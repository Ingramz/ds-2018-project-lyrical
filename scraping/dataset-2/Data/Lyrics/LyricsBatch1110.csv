The Divine Comedy,"Bernice bobs her hair in the barber's in the square
All her new-found friends are there to see it done
Bernice bobs her hair she's been driven to despair
'Cause her cousin doesn't care about anyone

Her hair was long, her hair was dark
Her hair fell down her back
And now it lies upon the floor
Bernice runs out the door

Marjorie had told her what to wear to the parties
Marjorie had told her what to say to the boys
Now Marjorie was jealous of her social advances
And presented her with this choice

""Bernice, bob your hair
You've persistently declared this intention
Do you dare to disagree?""
So Bernice bobs her hair and is instantly ensnared
In a trap so well prepared by Marjorie

Her hair was long, her hair was dark
Her hair fell down her back
The mirror tells of her mistake
Her heart is fit to break

So when it's dark and her cousin sleeps
Into the room she creeps

Bernice runs for her train

In love with the loveless
In tune with a tuneless old upright piano

She measures each movement
Her classical features and elegant waistline
Are going to waste while she pleases her parents

What if they die on the road to Rathmines
Where a dog in two minds times his run to perfection
An orphan at last,
She'd be sick in the loo-bowl
Then go to the funeral and cry by the graveside
And then sleep with the first man she sees
And she'd catch some disease
Which she would give to her doctor
She'd cook her own breakfast, and she'd cook his as well

Will disappear like the soap

Conceals a multitude of sins
And laughing like a little girl

Play games upon the backs of whales

I met a girl, she was a complete mess
I should've left her well alone, but oh no, not me

Could turn my frog into a cow?

Institutionalised mediocrity
Infinite tragedy

Difference against indifference
Wit against shit

The Divine Comedy,"The Divine Comedy's Casanova - a collection of songs for bass baritone and ensemble, inspired by the writings of the eighteenth century Venetian gambler, eroticist and spy; and performed for us there by the composer, Neil Hannon.

He was accompanied in that 1995 recording by a specially assembled group of young musicians, under the baton of Dr. Joby Talbot. The program was devised by The Divine Comedy, and was produced in our London studios by Darren Allison.

The Divine Comedy,"Through a long and sleepless night

If what is wrong can feel so right
Then life's no longer black and white

It's four o'clock and all's not well
In my private circle of hell
I contemplate my navel hair
And slowly slide into despair

This rut has fast become a trench
This smell has turned into the stench
Of rotten dreams and stale ideals
The past is snapping at my heels

Oh Danny Boy the pipes are blocked
With bedtime blues and future shock
I know the best is yet to come
But does it always take this long?

I can put on the perfume, even wear the dress sometimes
But I'll always be the bridegroom and never the bride

But I've no horse, that joke's so shit
And whips would only make it worse
Don't tempt the lonely and perverse

The casualties of casual sex
The child of three with X-ray specs
The conman low in self esteem
The Casanova in your dreams

I'll scream and scream and scream until
I've made myself critically ill
In hospital, in case you're there
In uniform, intensive care

I know you'll be the death of me
But what a cool death that would be
I'd rather die than be deprived
Of Wonderbra's and thunder thighs

I can put on the perfume, even wear the dress sometimes
But I'll always be the bridegroom and never the bride

Bored of normality? why not go daft?
It's easy to do if you try
Slide right back down that self-confident path
You've just so laboriously climbed

Pickle your liver and addle your brain
Live the Bohemian life
Die young and penniless somewhere in Spain
Then again you could try just to live your own life

In the way that you find most amusing

Soon there wasn't room enough for her
In between the bosoms of her family

Of playboys' playground she'd once dreamed about

Maybe I love her, but I'm jealous of her
She's a woman of the world

She's a fake sure but she's a real fake
On the make making up for lost time
Just you wait hey, give the girl a break
And a fifty dollar bill will see to that
That ain't enough to feed the cat
Serve up the rats and super rats
Well they just get fatter while she fades away

Maybe I love her 'cause I'm jealous of her
She's a woman of the world
Maybe I hate her 'cause I didn't create her
It's human nature girl
Maybe I'll suffer just to be her lover
Just to be part of her world

Baby can I be your girl?
Maybe I'll kill her, just trying to thrill her

The Divine Comedy,"My parents knew these people who
For all their faults were very nice;
They owned a farm whose ""Olde Worlde"" charm
Earned it the name of ""Paradise"".
We came to stay one holiday,
We played croquet and burned our arms;
But I was charmed and lost for words,
When first I heard the birds of Paradise Farm.
Singing gay songs all the day long,
Making love to the dinner gong,
Wondering when their human friend
Would come to feed them.
I looked in the trees and in the air,
I searched the eaves of disused barns
Till finally, to my despair,
I found the caged birds in Paradise Farm.
Singing gay songs all the day long,
Making love to the dinner gong,
Wondering why their tiny lives
Should be spent behind iron bars.

""St. Francis of Assisi""...
But ""Neil Hannon of The See House, Fivemiletown""-
Well, it doesn't sound quite right somehow!

Would come to free them.

They called my name, and revved the car;
""When nature calls you must reply"", they laughed,
Waving goodbye to Paradise Farm.",Birds of Paradise Farm,1996
The Divine Comedy,"Daybreak on the motorway to Damascus
A heavenly angel flagged me down and asked for a ride into town
For God's sake, on the motorway to Damascus
This heavenly angel, wise and pure, proceeded with a guided tour:
""Behold! A shining city of silver grey and white,
Of solar-panelled rooftops glinting in the light
And wind-power generators turning soundlessly through the night""
Mid-day on the motorway to Damascus
The heavenly angel flapped its wings and told me more exciting things
Like how one day this motorway to Damascus
Would disappear without trace, the unsustainable replaced
""Behold! The new New Forest in four hundred shades of green
Stretching out before us where it always should have been
A botanical thesaurus for as far as the eye can see""
Nightfall on the motorway to Damascus
The heavenly angel looked at me and said ""Well, what's it gonna be?
The long haul, or the shorter way to Damascus?
Choose with care and you will find that one day there will come a time
When the silhouetted ruins of the crumbling cooling towers
Are but ivy-clad reminders of a long-forgotten power""

Before we look and see ourselves for what we really are?

I'm here for the Season
And high as a kite
Living in error
With Maud at Cap Ferrat
Which couldn't be right
Everyone's here and frightfully gay
Nobody cares what people say
Though the Riviera
Seems really much queerer
Than Rome at it's height
Yesterday night
 
I went to a marvelous party
With Nounou and Nada and Nell
It was in the fresh air
And we went as we were
And we stayed as we were
Which was Hell
Poor Grace started singing at midnight
And didn't stop singing till four
We knew the excitement was bound to begin
When Laura got blind on Dubonnet and gin
And scratched her veneer with a Cartier pin
I couldn't have liked it more
 
I went to a marvelous party
I must say the fun was intense
We all had to do
What the people we knew
Would be doing a hundred years hence
Dear Cecil arrived wearing armor
Some shells and a black feather boa
Poor Millicent wore a surrealist comb
Made of bits of mosaic from St. Peter's in Rome
But the weight was so great that she had to go home
I couldn't have liked it more

Away from Belgravia
Would make you aghast

And young Bobbie Carr
Did a stunt at the bar
With a lot of extraordinary men

When suddenly Cyril screamed “Fiddledidee”
And ripped off his trousers and jumped in the sea

I went to a marvelous party
Elise made an entrance with May
You'd never have guessed
From her fisherman's vest
That her bust had been whittled away
Poor Lulu got fried on Chianti
And talked about esprit de corps
Maurice made a couple of passes at Gus
And Freddie, who hates any kind of a fuss
Did half the Big Apple and twisted his truss
I couldn't have liked it more

I went to a marvellous party
We played the most wonderful game
Maureen disappeared
And came back in a beard
And we all had to guess at her name
We talked about growing old gracefully
And Elsie who's seventy-four
Said, “A, it's a question of being sincere
And be, if you're supple you've noting to fear

In lands beyond the sea;
Nor, England did I know till then
What love I bore to thee.

'Tis past, that melancholy dream!
Nor will I quit thy shore
A second time; for I still seem
To love thee more and more.

Among thy mountains did I feel
The joy of my desire;
And she I cherished turned her wheel
Beside an English fire.

By mornings showed, by nights concealed
The bowers where Lucy played;
And thine too is the last green field
That Lucy's eye surveyed.

She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove,
A Maid whom there were none to praise
And very few to love:

A violet by a mossy stone
Half hidden from the eye
Fair as a star, when only one
Is shining in the sky.

She lived unknown, and few could know
When Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave and, oh
The difference to me

A slumber did my spirit seal;
I had no human fears.
She seemed a thing that could not feel
The touch of earthly eyes.

No motion has she now, no force;
She neither hears nor sees;
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course,
With rocks, and stones, and trees.",Lucy,1999

I've snatched all of my victories from the jaws of defeat.

When I hold you in my arms
And look back on my charmed life, my charmed life,
I hope, baby I hope if nothing more
That one day you'll call your life a charmed life.

Well the course of true love never ran smooth.
They broke my heart and I broke theirs too,
And breaking up is so very hard to do.
But I knew I'd find the one,
And sure enough she came along,
And not long after that along came you.

Well sometimes this life is like being afloat
On a raging sea in a little row-boat,
Just trying not to be washed overboard.
But if you take your chances and you ride your luck,
And you never, never, never, never, never give up
Those waves will see you safely to a friendly shore.

When I hold you in my arms
I know that this is a charmed life.

I wish that it could stay like this,

To tell them how it melts my heart,
Never more would my truck-stop friends

See how long you can stand on one leg

Can you beat your dad at chess
It's harder than you think
Sit him down at Christmas
Turn the TV off
Give him lots of chocolates and a drink
And he might give you a match
And when you've been duly dispatched he will laugh
Ha ha ha
And you'll say, ""one more game""

Can you write a silly song
It's harder than you think
One that's not too short
One that's not too long
One that can make everybody sing
Go on, give it a try
You might do better than I
It's just like trying to stand on one leg

Tell me can you tell a funny joke
One that makes you laugh out loud
One that makes the milk come out your nose
If you know a funny joke then tell it now

That's not bad, I'm impressed
But there's one final test

Can you hold a singing note for a stupidly long time
Well it's my party piece so let's make it a little harder
By starting it way up high
Come on, give it a go

The Divine Comedy,"Can anyone lend me ten billion quid?
Why do you look so glum, was it something I did?
So I caused the second great depression, what can I say?
I guess I got a bit carried away
If I say I'm sorry, will you give me the money?

But you know me, the complete banker
In a black Bentley, sweet Samantha right here next to me
Oh, how I hanker for the good old days
When I was free, the complete banker
In my Armani, before the rancour and disharmony
Well money makes the world go round and round
and down the drain

We went to war on the floor of the exchange
To all of us it was just a big game
But God I loved it: making a profit from somebody's loss
I never knew exactly whose money it was
And I did not care as long as there was

Lots for me, the complete banker
In a black Bentley, sweet Samantha right here next to me
Oh, how I hanker for the good old days
When I was free, the complete banker
In my Armani, before the anger and the inquiries
Well money makes the world go round and round
and down the drain

We'll learn the lessons, run tests and analyze
We'll crunch the numbers, 'cause the numbers never lie
Well maybe this recession is a blessing in disguise
We can build a much much bigger bubble the next time
And leave the rest to clean our mess up

Well that's just me, the complete banker
In a black Bentley, Margaret Thatcher right here next to me
Oh, how I hanker for the good old days

And one day you'll let your guard down
And I'll come 'round again",The Complete Banker,2010

With pepper-pots and matchsticks

Innocence can often be
Another one of war's casualties
But innocence can be restored
With a visit to the Professore
For ten thousand lire he
Can find mislaid virginity

His dirty needle leaves a trail of scars
And keeps her at the peak of her sexual powers

She takes him riding on the 133
Through the city to the cemetery
Where the Neapolitan girls go
Down behind the headstones

As life and death become entwined

Now baby, just pretend you don't see 'em

And Lola has a lover in the British ranks

The Divine Comedy,"When a child cries the tears rise quickly
Spill hot and prickly down the reddened cheeks
Just to leave as quickly as they came
And peace returns again

When a child cries you know about it
They scream and shout until the hurt is gone
Like a shower of rain that for a moment
Hides away the sun

But when a man cries it's choked and throttled
It's all been bottled up for far to long
And when at last the pressure cooker blows
It's hard to stem the flow

When a man cries his body shakes
And his eyeballs ache
And his mind vibrates
But he doesn't make a sound
Don't wanna wake the house now

Well the reasons are vague and hard to put in words
Just a dull abstract ache, don't wanna worry her
She would only ask what's wrong and I'd try to say
Then she'd take all my pain and explain it away
But who can explain why a man cries

When a man cries he cries alone
And for just a moment he's back at home

Free from guilt and safe from harm",When a Man Cries,2010

She uses life as her vocation
Standing on ledges clinging to the edges

Trying to avoid a confrontation

The worlds' a hard place to land on

Can be something you wish you never had

So she relates well to rejection

She just sleeps all day
In her squalid little slum
And takes little white pills
To make her body feel numb
And it's dark and dirty
And there's nothing left to eat
And in her heart there's a feeling of defeat
Smells of bus and fornication
And a bottle of cheat scent
Should she stick around

The Dixie Hummingbirds,"There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you",I Must Have Jesus,2000
The Dixie Hummingbirds,"I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on

The Dixieland Ramblers,"You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da

That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
 
Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

But as long as you love me so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The Dixieland Rhythm Kings,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1953

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

The DNA Disciples,"I am sitting
In the morning
At the diner
On the corner

I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee

And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue

He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in

""It is always
Nice to see you""
Says the man
Behind the counter

To the woman
Who has come in
She is shaking
Her umbrella

And I look
The other way
As they are kissing
Their hellos

I'm pretending
Not to see them
And Instead
I pour the milk

I open
Up the paper
There's a story
Of an actor

Who had died
While he was drinking
He was no one
I had heard of

And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking
For the funnies

When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so
I raise my head

There's a woman
On the outside
Looking inside
Does she see me?

No she does not
Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection

And I'm trying
Not to notice
That she's hitching
Up her skirt

And while she's
Straightening her stockings
Her hair
Is getting wet

Oh, this rain
It will continue
Through the morning

To the bells

Had my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

When she took a look at my palm
She said son are you feeling kinda warm?
And she looked into her crystal ball
And said you're in love

I said I could not be so
I'm not passionate with the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
You'll be looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise

That the fortune teller told me lies

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she made a fool out of me

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love

Well, I am married to the fortune teller
Well happy as me can be

Come and join us in the trenches
Red and purple by our side
Say you'll never leave us
In this company of mine

You carry this dirt
We stole from the source
Its tongue will be hurt
Attack from the north
The color was red
The number was six
Now you're in my head
No more to convince

I know that I am yours and you will be mine
Come and join us in the trenches
Red and purple by our side
Say you'll never leave us
In this company of mine

I bring this back home
Just hoping I've changed
So that you will know
Just how I'm deranged

You're crying, then went to church
You're safe, or at least I heard
Until to me you return

Walking the same street every night
Don't you think maybe it's about time?

You can light the fire that's in your head
Put it off, tomorrow will come instead

Pull the wicked flower out from its bed

Sending the children out to fight

Convinced myself there's no one better, so how could I deny
Your love, it's like a thorn into my side

My friends they understand me better but don't whisper goodnight
I want a lover and a sister, but we know that's not right
You used to listen to my music, I always wondered why
I wish I could pretend you make me try

I want the days to come, I want these sleepless nights to end
I lie here thinking how I lost you to all your stupid friends
You made me feel so foolish for the twenty-second time
Your love might be the last time that I try

Don't know if I'll make it through this winter without you on my own
I waited here for you forever, I can't believe you'd go
I may not have the answers, but I'd rather never know
Your love was such a heavy, heavy blow

Goodnight my love, you seemed so nice 'til I knew you better
Now I can tell you're always thinking twice about what might be better
On the outside, there's no conscience, you're a victim of your cautiousness
You don't try, you just lie there hoping that someone will come to make it right

When you woke up
Or got choked up
Ruby eyes bloodshot

See the way you can't sit still
With no mention
But attention
For a dead flower

So I write, write, write
All the things I didn't miss
And despite, spite, spite
My conclusion is

Nobody wants u
Nobody wants u
Like I do

It must be what you said
Just the wrong time
To be laughing
What goes through that head

And you won't just act your age
So you dance it
Too romantic
Put me on display

Excuses, abuses
You've used me up
My patience can't take it
I've had enough

It must be meant to be
When you make up
From the breakup
So now I see

It must be how you looked
When you woke up
Right here next to me

I made a list, you found it
And you left and said we're through
So I'm here outside your window
In the dark and calling you

It opens, hear you breathing
My fingers through your hair
Tell me I do

Bell bottom blues, you made me cry.
I don't want to lose this feeling.
And if I could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms.

Do you wanna see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you wanna hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't wanna fade away.
Give me one more day, please.
I don't wanna fade away.
In your heart I want to stay.

The way that you treat me baby.
Once I was strong but I lost the fight.
You won't find a better loser.

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

And let my feet out and touch the ground
Got to lay me a line on the lady
Before she walks down the street too far

The Doobie Brothers,"Sittin' by myself in the summertime, when the heat is burnin' down
Watchin' the golden crops in the field just growin' without a sound
I was a boy raised in the country and it's still a part of me
And you see no matter where I go it's a beautiful memory
Rise with sun at the break of day, lookin' out my window
It's the same as yesterday 
Sittin' under an old oak tree, pickin' my guitar in the shade
That old tree spreadin' over my head is the closest friend I made 

Just me and some lonely wooden music, floatin' through air
The grass is rustlin' and the birds are singin' and my heart don't have a care
Still another day finds me in the fields, sweat is soakin' up my ragged clothes
But I'd rather work than steal 

Watchin' the sun settle down over open Texas land, looking at the cattle and the horses runnin' wild as they can
Life was different in the old days, you just get a day's work done
When you were finished workin' in the fields, there was chores at home to be done 

I was always hearin' music, always wanna play me some
As a full-time friend or the way to ease the end of a woman that swayed me some
Hearin' those tunes always had a way of soothin' out my soul
When times got hard and work got slow it was music that kept me whole
Sun beatin' down through the trees, gets so hot bring a workin' man to his knees
Part of my heart, part of my soul, part of a melody
Hands are clappin' and people swayin' in simple harmony
Life was different in the old days, you just get a day's work done
When you finished workin' in the fields there was chores at home to be done 

Late in the evenin' on the front porch when the sun is settin' in the west
Me and the boys pass around the bottle and sing what we like best
Sing about our wives, sing about our children, singin' out the Delta blues
We're simple folks and we like it that way, got nothin' left to lose

The Doobie Brothers,"Well I dreamed I was standin' in the middle of a river,
Someone waited on the other side.
My body shivered in the rushing icy water.
I cried out but no one could hear me.
I tried to swim but it was much too far.
I felt a hand pull me up as I was going under.

Somebody's waiting there to catch you
You don't have to be afraid now baby.
Nobody really knows for sure,
Just open up your heart.
Don't be afraid, someone will catch you if you fall too far.

Sometimes you feel like you're invisible
There's a crowd but you're all alone.
Can't they see your heart is breaking?
You pretend that it just doesn't matter,
Try to keep smilin' baby hope against hope.
Love is gonna find you and set you free

Somebody's waiting there to catch you
You don't have to be afraid now baby.

Some variation of ""help me please,""

How should I feel?

Brother, you've fallen to your knees.
What do your children need?
The distance is never out of reach,
There's only inches between you and me.

Can't pretend I don't see you there.

Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' your way, you know
I wouldn't ask if things weren't like they were today.
Count up the corners of 'em, add up the dollars for 'em.
Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' your way, you know,
Ten thousand of 'em all over town.
I wouldn't ask if things weren't like they were today,

Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' at you, you know
Will I feel good about it, will I feel a fool?

Comes my humble quest for a plan.
I've been out there hoverin' by,
Don't forget to pull me in sometimes.

Will you be with me as I make my journey
Through the labyrinth of time?
And I'm still waitin' for the good Lord
To show me the way, babe.

This is who you see, this is who I am.
Please forgive me if I fall sometimes,
Just an ordinary man.

Will my reckless courage invite you
To become my clever companion?
Madly in love and in love with the madness,
Get ready to run baby.

This is who you see, this is who I am.
Please forgive me if I fall sometimes,
Just an ordinary man.
Enjoyin' the ride,
Savor the simple pleasure
With you by my side.

Thinking back on the happy hours just before the dawn
Outside the wind is blowin'
It seems to call your name again
Where have you gone

I travel down
My car is empty and the radio just seems to bring me down
I'm just tryin' to find me
A pretty smile that I can get into

Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away
It's warm outside, no clouds are in the sky

I keep it to myself
I don't want nobody else
To see me cryin' all those tears in my eyes

I thought that I needed a lot 
A little was over rated

That it's all about your perceptions

It ain't about the size of your car 
It's about the size of the faith in your heart

On top of all of that, he had no eyesight

Sailed on a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

""We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in this beatiful sea
Nets of silver and gold have we,""

Ruffled the waves of dew

That lived in the beautiful sea
""Now cast your nets where ever you wish
Never afraid are we,""

To the stars in the twinkling foam

You're always so far away

Down below, you used to tell the truth
Now, you're lookin' for something to say
You give me those eyes
And then look away

Do you want me down on my knees?
Are you livin' a lie?
Is this some kind of game
Baby, won't you tell me please?

Give me one good reason to stay
When you won't come right out and say

Who do you love? What makes you happen
What do you need for satisfaction
Who do you love? I need an answer
Is it just about a good time, good time
Who do you love?

I wish you'd lie or tell me the truth
So I can decide for myself
Maybe you've tried what we used to do
With somebody, somewhere else

 And change my lonely song to happiness

A pocket knife for long nights
And a sleepy little dreamer
With still, miles to go

And pour that last year down my throat
The days will fade and the nights will burn

I see her in the doorway
Staring a hole through it all

And the last one was, man, the last one was

So check your lock and close your eyes
When you wake up, I'll be all right
Never tell them where it hurts
And keep your bullet, safe inside

So, menace to murder

Bo Roc-

Function function, what's yo function

Shit, we got it funky than a muthafucka in here

For any other come I had to use a fuckin strap
To get what I want in the ghetto
And please, gutter for the drive-by
Sucka motherfuckers fly by
But why try, to test this three five seven
I know you wouldn't have catch me and my homies chillin in front of the shack
See, but I'z be the motherfuckin mack
Tryna check a stack
I gots a gap to watch my back
And since I'm crazy
That just mean no niggaz won't be fade me
Commin from a wicked city
Long Beach, where everything gets shitty (you know it)
And ain't that a pity
If you down on your luck
Nobody's gon give a fuck
That's why I'mma always bring my ghetto life, my ghetto thing, my ghetto swing

Far from little China
It's a place where the police is always down to find ya
'Cause everybody in the momma snitches
Brothers and niggaz, and sisters that's called bitches
Damn! the same people that holler out ""peace, brotha""
Will try to catch with the draws so they can fuck ya
Black folks in the ghetto straight fuckin up
And the whites on the outside bustin up
Time to bust a cap in the chevrelo
Whether you'z a nigga, a nigga, a negro
If you're not a sollution you'z a problem
Nine double one ain't be the only way to solve 'em
'cause it's oughter to cheese them crackers
First you pimps gotta work with the jackers
And both of y'all must work with the gangs and dope-dealers
'cause they'z the main motherfuckers killers
Until then the ounces from the white devil
And what's left for the blacks
Life in the ghetto (in the ghetto)
If it's lit take a hit and it's on

Now all through high school I relied on drug-smugglin
'Cause I was broke, a nigga was straight strugglin
Not knowin where my next dollars comin from
But I got a gun there's the double up I'mma jack one
How I'mma let the fool be up when I'm on the bottom
Anytime you broke a lot of friends you ain't got 'em
To be a young man you got to be ready
'Cause in my house there was no fuckin daddy
In the home, I roam with the homies from the block
Experiencing, puberty, clockin do' and passin glocks
I remember at the party the ho's didn't like me
'Cause when the party was over I rolled out on my Nike's
When times get rough and tough
I'm gon grab that bud and take a superpuff
Indo high, I replied on the bud for the pain
And stayin leveled to the ground and true to the game
You can't jump on my escalator if you ain't need it
I'd rather pull a lick and stay weeded
? into the alley
Smooth but fast now I'm headed to the shack
To count yo cash
If it's lit take a hit and it's on

And it's on

And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
But it's mandatory that I kick it

 But you're caught up in that same ol' patent and trap that the homies go through
 Searchin' for answers without no questions
 You thought it could never happen to you and your crew, but why'all was no exception
 It started out as fun and it was all about kicks (Kicks)
 But each and every kick turned out to be a trick
 Imagine this you got no family, you got no ends
 You got no hustle, no muscle, no car, no clothes, you got no friends
 You once was the neighborhood boss and hog
 And no G livin' legend like walkin' dogs
 Niggaz hate to admit it, but they know it's true
 Damn near everybody in the hood, includin' the kids, want to be just like you
 So, hear I stand as a witness, or, should I say a reclaimed victim
 Written off and spit on by this really sick ass system 
 You can roll what I roll in the swirl from the smoke

 And all money ain't good money
 But everybody want the cream and honey
 Thinkin' that the other side is all green plus it's sunny (Yeah!)
 But, money, lust, and jealousy most lead to treachery

 [Verse 3:] 
 Sunshine on your mind but darkness prevails
 You move your sales from motel to hotel
 Prerequisite for a blast, merchandise, cash, or ass
 Bloodshed often is the door where personalaties crash
 And it's your task to try to make a meal ticket
 So, you can kick it and be swift with your chicken (Bock-bock!)
 You's a victim and since you got your own mind
 It ain't all your fault, but you gotta do your own time
 Choose your weapon cause your first impression
 Often dictates the situation that you find yourself caught in
 If you still blind and you can't see 
 You better obtain yourself some glasses and clear your vision like DMC (Don't run!)
 And remember what I told you
 Remember who brought a soldier
 I want to wake you up like Sega
 consume large amounts of dank-a
 Man overboard
 Beware of the underlords
 Stay your ass on the boat, the devil is dope (Ooh-ooh!)

It may sound crazy
But I wanna go outside in the rain

Once the rain starts falling 
On my face 
You won't see, a single trace 
Of the tears I'm crying 
Because of you I'm crying 
Don't want you to see me cry
Let me go, let me go, let me go 

In the rain 

Once the sun comes out 
And the rain has gone away 
I know I'm gonna see a better day 
Right now I think I'm crying
Because of you I'm crying
Don't want you to see me cry
Let me go, let me go, let me go

Radio killer
Yea,
Y'all think they can handle this one man
Alright
Call the radio and tell 'em this your song 
(This your song, this your song, this your song, this your song)
Girl come on (girl come on, girl come on,)
Cause I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby

Met this little girl, she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin' with my head, wanna play in the bed
Sexy pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you movin' vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My pulp ain't fiction, it's an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo
While mama play bingo, she ride Mandingo
She don't give a damn if I'm married or single
She makes me tingle

[Chorus]
Shawty I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby

She likes Hip-Hop and R&B
Her life time goal is to be on TV
She looking for a man that could give her a break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake
Cause with whipped cream on em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beer, inside of daddy's '64
She shot me in the back with cupids arrow
We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress n she let me peep that
I'm Drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 7:30
Bought her some dessert, give a damn if its early
Head spinnin' around like roller derby
Everything about her says you don't deserve me
I hope I'm worthy

[Chorus]

(Cause I'm your baby)
You need somethin' like me? (Good luck)
Cause he ain't nothin' like me (no)
You can search but you never gone find
A love thats quite like mine (no)
Need a man that can love you good
And treat you like he should
With me shawty you the shit
He might be good but he ain't like this
Cause I'm your baby

In the back of the pickup, clothes the rip up
She see my chrome wheels, it gets more real
Running and laughing, music blasting
Side over the road, bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, can feel the urge
If you see my mama, don't say a word
The cops wanna know I'm a word are slurred
Don't ask me officer ask her
Wanna another drink baby she like sure
Wanna hit the club she like I don't care
She all in the rear-view doin' her here
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhere
This all happens on an average day
Your life is a trip girl, I'm here to stay
Never had a girl make me feel this way
Even tho I had to pay

The Dream,"[Verse 1]
Through the sheets, she climbs her way up to this bed singing melodies
Run my fingers in her hair and say come to me
First there is a no, then she says yes baby
She?s the Dream of a billion men
Go girl ayyyyyyy hiiiiiii iii
Go girl ayyyyyyy hiiiiiii iiiii

See she made her way from nothing
Can?t fault her for wanting something
She loves men that can afford (yea)
She wants to, live fancy

On planes that fly clear across the roaming skies
Brilliant cars, Spend evenings among the stars (live fancy)
Diamond rings ooh ooh ooh o
All those things? live fancy [4x]

Aboard yachts if not, somewhere tasting wine
In Paris seducing me while we dine

I got a lick for you, you got a car right?

Who you talkin' to, nothin' I'm talkin' to my momma
Now listen close, I can't talk any louder

He's bout to take it up north from my crib to drop it off to the plug
You could get him raw for the cash if you quick
And I know he ain't strapped because I just hid his gun
I asked her who the nigga was she ain't say a name
I just had a baby man I had to make some change
I was hurt, how could I turn away a stain
So I called up my brothers like Damon Wayans
We piled up in my Monte Carlo, pulled up to the bitch crib
Seen a white Ford Explorer shorty just told me to follow
He was sittin on 75th, he bent on stony and made a stop at the Kenwood Liquors
He ran inside to get a drink
When he stepped out he had a bottle of Hennessy in his hand
We rolled up and put that banger to his face
I told him give me everything in the car, nigga everything
He start stumbling like ""I ain't got anything""
I said ""shut the fuck up man, open the trunk up fam
Before I gotta let this hammer bang""
He reached for the keys and put him in
The trunk popped open I saw the weed in saran
I told him step the fuck back, he ain't listen though
His hand move he started reaching again
I was scared, I ain't gon lie
That's what it was
I thought he had a gun, my eyes went black
I let two shots go
Before I knew it he was layin' in the ground in a puddle of blood
I know it ain't right
I think about it every night
I ain't even mean to take his life

I open the window to get some ventilation

Cut across one another

In shadows I would wait

I learned to love with her other life
I wouldn't let it break us down

Was unimportant when I was around.

One night when the leaves had turned to gold
I sold my love for change
I met a younger single girl

Lost the very thing that made me rich

Couldn't bear to let her forget about me

Oh well the rain was falling down
And so she went away
And I was buoyed up by the praise of sycophants
And the false security of the take home pay

Maybe she wrote just to see if I loved her still
Maybe she wrote just to say goodbye
But I never saw the words she wrote
Only the tears that were in my eyes

One day when the leaves are green again
Maybe she'll let me in
We'll sit and talk about everything
Just like we were old friends

But I couldn't ever get used to it

Night light

Scorn into the face of fools who
Break hearts & turn their back on

But I don't want
To forget the little things you do
God knows
I never meant to be untrue
Now I'm waiting for the day
You'll be back in my arms to stay

As morning broke
I pulled it from the refuse on my way home
And in the great grey city dawn
A warning
Rung in my head with a fire alarm
It said,
""Alright,
You've been treating this as a dress rehearsal for life""
The time for a complete reversal is tonight
I put away childish things and telephoned long distance
And it rings rings rings

I walk like a stranger through this world
No, 
No you don't know me

Threw the night into turmoil
Put the city in darkness
And soldiers on the street
But the car
Burning up on the roadside
For all those in exile
Waiting to be released
In city
Surrounded by slums
Invaded by soldiers
Invaded by debt
Under dictator
Who escalates terror
Provoking further
Intensive civil unrest
And in the fear of
The nights' disappearances
A conspiracy of silence
Spread up around us like a wall
Between commemoration candles
And the twelve o'clock curfew
You started to feel less
Until you couldn't feel at all
Stood on the wrong side
Of the barricades in the national strike
Then became exile
Remember:
Soldiers shooting into the crowd at the university
Growing up under government
Where to be young is to be the enemy
Remember:
Where soldiers tear gas churches
And there's ten thousand missing persons
Whose cases are never solved
And the government advises not to get involved

The Dresden Dolls,"I've tried dolls that were guaranteed sixteen or under none were very exciting
Sorta like a laugh track or whacking off they'll get you off but it's just not the real thing
Its been decades since my pit days
But I haven't shaken it - I sit there like an idiot
Still caught up in the old punk protocol
And dreaming that the teenagers will think that I'm a radical

and I still wait for the bus to come where the high school got torn down
Still expecting to find true love among the skateboarders hanging out
In back of the bank in my hometown

all this talk and no action's got me stiff from the tit to the bone
So I'm living in lala land - but at least I'm not living at home
Same old catcalls, the same old chemicals
Same old thrills stealing stockings from the shopping mall
Its simple enough to grow the fuck up happy with the rough cut
Nobodys in here looking for a diamond in the rough but

I still wait for my mom to come and pick me up at holly's house
10 years after they cashed it in to make a multi-level parking lot for a seven-eleven and burger king

I've got cryptographs I've got all the phones tapped
It's proof enough it is indisputable
Love's not good enough I want photographs
Something that will teach me my arithmetic at last..

better get your kids in - I'm on the loose again
And getting more ridiculous the more I think I ought to get my mind out of the gutter
(it's getting dangerous, amanda-you are old enough to be the pork)
He's my own private highway from the cradle to the grave
I save a bundle skipping middle age and saturdays

and I still wait for the cops to come where the station since burned down
Still expecting they'll pick me up for all the sins I committed in the back of the banged-up pickup truck

I've got autographs, backstage passes and leather jacket back patches up the...
Ask me anything I've got evidence
Single serving saccharine packets dripping black with lipstick kisses

I still wait for the bus to come back where the high school got torn down
Still expecting to find true love among the sakteboarders hanging out
In back of the bank in my home-

I'm no pederast just out of interes
Thank you ,but I'm capable of getting up and getting dressed
Love's not good enough I want photographs
Something that will teach me common sense
Time and time again
I think ill dye my hair again
Oh god
Sixteen
No, I'm ten
I'm seventeen
And a bank of boston beauty queen....



",Bank of Boston Beauty Queen,2003
The Dresden Dolls,"Clutching the phone till my hands were sore
I never understood pain before, Christopher
You cannot know what it does to me
Hearing you speak with this frequency

I never knew what one voice could do
I was in heaven the moment I heard you
My friends go out drinking and having fun -
I stay in bed with my headphones on

Shot down with arrows from waves above
Christopher Lydon renounced my love

It took so long to get through to you
I never understood sorrow, and now I do
I finally got past your moniter,
You broke my heart in two, Chrisopher

Christopher, I was your listener, Christopher,
I've never felt love like this before, Christopher,
Christopher, now and forevermore, Chrisopher
I'll never stop saying Christopher, Christopher

Finally I knew what I had to do
I had to make the connection with you
I don't care if your old and incontinent
I will be yours til the bitter end...

So during a show about Joan of Arc
I got through and said:
""Christopher Lydon, you've stolen my heart""
When I asked if you felt the same way for me
You cut me off like a guillotine

Drawn like a bull to a matador-
I just see visions of Chrisopher
Shot down by arrows from waves above
Christopher Lydon renounced my love

Christopher, I was your prisoner, Christopher,
I hope you're happy now, Chistopher
Thank you for everything, but I'm not listening anymore nor do I plan to contribute to NPR
Christopher, beautiful, Christopher,
I'm the girl you've been waiting for



",Christopher Lydon,2003
The Dresden Dolls,"No one's asking to go dancing its not like that anymore
Its romantic if they mean it when they shut your fingers in the door
Its a gory sort of story that's been told a hundred times before
It gets tricky don't be picky if the slipper fits you wear it whore


How many tips can I take home tonight without them getting mad
How many stitches do you think it takes to fix a cut that bad
How many minutes until midnight and you get your eyesight back

not to knock it I've been off it never moving very much at once
Its been awkward I still offer it when its that time of
Other girls shower but I give out flowers
To curious strangers who throw dollars at my feet

how many crimes can I try spotting dry before it leaves a stain
How many times say that I love you til it doesn't mean a thing
How many fittings must I sit through with my big feet blistering
How many times until it strips me and my big mouth strikes again

I'm not asking to go dancing I'm not that dumb anymore
Its exhausting to keep smiling when your toes are bleeding on the floor
Its a gory sort of story that's been told a hundred times before
Don't be sorry just ignore me because honestly
I'm too sore from fitting exactly to ride into setting suns aching to
Stand on my own two feet

how many wishes do I still have left to fix the way it ends
How many princes do you think
It takes to put a girl like this back together again
How many instances can you point out where I was less than kind
How many happy endings do you need to change your fucking mind
And how much time do we have left before it's midnight and
You see that I was never the right size?





",Glass Slipper,2003
The Dresden Dolls,"Thirty licks with a belt - same old tricks on myself
And I wonder does everyone else live this way
A succession of tests a triumphant success
Each time I'm still intact at the end of the day

thirty drops in a glass - keep my temper and pass
With my breath held you bastards you lucked out again!
Its not really so bad, there's still mom there's still
Damage to do before they wrest the axe from my hands

its no mystery: you should obviously go
Before I break everything
You're always telling me that you're dying to know
But you're not really listening

how do I manage to station myself in harms way
And only get hit with a ticket for loitering
That I have no way to pay - and no strength to argue
My personal demons can scheme with professional care
Oh, god, they're after me
If I could shut them out just for an second
I swear
I could stop this catastrophe

thirty day guarantee
But they can't have meant me
After all I was born to a childproof world
No sharp corners or glass,
Small objects or plastic bags
Please, these are death to a delicate girl

its no mystery - you should obviously know
That I'll destroy everything
So don't go telling me that you're dying to know
Cause you'll get what you're asking for

and I still manage to station my self in harm's way
And only get hit with a ticket for loitering
Stating I came the wrong day
Now all the demons are screaming their wages aren't fair
I've left a secret kept
If I could shut them up just for a second I swear
It'll look like an accident
I could be decent yet
The magnificent end
I could be president....





",Thirty Whacks,2003
The Dresden Dolls,"The time has come to speak of many things
Of jacks and queens and kings

I bared my wrists and promised to begin
But you cut the blade straight in

try hard my love do you hear the distant strings
Please remember what this means

did I come back for all of this?
It seems absurd somehow...
With one well-placed flick of the wrist
You've really done it now...

(all of my blind ambition left me deaf with perfect vision)

the time has come
For things to come undone
That we should not have begun

at last I felt a numbness overcome
And now you turn and run...

the time has come
To take me in your arms and touch these fragile scars

you have the choice now so decide
If you want in or out
There is too much left for us to try
You can't just give up now

the time has come
To speak of many things
Of jacks and queens and kings

it took that cut to bring me back to life
They're bleeding, they're frightened but I hold out both my hands:
No one in the world will ever touch me there again.



",The Time Has Come,2003
The Dresden Dolls,"I won't try to explain what I cannot understand
It's a bird it's a plane it's a one night stand
If I only we could ride far enough
I'd forget you altogether
It's a bluff
There is no way I could not remember

don't ask me what I came here for
It is too delicate for words
I used to want to make you talk
Now I would rather you did not

I don't mind if you read while I'm coming
It's alright if you need the t.v.
To keep from noticing my mind going blank
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Is my back all that bad?
Strike the match and watch the doll come open

don't ask me what I want from you
It is not something you could purposely do
I used to want to make you mine
Now I have better things in mind...

The Dresden Dolls,"Biting keeps your words at bay
Tending to the sores that stay
Happiness is just a gash away
When I open a familiar scar
Pain goes shooting like a star
Comfort hasn't failed to follow so far

And you might say it's self-indulgent
You might say its self-destructive
But, you see, it's more productive
Than if I were to be healthy

And pens and penknives take the blame
Crane my neck and scratch my name
But the ugly marks are worth the momentary gain
When I jab a sharpened object in
Choirs of angels seem to sing
Hymns of hate in memorandum

And you might say it's self-indulgent
And you might say it's self-destructive
But, you see, it's more productive
Than if I were to be happy

And sappy songs about sex and cheating
Bland accounts of two lovers meeting
Make me want to give mankind a beating

And you might say it's self-destructive
But, you see, I'd kick the bucket
Sixty times before I'd kick the habit

And as the skin rips off I cherish the revolting thought
That even if I quit there's not a chance in hell I'd stop
And anyone can see the signs, mittens in the summertime
Thank you for your pity, you are too kind

And you might say its self-inflicted
But you see that's contradictive
Why on earth would anyone practice self-destruction?

And pain opinions are sitcom feeding
They don't know that their minds are teething
Makes me want to give mankind a beating

I've tried bandages and sinking
I've tried gloves and even thinking
I've tried vaseline, I've tried everything

And no one cares if your back is bleeding
They're concerned with their hair receding
Looking back, it was all maltreating
Every thought that occurred misleading

Makes me want to give myself a beating

That you are inflicting on the others

Hey, it's been a lovely day, everything is going my way
I had so much fun today and I'm on fire
God, it's been a lovely day every thing's been going my way
Ever since you went away, hey, I'm on fire

I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on
I'm on fire, I'm on fire
I'm on fire, I'm on
So you don't wanna hear about my good day?

Honest to God, officer it's awful
Down at work I'm getting too familiar with the floor
Showing off my talents by the mouthful

Hate to break it to you but its out of my control
Forces go to work while we are sleeping
If I could attack with a more sensible approach
Obviously that's what I'd be doing

Now, necks are cracking sideways
Hit me from the back side
I am on the white side
You are on the black side

Cut a piece that's bite size
Shoot me from my good side
If you got a straight line
This would be a good time

Gravity works slowly if you notice it at all
Some of us are getting mighty lucky
If you had to live with this you'd rather lie than fall
You think I can't fly well you just watch me

Now, necks are cracking sideways
Hit me from the back side
I am on the thin side
You are on the fat side

Shoot me from my bad side

This would be a good time

The Dresden Dolls,"Half underwater, I'm half my mother's daughter
A fraction's left up to dispute
The whole collection, half of the price they're asking
In the halfway house of ill repute

Half accidental, half painful instrumental
I have a lot to think about
You think they're joking? You have to go provoke him
I guess it's high time you found out

It's half biology and half corrective surgery gone wrong
You'll notice something funny if you hang around here for too
Long ago in some black hole before they had these pills to take it back
I'm half Jill and half Jack

Two halves are equal, a cross between two evils
It's not an enviable lot
But if you listen you'll learn to hear the difference
Between the halves and the half knots

When I let him, when I feel the stitches getting sicker
I try to wash him out but like they say, 'The blood is thicker'
I see my mother in my face but only when I travel
I run as fast as I can run but Jack comes tumbling after

And when I'm brave enough and find a clever way to kick him out
And I'm so high, not even you and all your love could bring me down
On 83rd he never found the magic words to change this fact
I'm half Jill and half Jack

I'm halfway home now, half hoping for a showdown
'Cause I'm not big enough to house this crowd
It might destroy me but I'd sacrifice my body
If it meant I'd get the Jack part out

See Jack, run Jack, run Jack, see Jack
See Jack, run Jack, run Jack, see Jack
See Jack, run Jack, run Jack, see Jack
See Jack, run Jack, run Jack, run Jack, run

The Dresden Dolls,"I've been driving around town
With my head spinning around
Everywhere I look, I see
Your '96 Jeep Cherokee

You're a bully and a clown
You made me cry and put me down
After all that I've been through
You think I'd hate the sight of you

But with every jeep I see
My broken heart still skips a beat
I guess it's just my stupid luck
That all of Boston drives the same black, fucking truck

It could be him or am I tripping
And I'm crashing into everything
And thinking about skipping town a while
Until these cars go out of style

I try to see it in reverse
It makes the situation hundreds of times worse
When I wonder if it makes you want to cry
Every time you see a light blue Volvo driving by

So don't tell me if you're off to see the world
I know you won't get very far
Don't tell me if you get another girl
Baby, just tell me if you get another car

It could be him or am I tripping
It could be him

The number of them is insane
Every exit's an ex-boyfriend memory lane
Every major street's a minor heart attack
I see a red jeep and I want to paint it black

It could be him or am I tripping
And I'm crashing into everything
I can't wait till you trade the damn thing in
By then they will have put me in the looney bin

It could be him my heart is pounding
It's just no use, I'm surrounded
But one day I'll steal your car and switch the gears
And drive that Cherokee straight off this trail of tears

Won't you miss me? Won't you miss me? Won't you miss me?

Missed me, missed me, now you've got to kiss me
If you kiss me, mister, take responsibility
I'm fragile, mister, just like any girl would be
And so misunderstood, so treat me delicately

Missed me, missed me, now you've gone and done it
Hope you're happy in the county penitentiary
It serves you right for kissing little girls
But I will visit, if you miss me, say you miss me

Do you miss me?
Will you kiss me through the window?
Do you miss me, miss me?
Will they ever let you go?

And a red little girl's at the top of a slide
And an orange old man at the bottom
Wants to take her for a ride

As she slips and she tumbles the orange man mumbles
Pennies crash down from the sky
And he tells her, he'll take her away where it's safe
And of course it is a lie

She's a third the down and her skirts are yanked up
And her little girl cheeks start to wrinkle
But her smile is wide and her legs are spread wider
Her hair growing long and her hips getting larger
Past getting brighter
Light growing weaker

She is halfway down now but the man is impatient
Shakes change in his pocket he might have to wait
But she's coming
She's coming
She's coming

Who are you blaming?
They're just playing
That's a good one, who left the playground
A good decade before the bell rang?

As she starts to draw nearer the view becomes clearer
The splinters are painful but she doesn't feel it
The pennies were loaded and as they exploded
She starts to spin out of control

Her eyes are now closing her sleeves are unrolling
Up past her head and her veins are all showing
Not that she noticed, she's thoroughly focused on
One old man who's laughing
Who's laughing
Who's laughing

Don't worry, I've got you
Don't worry, I've got you

You'll get more than you're asking for without the right protection

Today's a very special day
And how you'd love to have a little thing with which to play
But love won't get you very far, today be still your beating heart
You'll have to keep on feeding it tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow

Boys will be boys, will be boys, will be boys, will be boys
Will be boys, will be girls with no warning
Girls will be girls, will be guys, will be boys that don't cry over toys
That they use to beat girls they despise by the morning
They always said that sex would change you
Change you, change you, change you

No second thoughts the knife is nearing
You'll never hear the little pitter patter pitter patter
Of this little feat of engineering
Of course I love you and of course it's what's inside that matters

But I think the whole charade is ending
It seems to me to be the only way to keep from getting
Caught up in a long life of regretting
The doctors say that once you get a taste for it should keep on cutting

But while you happen to be here
Why don't you whisper all those sweet forevers in my ear?
Stiff upper lip in all this sorrow, hurry up and stick it in
You never know when it will end tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow

They always said that sex would change you
Change you, change you, change you

The Dresden Dolls,"All the cities in the world
And so very little time and
So many different girls...
All you have to do is find them. 
There's a wealth of opportunity, you plan your trips accordingly. 
A pity, but the pretty ones are usually more touristy. 
Say, how'd you like to run away from these machines?
Everywhere the spies are printing out your dreams. 
Seven stops in seven different countries, 
Seven page itineraries, memories thick as Bloody Marys, Jesus, Joseph, bloody hell. 

Right now we're here in Boston, 
In love with downtown crossing. 
New York will be there in the morning. 
Come back to bed, my darling. 

Four years thrown away on vows we never kept. 
Forty-five minutes every day religiously devoted to regret. 
Time we could have spent on medication thrown away on education, 
And we planned to take a trip to Scotland but we never made it. 
How'd you like to run away from these machines?
I had Julian's and Steve's. 
You had Julia's and Jeanette's. 
You wear your terror on your sleeve for all the men I haven't met (yet). 
I had Oliver in Potsdam, you had Elanor in Amsterdam. 
We're keeping track so carefully we've missed the state we're in completely. 
Honestly, your foot is out the door and I've got scores of offers elsewhere and keep both feet planted firmly in the air, 
And tomorrow you can totally erase me from your mind, but trust me everything is fine, 
Because
Right now, we're here in Boston, 
In my apartment in the south end. 
Forget your year in London. 
Come back to bed, my darling. 

You can put the details in a letter, 
The more embarrassing the better. 
Right now I can be happy if I choose to. 
I know that in the morning I will lose you...

And maybe you'll go mad. 
And maybe I'll go gray 
And pack up to Berlin, 
Or maybe it won't matter anyway. 
We'll find out that your mom was right and you'll admit you're really gay. 
And maybe I'll wake up
In a city far away. 
Or maybe we'll make up
And buy a house and have a couple kids and a Labrador and a microwave. 
But anyway, 
Right now we're here in Boston. 
In Eden, where you almost pulled your pants down. 
Don't worry who these jokes will all be lost on. 
Come back to bed, my darling. 
There is nothing in the world that we can count on, 
Even that we will wake up is an assumption.

Sometimes they let strangers in and other times they check their records
When they check out in the morning dad puts out the lie detectors

And I wanted to but I just couldn't ask if he would take it back so I could know for certain
So on the bench I watched his left hand crossing
While doubling entendres with the voicings
He said ""O darling, you're charming
Please don't find it alarming if I pull this stop out to free up a hand for heavy petting""

Now there there
I'm a friendly man
I joke about sex because it's funny when you're frightened

So silently I sat and turned the pages
Recalculating our respective ages
Over my shoulder, he muttered, ""If I get any older
You can hack my wrists off with your choice of objects
No, I'm kidding""

Don't be scared
I'm a friendly man
I joke about death because it's funny when you're frightened

Erasing all the evidence
But there were matchsticks in my pants
And if a rock should hit my head
And I remember what he did
You'll be the very first to know
Maybe I'll find out why this damn thing won't stop bleeding

He told me that I showed a great potential
That given I turned heads and pages
Fame would be a piece of cake
But practice was essential
So like a stupid child I believed it
And golly who would had agreed if
I had been Schubert or Mozart
Devoted to the fine art of perfecting absolutely everything inconsequential

Don't be sad
I'll come back again
I joke about trash 'cause it takes class to be enlightened

Straight to my lover's heart for me

Don't you hear me calling?
My tears keep falling
I got to have your love now
Whoa, oh, oh, yeah

Look, I loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
I loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby

I look at you, you turn away
I say to you, ""Please look my way""
But you say to me, ""Leave me alone""
Then I say, ""I can't live without you""

I loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
I loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby

Girl, deep in, you know that, my love for you
And it hurt me so bad, I'm telling you
Come on, look at me once, [Incomprehensible]
Can't you see, I can't live without you

I loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
Make you my baby

Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Hear me calling
Hear the love is getting stronger

The Drifters,"Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city

All around, people looking half dead
Walking on the sidewalk
Hotter than a match head

But at night, it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be alright

And babe, don't you know it's a pity?
That the days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city
In the summer, in the city

Cool town, evening in the city
Dressed so fine and looking so pretty
Cool cat, looking for a kitty
Gonna look in every corner of the city

Till I'm wheezing like a bus stop
Running up the stairs
Gonna meet you on the rooftop

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on, and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be alright

And babe, don't you know it's a pity?

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
