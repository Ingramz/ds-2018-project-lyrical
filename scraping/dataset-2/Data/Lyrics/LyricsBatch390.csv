Turn up the radio 
Tonight is all about

We living stereo 

Prende el radio, the feet are tingling, party
viviendo la vida
En diferentes escenarios 
La disco el party 
Yo me la vivo diario 
No soy santo pero llevo mi rosario 

Las mujeres sexy 
Bailando bien crazy 
Metiéndole goles a la vida como Messi 
Mi gatita es una no la cambio por ninguna 
Así como la vivo es toda una fortuna 

Vive el nuevo estéreo 
Deja el misterio 
We gonna party 
You know que esto es en serio

Así es como nos robamos el show 
Luces mujeres cámara y acción 
Hasta que se acabe thats for sure 
Entretener mi negocio 

Campeones de la liga 
No sufrimos de fatiga 
Everybody comes to the party 
Que la fiesta siga

Llevo tanto tiempo mirando 
Cómo te gusta bailar
En la disco el dembow retumbando
Y el DJ no quiere parar

Porque tú me tienes la mente daña, má
Porque tú me provocas tantas ganas, má
Porque tú me tienes la mente daña, má
Porque tú me provocas tantas ganas, má

Ese vestido blanco, un corte seductivo
Me mantiene vivo, muy fuerte, bien agresivo
Me sacaste lo bestial
Estamos en una zona totalmente anormal
Extra bella, demasiado bella, tú lo sabes
Entre más se pega más en caso vas el viaje
Sube conmigo hasta las nubes
Siente cómo el dembow hace que tu cuerpo sude, wow

Porque tú me tienes la mente daña, má
Porque tú me provocas tantas ganas, má
Porque tú me tienes la mente daña, má

Ella me miró y la miré y ahí me le pegué
Bailando la besé y después me dijo yes
Ven, escápate conmigo
Vamos pa´ mi habitación que yo hoy quiero contigo, yes

No te imaginas lo que pasa por mi mente 
Cuando te veo pasar
Sería un placer que me dejaras acercarme
Yo no pido nada más
Ay, no hay duda que tus labios con mis labios 
Los quisiera juntar
Te tienes que arriesgar

Solo déjame acercarme
Aunque sea un poco más
Ay, mira cómo a mí me tienes
Que no puedo ya aguantar

calmaría tu frío y seriamos fuego
Cuando estemos envueltos en la pasión 
Que necesita comenzar de nuevo

Es que tú me sacas de la realidad, oh
Enciendo mi locura, empiezo a imaginarme
Qué sería de mi si pudiera probar 
Todo tu cuerpo y en la noche a tu lado quedarme

No puedo entender 
Cómo el mundo cambia cuando te veo, cuando te veo
No quiero perder 
Tu sonrisa que a mí me lleva al cielo

No recuerdo lo que sucedió

Pero que hora son, qué fue lo que paso
Por qué Farru tiene el carro aparcado en la habitación
Yo no recuerdo, solo se que amaneció
Y que tenia un tatuaje que decía ""Peace & Love""
Pero que confusión, creo que cometí un error
Y mezcle los tragos y una pastillitas de color
Que sentimiento creo que tenia un medicamento
De esos que te noquean duro contra el pavimento

Ya son las 6 de la mañana
Y todavía no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara
Pero amaneciste aquí en mi cama

No recuerdo lo que sucedió

Y ya no me acuerdo de nada, no tengo nada en la mente
Solo que estaba tomando mucho ron con aguardiente
Rumbiando en la disco estaba prendido el ambiente
Ese es mi único recuerdo hasta donde estuve consciente
Se acababa la botella y de camino ya venia
J Balvin me estaba hablando y no sabia lo que decía
Creo que nos presentaron, aun no lo se todavía
Que no recuerdo tu nombre mala suerte la mía

Era tiempo que te olvidaras (ey) 
Te olvidaras (ey ey) 
A veces pienso que esto no se acaba 
Parece que el tiempo no pasará (yeah) 
No pasará

Ayer mis ojos recordaste que sentías 
Tu piel no olvida lo que sientes todavía 
Y me aceptaste que a mí preferías 
Y que extrañaste mi calor las noches frías 

Que intentaste con otros hombres lo sé 
Y busqué otros amores también 
Pero no te olvido, pero no te olvido 
Aunque el tiempo pasa esto sigue vivo

Ya no vengas buscándome
Qué raro que tú digas que me amas
Sabré que es por cómo me ves

Me acuerdo de ti cuando no era cantante
Cuando no me vestía tan elegante
Cuando lo material era lo importante
No te parecí un hombre interesante

Ahora los tiempos han cambiado 
Han cambiado bastante 
Han cambiado bastante 

Que raro, que ahora que estoy más caro 
Cupido te haga disparos 
Y que andes loquita por mí 
Eso no me queda claro 

Que ahora que estoy más caro 
Cupido te haga disparos 
Y que andes loquita por mí

Uoh oh oh oh

Y te dañarom la cabeza 
Por chismes que no me interesan 
Si te dañaron la cabeza 
Después no digas que uno es el que empieza 
Nunca estuve para hacerte promesas 

Muy personal, lo de nosotros no era normal 
No había confianza ni aquí ni allá 
Más que este amor es como la inseguridad 
Si nos amábamos, tú me conocías 
Buscando un juego, tú insegura 
Sobraron dudas 

Y te dañaron la cabeza 
Por chismes que no me interesan 
Si te dañaron la cabeza 
Después no digas que uno es el que empieza 
Nunca estuve para hacerte promesas 
Muy personal 

Me da igual si tú piensas que yo soy el malo 
Será que nunca debiste guardar el pasado 
Siempre fui claro, no me preguntes si no contesto 
Mensaje de texto con pretexto 
Quiero que veas, aprendas y sientas 
Que lo de nosotros no es normal y así no bregas 

Que te vaya bien 
Aunque no sea por mucho pero esta vez 
Dale mente al tiempo que vas a perder 
No te molestes si con otra me ves

No quiere saber na' de mí
Ay, dime qué fue lo que yo hice mal 
Te pusieron en contra de mí 
Al que fue, no se lo voy a perdonar 

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no 
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue 
Yo si me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos 
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos (Let go, come on)

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no 
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue 
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos 
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos 

Sé que te pasas negando, todo lo que tú y yo hacíamos 
Queda en tu mente grabado todas las veces que nos desvestíamos 
Ahora me paso pensando, cómo tú puedes vivir así 
Diciendo que no sabes lo que entre sábanas tú te entregaba a mí

Solo yo, he podido llegarle 
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse 
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban 
No decía nada ya no

Dialogando con el dinero 
No quiero interrupciones 
Esa es la prioridad 
Pasaste lista de opciones 
Estoy con la colombiana, que sepa mañana y la cubana llega a Paris 
Llámate al ruso, que baje los kilos de oro que llegan a la calle de Brasil 

Solo yo he podido llegarle 
Tu cuerpo sabe, elevarse 
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban 
No decía nada, nada no no

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no 
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue

Y si me ha visto se supone, que en el pasado fue 
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo, hacíamos 
Cuando en la cama nos matábamos (J Balvin man)

Por más que me niegues a mí, no puedes escaparte 
Si era tu luz de mi sombra y me seguías a todas partes 
Nos lograron separar, tú no quisiste escuchar 
Fue más importante qué dijo la gente, que a dónde podíamos llegar 

En el mundo de mí están hablando 
Diciendo mil cosas 
Que me ven por aquí, que me ven por allá 
Por mi vida famosa 
Tú me conoces de años atrás, sabes cómo es la cosa 
Tú sabes que yo soy real 
Te lo dije una vez

Y sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer 
Que tú no lo quieres leer, que ni por la calle tú me quieres ver 
Si sales de party me escuchas a mí, siempre te preguntan por mí baby 
Dime qué se siente ser el fantasma que te atormenta a ti 

Dime que pasó mami, todo iba normal 
Te hablaron de mí, te dejastes llevar 
Tu cuerpo me estaba empezando a amar 
Y por culpa de la gente, ahora te toca olvidar 

Yo sé que eres infeliz, pero te pasas mintiendo 
Fingiendo que eres feliz, mami yo no te entiendo 
Ahora él te pone a llorar, también te pone a sufrir 
Mientras yo te ponía a viajar, yo linda te hacía lucir 

Solo yo he podido llegarle 
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse 
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban 
No me decía nada nada no no

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no 
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue 
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos

Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib

No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent? Had a thing for you
Even wrote the song dreams for you
'Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
'Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' 'cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you, I'm saying

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want ya

Fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?

Like, give me 20 dolla', dolla'
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall, each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling please play
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever, but

Babe, you know it gets no better than this,
It's like sunshine on a rainy day,
It's like a, ""How could you take me away?""
""Take me away.""
""Away.""
It's a beautiful bliss.
When you feel like this (beautiful bliss)
When you spill out hits (beautiful bliss)
When you fly as a bitch
And you ride with tits
And you aint bothered a bit now baby.

Fresh out the airport
Fresh out the tan with the clippers
Like Sean Lippet thinking, hmm
I'm trying to get it like Sean get it
If lord giveth a mill and a milf like skibbit
Its slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That anvil night hard mine is bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my hearts in it
When Brett Hart meet Brett Favre
A sharp shooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less stick some more
On your vest then my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My pro-ject is like what pros inject
And niggas so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath no joke
You see them boys sign me to the 'Scope, right?

[Chorus]

I fall whole to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil' nigga 
From the ville could get a deal
And tell them niggas at the top 
We want yo spot we are for real
And yet we heard you got it locked 
But like them socks we on your heels
So you best be on your toes nigga
Especially on your flows nigga
'Cause man they keep on checking 
For me especially all your hoes nigga
Catch me on your doorstep
You see me let me in
All I wanna' do is eat
I'm like the freaky lesbian
Know all I wanna' do is ball on TV knee E.S.P.N.
They heard I'm bout to blow so all my enemies say, ""Let's be friends.""
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
Where all the girls that we knew scream, ""Fuck you""
Gon' let me in
I'm definitely in a class of my own
And dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton
He just pass the Patron
And he ain't givin' dog is earned
If you just live in dog you learn
I let you niggas see the light
I'm like the prison yard I yearn
For that living large but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your son rise
Kick back and know your son set
Forever I ain't run yet
And never will
Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said, ""Fuck the world and I ain't come yet.""
You up yet?
My punchlines like gut checks
I'm raw dog
I'm rough sex
I'm on deck
I'm up next
I'm godbless
I'm success
So fuck stress
You can get the fuck from around me
And if you listening know you wondering
Where the fuck they found me
I'm from the ville boy
(Aye Wale, good looking.)

[Chorus]

Another day up in my ES
Wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet
Fuck it
I don't be stressed like relaxed muscles
Your feedback ain't flexing
Then you can keep it running
Like a muffler
When we not in summer
They like A list actors
They not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function
I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female Dijon a puncture
Waiting showing you her beauty if she's naked
It's like the view of a paintin' or a lakehead
This shits how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital for Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or it I placement 'cause
Shift the keys get your capital raised up

Now I'm stuck here hollering at old girl
Got one, got two three four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut one hut two told them hoes take a hike
Then it's on to the next one on on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

I wonder sometimes.
I wonder if I, was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

'Cause her eyes
Those hips
And that ass
Don't compare at all, no
And at best all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you're gone, gone, gone

'Cause being your friend
Is killing me softly
Hear voices
Wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault
And the wrong time
I wonder so often
Regret gets exhausting

That's why all I want is you now

I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Trying to celebrate my ""Independence Day"" Will Smith
Baby girl who I'm kidding
Still sick real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be,

Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn't be
Lost in the player way sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you gotta a hold on me
I say I'm wrong, you say come again
Damn said I was wrong look don't rub it in
I got a lot on my mind
Got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes,
How they coming in
Just saying
Don't wanna have me then somebody will
I'm playing
Weight on my chest like I body build
I'm praying
You ain't content with trying to do your thang
And come back baby boomerang, rang

J. Cole,"""We've only just begun""

Oh, yes, indeed, I like this, I like this
Hey, yo, Hi-Tek, do me a favor, man
Speed it up a little bit

From the intro you know I'm so influential 'cause I'm glowing like a candle
The focus is so essential, dog; what you tryna get into?
I steady the flow, ready to blow like snotty tissue
They snitching like Donnie Brasco, I'm counting like Monte Cristo
The ghetto full of betrayal like Iago and Othello
Your fellow neighbor will slay you; they'll smoke you like cigarillos
Police want that info--they'll grill 'em like Portabellos
I'm murdering instrumentals 'cause I rap with the conscience
Of felons, killers, and monsters, so revealing and honest
We're still feeling the promise; some nights I kill 'em with kindness
Hitting like Muhammad Ali; you more like Tatyana
All this is probably Karma: you dishonored the father
Whether it's God almighty or the almighty dollar
We follow the prophets like Islamics or the Dalai Lama
Your bullet points so hollow they could probably pierce body armor
Look in the scope; my people still a target

Smile on my face, tears of a sad clown
Feeling out of place as I whistle a cab down
If I tip extra, can I huff a cig'?
Blow my smoke out the window, dropping ashes on the bridge
Uh, I'm in New York now like Akeem and Semi was
Tryna get the lobby door open from a semi-buzz
I just wanna go to the slum
And throw my money on the floor like the Notorious B-U-M, uh
Build a home, teach a class, start a revolution
Free the mind, heal the body, talking evolution
This that black Elohim, Anunnaki rap
That Farrakhan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Qaddafi rap
I dedicate this to my niggas in New Orleans
Rocking black and gold stocking caps and fleur-de-lis Shockey hats
I'm in the coatroom, screaming ""who that?"" on the double
Serving gumbo with a shovel, dog, I'm on another level
Me and Kweli come together like two pieces of metal
We magnetizing the ghetto

Yeah, now here's the memo
I'm a rebel without a cause, a bezel without no flaws
And, shorty, you straight; bet you look way better without no drawers
Let's sweat out this alcohol; bet I'm about to ball
And never let up; look how I just crept up without applause
Fed up with all the frauds and left y'all without a job
The center of attention; this is clever; I'm Pau Gasol
Really though I'm LeBron, really don't got my mind
On this new school of rappers I will really go Columbine
And throw up the diamond sign; boy, you know I'm-a shine
Flow is in Ramadan 'cause couple years ago the game had they pajamas on
But now they on my dick; man, I should throw a condom on
'Cause a nigga coming raw like I ain't got one on
And I ain't stopping nor copping no pleas; I just lock and load, squeeze
Dog, I'm on a higher level; I'm on top of nosebleeds
Niggas say they sick, but when they rock, they don't sneeze
Like the nigga on the block waving his glock, but won't squeeze
Please

Hold your applause until the ceremony end
Yours truly, truly blessed, yet again a noble planted
Super magic, abracadabra kid
Mysterious master Jim, blacker pen, arrowhead
With the long-barrel stem and his apparel fresh
Harbor lights shining out the black power grid
With the Black Power grip, and pure power don't power trip
Push the cellar ceiling up and make the tower tip
The Gladwell point and Babylon polish
All about nothing where it's all about the dollar
And mansions on the fault line of a shaky market
The Devil at the dance hall thirsty for a partner
Get off him; there is not a parcel or a portion
Or a measure of a fortune more awesome
Gorgeous, the funky Four Horsemen and one more
With Hi-Tek on the score, once more, of course

You're welcome, thanks

She’s a star if I ever seen one
Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one
So now I’m under pressure I want it bad
She got something I never had
I see ya looking at me

Bad bitches get low
Bad bitches get low right now
Bad bitches get low
Bad bitches get low right now

Wale and we are not the same
Got bread in the diesel, got diesel in the check?
Rock Steady, me and my nigga Cole
Leave me a couple minutes, you leave me a couple hoes
Quite gifted, ambitions of life living
Despite living with more attention than light skinned, women
Ok you think a nigga shallow?
Ok, you probably think I get ‘em all with the cash flow
Actually I like a broad that can bag hoes
That's how I rope em all down
See my last hoe (work)
Blast off (work)
Get involved
Gas women then return ‘em like a rental car
That's one show, that's fifty large
Nigga I just glow, bright as any Debarge
I’m just tryna get ya comfortable
And its amazing what some liquor and a blunt’ll do

Please show love, make way for the bad girls club
Please show love, make way for the bad girls club

Hey, Cole World
Down for whatever
Boy got Dollars, Pounds or whatever
Being broke and its a Diddy ass world
Still found a way to get pretty ass girls
Killin’ y’all niggas, any last words
Cause you didn’t play the game right
Hey girl, before you throw it at me
You gotta make sure you aim right
Red dots cause I’m red hot
Seen, dead girl you smoking
I get paper like I a mail box, seen
But girl you got me open
Proceed, pocket full of G’s
Kush; baby mama less; yeah no seeds
Blow tree’s like a hurricane
Damn, if looks kill, than ya murderin’
Damn!

Please show love, make way for the bad girls club

I am what you want, cause you like what I make
I am what I am, and you is who I say
Go where you ain't been
No reservation
And most hoes be so-so when they hold no make-up
Yeah, I got the flow that they know is the truth
It’s getting ugly in here, guess I coated the booth
After the club, gettin you open
And I’m talkin, passenger action
I’m pulling you over
And you walkin,
after the fact
It’s knowin’ it’s over
Now tomorrow you sober wishing you ordered a soda
I am more than the dopest
I’m forever improving
They can’t fuck with ya boy
Like a BYU Cougar
They 22's or something
I’m brutal as a bazooka
And when the smoke clears don’t you dare ask hooka
Or who did, cause I did
Bitch I’m here and I’m it
And I’m is what you ain't
Who’s iller, I’ll wait
Hold up!

J. Cole,"Look, I just shed tears homie and now I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
And when I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
'Cause as I left them I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, 'cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of lettin' my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame 'cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowin' through our veins is the same
My mama left you and maybe your anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be tellin' you fuck you 'cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help 

But break down, I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit man
It's fuckin' with her body, now she sick damn
I wanted a big house with the white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothin' like real life
You made a milli off of servin' hard white, yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shootin' niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bullet proof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruitin' niggas
We tryna stand tall when it gets to crucial niggas

Break down
We break down, we break down, we break down

He's servin' time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know, 
His daughter twenty five pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be four
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt, she love him yeah that's fo sho
But temptation stays 'round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know?
Never know and so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freakin', but them niggas holla
But she never speakin', but tonight I see the devil creepin'
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She do the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!
Please, stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!
Don't break down, don't break down, don't break down, don't break down",Breakdown,2011

Now I ain't got no kids yet,

I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet,
But that's how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses,
Make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter,
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rocking with the best man,
Dress game down to the sex game
Won't brag, but the boy been blessed mane,
Let you play with the stick, Ovechkin
She calling, she texting,
She's falling, but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate girl
Cause a nigga don't play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing no handcuff or arresting
And I ain't coming offa my last name
Cause I really can't take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit,
Your home girl saying, ""He a bad boy""
But I'm signed to the Roc,
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids

Hey, Globetrotter,
Cole hotter even way out in London town
Hoes holla 'cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kwali, Pimp C, H-town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that'll cut all night,
That'll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight,
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever,
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight,
On the grind tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head,
I hate it when you give me headaches

Hey, Cole World, baby, ain't nothing sunny
I see 'em hating, but it ain't nothing to me
I'm from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo' fives like change for a twenty

So we can do whatever you like
Hey, hey

It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle, take the proceeds go to gamble
Bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae

Uh, turn up the 808's for me
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck could niggas tell me
They say I'm takin' long, I tell 'em patience is a virtue
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See, when you're spittin' so real
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
Got 'em feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be

Walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
'Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowing it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got 'em
They say he wouldn't leave me yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress of this mess you're in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin' now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?

I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure that money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares where niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies, who infiltrated my team?
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
You never, have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If you don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
'Cause this life get hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? My fans, and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' ""God damn, what's her name?""
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like ""Bitch don't be so fuckin' lame""
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those praying for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will

Woman, bet he wouldn’t put his hands on a nigga
I ain’t bitter boy that’s all you
Plus I just fucked her 'fore she called you
Dry your eyes baby, I’ll drive you home
Older hoes sayin' ""my how you’ve grown""
I came up, fucked the game up
Show my momma I’ll survive on my own

Did you miss me? No, I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm goin', now is you comin' with me? Up, up and away
Hey, do you trust me?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me?

""Ahh, yeah nigga, we out here nigga, yeah nigga!"" 
So we goin' crazy, we goin' crazy as fuck, we like super excited
Dog, ten seconds later, all I see in the back and hear is ""woop woop,"" 
Blue lights right behind me, the fuckin' undercover car, of all things
So I'm like fuck. I knew right away what it was 
Dawg, for the, for two and a half maybe three years before that, in New York, 
I was drivin' dirty, my license was no good
Dawg, how 'bout the moment I found out I was gon' get the deal 
A fuckin' cop got behind me and I already knew what it was
I handled it so like, I handled it the best way you could ever go to jail like I went to jail knowin', 
Bitch like, ah know what I'm sayin'? 
I'm in there dog, spendin' the night in jail realizin', like, these niggas have no clue,

Still at it

What a life we chose
I'm sending this out to those
Who fell down, but then rose
I'm hot, I'm hellbound
With these flows, Cole
And when my story's told
Let it be know I'd never fold
I took my time
I gave my soul
I watched you shine
But me I glow

I'm coming for what I'm owed
You know?",Intro,2011
J. Cole,"Yeah, I had this little bad thing something like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, something like The Wiz
But you see the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world and about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like ""baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard""
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down for
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feeling we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feeling
You feeling when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause she be healin' that shit
And naw that ain't your girl, dog, but you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights please

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights,
For now everything just seems so right,
And how you make the darkness seem so bright,
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights,
For now everything just seems so right,
And how you make the darkness seem so bright,
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceiling
She say she wanna blow Ls, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryin' to put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been living a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like ""baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen""
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow, the more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules but yet y'all tryin' to play the game
And ain't it shameful, how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make, coward nigga you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family, dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recording tracks
Said ""I know you wanna change the world but for the night please
Just reach over and hit the lights please""

I got you pregnant now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin’ if this gon' make me think 'bout wifing you
Like if you had my first child would I spend my whole life with you
Now I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I’m tryna talk
Now I ain't tryna spend the night with you
I’m kinda lost see
I’ve been giving it some thought lately and frankly
I’m feelin’ like we ain't ready and it’s hold up now
Let me finish
Think about it baby me and you we still kids ourself
How we gon' raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself
A nigga barely over twenty, where the hell we gon' live?
Where am I gon' get that money
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I ain't got shit to give ‘em
And I’m not with them niggas who be knocking girls up and skate out
So girl, you gotta think 'bout how the options weigh out
What's the way out?

And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect

And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes

She said, ""Nigga, you got some nerve to come up to me talking about abortion
This my body nigga, so don't think you finna force shit
See I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flipping like reciprocals
It figures though, I shoulda known that you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claiming that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowing all the right things to say, I let you hit it raw, mothafucka!
Now I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?
Tryna take away a life, is you God, mothafucka?
I don't think so! This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here I'mma love it
I ain't budging I just do this by my mothafuckin' self
See my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help from a man
But I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talking about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
'Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doing the same shit, you ain't shit nigga""

And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work but you doubt it

That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it

They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons
They grow apart, she wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her 'cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though
Uh oh, she tellin’ him she missed her period like typo’s
He panicking, froze up like a mannequin
A life grows inside her now he asking “is it even mine”
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant dawg
Could she be lying?
She be crying crying 'cause he acting distant
Like ever since I told you this nigga you acting different
And all his niggas saying man these hoes be trapping niggas
Playing with niggas emotions like they some action figures
Swear they get pregnant for collateral
It’s like extortion, man if that bitch really pregnant
Tell her get an abortion
Uh, but what about your seed nigga?
What about your seed nigga?
What about your seed nigga?
What about your seed?

I'm cut from a different sleeve, Cole World so the wrists we'll freeze

Y'all niggas better not call the law, get no blood on my Audemar
Meaning y'all better not waste my time when y'all ready I take you all to war

See I could probably rush you, tell you that he shoulda loved you
Take advantage, fuck you, tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same, on different teams, but it's all a game
The objective, tryna score, you got a wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers, pull up her pants, you find the door
You drive her home, she mop you off, you bust again, and drop her off
Then repeat like a episode, why we cheat, I'll never know
Is it 'cause we rap? Heavens know, lotta niggas rap though, never blow
Like heterosexuals, girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be 'cause my father let me know that he cheated and somehow
I never told, I never told

Juggling, bill paying, been running 'round, field daying
Wine and dine, meal paying, with hopes that she'll lay in
The bed and, get wet then, give head then, you bet man
The same girl who said we just met man, game colder than the fucking dead man
One night stands, no best man, no bridesmaids or reverends
'Cause Wolverine's depressed and don't wanna be your ex-man
'Cause Cupid aims and throw the darts, there go the sparks and broken hearts
Who wanna build Noah's Ark just to have that shit torn apart?

But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it

You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

Up in first class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit in coach, hate to see me walk past 'em
Young, black, pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', ""how did he manage?""
""With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!""
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar 'cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like ""what the fuck you got a deal for""
When I was ass out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door

Hey, I'mma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
'Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

I made it to the rack, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don’t understand is this is all plan
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck
Don’t you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not 'cause my looks, 'cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
Young Simba been a lion from the start
Dumb nigga’s, y’all been lyin from the start
My life’s like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gon' say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same

And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year, that's unfair, but

Speaking of positions just witness how I elevate it

She probably gon' die, it's startin' to be evident
I told her, ""Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent""
I'm a thug but I got a heart like Kev in there
And I can't let this girl throw her life away
Kick the door in the room and told her to put the knife away
Took her to the hospital like right away
She a angel with demons, the girl like night and day
Stressed out, parents getting divorced
Girl love 'em both, she ain't tryin' to sit in court
She a square so it's hard to see the angle
And that's why God gave her an guardian angel, it's me
And I'm here for her, swear to God that I'm here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She ain't had no pride, so she went and did a year for him
She a ride-or-die, like Eve and them
Make home-cooked meals every evening
Start stripping on the side, now I'm tipping on the side
Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her
Takin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him
She don't wanna pray, but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah, grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin' on the door H.A.M

Even though she doubted me
I thank the lord that we are safe

To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You’ll never be me partner so it don’t fucking matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you, that's when it sounds beautiful
Then maybe you could blow up
And maybe you could blow up
Shit, but you know what?
For now, bitch I’m about to blow up",Blow Up,2012
J. Cole,"Yea, lost in the world
Like Siddhartha while I author these quotes
Cutting hoes like a varsity coach
Caught fire, no larceny
Please you gotta pardon these boasts
A lot of niggas pray to God that he choke
Never see the album drop
Fall off and be broke
Reminiscing on the hard times
So often he'd hope
To slip his foot in the door
Promise when I made it
I'd write my hooks for the poor
But now I'm hella faded
And got my foot to the floor
While I'm pushing this Porsche
Seem to be more concerned with how I look in the Source
Staring in the mirror just to see a look of remorse
Take a look at my chain
Look at what I became, mayne

You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to say so
I say, this my song for you my friend
You can only see that I
Can hardly let things go, no, oh, yea
So listen to the sound of my voice
You better send him all my love
He's given me no choice, no, no, no
Listen to the sound of the boys, huh!
A raggamuffin is a freedom fighter
He's handling a choice
And I know that if

The raggamuffin is one of the friend
What you see is what you really get in the end
But what you're ever gonna, gonna do, I don't know
And the raggamuffin shall not fall down
Because he has the wisdom not to fool around
But why did you have to leave the good sense on the ground, yes

You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to have so
I say, this my song for you my friend
You can only see that I
Will never forget ye-yes so

But what you're ever gonna, gonna do, I don't know
And the raggamuffin shall not fall down
Because he has the wisdom not to fool around
But why did you have to leave the good sense on the ground, yes

Yea, that old me that you knew well is still in me
Somewhere, deep down there
Hiding in the corner is a nigga who cared
Believed he could change the world and he dared
Now he sits alone
Used to write poems but that's gone
It's been so long cause he's scared
The world ain't fair and I'm fully aware
When the revolution comes will I stare
Or will I ride

The raggamuffin is one of the friend
What you see is what you really get in the end

J. Cole,"If only you knew all the love I had inside
If only I told you
That you were my greatest pride
If only I showed you just how good you made me feel
Maybe I wouldn’t be alone and you would be right here but
I don’t wanna do it over
The first time has gone away
You can’t rewrite the past
All I can do is say

This time, I’ll do it much better

This time I’ll be a better woman
This time I won’t get in my own way
I could go back you never would have gone

If looks kill then Melanie you a felony
We both hot I guess we couldn’t take the jealousy
All in my ear I had my homeboys telling me
How to be a player, we fell off like Bill Bellamy
MTV shhh, we used to watch Law and Order, NBC shh
But now I’m watching solo on some empty seat shit
Thinking of you, I got a lot more drinking to do
Reminiscing, though I seen it coming
Yeah I had a premonition
Right beside each other and somehow it felt distant
Lets rewind back when days sunny like Liston
Smile just glisten, your booty like a cushion
Is this the moment where we making up
And realise we tripping forever breaking up
And then I break you off, put you to sleep know its deep
When the girl of his dreams is the same one to wake him up

This time, I’ll do it much better
Love you like I never
Ever loved you before

J. Cole,"Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to be
'All you can be' posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany
I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know that the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope
And knew one day you would find it
And knew one day that you would come back and rewind this, singing

I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better tonight)
If you ain’t fucking with that
I don’t care (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
I got a life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: ""Don't let me slip""
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you
""You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane""
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go with me damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows them
Don't you ever go expose them
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's a tutor for me
Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

J. Cole,"Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors I'm just paintin my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped the range rover my girl got the mercedes
Iced out crazy I wanna shine like baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way that people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch yo chain, I bet it still won't free you
Cause I'll be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, ""Here go your chain my nigga""

This is chaining day
I need you to love me, love me
Chaining day, my chaining day
I need you to love me, love me
My chaining day
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair

Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Rolly
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
The same shit a rich white mo'fucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home where niggas sit today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', ""Fake it 'til you make it""
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And actin' like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated to that hundred racks
I gave it up, for what

I need you to love me, love me
Chaining day, my chaining day
I need you to love me, love me
My chaining day
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear

Lord
This is the last time
Told my accountant, It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my Chains from me
This is the last time
'Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
'Cause I love this slavery
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me

On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round

They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show them kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?""

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
'Cause he don't seem to want you back
And it got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking
Not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch
That them broads can't be, and that's you
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round

Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
(You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
Like the sun, I know you know I found my way back round)

We don't look nothing like the people on the screen
You know them movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation, or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, cause we in hell already
I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
Yo one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail
I got money for the bail now, well now
If you asking will I tell now? Hell naw
I ain't snitching cause
Man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

Ey yo, I walked through the valley of the shadow of death
When niggas hold tec's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check?
And if so, you gotta expect to sip juice
From the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament

Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee ""the finisher""
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit
And who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run

I was a young nigga making A's at 11
At 12, trying to get that taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell

How many record do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the double X L
Or Fader, fuck ya magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest
I ain't talking about later
I'mma drop the album the same day as Kanye
Just to show the boys the man now like Wanyá

She thinking bout all the things she can get
She thinking you got a range for a whip
And a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple cause

I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes boy knock it off
I seen your mama in a Benz when she dropped you off
Damn now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, ""What mean the world to me?""

Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, ""Watch the snakes cause they watching you""
I told her, ""Aw baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!""
She said, ""You bout to miss church"" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)

This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with

A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her cause I tried to hit
On the first night, nah I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfuless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative
Nigga is to hit and never commit
Now realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call
She was hurting
Now she staring dead in my face she was smirking
Like, ""Yeah I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga""

J. Cole,"Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end, so far as rap goes
It's only natural, I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name

Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin

I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read 'em in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who thought that I would meet him on tour?
I'm earnin' stripes now nigga, got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let him know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though, cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning feeling fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said you the one, yo why you make that shit?
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin

I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made ""You Owe Me"" dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts, you mean tellin' me
That I was not up to par, when I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted by my mind, I kept on sayin'
Where's the hits? You ain't got none
You know Jay would never put your album out without none
And dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with their outcomes
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I study the shows, the fans, study their hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number 2
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game but on the way
I let Nas down, I got no one to blame, I'm ashamed I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you could never understand, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin

I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen
Outside my core then I can open a door
Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall like the son of the Lord
On the cross, dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that hip-hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?
Lettin' Nas down
I got the phone call quietly I mourned dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight may I never lose sight, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals

A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money of sins by any means
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter
Up here, life is a bitch I blow a kiss at her daughter
In a city where niggas will leave you shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once

Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparation for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how

Don't it ever get boring to you?

Getting high off of power
Fuck it more to you, saw through you
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for more money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but it just ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watching little Jermaine
Do his thang before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got

Of one day that I become you
And I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more

Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked then made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feeling like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wanna be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowing when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wanna let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Oh shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying
""Baby, why don't you throw these bands on me?""

She pop a molly let the motherfucking games begin

I'm holding on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on

When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings
Followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher says we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: ""Are you sure?
Even the murderer? Even the whore?
Even the nigga running through bitches on tour?""
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit
She losing faith in him and he knows and shit
Like what the fuck is a break
Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got till it ain't no more
No more tears it's been ten long years, damn near
I don't know if I can wait no more, and who can blame her
You complaining 'bout every time you out, you come back she pout
Sleeping back to back, this is whack
We 'bout to go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out on account of your guilt
She's has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evening
And even then, your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman
At least you know you got Lois Lane
But you

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on

Yeah, unbelievable seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age 3 I knew this world was three below
Listen, even know my ego low achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent, yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me: ""Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color their face is""
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
9 months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, cause you
Know your wifey loves you, does you refuse to accept it?
That's that type shit that tell why my granny light-skinned
Rich white man rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains still concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from 50 mill like Dave Chappelle?

When they get my album, probably pass this on
Thought they knew me, well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell
The happiness can't buy yo' ass this new SL
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit
Ride or die chick fighting insecurities
Want ring and my last name for securities

It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out we're tired
We only need to stay close
In time, sparks will fly
(And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too)

It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out we're tired
We only need to stay close
In time, sparks will fly
(And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too)

I know my style ain't perfect
I know my smile ain't perfect
Nigga ain't perfect, it's true
Funny though I'm perfect for you
All the drama seem worth it for you
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true
Now what you crying for?
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?
She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back
I say those word hoping that,
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And though I slip, only girl in my life is you

It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out we're tired
We only need to stay close
In time, sparks will fly
(And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too)

It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out we're tired
We only need to stay close
In time, sparks will fly
(And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too)

Feels as though our world's crashing down
We can't forget to breathe through this now
We live through the ups and the downs
It'll get better

It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out we're tired
We only need to stay close
In time, sparks will fly",Sparks Will Fly [*],2013
J. Cole,"I said set it off on my left
Set it off on my right
I said liquor all in my breath
Bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas trying to fuck
Fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air
But I ain't scared for my life
I said

Yeah, God flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas sayin' live fast, die young, so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it, ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first the sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard ""can't get enough""
Now she fuck a nigga thinkin' that she may hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, ""the things hoes say""
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
I'm in trouble

And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off of her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like ""don't you know this shit already?
Nigga, ain't you rich already?""
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches
That a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And theirs mans don't know, mans don't know, fa show
Had a nigga's baby, little mans don’t know
Mama, was a freak, got it in on the low
12 years later when my song come on, he ask
""mama, did you fuck J. Cole?""
Whoa

Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
I take you to the promise land

Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade

Sometimes I brag like Hov
Sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough
Look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers trying to steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet
I'm real life hot
Homie, get your weight up
Fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect
Whenever I say faggot, okay faggot?
Don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass
That's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya
Boy Meets World
I'm trying to find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James
Wait a minute that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck
If the hoes like it
I love it nigga nigga nigga
Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga
Rap nerd even copped Rah Digga Digga
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like eleven so forgive me
A decade later I be all up in the city
Trying to get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it
It was, fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know
In a year he'd be fucking paying me
What can you say to me
I beat the odds like Vegas
I use to rap about haters before niggas was hating me
Now they hate to see a young Black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free
Pardon me

Got the game back and I ain't never lettin' go

I'm the prince of the city
I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parks where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
So I'm wondering really
What could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops cause he's sorry
Fuck the education
Would ask for reparations
But I'm probably just gonna buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the T.V. so the demons in him
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil but now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul

My nigga
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul

I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody

Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati

This next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati
Is you stupid nigga
Young Black millionaire
Old White billionaires
I'm sure that they could do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would have been a summa cuma laude
Beyonce told me that she want to cop a blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth
I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see them at the Oscars

Oh hey what's up? What's goin' on with you?
OK, friend hug, friend hug, just a friend
Keep it friendly, friends, friends

Re-adjusted my target audience
Cause it's obvious
I've gone astray
Losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timberland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind
Just the sound of my whole career
Crashing burning
The thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years
Until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here
Mask my tears, but I

They say I ain't getting money well who told them that shit
OK your bitch she like my diamonds and the cars that I ride
Or she might just like my style or its the squad that behind me
I don't know but she gon' go because my pockets on swole
I just walk up in the mall then I buy the whole store

I know my diamonds looking blinding please don't look at my wrist

You ain't fucking me for free bitch 20k for my dick
Catch you slipping Scottie Pippen one phone call and you hit
I just get these bitches numbers I don't call I forget
And I'm riding in them foreigns I'mma ride off St.Lawrence
I'mma ride on brick squad catch a nigga I'm scoring

You got a bad batch too much baking on it
Right back on the stove, right back to them shows
Right back to my bitches, your advance is my clothes

Shorty pop a molly then she wiggle it
Putting orders, you telling stories
Casino life hard rock nigga put in all this

J. Cole,"If Michael Jackson was alive right now
He would want us to smoke one for him
Double M, Self Made 3, let's go

Folarin in this ma'fucka
I'm just talking to you ma'fuckas
If I don't make you niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

Misunderstood, just over heads
Just in your ears, although you deaf
Killing my fitteds with no intent, I grew 'em better
Like I'm under a goal post, I'm two official
Extra point nigga, I forever kick it
As far as lyrics I'm quite content with celibate living
Wittingly unfuckwittable with these syllables
And fuck your syllabi, lil nigga been to school
The realest dude in the room in my groove
And all my women come frequently as the summer's moon
Keep talking 'bout ambition shit
Brown women, brown liquor, I'm innocent
And all these bitches don't know which body part they gon' pick
Invite them to my mind but they end up on my dick
Reminiscing upon my man Slick
We from the jungle, the grimiest animal a pig
As-salamu alaykum though, try to hit the Jummah
Muhammed said you faking, though
Somebody said ""you winning, why BOA pray so much?""
I said ""you tripping, such winners make niggas pray on us""
Dreams fulfilling they ain't capable of
As I renovate a model but do raise up your cup
Tell them niggas we never giving up
And never lose us on this never ending revenue hunt

Folarin in this ma'fucka
Still talking to you ma'fuckas
If I don't make you niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

Uh, I did it for my family
I'mma take my mama to the Grammy's
And shoutout everybody that ever said that I can't be
And show her everything that she taught done came in handy
Yeah, everything fine and dandy
Hurricane flow, dropped my album it was Sandy
On another level so they couldn't understand me
I guess I gotta take what I want like Meyer Lansky
Shore is 'bout to get back, put your feet up and sit back
Barely went gold but I got money just like I went plat
You get that? Look like I went diamond where my wrist at
I eat a nigga first four bars without a Kit Kat, pause
Let me get that, oh, how you get that far
Cause when I ran out of gas I had to push that car
And when I ran out of cash I had to push that hard
Like Chris Paul when he push that ball, you dig?
I ain't even used to look that far, you dig?
I learned to hustle when I took that loss, I did
18 when I took that charge
Time to retire old niggas like they did Brett Favre, you dig?
New flows and new hoes
Now I'm switching Ferrari's just like I do clothes
I run a business my nigga, I don't just do shows
I don't just rhyme nigga, all I know is grind nigga

I'm looking at the plan like this shit might work
But if it don't work then this shit might hurt
We made first and goal now we gotta convert
Gotta get a couple mill, then go for dessert
I'm tryna break the bank, I ain't breaking the news
That negative attention be the reason we lose
Instead of paying bills niggas wanna buy shoes
If it's money over bitches, is it that hard to choose?
Give these fuck niggas some fame
9 times out of 10 they wouldn't even sustain
You can tear they ass apart and let the pussy remain
Until the industry fuck 'em and then they no one again
I always been me, I was never ashamed
I understand that no man's path is the same
And when you not lying you’re even harder to tame
If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game
Nigga don't be a statistic
How your main bitch sending me pictures?
Feeling futuristic might buy me a Fisker
Or a time machine to make the process quicker
I ain't with the waiting but I stay patient
I take work trips, I don't take vacations
I'm headed to the top where I stay stationed
Yeah nigga, I stay stationed
And I ain't with the drama, don't look back for that
The flow got more crack than the trap you at
I'm done with bitter bitches, it's a wrap for that
If your a angry bird, it's an app for that
I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch
And now I'm back with a brand new batch
Yeah, and it feel good when it go like that
I spend quick and make the dough right back

This verse never before rehearsed, it was wrote on site
To slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Cole world, zip your coat up tight
I put your soul on nice
Illiterate, the boy don't write
Never met a beat that the flow don't like, it's cold
Young CO, L.E. call me Neo
And If I ain't the one I'm the prototype
Insane how I rhyme
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
Shame y'all lying, me I'm the truth
Dog eat dog world nigga we on the loose
Niggas don't wanna hang, I'm the tree, I'm the noose
You lil pups couldn't pee on my roots
Touch the people, I could be a masseuse
Thoughts black, I should be in The Roots
While y'all foulin', me I just shoot
Fallon, Jimmy, nigga
Ask for it nice, now it's gimmie nigga
Once poor now it's plenty, nigga
Still want more, no Demi, nigga
Serve niggas quick like Denny's

Did the most with what I was taught

Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need somethin' newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I weren't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I, could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
Cause I'm tryna stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dream in quiet tryna dodge a suit and tie

I always did shit the hard way, my niggas slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbaca
Whispers that he got it for the low low sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peep game, got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, to ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front door
His mama at home, she still let em' hit the blunt though
I told her hello and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash, and just asked
""What a nigga gotta do to get that?! Put me on""
He just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 Years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, ""Nigga you know how you sound right now?
You won't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now, listen""
""You everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me, when I look up to you?""
""You bout to go get a degree, I'm bout to be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or sell a number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't never want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?""
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly

While silly niggas argue over who gone snatch the crown
Look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds, one verse at a time
And claim that you sick, and fuck it if the truth is
Who's the king?

We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls from the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he claims onto the need for power
But reality he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize
The fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same
Are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause deep down I know every pore just wanna be loved",Fire Squad,2014

Get to know somebody and you learn a lot about 'em
When we long for you, start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breath without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em

You knew that already
And turned to the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute but came lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossin' the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a straight
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga fall to well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger singing

May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you nigga with me cause I love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide
It's just physics, please let's put our egos aside
You my niggas, and should our worst tenancies turn us into enemies

For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate

Sat beside me, used to laugh at mad jokes

I'm thinkin' how she ride on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
It make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deeper
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before

I said I was like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know what
So she done roll back and told me
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when playing on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like ""Yeah baby sound like a plan""

Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in a crib now a nigga palm sweatin'

And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practice
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said

'Cause I've been in this hood dog for way too long man
I've been quiet for way too long
Been patiently waiting can't wait too long dog
I've been broke man for way too long
No hot water for way too long
You can't knock the hustle it's way too strong
Yeah we're way too strong

Death to the imposters, label me the king
My dreams could win Oscars, my n****s turned mobsters
My white friends doctors, fatherless child
Listen how I got this knowledge is wild
Streets taught me, speak softly n**** watch from the crowd
'Cause any n**** that's loud, just want attention and eventually blaow
No fake n****s allowed in my circle dawg
You been through half the s*** I been through it'll hurt ya dawg
Tread softly, my n**** moving state to state running late watch 'em
Tryna avoid state troopers, that's the weight watchers
Run this dope set this cake till they say ""Gotcha""
Or till the fat lady sings, and n****s hate operas
And Oprah hate n****s
Make no mistake that we know the stake still
We hope to make over eight figures
Slim chances, but n****s bet against the odds 
And who am I to criticise how you play your cards dawg

'Cause I done beat the odds going way too hard
I been getting slept on for way too long
I been patiently waiting for way too long
I been quiet dawg for way too long
You can't knock the hustle dawg it's way too strong
It's way too strong
I said you can't knock my hustle dawg it's way too strong
It's way too strong

Look, I never admit it, tryna get my brother acquitted
Yo' tell the judge I be happy to pay him off if he's with it
My flesh and blood, hauled off to the cell
I search for heaven as I see him getting lost in this hell
Headed for coffin or jail, to never try is the ultimate fail
But love is wanting more for someone than they want for themselves
Deep, I guess I love a lot
Because the more I do my thang the more I feel the guilt and shame that my brother's not
Reminisce as we was kids screaming f*** a cop
Guess he took it serious, for me that s*** was just for props
Arms too skinny to hug the block
I found comfort in my dreams, of things seen on the screen of fortune and fame
Decisions, decisions, the Porsche or the Range
I take a trip back to the 'Ville only corpses remain
Some of them n****s still breathing but they dead inside
Victims of a genocide
Tears fill my eyes dawg

'Cause I've been out of touch man for way too long
I've been out in Hollywood for way too long
I've been, getting this paper for way too long
I ain't called my pops back in way too long
I done make my girl wait for way too long
I wonder if I changed, am I way too on?
Can't knock my hustle but It's way too strong
It's way too strong

Or do you like drugs?

Ran into a night owl rollin' White Owls
Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl
I'm with it though, she a centerfold
Big ol' blunt look like tentacles
She strip in Europe, Interpol
Don't remember her in her clothes
I fucked her friend, damn they was close
Let's reunite, let's get em close
Hit 'em twice in a row, hit a flight, and I'm ghost
That's the last time I seen her though
She be gettin' too eager, ho
Stamp it like it's my visa
Cheefin' off of these berries
When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry
I'm her Midnight Mercenary

It's lit

It's lit
Feel the buzz?

She take me to a place that I never would discover
Might never have another, so I had to fuck her
Reach into my pockets, damn I ain't got a rubber
See my nigga Ron, like L. Ron Hubbard, he be outta space
Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Room 508, check by the safe, she say ""Boy you got it made
Do you got a cape?"", I ain't with the games ma, do I gotta wait?
I'm quite impatient, intoxication got me feelin' like procreating
Girl I'm the baker, you surely caking

Now comes the question of which intro do you use?
Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on?
But, then that let's people know I had more than one take
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
Yea, let's do that

You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin'
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin' online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, uhm world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me, long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Woah, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
'Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out
Ced on the beat let me vibe out
We was 15 with a ASR up in my house
Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin', he made it rappin'
Now at the shows he the main attraction
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin' ""It's lit, feel the buzz?""

They can't call us bandits no more
Same hood, same corner store
But them same old hoes ain't wearing panties no more
I'm on my night job, slim waist with them fat thighs
Never been baptized, but she soak me all in her holy water
I'm one of five, she the only daughter
She ain't used to sharing, I ain't used to caring
Let's play truth or dare
Cause lately my lifestyle's like dynamite
I'ma go lights out like dynamite
Smoke one, that I might
I'm on my night job, always knew how to play these cards of mine
Fuck rap, we seen harder times
Jump back like Vinny Carter prime

I won't let it out until you let me know if you love it
Aye baby, I'ma take it low

I'm on my night job, y'all niggas jivin', I'm back up in position
Earnhardt, I'ma catch some nigga slippin'
Burn hard on a track and get to whippin'
I'm on my night job, why is it always blacks that get detention?
For my nigga with the pass to get the flip in
Boy that trap is a accurate description
I'm on my night job, finally got Bassy off the corner
'010 niggas thought he was a gonner
He ducked shots, now it's ""Bas we gotta phone her""

Being an artist, that's the best excuse for being crazy

Now she on my face time and my nigga she just masturbated

Fuck a album release party, I'm out in the streets shawty
How many rappers I killed, counted at least 40
Nah I ain't God, but shawty down on her knees for me
I'm horny like that Coltrane album
A Love Supreme, that's cold fame album
Lately I've been dancing like a Soul train album
Lately silly making songs bout how they hate me
They've been loving me this whole time
My only adversary was my own mind
Killed my ego now I'm snappin' like it's '09

So the state raised him, and the hate raised him
They clowned on him at school but he fronted like it ain’t phased him

If his skin's a little different they gon' say it was self defense

Starin' at the idiom box, riddle me this
If a killer was a nigga would niggas still really care
Cause niggas worser than Zimmerman livin' life everywhere
Niggas hopeless
Small niggas with big tools
Couldn't get to Harvard, hard work, he hard whipped
Cause them hardy hah's and hard nights
Are hard to live through
When you hopeless
What we gotta do to be winnin'?
Cause all the schools gettin' closed
Dribble a little, coach, shootin' at a foe
Cause they chargin' them to hoop at community center
My nigga, hopeless
25 bands, he was shootin' not a damn givin'
Cousin threw a couple grand at some dancers
Throwin' back their fat ass, is my glasses confused?
We're the hopeless
America's dream and nightmare in the same being
Even when being polite here
Niggas try to bring me down, the life of a pioneer
Lightyears worth of hopeless
Celebrities celebratin' disgust me
The cerebellum invaded with all these fresh things on
Watchin' ""Love and Hip Hop : Atlanta"" as we speak

Okay, the Steebie show is on
And so my broad rollin' weed now she's mad at me
Cause she seen a scene with Rasheeda baby father
Said, ""You niggas all hopeless""

Fallin' out with my friends again, but it make no difference to me

Got no gas in my tank again, but it make no difference to me
Overdraft at the bank again, but it make no difference to me

Prolly go back in a minute, ain't shit here

Thoughts are ravaging in the whole crib
Now he post-traumatic and always on the edge
On the pills, some bills, two kids, one leg
Nigga so hopeless
A lot of black cops always clap back
And some foul white cops always on deck
Playin' race card, guarantee you'll make a blackjack
Nigga so hopeless
Cause we ain't 'posed to ever have shit
And we ain't vocal as rap
Niggas cause we don't mope unless we trap hits
Nigga hopeless
Look at what I go through to show you
Niggas respect money, money respect power
And power, we never given unless
A nigga catch, shoot or dribble
We are hopeless
Nah you ain't out here for the culture
You finna riot, without a purpose
You ain't a mothafuckin' rider, you a fuckin' token, posin'

Of course not literal
But why complain about the man
When a nigga with my skin
The same problems with them I had
Is out there killin' niggas too?
Eat your food, nigga

Some get addicted to the fast route
The hand in hand, you know that cash route
I pray to God that we see better days
I caught a record while the record plays
I’m thinking Lord don’t let em carry me
See I know one day when they bury me
I’ll go straight to black heaven, black heaven
Yeah I go straight to black heaven, black heaven
Don’t let the paranoia get to me
Can’t take a trip to penitentiary
I make a flip and take the summer off
A half a brick? now that’s a summer salt
I look to God, it’s been along road
I got my braid up, like a cornrow
I've been through hell, one day I’ll find my way
If not then maybe I can buy my way to black heaven",Black Heaven,2015

For your eyes only, for your eyes only (for your eyes)
For your eyes only

Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long, the consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat
Her mama be stressing me like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it
Ain't got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes)
For your eyes only

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?

You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you're hearing this, unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you
In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God
But because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me
Maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related
Mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above, maintaining a time sheet
That slow money, picked up the family business
By the age of thirteen, six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking, what the fuck we naming this girl?
I told her Nina, the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes

It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated cause the cash running out
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See baby girl I realized, my definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your 
Father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your Daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

For your eyes
For your eyes only
For your eyes
For your eyes only
For your eyes do you understand, for your eyes

One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling
He said ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing
When times was hard I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your Momma nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects
I had to interject like, ""Nigga what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I've been having premonitions, just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow, like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said the only thing I'm proud to say I was a father
Write my story down and if I pass go play it for my daughter when she ready
And so I'm leaving you this record for your eyes only, don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think this segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means I would never be brought into this world 
'Cuz my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a 
White girl to take back to Jonesborough with
'Lil Zach and Cole World barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later making sure the story's told
Girl your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cos he was cold
Not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving O's
Nah your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cos he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed fuck the law, although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cuz he loved you""

Yeah, my intuition is telling me they'll be better days
I like this tone

Yeah, my intuition is telling me they'll be better days
I sit in silence and and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm in peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the father for forgiveness, God, I'm overwhelmed (Please God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if he's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, he'll never judge a man
Because he knows us all and therefore he would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother's life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry

Yeah, my chosen religion: Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt hoping to God He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I tell a nigga what to do?
I just apply this economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard nigga

Yeah, prodigal son
Got a new gun, this one
Don't run out of ammo lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star, and remain my self
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt I evolve
I no longer bury demons
I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches disrespecting dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, poor)

(I swear to God bruh)
We're gathered here today
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'mma kill them niggas man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you bro)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you bro, I'mma kill them niggas bro)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'mma kill them niggas myself)
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is, this is, beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from",Change,2016

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seen it come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party soft lips soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is than tell me if I'm wrong or right
If, I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, this the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights off

And put my number in it
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time
I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind is letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
I be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girls 100
And I want it, no question
I know destiny well and know I seen the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

Catching up on our shows, eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl with bananas and some almond milk

I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine

You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
And, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me
From letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself

Better than I know myself, well how about that?

I want you believe not only in me, but have some faith in yourself
I wish you peace and good health, happiness and some wealth

Can't you see it's a trap? The type of shit I think 'bout
I sensed they needed my help, that's why I had to reach out
What you think? I do it for my brothers under a spell
It's clear we living in hell, the life of a black male
Right out the womb you come out, and it's a bunch of blackmail
Just waiting for you to fail, a special room in the jail
With your name, a number on it so you property now

It's honestly a lot to bear
I play the game of stacking knowing that I ought to share
How much does a man need? How much can he hoard before his greed?
How can a rich father teach humbleness to his seed?
Just questions, the stubborn all get taught tough lessons

Justified it using Christianity would say
Religion don't mean shit, it's too much ego in the way
That's why ISIS is a crisis 
But in reality this country do the same shit
Take a life and call it righteous
Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly
In a hotel lobby after a show
Was noticing these white ladies watching CNN
Covering the action
They read the headline and then they all started clapping
As if Lebron has just scored a basket at the buzzer
I stood there for a second watch them high five each other
For real? I though this was thou shalt not kill
But police still letting off on niggas in the Ville
Claiming that he reached for a gun
They really think we dumb and got a death wish

Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus

Thinking bout the things I said I'd say when I would see him
Feeling nervous, sitting in a room full of white folks
Thinking about the black man plight, think I might choke, nope
Raised my hand and asked a man a question
'Does he see the struggles of his brothers in oppression?
And if so, if you got all the power in the clout as the president
What's keeping you from helping niggas out?'
Well I didn't say nigga, but you catch my drift
He look me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
He broke the issues down and showed me he was well aware
I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
But dawg you in the chair, what's the hold up?
He said there's things that I wanna fix
But you know this shit nigga, politics
Don't stop fighting and don't stop believing
You can make the world better for your kids before you leave it

Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart
See the people at the top, they get to do just what they want
'Til after while the people at the bottom finally get smart
Then they start to holla revolution, tired of living here, destitution
Fuck that looting, can you tell me what's the best solution?
I used to think it was to over throw oppressors
See, if we destroy the system that means we'll have less of greed
But see, it's not that simple
I got to thinking 'bout the history of human nature
While this instrumental, play
Then I realized something that made me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
Think about this shit for second, you heard the way
The children in abusive households grow up knocking girlfriends out cold
That's called a cycle
Abused becomes the abuser and that how life go
So understand
Look at the power, but you know what power does to man
Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
So when you talk about revolution dawg, I hear just what you saying

What good is taking over, when we know what you gon' do
The only real revolution happens right inside of you

Decade from now I might just buy the Mavericks

Expand your vocab
I'm giving out toe tags for no cash
All summer long plus three seasons after
Please CC a rapper, tell him meet me
It's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
The problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
I'm the answer on the low, I'm a cheat sheet for rappers
I came up 'round AC to DC adapters
Plug talk, what I'm really sayin' is a shame but my niggas move 'caine like HBCU Kappas
Whole town full of CC Sabathias
You think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack?
Not really
This is not the eighties, don't be silly
Now we push pills and sell heroin to Billy
Now Billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
How many black addicts that got caught up in the system
With no sob stories on your prime time television, I can smell a blatant contradiction

You plant a seed, it grows some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife

A little different when you haven't ate food
So I'ma leave it up to fate to make these decisions
And stick to my intentions
I did it for more of the passion, not the great checks
Knowin' that there's more than fat asses and great sex
Tryna be the man I ain't yet
But demons stuck on me like ashes on gray sweats
'Cause man I ain't made shit and I'm lackin' the patience

I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed

One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'

Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some
Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country 
And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house

On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses

To my nigga, I hope you listening
I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got perscription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got twelve slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way

'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself

Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons

When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach

I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell

All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame? My occuptation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had change
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot 
By brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, ""blaow, blaow!"", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, ""Don't forget me""
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that 
I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through

I put my head to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was

All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen? 
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and 
For us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time
And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world

And I find them true, amused, you in the booth with me

Can't spoil time on nickeling and diming
I got me a girl, she don't want no diamonds
A daily reminder to holler at God
Like where did you find her? Good looking, my nigga
Everything 'round me I took it
Did it with only the niggas I knew
And a few niggas I thought I knew better
There go my bitches, I always do better
But, you're more top echelon
My next probably be a step backwards
Niggas front when they get struck with love
Like in drama, they used to be the best actors
I'm done with all that tough acting
John Madden when I saw it happen, and so it happens
My niggas want life's good things, they still dreaming
And you deserve them too, I'ma do it just so it happens

They don't see the real me
They only know Cole, they only know Co-ole
I had to get back, I had to resort to turning my back
I'm doing just that, true that
I thought He was through with me, but that wasn't true
The proof? You in the coupe with me
God shuffled the cards, dealt me a hand with impossible odds
Put an obstacle course up
Look, and I conquered them all (conquered them all)
With minimal effort I'm fresher than sock in your drawer (fuck)
They spinning my records so heavy, I'm topping the Forbes
Stuck in a rock in a hard place though
Is it true what they say? The higher you go, the longer the fall?
Well I dropped to the floor then knocking the door was on queue
I thought that I saw it all 'til I saw you
Now I call you when the sun shines and the rain dries up
I'm a pit bull, but for you I be on chain tied up (one more time)
In the backyard with a muzzle on tail wagging like Oregon Trail
Waiting on you to come through just like you do, well

You and I will always be somewhere between
Sweet Trippy, I'm yours for the gettin'
Talkin' foolish, had the moon, I was gone, eighteen hunnid, sippin'

I can't get rid of you, all the places that I used to go and kick it
All this weight that I'm liftin', trippy

Without a space I could feel, in the words to define
Pick it up, if you will, heavy weight on my mind
Just a pretty brown thing with your head in the clouds
Why don't you slip the round thing in the palm of my hands
Up enough for the thrill, over over you spill
Open up, I could tell
I could see when it's real
And as soon as I grab a hold of ya, I'ma have to let go of ya

Came down the block, somethin' sick, but it's rented
I don't give a fuck, bitch, either way, I'm in it
I ain't gotta prove to you that I got bread
Niggas talkin' money but broker than the bed 
That I slept on back in Mohammed crib
'Member fuckin' hoes leanin' all the left
Don't know why they rocked wit' a nigga, but they did
Damn sure wasn't the money, maybe it's the kid?
Used to have a honey that we loved when we was young but 
Somehow got disconnected before Facebook got so big
I used to search her name hopin' we could reconnect
But if I sent the message, would she still be on my dick?
When I couldn't find her, had me feelin' mad lame
Maybe she got married and she changed her last name
Maybe she just ain't up on the latest of the internet and ain't got into that
But give her time, that'll change
Bingo, what do you know?
Years later, late night after a show we here later
Brown skin, love how it glow, your hair tighter
Ask, ""Is it cool if I smoke?"" Go 'head, light up
High from your fragrance, I love, you smell purrty
Know I got it straight from the mud, my nails dirty
If somehow we both loose touch, I won't lie
Ya got me open way too much, I'm gon' find ya

We should be lost in the deep end, like water to a fish scale
Why don't I just swim?

I can't get rid of you, all the places that I used to go and kick it
All this weight that I'm liftin', trippy

She said ""I have some prime-time skill that you need to tap""
I never met a girl
So I front with it
So I took it to crib
Sparked a blunt with it
Hit it
It was the bomb
(? on cloud 69)
But all of a sudden she start flippin' and scrip talkin'
Like what have you done for me lately
Like she hate me
I wasn't no romance without the ends
She had me drivin' and stealin' and illin'
Just to hit the skins
I was open
You could drive a bus up my nose
My friends tell me 
I shouldn't mess with these type of hoes

[Chorus:]
Lady Heroin, you know you diss all that
Yo it's the bomb baby
You got me hooked like crack
Got me dealin' over back, 
'Cause it's the tap that cap
I used to be like a mack
Now I don't know how to act

(Snoop sample: The pussy was the bomb 
 had a nigga on sprung. I was)
Shootin' up.
That's that shit in my bloodstream

(Snoop sample: The pussy was the bomb
Had a nigga on sprung. I was)
Shootin' up
That's that shit in my bloodstream

Even dough I'm a fiend
I can't break clean
'Cause everything so supreme
When she's on the scene
And can't nobody tell me bout my boo
I wore a tattoo
Track marks on my arm, black and blue
But she didn't feel the same for me
She had a jealous boyfriend by the name of O.D.
Now O.D. was short for Over Dose
And whenever he got caught
Niggas pushin' on his girl
He made her comatose
Lady heroin had me thinkin'
I could get toe to toe with O.D.
But he showed me
Damn my nigga told me
(Told you what?)
Not to mess around
When I had to clown
And now it did me a six foot ditch in the ground
So take it from me, yo
The negro
With a tab on his toe
I'm tellin' ya not get with that ho
The most scariest female 
Once you're under her spell
She crosses your bucksells
And send you on a highway to hell

[Chorus:]


[The Lady Of Rage]
I'm off in your bloodstream
Snatching your cream
Can't get enough to me
You's fiend to the extreme
A nightmare but not a dream
Realer than real
State once I penetrate you mind state 
Ya never get ya scrilla straight
I'm on a mission to invade your soul
Open up your brains and let me take control
I would be under when I had a love like this
Made you steal and kill for me baby with just one kiss
I could sentence you to die
In the blink of an eye
Of a needle
I think you evil on the sly
My supply
Non-stop, skin pop until you drop
Blood watch drippin' out your snotbox
I got your brain locked
Hash lady in the hot spot
Black widow
Stick my tooth in 'em
And check 'em with that China White venom
Than I mo' fill 'em
Swimmin' in that bloodstream
Gotcha
Now you a fiend from lady heroin

J. Flexx,"(Here we are in this day and age still loyal to the state of confusion. Why
is it only tragedy when harmony unites the people of this nation. We must
learn to break this cycle of hate and disrespect among our brothers and
sisters and we must stop asking the question: why? Start spreading the
message of one love)

[Verse 1: J.Flexx]
My heroes catchin 3 or 4 through they corridor
They blast on em, hit the gas on em, last call
A bullet make a life shatter like a glass jaw
Look like the devil gettin just what he axe for when the gas draw
They want to blame it on the gangs but it's a bigger picture
'cause why we're steady dyin somebody gettin richer
Listen to what I'm spittin, who you think benefittin
while all these heads splittin they money-gettin
See the gangbangin ain't all about the red and blue
'cause some many's corporations is gangstas too
They rub you out in a minute gettin greedier and greedier
Buyin out major labels and pimpin the media
Orchestratin beef between the west and east
Kill a superstar, blow up his next release
We got to put them straps down 'cause if you let them stay dead
Every death in black America is gang related
Yeah

[Chorus:]
A change is gonna come to our lives (A change to come)
I'm not sayin it's wrong (A change to come)
We've reached a point and we have to decide (A change to come)
if we should go on (A change to come)

[Verse 2: Tenkamenin]
I'm fallin from the heavens screamin out ""Lord please!
Let me go so I can check up on my younger seeds""
To show em right so they won't reach these penetentiaries
'cause over the years that's what them folks want us to turn out to be, and
just release you
When I was young I wanted to be a thug
hang on the corner, smoke my weed and try to sell my drugs and show no love
In '97, all this had to change
So many murdered behind unnecessarily petty games, it's all a shame
Doin crimes as a past time
Tryin my best to stay alive is all that's on my mind
I hit my knees and drop my head between and ask the Lord
""Please let me make it through this struggle"" even though it's hard
Jealousy got us hatin it, wantin to kill each other though
What ever happened to the sayin that we are all bro's
Keep it up and best believe you, I will finally see it's gang related
So we best to let the killin cease, now rest in peace

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: J.Flexx]
Tell me how many Haiti bottles I gotta empty
before I wise up and stop lettin the devil tempt me
Usin materialism to jealousy to pimp me
Live by the gun, die by the gun, to put it simply it's gettin shady
They got me mad like rabies, headed for Haiti's
Sellin they soul for a Mercedes and fly ladies
All this dirt being done ain't gang related
We got to take our former glory why'all, reinstate it

(People are in trouble in America. As a matter of fact, people are in
trouble throughout the Earth. We have returned into a force of death and
destruction on ourselves. We were never meant to be trapped in this
darkness, but there's always light in the midst of the darkness if you know
where to find it. Nothin is impossible. If you know who you were you
wouldn't want to be anything but who you are. We have one change but one
cause and that's to frown one love)

The Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good,
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.

We were out on a date in my daddy's car.
We hadn't driven very far.
There in the road, straight ahead ...

I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right.
Never forget the sound that night ...

The painful scream that I heard last.

I really didn't care
I had already gone too far
To let them steal my share

So, like a fool I took 'em on
And as my anger cool
I realized I could take all mine
And skip off with theirs, too

I know I must be crazy
I'm bound to wake up dead

Somebody, somebody
Waitin' outside my back door
Somebody, somebody
Tryin' to even up the score

I figured I should lay real low
And stayed away from town
I covered up all my moves
So, it'd be hard to track me down

But I started gettin' shaky
And I paced around the floor
Hiding out all alone
I couldn't take much more

Just sitting 'round here waitin'
Is drivin' me up the wall

Somebody, somebody
Waitin' outside my back door
Somebody, somebody
Tryin' to even up the score

So, I called up my old friend Marlene
Who was lookin' for some fun
I got drunk and like a fool
I told her, what I'd done

I heard them knockin' at my door
They got to me at last
It don't take much to figure out
How they'd found me out so fast

And when I looked for my Marlene
I saw that she was gone

Somebody, somebody
Waitin' outside my back door

J. Geils Band,"This is the story of a young couple in Portland, Maine

While waiting for her husband Don
To return home from work, she reaches for a can of anchovies
As she spreads the tiny fish across a piece of lettuce
She notices a small note at the bottom of the can
Written on it is a telephone number

Curious, she dials, and is told, ""Don't move, lady, we'll be right over""
Placing the phone back on the hook, she turns
To see three smartly dressed men standing in her kitchen doorway
Before she realizes what is happening to her
She is rolled tightly in long sheets of cellophane
Transported to an international airport and placed on a waiting jet-liner
All this being too much for her to comprehend, she passes out

Upon awakening, she finds herself in a strange, foreign speaking nation
'Dalas nekcihc dna tihs nekcihc neewteb
Ecnereffid eht wonk ot suineg a ekat t'nseod ti'
Alone, fearing her escape impossible
She seeks comfort in the arms of a confidential agent

With the trace of her kiss still warm upon his lips
He betrays her to the hands of three scientists
Who are engaged in diabolical, avant-garde experiments previously
Performed only on insects and other small, meaningless creatures
Using her as their subject, they are delighted with the results
For the first time, a human being is transformed into a, shh, top secret

Meanwhile, back in Portland, Maine

Her husband Don, now chain-smoking 40 packs of cigarettes a day
Sits at a local bar and has a few beers with the regulars
Bored, everyone's attention turns to the television set
That just hangs from the wall, welcome to bowling for dollars

Suddenly, crazy Al says
""S-say, Don, there sure is something familiar about that bowling ball""
To which the terrified Don replies
""Oh my God! That bowling ball, it's my wife!""

And the lesson we learn from this story is
Next time you place your order
don't forget to say, ""No anchovies please""","No Anchovies, Please",1980

J. Geils Band,"Mad dog in the hallway and my head is filled with fire
Panic rules the moment with no mercy or desire
Ran across the blackened sand to get a soft ice cream
And now my mouth is burning crimson in a long and bloody dream
Sometimes I wonder 'bout these physical disorders
My only contact is with TV news distorters

Glancing over quickly at the words from brain to pen
All that I can tell you,  I'm insane, insane again
Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax, relax

Puppets with directions they whisper in my ears
Circled stairs around me drip with long forgotten tears
Nothing done without a motive, proving they were smart
Every path they traced for me another kind of chart
Corporate Christie says it all the meeting is a-twist
My pulse is fading quickly you can feel it on my wrist

Glancing over quickly at the words from brain to pen
All that I can tell you,  I'm insane, insane again
Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax, relax

I need some breathing room
I need some breathing room
I need some breathing room
I need some breathing room

Shrink rap, clap trap, mind bend, echo send
Chicken coop, drug soup, nerve food, solitude
Back track, meat rack, cardiac, yakety, yakety, yak

Breathing room, I need some breathing room
Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax, relax

Mama, won't you tell me please, please what is goin' on?
I have seen with madhouse vision
No conclusions can be drawn
My mind is inside out and all the clarity is gone

Glancing over quickly at the words from brain to pen

Out on Chesapeake Bay 
With her white patent boots
And her blouse red lame

A table top dancer
She would smile on cue
Oh those lips of an angel 
Angel in blue

She'd been dancin for ages
Through cities of bars
She was kickin' the habit 
Of scoring in cars

She'd been drained of her spirit
All caged up in this zoo
A wild cat angel
Angel in blue

And as she stared out into nowhere
I thought yes I thought she might break down and cry 
Oh when I whispered I thought I could love her

She just said, ""Baby don't even bother to try""
And I watched as she spoke
Her words chilled my bones
All her friends did her favors

That were really just loans
And she never had dreams
So they never came true
Oh the palest of angels
Angel in blue

And the bees they had stung her
The birds they had flown
There were guys she could number
But none had she known

And she never had dreams 
So they never came true

Some fellas look at the nose

I don't care if her eyes are red
I don't care if her nose is long
I don't care if she's underfed
I don't care if her clothes are worn
First I look at the purse!
Some fellas like the smiles they wear
Some fellas like the legs that's all
Some fellas like the style of their hair
Want their waist to be small.
I don't care if their legs are thin
I don't care if their teeth are big
I don't care if their hair's a wig
Why waste time lookin' at the waistline?
First I look at the purse!
A woman can be fat as can be,
kisses sweet as honey
But that don't mean a thing to me
If you ain't got no money
If the purse is fat....that's where it's at.
Some fellas like the way they walk
The way they swing and sway
Some fellas like the way they talk
Dig the things they say.
I don't care if they wobble like a...
or talk with a lisp
I still think I'm a good lover
if the dollar bills are crisp

J. Holiday,"Don't choke on that, homeboy, blow it out
Don't sip on that drink, pour a little out
Let your life reflect what comes outta your mouth
And never pull out your piece unless you dumpin' out

Never fear no man but know when to run
Leave no man standin' till the battle is won
And when it's gettin' real good, better pull it out
When niggas front, don't give up, my brother, sweat it out

And don't smoke what you don't roll up
And act right if you know you can't fight
Take a test if you're unsure if it's yours
There's a one percent chance that it might be another man's

And we know the life we been livin', that one day we might fall
And the only choices we give is got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, He's got love for us all
Still we're livin' these thug, these thug commandments

Stop cuffin' that young girl, let her breathe
Be a father to your kids, not hell disease
No doo-rags in the Lord's house
Trust in the Lord, but keep a glock in your house

When you talkin' to a man, look him dead in his eye
Never get high, come on on your own supply
Gotta think fast, stash your little cash
Watch them snake niggas, they slither in the grass

And don't smoke what you don't roll up
And act right if you know you can't fight
Take a test if you're unsure if it's yours
There's a one percent chance because it might be another man's

And we know the life we been livin', that one day we might fall
And the only choices we give is got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, He's got love for us all
Still we're livin' these thug, these thug commandments

We fall down but we get up
We sell out and we reap up
And we keep watch from the roof tops for the cops
Hive snitches, tap telephone switches

And we get paid but we won't sell
Right back slang, new story to tell
Goes around and 'round like [Incomprehensible]
And never changes, that's all the game is

And we know the life we been livin', that one day we might fall
And the only choices we give is got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, He's got love for us all
Still we're livin' these thug, these thug commandments

We fall down but we get up
We sell out and we reap up
And we keep watch from the roof tops for the cops
Hive snitches, tap telephone switches

And we get paid but we won't sell

Goes around and 'round like [Incomprehensible]

And I can't wait for shorty to come through
From your lips and back up to your eyes
My hands on your hips when we grind
I'm fantasizin' 'bout what I'm gon' do to you

Got me fiendin' for her love, can't lie
Man, you should see how she got me
Spendin' all this time with her
And I couldn't leave her if I wanted to
Her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do

'Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

Whenever we up in this bed
And my fingers all in your hair
I wonder if you feel me watchin' you
'Cause I can't go a night without your lovin'
Got me lookin' at this phone
Every time it rings, I hope it's you, girl

Got me bracin' for your love
And I've fallen for you, I can't lie
I just wanna be with you
And yes, she got me there, I said it
Somebody call the paramedics
Tell 'em to hurry up and come through

'Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me

I can't go a day without you

J. Holiday,"I wanna be a little bit more like, like laid back
See, y'all do is cool but me homie, I'm calmer
Like what surround her neck? I charmed her
Me I milked the cow, I'm a farmer

Her guards up but I removed the armor
You just seem to be the part of the problem
Introducin' me, the solution
I rocked it just like I'm from Houston

No, not the ball playa, more like the mall playa
Soon as I touch down, I shut down the store playa
Look, I'm already on playa
See, I'm like the stars in the sky early morn' playa

So just listen to the song
So we could end all back and forth like Ping Pong
She is my queen that makes me King Kong
I'm the leader of the jungle dog
Ain't nothin' left to say but, hey I'm the bong

Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC
She's all meant to me like the wrist and the bracelet
And I ain't need no one of she, she's beggin' me to chase it
Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC

Lets just say that we slid off
Gallardo spider so we can take the lid off
She just made that jump like Cris Cross
Right in the passenger side you pissed off

Ain't my fault I just handle my biz
You can't handle your wiz, so it is
What it's gonna be? I'm in the sun sittin' under palm trees
Lookin' life big

I won't hate, I'll just tell her how it is
If I show you how I live, you would think I was hidin'
And mic is my Trident, I'm Poseidon
And she is my Afro deity, stop lyin'

You not as fly as I'm
And some say I'm the flyest plane on the runway
Some day I would be the one day called king
And till that time your girlfriend can call me

Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC
She's all meant to me like the wrist and the bracelet
And I ain't need no one of she, she's beggin' me to chase it
So don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC

I didn't come here to brag
No amount of money could match with my swag
You know I got wrapped in the bag
Livin' in the past
And I'm the future do, all washed up like the Guadalupe

Your own home team won't root for you
And that's 'coz they look for me
So truthfully as truly yours
Your girlfriends favorite MC

Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC
She's all meant to me like the wrist and the bracelet
And I ain't need no one of she, she's beggin' me to chase it
So don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC

Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC
She's all meant to me like the wrist and the bracelet
And I ain't need no one of she, she's beggin' me to chase it
So don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC

Fresh off the runway pale white nik's,
Phantom top drop on that I-95
Pink see us suckas' who but I?
I'm on my way to party at Corut NY
Now I ain't gotta tell you that them boys pop bottles,
And mami's lookin' like Americas top mode
She said ya earring, look at that thing
That's even bigger then the rock on my ring
Now she's got a man, plays for the hawks.
I'm like come on ma you know me run New York
J's in the background put you to bed
Says she's got brains so I'm lookin' ahead
And I'm lookin' for bread, I gotta eat on these streets
Shit 17-5 bout 2 holla at Gs
I'm a real nigga, real niggas do real things
And I can keep a secret it's the song that I sing

Baby I
I, wont, wont, tell, tell
If you don't want me to
Cause I got a thing for you
And I'd do anything for you, girl anything
Baby I, I, wont, wont, tell, tell
I'd never do that to you
Cause baby you got it and you got me,

A material girl in a material world,
Venus, Serena, my cereal girls
What you know about havin' dinner on a jet?
Make it back before the D-J's finished with his set,
Now they call me the Birdman
When the doors ajar
Ghost ride the whip like I'm from Oakland y'all
It's the crack man and he ain't got a shot, the don,
The wrist is Jacob earring chapard
When the chows for chows out
Know it's the same thing
Bills so high, they throwin' the champagne
I'ma real nigga, real niggas do real things
And I can keep a secret, it's the song that I sing

Baby I

Cause baby you got it and you got me,

Millionaire frames, perrir rocks
Everyday a different chain nigga get ya gear up
Name another fat guy fly like me
And get you right laid pie all night like me
Call you fruity pebbles cause you got so many spy bags purple ones,
Yellow ones, sky blue the white bag
Hermes shit where ever you lay your eyes at
Red card, black card, I could buy that

Shorty she know the game
She said she love the chase
Im trying hard to bag her, but she love the wait
Never half, she rather give in wholes
Please part'on my French, but she give me good blow
In return I give her dough
When she see me give n go
Other dealers give me out,
But for me she gives me mo'
Cause its never stepped or cut up or chopped down
But to get it is a risk,
I can't get locked down
Since the hit so good, I'm left fieding for a fix
Heard she got some new shit
So I gotta move quick
She's like,
You're dealing with a mind of a hustla
I'm like,
Fine I'm your #1 customer

She is my heroine, get me high like heroin, love
Forgive me for my sins
I just keep giving in
To what I call fatal love
Caught up by the way of drugs
But,
Some don't get it
It's so addictive
This relationship, so vindictive
First I love it, then I hate it when it's gone
Can't settle for no dirt
I need it in its purest form
To perform
I'm searching for my hustla,
And in return
Shawty I can be your customer

[Chorus]

Look,
I can't let this addiction get the best of me (oh noo)
Physically, she's taking me to ecstasy
My highest point is taking away every breath
To the point of no return
Til' there ain't nothing left
What's next? 12 steps
Since the bond we had
Provide me with the proof that I belong in rehab
Cold sweats
Night and day
I just can't relax
Breath in, breath out
Relax

In the doorway
About to leave me for good this time

Handing me my chain

I got her for our two years
She said there's nothing left to do here
There's no more love
I'm leaving you here
And she turned away
And I see two years fall to the ground

I'm saying don't go
Cause you make sleeping difficult
You make it difficult for me
Don't go
And you make eating difficult
You make it difficult for me
Don't go
It's almost impossible
Almost impossible to breathe
Don't go
Cause you make living difficult
When you're not here with me

And I can tell that deep in her heart
She would like to stay
Because she loves me
And she knows that I love her too
She just hates the way I get neglectful
And some times a little disrespectful
In front of my friends
Baby don't let go
Cause all that I need is you (You)
So as a fool

She has no job, no home, no family
And she barely has the chance to even eat
So she begs, and steals, and sells her body

Sometimes she may come off a little strong
But she's just on her own
But is it was you
What would you do
If you didn't have a home

If you didn't have a pot to piss in
Didn't have a kitchen
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends
Imagine if you was homeless
Sometimes you should just look at your life
And imagine if it was you
Just imagine if it was you

There's a man, on the street
He's got holes in his shoes, on his feet
We be in the club spending doe
Then we'd come outside and tell him no
All he needs is a couple bucks
He's got a little change but it's not enough
We turn our backs and laugh
But we stop in our tracks
And turn the other way, because we got it made
Sometimes we make 'em up
Just a little strong
But he's on his own

If you didn't have a pot to piss in

Got a black president but there's people outside
I know you've seen 'em and we all done passed 'em
Some people seen some shit last night
Still got 'em laughing

Wake up and turn this hatred around.
Racial insanity, trafficking of slaves.
These crimes you will take to your graves.
Your souls are like one another;
Your veins are similar in colour.
This land wasn't yours to keep,
So listen now and hear me speak:

The stars look down and witness.
Erase the spreading sickness.

You can't see it with your eyes because they are rolling back.
You're about to have a heart attack.
Human depravity, suffering and torture.
Co-existence maimed at the slaughter.
Your souls are like one another;
Your veins are similar in colour.
This land wasn't yours to keep.
Wake up fools from your ignorant sleep.

Erase the spreading sickness.
You're so far gone that you can't see
Your place in hell is guaranteed.

Separation now leaves you to sink and slowly drown.
Unmarked graves for those who have disgraced our name.
Devastate? Eradicate? The human race is the same in every way.

I stand tall, feet firmly planted on the solid ground.
Separation now leaves you to sink and slowly drown.

Separation will never advance us.
Discriminate, you will never rebuild trust.
We're born the same over time. Your open mind changed.
We're all brothers, so you need to look upon others in the same light.
Just 'cause you're white doesn't mean you can excuse this ignorant fight.
And the same if you're black no racist attack is justified.
Supremacy, just a lie.

Does it matter about the colour of skin?
Stop wasting your time.You're fighting a fight that you won't win.
Diminish this ignorance and get a grip. Settle in.
You're controlled by the hype, abusive and threatening
Towards another brother that wants to be here and fit in.
Grown up around mixed-race kids, we see no difference,
So why discriminate him? Hatred based on appearance.
You need to erase this spreading sickness.

Lift my hands to honor You because Your word is true

Knowing that you died to set me free

Mutta ota tämä laulu
Tästä tuli vähän sellainen

Jotkut menee sekaisin rock'n'roll-musiikista
Jotkut menee sekaisin alkoholista
Hei beibi

Menen sekaisin sinusta

Vielä kerran sekoitat minut
Vielä kerran sinä saat minut sekaisin
Menen sekaisin",Sekaisin,
J. Karjalainen,"Ystävät mua kuunnelkaa
Ja mukanakin laulaa saa
Kun kerron teille pienen tarinan
Tää on laulu Laura Häkkisen
Ja silmien niin sinisten
Oli juhannus ja siitä aloitan

Mä ikkunasta hänet näin
Kun keikkabussiin hetkeks jäin
Tää juttu sattui Järvilavalla
Hän seisoi ihan yksinään
Laiturilla mietteissään
Mikä juhla se on sillä tavalla

Mä menin päähän laiturin
Ja hyvät jussit toivotin
Hän kasvonsa käänsi minuun päin
Silloin näin mä kirkkauden
Jota olevankaan tiennyt en
Ja kouristuksen tunsin syömmessäin

Hän oli kaunis kaunis niin
Mun silmät peittyy kyyneliin
Aina kun mä häntä aattelen
Niin sinisinä järven veet
Ei ole koskaan loistaneet
Kun loisti silmät Laura Häkkisen

Ei minua hän tuntenut
Eikä oikein uskonut
Kun sanoin että soitan bändissä
Mä sanoin ""Soitan kumminkin
Beibi menen sekaisin""
Hän sanoi ""Taidat olla kännissä""

En ollut enää ollenkaan
Olin tokkurassa muuten vaan
Mulle riitti loiste silmien
""Nähdään päässä laiturin
keikan jälkeen"" ehdotin
""Nähdään vaan"" hän sanoi hymyillen

Hän oli kaunis kaunis niin
Mun silmät peittyy kyyneliin
Aina kun mä häntä aattelen
Niin sinisinä järven veet
Ei ole koskaan loistaneet
Kun loisti silmät Laura Häkkisen

Keikka alkoi yks ja kaks
Eikä tullut paljon kummemmaks
Onneks se loppui lyhyeen
Sinisilmääni mietin vain
Mä katseellani häntä hain
Pian tahdoin hänet nähdä uudelleen

Mä jengin läpi kiirehdin
Takas päähän laiturin
Ja odottelin sydän pamppaillen
Siihen tuli jotain porukkaa
Nimmareita jaagaamaan
Mut ei koskaan Laura Häkkinen

Mä olin epätoivoinen
Mä etsin alta koivujen
Mä pyörin eessä nakkikojujen
Mä siinä melkein turpaan sain
Kun tyttöäni turhaan hain
Ja varkain valkes aamu kesäinen

Hän oli kaunis kaunis niin
Mun silmät peittyy kyyneliin
Aina kun mä häntä aattelen
Niin sinisinä järven veet
Ei ole koskaan loistaneet
Kun loisti silmät Laura Häkkisen

Stade sanoi ""Lähdetään""
Mä sanoin ""Menkää, tänne jään""
Ja istuin takas päähän laiturin
""Mä en lähde minnekään
Mul on juttu meneillään""
No Stade sano ""Mä poltan Camelin""

Silloin vanha järkkäri
Näki minun hätäni
""Arvaan ketä ootat"" alkoi hän
Kylmä karsi ruumistain
Kun kertomuksen kuulla sain
Näin miehen kyyneliään pyyhkivän

Oli siitä vuotta kymmenen
Kun järveen kesken tanssien
Hukkui nuori Laura Häkkinen
Sen jälkeen joka juhannus
Näin loppuu tämä kertomus
Nähty oli loiste silmien

Hän oli kaunis kaunis niin
Mun silmät peittyy kyyneliin
Aina kun mä häntä aattelen
Niin sinisinä järven veet
Ei ole koskaan loistaneet
Kun loisti silmät Laura Häkkisen

Hän oli kaunis kaunis niin
Mun silmät peittyy kyyneliin

 Finding your love I've found my adventure 
 Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster 
 All that I want in all of this world is you

 You are the promised kiss of springtime 
 That makes the lonely winter seem long 
 You are the breathless hush of evening 
 That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
 You are the angel glow that lights a star

 And some day I'll know that moment divine

Has left her old companions and faded from view

Lonely men with lonely eyes are seeking her in vain
Her streets are where they were, but there's no sign of her

She has left the Seine

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street caf‚

The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

I'll think of happy hours, and people who shared them
Old women, selling flowers, in markets at dawn

Children who applauded, Punch and Judy in the park
And those who danced at night and kept our Paris bright

'til the town went dark.",The Last Time I Saw Paris,1996

Till I see the brightness in every pot and pan

Whenever a cloud appears in the blue
Remember somewhere the sun is shining
And so the right thing to do is make it shine for you

A heart full of joy and gladness
Will always banish sadness and strife
So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life

So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life

My true love was true

Something here inside cannot be denied 

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
Oh, when your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride

Oh, so I smile and say

J. Lawrence Cook,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Backyard,1978

It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy

'cause my heart belongs to Daddy.

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more

I lie here beside you, just watching you sleep, 
And sometimes I whisper, what I`m thinking of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
Sometimes in the evening, when you do not see, 
I study the small things, you do constantly, 
I memorize moments, that I`m fondest of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
In only a moment, we both will be old, 
We won`t even notice the world turning cold. 
And so, in this moment, with sunlight above, 
My cup runneth over with love . . .

because these fools who be sliding on tracks, braggin' they nice
headz screamin' they need it, but do you really want hardcore?
Stakes is High like De La, plus i'm fiending to start more

[Starang]
Trouble on the double, yet cooler than any hooligan
frontin' on the mic nigga, who you think you foolin' with?
y'all be on the mic kickin' nothing but that nonsense
nigga please, ease back my crew been the bomb since

Tell me to maintain and keep doin' my thang
keep my dick in my pants, and just stack the green
shorties can't be coniving, had to flip about warning
now you in a cell tryin' to post bail by mornin'

but on the contrair, if I smoked an ounce a day
it'll only make a mess when I bounce this way

The jail scene ain't workin' no more, got me punchin' a wall
fam put a block on the phone, won't accept collect calls
and to top it all off, heard my co-defendant turned canary
stutter steeping through the house lookin' all scary
I'm just waiting to face him in the mess hall
thinkin' 'bout the Tyson loss, gettin' my reps off

don't even write scripts, that's the ohkeedoke shit

Niggas say Starang's smooth, just like ice without cube
I'm nice without dudes, on my motherfuckin' track
niggas call me Starang, others call me Jack
but if you call and I'm not home, you can call me back
but no matter where i'm at, I always rock the show
the niggas next up on the mic, y'all niggas gots to go
Phantom of the Opera, yo I blow scenes North, South, East
West, fuck your chest dukes, get it out your mouthpiece

(I was) laid back sippin' Beck's, gently cleaning off a black Tek
JP's cuban link got my neck laced (shine baby)
steal the show like a thief, blow without a trace
see so many wannabe's steadily tryin' to be me
act grimy, crimies constantly scheme how to fi me
out to get the bonus, becoming assed out like the homeless
no disresepct intended, but it's a fucked up world we live in

My lust for hip hop got me strivin' for perfection
and when my inner glow shine, you vision my reflection
and now chumps had to get a closer glimpse at it
as sweat trickle down your face, you break into a panic

A l'entrée ça refoule, on n'accepte pas les fêtards
Accompagné, faut l'être si tu veux danser
Le physio qu'est à la porte ne parle pas un mot français
2m10, un clando, un beau morceau

Mais ce soir, c'est sûr qu'il y aura de beaux morceaux
Dans les poches plein de biftons de quoi m'amuser
Prendre la bouteille, étalé sur un canapé
Veste enroulée autour du bras, tout le monde est sur la piste
Petits pas synchronisés qu'on a répété à dix
Moi et mes complices sur la même longueur d'ondes
J'ai déjà choisi ma go
Et pour mon pote j'ai repéré une blonde
Y a du monde dans la salle, les as en Lacoste
Le DJ a ses platines, sa mixette et son vieux poste
Tu sais nos beaux délires on ne les a pas oubliés
Des bonnes soirées y en n'a pas des milliers

Entre jackpots, on donne ça à l'ancienne
Comme au bon vieux temps pour nos potes et ceux qui traînent avec nous
Si tu te rappelles du tube du ghetto
Pour nos jackpots, pour nos jackpots, gros

J'ouvre mon armoire je prends une chemise même pas repassée
Je regarde dans la glace et je me dis c'est déclassé
A cet heure-ci, à l'entrée ça doit se tasser
Oh calmez-vous
Alors je rase ma barbe de 2 semaines, je suis pas pressé
Ça devrait passer même si j'ai les yeux cassés
Et même si je suis avec 8, 9 disjonctés
On cache nos armes dans le buisson
Ma gueule se marie bien avec le son
Hey garçon, c'est pour moi l'addition
On a dansé comme des tarés, je suis essoufflé
Pour me rafraîchir je vais au bar pour consommer
Accoudé sur le comptoir, les lunettes Cartier baissées
Je remarque que tous mes potes venaient juste d'arriver
Et la je lève mon verre de coca, je picole pas
Je porte un toast à tous mes frères d’Afrique et c'est comme ça
Vu l'ambiance, fallait du cran pour stopper la sono
On rentrera à la cite à l'heure du premier métro

Entre jackpots on donne ça à l'ancienne
Comme au bon vieux temps pour nos potes et ceux qui traînent avec nous
Si tu te rappelles du tube du ghetto
Pour nos jackpots, pour nos jackpots, gros

Je suis dans l'arrière salle du cote official
Faut toujours être optimal avec mon petit verre de sky
Et me laisse aller sur un son de Georges Benson
Les stomboscopes font briller mes Jean Marie Weston
A l'ancienne je fais un petit tour sur moi-même
Dans la foulée repère une jolie demoiselle
Toutes les femmes ce soir se sont fait belles
Sans aucun doute je mets mon petit grain de sel
N'abuse pas sur la boisson je t'en prie fais pas le con
Hey baisse d'un ton, tu sais à qui t'as affaire tonton
Je suis avec Jeannot Mandjack adossé à un poteau
Ce soir c'est relax je suis avec mes jackpots
Ici c'est timal je suis avec ap dans l'arrière salle
Montez tous dans le golf et dans 5 minutes on remballe
Et tetkal ce soir c'est festival

Juste un instant que je mette sur le toit la grosse malle bleue
Nombreux comme une équipe de foot, voitures à ras du sol
On est les derniers locataires qui décollent
Le plein de gas-oil et de gazouz pour pas flancher
Bilel va pisser le temps que je fasse mon petit marché
Direction le port, deux jours pied sur le plancher
Jusqu'à Marseille avec la voiture un peu penchée
Plus 24 heures de bateau, je sais c'est pas un cadeau
Mais qu'est-ce que je vais kiffer sur la place Guideau
A Bejaïa City du haut de ma montagne
Avant de rentrer feudar, je fais un petit tour par Oran
Vu qu'à Paris j'ai dévalisé tout Tati
Je vais rassasier tout le village même les plus petits
Du tissu et des bijoux pour les jeunes mariés
Et des jouets en pagaille pour les nouveaux-nés

On parle de tout et de rien, des Nike Air aux visas
De la traversée du désert au bon couscous de Yéma
Et mon cousin me dit, ""Karim te kiifeut eul zeut la?""
Il était tellement bon que j'ai jeté mon cirage en ras
Avec 2, 3 blédards on tape la discussion
Mahmoud ne peut pas s'empêcher de dire que je suis dans la chanson
L'un d'eux me dit ""Moi je t'ai pas vu fi télévision""
Et l'autre me demande ""Sarra teurlof Mickaël Jackson""
Ils me parlent trop vite et en argot de blédard
Je sais ce qu'ils feraient pour une poignée de dinars connard
Pour une poignée de dinars connard je baiserais ta sœur

Et si j'avais assez d'oseille je ramènerais tout le monde
Mais je peux pas fermer les yeux sur ce qui se passe vraiment

Content de revoir mes poto et ma chebba

J. Mi Sissoko,"Parfois, j'arrive plus à écrire, y a rien qui m'inspire, 
Pourtant dans cette vie de dingue, j'ai tellement de choses à dire. 
J'ai du mal, à exprimer, tout ce temps passé à trimer,
Fils d'immigrés ouvriers, familles modestes opprimées. 
(Parfois) je glande avec les jeunes de ma bande,
Y a rien à gratter, à part tes couilles quand le matin tu bande. 
Des fois, je vais au billard, avec une bombe au cinéma,
Je vais tirer au stand, avec Nardo et Tima. 
Quand je me sens bien impossible de faire du sur-place,
Pas de drogue, ni d'alcool, tu ressens les minutes qui passent. 
Parfois, j'ai plus de sous, rien que je gamberge,
J'ai des problèmes, tout le long de ma poche, c'est l'hôtel qui m'héberge. 
Des fois ça va mal je maigris, y a de quoi devenir barge.
Parfois même je me perds les plombs, je prend le large. 
Je vais au sport, je me vide.
Des fois, je suis tout froid, timide, parfois, je suis chaud bouillant, tout speed. 

Parfois, des fois, selon l'humeur du jour l'état du moral, 
Qu'arrive le bien ou le mal, j'essaye souvent de m'évader.

(Mais je perds le contrôle de mon cœur) 
 
Parfois, j'ai envie de rester seul, mon meilleur ami, c'est la solitude. 
Souvent je rêve de fortune. Des fois je regrette les études. 
Souvent je démarre au quart de tour, et aucun recours,
Je suis comme un fou, mais j'avoue parfois je me goure. 
Je fais des virées nocturnes, violant le code de la route,
Le son à cure, je vais à crêpe avant de me vider les burnes. 
Parfois, j'ai besoin d'une lope en express, une ouverture à chaque,
Comme dit Alix ""ça pète!"" 
Puis je décompresse, avec l'humour qui nous reste,
Pour ne serais-ce qu'un instant, évacuer le stress. 
(Des fois) j'ai le blues, je suis blasé,
Je met mon portable sur messagerie, j'ai plus envie de me raser. 
(Parfois) j'ai envie de me caser, de me casser,
Retourner dans mon pays, pour me décrasser, me purifier l'esprit.
Des fois je songe à arrêter le rap, d'éloigner tous ses mensonges, me mettre dans le deal. 
Une bonne fois pour toutes, j'y pense même quand je dîne.

Parfois, j'pense à mon père, je l'ai pas vu d'puis 83,
J'avais 6 piges, aujourd'hui, j'en ai 23. 
Des fois, y'a des embrouilles qui te tombe dessus, sois prêt à me jeter dedans, 
Quitte à laisser ta peau, une jambe un bras ou tes dents. 
Parfois, j'suis à pince et j'prend l'taxi. 
Des fois j'triche, j'récupère c'que l'état m'a taxé. 
Parfois, j'sort en boite, évite les sons à répète qu'on s'débecte, 
Les histoires à s'mettre en cavale, ou prendre la perpet'. 
J'aime bien danser, mais jamais dans l'excès. 
C'est pas pour t'vexer, j'rentre en basket là où t'as pas accès. 
Oton ouais, K'1 Fry Mafia, ouh wa. 
Des fois j'ai envie de foutre le darwah, bah ouais. 
Des fois j'vais faire vibrer l'studio, traumatise l'ingénieur. 
Des fois j'rêve d'avoir un fils d'l'appeler Housni junior, 
Avec une charmante demoiselle, tellement mignonne, bonne, 
Qu'un homosexuel craquerais sur elle, kifferait plus les bonhommes.

J. Mi Sissoko,"On a cette force de vivre, on lutte parce qu'il le faut, car on vient du ghetto
On mène une thug life mais on la vie par défaut, parce qu'on vient du ghetto
On garde la tête haute, on s'ra jamais soumis et on luttera jusqu'à demain
On a nos modes, nos codes, nos rêves, nos envies
Plus ils nous font mal et plus on est fort
On va chanter pour les jeunes des quartiers
Pour tous ceux qui restent fort

Ouais, parce qu'on vient du ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Ouais, parce qu'on vient du ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

Eh, j'dédie mon album à mon ghetto
Et j'dis que l'on peut faire rimer succès avec ghetto
Si ma plume réanime l'espoir du ghetto
C'est que plus que la frime c'qui m'anime c'est l'amour du ghetto
J'suis trop fier de venir du ghetto
Même si j'y ai souffert, j't'assure j'ai appris trop d'choses dans l'ghetto
Quand t'as survécu au ghetto
Tu peux faire face à c'monde car t'as l'intelligence du ghetto
N'écoutes pas tout c'qu'ils disent sur nos ghettos
La misère nous unis, ne nous divise dans le ghetto
En tout cas dans nos ghettos, malgré nos différences, on vit ensemble
Et tu n'vois ça que dans le ghetto

Yeah, j'suis construis mais t'inquiète j'suis ghetto
J'suis instruis mais pourtant j'viens du ghetto
J'suis ambitieux mais comme tous les mecs du ghetto
Généreux même avec peu, j'ai la mentalité du ghetto
Malgré la rage du ghetto
J'fais face au naufrage avec le courage du ghetto
Ma poésie vient du ghetto, s’élève du sol, s'envole et donne des ailes à mon ghetto
Ne parle pas que du pire quand tu parle de mon ghetto
Mais t'as pas le sourire de mon ghetto
Crimes, stups et violence, on l'sait c'est ghetto
Mais comme ça, t'as peu d'chances de sortir vivant du ghetto

Took a big chance and waved me home
I'm pretty sure the ball touched me

I should'a known better than to take that ride

He handed me that phone and said, “Sorry son”

That he had lived a good long life
And he had always fought the good fight

I knew what I had to do

When I was just a lad
Me father gave me nose a tweak
And told me I was bad
But then one day I learned a word
That saved me aching nose
The biggest word you ever heard
And this is how it goes

That this Gay-Z and Cockafella Records wanted beef
Started cocking up my weapon, slowly loading up this ammo
To explode it on a camel, and his soldiers, I can handle
This for dolo and it's manuscript, just sound stupid

Dick sucking lips, whyn't you let the late, great veteran live

(Lose) I prove you lost already

Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad, watching his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissing women
Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well life is hard, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was getting chased through your building
Calling my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was gave you a style for you to run with
Smiling in my face, glad to break bread with the god
Wearing Jaz chains, no tecs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hanging with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class
You Tae-bo hoe, trying to work it out, you tryna' get brolic?
Ask me if I'm trying to kick knowledge
Nah, I'm trying to kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rockafeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas?
Philly's hot rock fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you getting girls now 'cause of your looks?
Ne-gro please
You no mustache having, with whiskers like a rat
Compared to Beans you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hanging with Caine, to Herb, to Big
And, Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-riding fagot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons
Ha, R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick
Shaun Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick
So little shorty's getting gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is goin' come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss",Ether [Bonus Track] [*],2007

Verse One: Prodigy
Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
KnowhatI'mean? Have a situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse
for the cops to discover, while I be dippin in the Range Rover
All jeweled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryin to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low sippin Asti Spumante
Niggaz try to creep on the side of my jeep
Stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really yeah
but keep lettin them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours and your team's inferior
You want to bust caps I get, all up in your area
Kidnap your children make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got G's in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
Push back, the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
through the butter soft leather upholestry
But mostly, keep the gat closely, 'cause niggaz want to toast me

[Verse Two: Havoc]
Yo I gotta get mines, no matter what the con-sequences
Count up my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose

J. Period,"New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starving
Pushing cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me
""What you up to, the cops gon' bust you""
I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered
If God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Staring at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwing them bones
Hoping my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoeing
While he looking at centerfolds of pretty girls
Showing they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lying
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I want to crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezing
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, nobody leaving everybody

Some niggas fuck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas are dangerous, so don't test 'em
They make you, disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chilling
They had the coke game something crazy
Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or something
Took a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch them
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangstas, we lounging, out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas I got your back, the fools don't play""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See my cousin's in the game, thugging and things
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Should of never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Opening the hotel room do', to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had something to do, with all the drama
Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fucking with you
He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers

All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?

J. Period,"Check me out y'all, Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta and braver, I pull a number like a pager
Cause I'm am ace when I face the bass
40 side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't' a damn thing gonna change
I'm a perform a strange show the mic wonder was born the game?
Nas, why did you do it
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

It's halftime

It's like that, you know it's like that
I got at him, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off wit my own rhyme
Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas will catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels to never run it
Wit more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise, kid, surprise
This is exercise til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparking
But I was too scared to grab the mic's in the park and
Kick my little raps 'cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fucking man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch C.H.I.P.S, now I load glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a fagot
But not a bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap, I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand
'cause in the streets, I'm well known like the number man
In my place wit the bass and format
Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be fouled whenever I freestyle
I see trial niggas say I'm wow
I hate a rhyme biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime

It's halftime

I got it going on, even flip 'em on this song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the narcs hit
Word to Marcus Garvey or heartless Sparkton
'cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slaying them fast, doing this, that in the third
But chill, past the entree and let's lay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee
Putting hits on 5-0
Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo-fo
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for that weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn, Queens is living fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout

Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead

Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, livin harshly
Beat up and battered, they pull me out
I watch as niggaz scattered, makin me kill

I see niggaz bleedin runnin from me in fear, stunningly tears
Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, givin niggaz heart to follow me
Placin peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up tech with numbers on his chest that say 
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hopin one day, police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murderin, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand

Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that tech that kept cryin
Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear
He's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody comin in, open the shelf
His eyes bubblin, he said, ""It was on""
I felt his palm troubled him shakin
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was achin
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waitin
My creation was for blacks to kill blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally, go off, makin niggaz memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for 'im
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with

J. Period,"Life, I wonder
Will it take me under, I don't know

Imagine smokin' weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine goin' to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruisin' blue behind my waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters

Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feelin' like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got not evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually

Troopin' out of state for a plate knowledge
Of coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion
Designer clothes, lacin' your click up with diamond vogues

Your people holdin' dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind, I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read 'The World Is Mine'

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?
If I ruled the world, still livin' for today
In these last days an' times

The way to be, paradise like relaxin' black
Latino an' Anglo-Saxon, Armani exchange the reins
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path

The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes an' Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in

Open they eyes to the lies history's told, foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seein' things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Trickin' six digits on kicks an' still holdin'

Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work, release purple M3's an' jet skis

Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
An' reverse themes to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?
If I ruled the world, still livin' for today
In these last days an' times

An' then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin' from jake, gettin' chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state

Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Tryin' to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera
Makin' moves in Atlanta, back an' forth scrambler

'Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga havin' shit
If I ruled the world an' everythin' in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 infinite

It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or be Felonies
Strictly livin' longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?

My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented, with formality
My duration's infinite, money wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop, straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Childhood lesson make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines
The hype vice, murderous night times, and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac gold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggaz no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to Ceelo
With side bets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below (Peace God!)
Peace God, now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all

""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alize niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine Gods check the prognosis, is it real, or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
Your telephone blowin', black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic fo'-fo' I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some up-rise, plus some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails, for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace.
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream, about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo
Fuck 'rap is real', watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up, and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flat-line am I sane?
That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking it light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell
NAS, NAS

[Chorus: x2]
""Nas is like life or death.. I'm a rebel""
""My poetry's deep, I never fell""
""Nas is like, half man half amazing""
""No doubt""

""Nas is like..""  Earth Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
""Nas is like..""  Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death
The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
Came a along way from blasting, techs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes, giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my nine spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth, can't take it when you under this Earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Makin choices, that determine my future under the sky
To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much to success to ya, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is

[Chorus]

""Nas is like..""  Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, greenleaf reaper
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for
Always got you, I'm like Pop Duke you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
combined in one man; like the '99 summer jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of em fam'
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it, and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night

What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major

[Nas]
If niggaz could look inside my mind, you'll find
where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the braincell graveyard
where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin I'm still winnin, I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
""No Half Steppin'"" with flat tops when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork and Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
on a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
Your part of the world, might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them, treacherous rocksters in the Mexican mafias
Be scrappin with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothin less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watchin for paint chips, don't want no led in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shinin since Roxanne Shante' made ""Runaway""; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers want to be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist
I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things like
Somebody's always watchin, my life
Before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they want to see me in prison, the chains bamboozled

with dead eyes -- tired of riots, shit is quiet

Hear my favorite song, all these niggaz sing along
All the ciggarette smoke's cloggin my lungs, hoodrats flashin they tongue
Young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggaz both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggaz got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on, whoever walk in the lead
Cause I ain't playin, niggaz'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggaz'll find the loot in your kicks

Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One god to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with

Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics

Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knocking us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricocheting between the spots that I'm hiding in
Blacking out as I shoot back, fuck getting hit! {*more sirens*}

At all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots
From twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my guns was holding 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothing is fair, niggas roll up, shooting from wheelchairs
My heart is racing, tasting revenge in the air
I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines
If y'all niggas really wit me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There's nothing in our way, they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust

That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
Cause we stronger now my nigga the time is now!!

Or want to see me on top, too egotistical
Talking all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns I'm blasting cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? fooled you niggas
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashing
War gets deep, some beef is everlasting
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifing each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my range, niggas throwing dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished
Should of knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blinding, I never make the same mistakes
Moving with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swelling my melon cause none of these niggas real
Heard he was, telling police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searching, the time is now

roam around the project this lyrical logic I dilute,
the weak can object the right composite

the palm lady dreamt of this day, so I'ma play
the crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
the first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, Armor All Benz and endless papes
God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million
without the FBI catching feelings

[Chorus]

From fat cat to papi, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina 
Up in the hotel, smoking on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

[Chorus]

Growing up project-struck, looking for luck dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up, giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny?  Getting put on to crack money
With all the gun play, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

Picturing my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom

And fly ass frontin' bitches that now caught vapors 
Niggaz run up on you with guns, snatchin' papers 
Outlined body chalk, is how they would scrape ya 
From off the pavement, I hate gettin' locked up 
Cause that upstate bus reminds me of the slave ships 
But then the bible never saved shit 
I guess that's why every juvenile is in the same predicament 
You want to slang crack, or hold tecs, and do the concept 
You can't make loot, when your moms is smokin' up the product 
I try to tell ya, don't let these streets fuckin' fail ya 
The way niggaz be gettin' clapped shit'll fuckin' scare ya 
But in the dark, we ran wild, so we killin' 'em 
Niggaz scared, can't stand still, like fuckin' helium 
Fake niggaz, they don't go platinum they go aluminum 
Got em cloned the fuck up son, that's why we losin em 
I'm lookin' at this niggaz longevity 
To make a big play, but then it might be a mistake

On bitches try to punk smell the panty and raw sex 
Mad lights I had to black out, when fake niggaz act out 
Or step out of place, they get slapped in they face 
All y'all niggaz is fake, tryin' to emulate my style 
What grown man? In this game, to me you're a child 
I trained wack MC's, in camps like ex-marines

Of horrifying things, that your ass never seen before?

Y'all know what I mean 
Where do niggaz go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble

Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on

Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace

Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar, with golden wings in thug's mansion

Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor store and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, 'cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night,
it had me shook drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me

J. Phoenix,"I want you to close you're eyes, n' envision
The most beautiful place in tha world
If you in the hood, the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey, the best journey, its a mansion
Acres of land, swimmin' pools and all that, check it out

I'm capable of anything, my imagination could give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets watchin' many things
Kids walkin home from school, on drug blocks, missionaries
Pass out papers that read love god
I see faces cases, judges n jurors, masons lawyers n cops
I watch 'cause every thugs face is my mirror
But this was one in particular
This kid he was the vintage stick em up pro
Sixteen years old did his jail since there was no where to go
Every mornin' calls his commrad to come n get em' a smoke
He insane already gone mad, blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where his sets at
Sling from dusk till dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his ass was flarin
Smokin' like a chimney on remy of course he not carin'
He needs a place to go to keep his mind expandin
I give em a helpin hand, bring em out to Thugz mansion

Every corner, every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy
Lil hennesey, lay back and cool, every hour 'cause its all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside, every wrong done
Will be alright, nothin' but peace, love n street passion
Every ghetto needs a Thugs Mansion

Dear mama don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the hommies I'm in heaven and it ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night
It had me shook drinking
Peppermint schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm till the day game
Lil' Latasha sure grown, tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven
So come home
Maybe in time you'll understand, only God can save us
Where Miles Davis cutting lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on
They in heaven found peace that last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place
In Thugz mansion

Every corner, every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy
Lil hennesey, lay back and cool, every hour 'cause its all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside, every wrong done
Will be alright, nothin' but peace, love n street passion
Every ghetto needs a Thugs Mansion

A place where death doesn't reside, jus' thugz who collide
Not to start beef but to spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis grey hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw to much sufferin'
I'm just twenty some odd years I done lost my mother
And I cry tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Anne Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone, she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
With angels songs, with golden rings, in Thugz Mansion

Every corner, every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy
Lil hennesey, lay back and cool, every hour 'cause its all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside, every wrong done
Will be alright, nothin' but peace, love n street passion
Every ghetto needs a Thugs Mansion",Thugz Mansion (N.Y.),2002

J. Ralph,"It's like I'm walking through this kingdom of time
This far I've done lost my mind
Only to find the other side

Is where the world opens wide
To descend these city streets late at night
I've been searching for my bite
They say I inspired, but I'm still looking for my fire
These lies have got me tired
I'm free falling, I'm done stalling
I'm done crawling up this mountain top
I won't stop till I manifest my craft
The top is close
I'm sky scraping
They stay chasing
I'm like racing in the Sun, I'm running from depths
They're done, I'm going gray
I'm still young having mystic visions
Of the one, I hear the hum, the melody comes
Rushing in like some wind
Cuts close like a knife
All I got is my life
All I got I got I got

Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high
Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high

Now the rain is falling drizzle dropping on the street
Cleaning off the dirt beneath my feet
I got the speed on repeat
While I'm riding subway trains on a fact
Over tracks to go crack, my heart's black
But intact I've come to take the music back
I'm moving forward this time you can't ignore it
Put the pedal to the floor
Let's take you off
Through the time that has come
The time has come I launch orbit
I'm tight rope
Walking over fire with flames, yeah hot coals
I'm like water for you trolls
I pay no tolls
Speak to ghosts
Time to go high
The cross that you walk by
Got my eye into
I'll magic fly off on the broom
Which is true,
I'm at the crossroads, but I'll give my soul
It's already old

Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high
Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high

I'm a slave to the throne
The chariot, the flames, it's my home
I'm in a class of my own
Lights out, you're all alone, with your heart of stone
O-o-o-o-o-oh-oh

Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high
Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking dirt when I'm flying high

J. Rawls," 

Medic! Medic! A, yo, that's what they yelling!
Their hearts done stopped pumping, son, and ain't no telling
What that kid gone do now, is that him writing texts?
What the?! I didn't know that son was ambidextrous
With the beats and the rhymes
Plus he said it on time
And listen to that groove
It's raw with no refined
With ""Boom-na-na""..
Yeah, that's how we did it
Rolled the loop, and kick in the snare, and then he lit it
Now you're brain's on drugs
Introducing J. Rawls
He makes the beats for ya'll
And now he got the gall
Like, Who he think he is?
Like maybe Mos, Sans, and Kwa..
Ain't wrote no damn lyrics since the days of my man, Ra
But he still move the crowd
To the next universe
And ain't no chaos in this verse
But you gotta let it soak first
Before you knock it
But listen to you rock it
And once that rhyme settle up in your dome
Just buy the album when I drop it
But it ain't like that
I'm just statin' my case
I been touching Ts and marks [????] since I tied my first shoelace
So listen up! Cause, son, the rhymes about to start
So sing the chorus with me, cause that's my favorite part
Come on:

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Who they want to be like?
They can't see me!
Who they tryin' a' be like?
They tryin' a' be me
Who they want to be like?
They can't see me!
Tryin' a' be like.
They can't see J. Rawls

Who they want to be like? That's what I thought
Expected Sands on the mic, son, but, yo', you got caught
By them brothers united, and we're not Bling, Bling
And ain't no stretch Hummers and stuff
We just doin' our Thing, Thing
With the nine to five; man, I'm trying to stay alive
And, yo, this rent payment is due, and ain't no checks from Jive
Or, maybe, Tommy Mottola, or even Arista Corporation
I just do this stuff for fun, I do this stuff for Jason
Or maybe Joe Sikes (Peace son!)
So I can take it up a little higher
Put two weeks in on the job or maybe even retire
And I just got here, but I'm still working like I'm starving
And working my ass off, but it's getting kind of hard and..
So maybe the next time you see me I'll be talking about Bling, Bling
But I'll be giving to the org instead of wearing them diamond rings
Or, maybe, buying equipment, so I can perfect my craft
Making phat ass beats for Sands; so he can, keep spitting that math
So check for Book of Acks [???], and peeping the Lone Cats
But don't be expecting too many more of these damn Rawls raps
Until next rhyme, remember this moment in time
With that ""Who they want to be like?"" Cause that's my favorite line

J. Robert Baker,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

Things I was thinking of.

I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart

We've played the game of stay away

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Must have been part of the game,

Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,

What's happening...
Check it out 
It's critical; the situation is pitiful 
Bear in mind you gotta find somethin' spiritual 
We never gain 'cause we blame it on the system 
You oughta listen, whether Muslim or Christian 
Or any other type religion or creed 
'Cause what we need is less greed 
We can't continue to kill ourselves 
We gotta build and expand our wealth 
So one more time, I'll design a rhyme divine 
To educate and elevate your mind 
Nowadays we gotta fight to live 
Human means we got a right to live 
Without the homicide, without the genocide

In the land of the free, home of the brave 
Too many of us reach such early graves 
They tell us to behave, but they don't know 
About the neighborhood drug flow 
They don't know about the drama, or about the guns 
I ask how many politicians steal our funds 
And how many officers will turn up corrupt 
The governments don't care; they pass the buck 
I'm growin' tired of the trickery 
And the misery; it's makin me kinda sick, you see 
But now I meditate, so I can get it straight 
My thoughts penetrate, so I control my fate 
So be advised by the wise and conscious one 
We take the easy way out, too often, son 
We better get some kind of work ethic 
Realize it, and correct it

Victims of an unfair society 
But for those who are blessed 
We must correct this mess, or disappear into nothingness 
We're living in the age of doom 
How many teachers reach all the kids in the classroom? 
The beast is stalking us, but there's no stopping us 
As long as we maintain the strength within us 
'Cause we're winners, descendants of the kings 
They try to hinder us from doin' our thing 
So get the money, but spend it wisely 
I get ill when the beats hypnotize me 
Realize that the key 
Is for each to master his own destiny 
Deal with reality, and keep a tight focus 
'Cause there's a lot we got to cope with

y poco cuidado.

opening doors,

Making my entrance again,

Ayo I claim throne like Persian kings
My urban theme is to keep my culture pure 
And untampered like virgin queens
Never splurging cream
When I stack I'm merging dreams
Into one plan, rappers getting this green's an urgent thing
Number one on the list, no need to front on this shit
It's a blessing I don't have to vic with the gun on the hip
Got enough ice in the freezer, don't need none on the wrist
Just trees and more Henny, that's how I come in this bitch
Just like y'all man, I just wanted to flip
And hear myself on the air gettin spun in the mix
See you runnin the risk 
Tryin to challenge J-S-A, N-D-S
Yo Grap, these nigga envious?
I'm like the friendliest
Love and peace to any with
The same back to me, that beef shit is wack to me
Because actually I find out the facts to be
That if you have beef, it's to the death naturally
And don't nobody wanna die over dumb shit
So don't front on me because of who I run with
We gotta teach these kids to say no to beef to live
Not by words, but by actions we can repeat the shit
Our brothas killing brothas
Because it only leads to one dead, one in jail
And another story to tell

It goes hip hop, shoo bop doo wop
Put a hook on your mind and check the clock
And just do it, and just do it
And you know you got to just do it

It goes hip hop, shoo bop doo wop
Put a hook on your mind and check the clock
And just do it, and just do it
And you know you got to just do it

Free your mind and define what is true to you
Hold your plan tight, something like paper to glue
I keep it fool proof, set up a base for my youth
When it's all done, she's flying helly's off of roof
Big plans now, working my product against demand now
Takin breath before I take my steps
Now that I'm ready, I execute with great precision
On mission with Sands makin proper decisions

That are critical, Razor Sharp like Bobby Digital
Political, in all angles we stay pivotal
Original, MC smooth individual
I'm down for Rawls, never wanna see my nigga pitiful
Ridicule, I do not, that's just my physical
The one who stared and played the judge and life is the fool
The plan is lyrical, we all just need to get along
And that's the formula of the song
Grap L-U-V in, Sands I'm MCing
While J. Rawls got the funky drums beating, check it out

It goes hip hop, shoo bop doo wop
Put a hook on your mind and check the clock
And just do it, and just do it
And you know you got to just do it

My crew be in the mix, like name brand kicks
The kids that only deal wit that type of nonsense
You can't get wit, D.K.S. self evident
Adolescence, reign the supreme court, in any, every, meant

[Lil Knock]
The time was approximately eleven forty three
When the D called me, and told me, we must be
Lyrically, the best that he says, the
K N O see K, and S and K, it's spray
Comin away, the B.T.J., it be they
I'mma hold it down, wit sounds
Like clowns, walk the trey pound
Now in the underground, B.T.J. just entered
Remember, the S comes last like December
Once shit cock it's time to Rock like the Monsta
In reality, B.T.J., is lyrically responsible for all difficulties

[El Sha]
My lyrics oppose a threat to the best M.C. yet
And appears nightmares for those who slept
Also the biters, claimin they writers
They need to think about what they talk about
When you exposin your dirt, that's when you dummin out
Dwellin in the PJ's, all day, hangin out wit nothin to do
Them rebellin niggas is mad, 'cause I'm tellin the truth
Hittin yo wit mind craftin, flows to molecular cord graphin

[Chorus 2X]

[Lil Knock]
Aiyo one day it was me and the D
Walkin down the street, some niggas stepped to me
Said are you Lil are-you-T-I-Z
He said I heard you nice on the muthafuckin M-I-see
Battle me, battle right here, and let's see
So we kicked a verse that didn't hurt
So I hit 'em worst, to let him know I don't play those games
Save 'em for the jerks, D. Verbs said ""Son, let me get some""
I said ""No, 'cause he's a victim, and he probably in my premises
You know when I open my book wit my lyrics I'm endin this""
(No question) All this shit he poppin in my ears
Fuckin ejected, he can't hang wit my style
Look now, here's man fillin it, back to like what I was sayin
I start extortin, I'm not playin
You want Lil Knock? I come on your block
Cock and then start sprayin, lyrics
So don't start what you can't finish
'cause I will be sure to end whatever you created

[El Sha]
Mentally you can't function
Physically you dead wit the push of this button
Explosion be corruptin, from the expert of execution
I met Lil Knock at the junction
He was talkin about walkin, to the tree spot
We took the L to New Rox, we got stopped by two cops
Talkin about ""Where the two glocks?"", we doo wops
How was I two glocks? Man, it's too hot
And I'm cold, so let me go, I never hold
Whoever told you, that I do la?
Lil Sha, fuck a do or die
Nigga die, because of what they do
I do what I do wit my crew
Po-po was hype, they was like ""You bite, stick wit the mic device""
Drivin off, said ""Have a good night""
Personally I might, and all that shit I said was a psych'

Aright. Hey you know E just got cracked, he's in jail now. 
What? 
Yeah, Go-Go's out. I just saw him runnin' around the other day. 
Ah, f*** that fool. But anyway, what's happenin' with my moms? 
She gave me a message for you: 
She said she's sorry she couldn't be here today, but she'll be here next week. 
Aright well check this out, I got somethin' real important 
I want you to tell her 
C'mon c'mon this s***'s over with. 
I'm not done talking to him! 
C'mon boy, back to your cell. 
Shut that s*** up b****! He's outta here, c'mon. 
Don't be callin' my woman no b****! I'll f*** you up! 
Yeah yeah fool, what? Yeah yeah that's what they all say fool. 
You institutionalized, and this is your home... 

Guess who's back, and ready to knock off a cop or two 
'Cause me and the crew could still get our rocks off 
The penitentiary don't stop a n**** 'cause he's in jail 
Hell I'm makin' more money on the street from here in a cell 
I'm livin' proper, the coppers is havin' fits 
I just made the profit, you punks ain't stoppin' s*** 
I still remember my momma told me 
Find the cop who killed your brother 
Send him to Hell lookin' homely 
'Cause a real n**** love the law 
What's raw is a n**** that's above the law 
Keep pressin' your luck and get f***ed, huh 
Think a n**** don't know wha**up 'cause he's locked up 
But in the meantime, it's get swoll get clean time 
Concentrate on gettin' green time 
And as the years go by, they forgot 
About the small time soldier from the block, huh 
To kill the crook they threw the book at me 
Don't worry be nappy, don't even look happy 
Put me in the hole, gave me cold cuts 
Did push-ups until I swoll' up 
And then they offer me a furlough 
But what they don't know as soon as I get free I'm killin' five mo' 
They asked me if I changed much 
I told em 'Yeah' even though I'm still the same nut 
They started askin my questions about my brother 
And makin' remarks about my mother, hmm 
Wait a minute, hold up 
makin' jokes about my folks'll get yours blown up 
They sent me back to the hole for what I told em 
I guess he didn't believe me, so I showed him 
He went home to find a tragedy 
N****, that's what you get for tryin' to badger me 
And anybody else that want to sweat me 
I'm already in jail so you punks can't get me 
You better pray they never see me 
'Cause if they let me free, prepare for trouble on the streets.

Deep inside you know the truth 
He don't really love you 
Baby, you've gotta face the truth 
You know I'ma keep it real with you 
Let's be real 

I was December in the Chi 
When I saw you walking by 
With the tears in your eyes 
And I walked up to your side 
So I asked you how you feel 
Girl is everything alright 
I want you to keep it real 
Girl you ain't got to lie 
See that dude is a mark 
A predator and a shark 
And I knew that from the start 
He wanted to break your heart 
You ain't got to think twice 
Cause I ain't that type of guy 
I'd rather see you happy 
I don't want to see you cry 
Let's be real, come on now 
Let's be real, he got no love 
Like I have for you, really feeling bad for you 
Out of all of this time he never had love I have for you 

[Chorus]

He disrespect ya, he don't protect ya 
I know it hurts but you got to keep your head up 
He doesn't love ya, but I can treat you better 
That's why I think me and you should be together 
He doesn't need ya, bet I can please ya 
He doesn't trust ya, forever triny to treat ya 
He doesn't look at ya texture 
You should tell him that he really got you messed 
Tell him to beat it, me in your life you need it 

I'm willing to do whatever, you really can't beat it 
I'm your keeper, my words you need to keep it 
Fresher, I could be the reason why you breathing 

[Chorus]

He disrespect ya, he don't protect ya 
When you in need he don't hurry to catch ya 
Hurt and neglect ya, certain to stress ya 
I ain't your daddy girl, you can do whatever 
Let's be for real, come on now, Let's be for real, you know what's 
Up Let's be real, come on now, let's be real, forever ma 

It's best you let him go, or you will never know

What we could be, why can't you see

Use to tuck me in with the bedtime story

My shoulder to lean on 
You kept my dreams goin
I owe it all to you me now I got the green flowing
And I'm gon always be yo baby

You raised me to be a lady

You was still in my corner to press the brace
Till I'm ready in yo arms you kept me safe

I say a prayer for ya 
Lord knows I care for ya

Can't nobody replace you

J.A.Q.,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son
Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son",Georgia on My Mind,2008
J.A.Q.,"Inseparable, that's how we'll always be 
Inseparable, just you and me 
It's so wonderful to know you'll always be around me 
  
Incredible, what you are to me 
Incredible, you bring out the woman in me 
With your style of love 
Inseparable, yes we are 
  
Well like a flower to a tree 
Like words to a melody of love 
There's no way we could break up 
No words that can make us 
Blow our thing
We're just

Inseparable, for the rest of our years 
It's so wonderful to know you'll always be around",Inseparable,2008
J.A.T.P. All-Stars,"I love my man
I'm a liar if I say I don't

I've been your slave, baby
Ever since I've been your babe
I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your babe
But before I'll be your dog
I'll see you in your grave

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Squawked about my supper then he put me outdoors
Had the nerve to lay a matchbox on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long ways to go

I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curled
I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curled
But my mother, she gave me something
It's going to carry me through this world

Some men like me 'cause I'm happy
Some 'cause I'm snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I've got money

Some say me Billie

Now, if you put that all together
Makes me everything a good man needs",Billie's Blues,1998
