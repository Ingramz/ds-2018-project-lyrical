Fatal,"Yeah

Erst sind wir Feuer und Flamme, dann sind wir Asche und Staub
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt Benzin, verbrennt dein Kiez, verbrennt dein Lean, verbrennt deinen Arsch
Es regnet Asche und wir laufen durch den mattschwarzen Rauch
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt deine Nikes, verbrennt deinen Hype, verbrennt deine Likes, verbrennt deinen Arsch

Es begann mit uns im Dunkeln damit mein' ich ganz unten
Da wo die Augen der Dämonen beim Mondschein funkeln
Die Taschen höher die Akten voll
Doch Familie ist, wo die Jungs sind
Damit die Ablenkung stimmt
Dreh den Beat auf und lass pumpen
Wird er rausgehen in den Dschungel
Schon als Kind dann als Junge
Doch raucht jetzt als Mann stillt nur Papier den großen Hunger
Aber wenn die Hände glühen wie Feuer, dann verbrennt da jeder Schein
Die Kohle kommt viel zu schwer, aber geht viel zu leicht
And Handgelenken Tic Tac Toe in rosé gold und weiß
Und der Diamant und nicht der Charakter sind dir noch lupenrein
Ich nehme das Blutgeld von dem Business, kauf' meinen Brüdern neue Nikes 
Und das Geld verbrennt nur langsam auch wenn man es teilt (ja)

Erst sind wir Feuer und Flamme, dann sind wir Asche und Staub
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt Benzin, verbrennt dein Kiez, verbrennt dein Lean, verbrennt deinen Arsch
Es regnet Asche und wir laufen durch den mattschwarzen Rauch
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt deine Nikes, verbrennt deinen Hype, verbrennt deine Likes, verbrennt deinen Arsch

Wenn du mit dem Feuer spielen willst, dann verbrennst du dich Junge, das ist sicher
So wie das „Amen“ in der Kirche oder dass dein Leben enden wird, Junge
Brüder stechen sich wie 'ne Ghettobitch, Junge 
Sind zusammen damals aufgewachsen, ist ein Zeichen dass die Welt am enden ist, Junge
Literweise Blut klebt auf den Batzen, hingen nächtelang, labbern von Straßen, ja
Ab Tag eins war unser Name laut
Die Vergangenheit hinterlässt Spuren wie vernarbte Haut
Sie verbrennen Scheine für Rolex Uhren, aber können sich keine Zeit kaufen
Du kannst bleiben, kannst hier einkaufen 
Aber eintausend Euros reichen aus und ein Verrückter erschießt dich über einen Haufen
Miese Junkies gehen sicher Stein kaufen und verbrennen ihren Existenz 
Und Frauen gehen raus ihr Fleisch verkaufen für die AMGs (?)
Ich dreh' die Runden, seh' die Kunden
Lassen die, die tief im Schnee verschwunden sind 
Und jeder ist an eine (?) gebunden kurz bevor er so tief in dem Höllensumpf versinkt

Erst sind wir Feuer und Flamme, dann sind wir Asche und Staub
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt Benzin, verbrennt dein Kiez, verbrennt dein Lean, verbrennt deinen Arsch
Es regnet Asche und wir laufen durch den mattschwarzen Rauch
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt deine Nikes, verbrennt deinen Hype, verbrennt deine Likes, verbrennt deinen Arsch",Verbrannt,

Fatal,"It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!

Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gif when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper, speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voicebox locks and excels like a rocket

It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!

Fatal is merciful and they curse me
When I grip the mic I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart
From the seams and hem up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes
Cause I'm living larger than the founders of Fendi
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge

It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!

Some of them said (said what?) that the Ak should quit
But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick, your lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave cause the shit you talk is dead

It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!

I grab up girls like jacks
Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics, who's necking me
(Ooh he got an afro) yo, but I got dough
Why's my name the Large Professor?
Cause I milked your cow in other words I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savanda
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra
Don't let the folks around your way puff your head
Cause you'll be the owner of a hospital bed
I'll kick fire out your ass so fast
You'll be as crispy as my man Bill Blass

It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)

Fatal,"Ah yeah!
Yeah!
It's all about you, one time!
I'mma say it's all about you baby, yeah!
It's all about you, it's all about you, yeah
This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac you knowhat I'm sayin'? (It's all about you)
Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh

You probably crooked as the last trick
Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club
I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' boo, is this is all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
I never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah nigga
It's all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
I see the same hoes in the studio
Or kickin it in the video
It's gotta be the same ass and thighs
But you'se a groupie baby and don't look surprised
I can see it in your eyes that you nuthin' but a trick
Hangin' with us for some superstar dick
Wanna autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin'
She know what's crackin, free shows like loot
From limos down to the Lexus Coup
We be flossin'
And all females love that
Especially when you're dope platinum and you own wax
When I met you I really didn't have to say much
'Cause me alone just made you wanna taste and touch
Don't be trippin' if I run up to your hoe and whole crew
I'm gonna still let you know girl
That it's all about you, you, you, you",All Bout U,1996

Have some respect shut the fuck up 
Driveby money talkin shit yo back the truck up 
Y'all niggaz don't respect me but you fear me 
And fear is better than respect, y'all niggaz hear me? 
If I smack the shit outta this nigga 
His man over here be like, ""Yo what? Nigga what?"" 
But his man is like, ""Psych yo"" 
Take it from one extreme to the next 
And my shit always bounce like D-M, to the X 
I can bring it from up here, to enough is enough 
Down to, ""Aight I think it's safe to take off the cuffs"" 
I play wit words, blurs and slurs, flip styles 
Take his and hers, niggaz is couraged, I get wild 
So don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry 
I've got a lot of enemies, and they'd all like to bang me 
(What?) Catch me when I'm sleepin', with one eye closed 
One guy chose the dogs; left one got froze, filled with holes 

Ugh, it's gonna be a long time befo' dey touch this here 
It's Gotti's, Consigliere, let's take it there and make a milli, yeah 
Which Bentley's? Ice drippin' off the jewels, daily 
Ja the one, what? y'all don't hear me, nigga 
Y'all remember, see-M-see, '95 December 
Fine women, illegal tender, such is life 
When I feel like I ain't to be held, who could hold me? 
Hoes try to console me, rec' exec's want to own me 
Damned if I die slowly, drugged out broke and lonely 
Like so many who pushed roadie before me

Look in my eye, you see realness 
The Mobb tonic quest for million, my Lex with ill rims 
My name ringin', chain swingin', ain't richest? 
Are you my heir? Like do we present the same vision? 
My insight is deep, mental intuition 
Type essential, due to this trife life we livin'

The Bridge under pressure for mad years and countin' 
What? My connect eatin' papaya, supplyin' me 
Cormega represent a live nigga dynasty 
9's and Tek's, my hollow heads outlined your vest 
My only fear is twenty five years of death 

One deep from Jersey, on the Island doin' six

Bullets small as his G-be-30, niggaz lose it quick 
I had to get out of town, I done shot another dick

[Verse 1]
Bert and Hussein, back to back now that`s flammable
Smokin` ya brain, attack the track like we some animals
Mechanical, live wire jaw, rap cannibals
Fire force survive behind bars, like we unhurtable
Swervin` through Jerz emerge and serve you don`t deserve to pull,
Another breath of oxygen,
Has is known for oxin` `em
cool Kas` chrome be droppin` `em,
Killa Kane be lockin` Philipane
Drip from a toxic tongue
Get done wid it,
Out of control like we begun wid it
Bricks explode, licked you out the show
That nigga Bump did it
I block, like Murdock, army fatigued and,
Bout to store blocks an` Fort Knox ya minor league shit
Breathe this, ballistic, shell like Khadafi
Bringin` the blizzards when I make bail you can`t stop me,
In jail all that I can see provoking hell,
Chokin` at a third rail velocity
Obviously ya men have, been barkin` up the wrong tree
Microphone strong deep bomb first
Ya mind burst within a rhyme verse
Dirty Bert rehearse the worse of me,
The black clip`s burnin` me
The cat who act fraternity
The landscape`s redded,
Fuck it ya man said it
Ya shoulda never let it escape
We won`t wet it,
Squeezing, leavin holes in ya crew,
Maestro can stand through,
When I pass the Mac to Rock that nigga brand you
When I pass the Mac to Rock that nigga brand you

[Hook]
Ten out of ten
No ya chance is a ninth
We do jail wid no bail
Losin` half of our life
Livin` the life of the poor
Losin` sight in the war
You can slice it down precise
Shit`s trife around the board

[Verse 2]
We in this thing together
Tryna build the same cheddar
It`s strange sometimes I think paranoid clutchin` my waist
A fake couldn`t relate to,
Drugs and honeys,
My hugs are funny
And thugs blow slugs for the money
Gunshots, mobbin` up quiet late nights
Walkin` down New, you betta think twice
This shit ain`t right,
It`s all wrong,
NARC`s we slide on
It ain`t safe season
Say it`s strength in numbers
We rolled the whole precint
Rev the whip up,
We live `98 stick-ups
Loadin` clips up
That flimsy ass vest we rip up
New Jerz, come check us
But don`t test us
Oppose, we throw holes in ya Lexus
Act whatever, clap whatever
When we clap we clap together
Leavin` you cats on the stretcher
O.N.S. and the Embassy,
Outlawz and Pentagon
If it ain`t that,
It ain`t shit to me
It ain`t shit to me

Fake lies, close ya eyes,

You little hip hop cop,
Playin` spy in the park
We turn schemes to cream
Cause we fiend for green
Wid the cops and streets watchin`
Ain`t no need to dream
Codine my team,
Full beam on ya knotty
Killuminati to ya body
Got mooned wid the shotti
Getto star you for Amaru,
Yak see you tomorrow,
I know you here,
These other niggas be like where are you?
The Henny`ll start you,
Dirty ever semi I borrow,
No confrontation or quarrel
I can`t shake up or startle
The time taker
Tying `em up like Ron Baker
Here to shake and break `em down
Like the LA Lakers
I see through `em
Ain`t no tellin` what I`ma bout to leave through `em
While he lay there I stay there
While the paramedics`ll breathe through him
Squeeze through him,
Put the E to him, hit `em up
He gon` lay there shakin` waitin` for y`all to pick him up
Ya outta there,
Quick as you squeal, I`ll appeal
It`s kill or be killed,
In this world of free steel
Every crew`s a game,
Wearin` blues is strange
From how you move you`ll be named
For what you doin` who you claim
You might, think it`s a game
From bein` critically acclaimed
A war winner for pitiful game
Fuck wid Hussein

[Verse 4]
From cops got our feet tired
Everybody split up anybody get caught
Son just keep quiet,
These C`s watchin` me,
Two CDS` of armed robbery
Terroristic bread and possession of stolen property,
Keep to myself that`s how I got to be, cats acknowledge me,
For the simple fact I live everyday of the week periodically
Premeditated robberies, how could you possibly
Mistake Imperial S for a mental or methology
I`m realer than the cats that shot at me
I think I`ll probably, ride by and let `em sample the varieties,
My hollow ain`t easy to swallow,
Like them five dollar bottles,
Kill or be killed`s my motto,
I do it cause I got to,
I`ma, straight up commodity
I thug in this society
On the side ah me`s my niggas that`ll die for me
Would you ride for me?, or get rode on?
Been in this game so long
I kick slick shit in every sentence
Y`all have to grow on,
Throughout my hard times my vision was blind
Hustlin` dimes fake niggas want to beef wid me
I ain`t puttin` it in my rhymes
You ain`t worth it,
Wid out contact I catch perfect,
Had the heart in front of the crowd
But in your eyes you nervous,
Now start chirpin`,
The .38 special start squirtin`
Leave two holes in ya shirt
And put you on the side street hurtin`,
Now that`s for talkin` out ya person,

Fatal,"[tame one]
Wait'll niggaz hear that tame and fatal got down and made it straight
From uptown with six sacks and this track that's in the background
Stop stressin from the chest up, we messed up
Off that best stuff that fits up in yo' dutch
Situation like this, you get blown to bits
Fuckin with this brick lyricist, more complex than the pyramids
Here it is, strictly biz like small print
In between them bong hits, we drop the strong shit
Chickenheads say, ""who him? "" with fucked up timb's
Knotty fro and baggy denims, spendin up the benjamins
In city tenaments, the boom skwadron odd man
Don't give a fuck like rodman (""what are you doing? "")
With no rings like patrick ewing (""what? "")
Still I play hard regardless
Acquitted from the charges throwin darts up at the heartless
Aimin for your brain, tame one, one of the darkest
Brown like the chocolate, poppin your metropolis

Chorus: fatal hussein

Around my way, all they do is shoot dice all day
Escapin secret indictments, gettin nice all day
Don't let em fold ya, outlawz, the getto star soldiers
Give this letter to the president, before this shit is over
(repeat 2x)

[fatal hussein]
When hussein aim, puttin they brains on walls like tame name
Blastin these motherfuckers cause they just can't maintain
Y'all plain jane's gel in the ? well's? county of sing-sing
Me and young noble, got em strung hold em for hostage
Lyrics verbally toxic, spit like doubled edged optics
My shit is milk, wearin silk shirts with chocolates
Y'all broke and can't cop shit, I get, physically fit
On some evil eye ready to die shit
This thug shit, niggaz get beat down and shot up
I saw this one nigga, get stolen on and your soul got up
Stolen car, roll past the bar, toured a lot of city
Gave him an eighth and he cooked his whole product
It's a shame how you cowards change the game for narcotic
You don't get it, don't got it, the love of money get exotic
If you old you get shot at, and can't walk the streets
Without gettin your lil' money hungry soft ass spot

Chorus

[fatal hussein]
We adapt to the system like ? eddie bap? on mission
Get an ounce of izm, two six-packs, and kid listen
Just a dip on the task, my little niggaz on the ave
Do a bid and laugh, come home and cop a half
Hit me with twenty hundred, what you got was fronted
Now run it, I got this fuckin drug spot where I want it
So don't be dissin new, when you ain't got shit to do
Five thousand dollars, charge free, right out municipal

[tame one]
Niggaz get played off to the left like they was southpaws
Toss you to the outlawz, then let them shoot it out
For what you clock for -- got more than you expected
When I inject correct shit, it gets hectic
Fuckin comin up with that next shit, thug niggaz and bugged niggaz
Luce? steel is tight, I'm straight up like midnight
We burn mics on turnpikes, we swervin through the lanes
We throw chains at bitches, it's back to new jeru to get these riches

We got the plague in this mother fucker
The pentagon in this mother fucker

Around these blocks
You know these hot glocks
Cock till you drop
All you wanna-be cops
You don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police
Beat what the streets do to me
Actin all new to me
I'll creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image
Of this primace
From here to east crems
Through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in a couther
Six plates to soup ya
On due we always cruise
Right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin with sal
I start thinkin 'bout al
Ricardi coverin my body
At the rink when I wow
I bag a hotty or two
This but a shotty for you
I got more bodies than drew
I drink mine naughty or new
Fuck your crew
This type of shit we do for a petty hobby
Fuck the whole world
This fatal dawg against everybody (it's on)
Better be twenty-five once this shit you never fuckin heard
Outlaw, outlaw, we rate these breaks
That shit we don't got be that shit we gotta take

[verse 2 - merciless x]
It's the merciless x
Like malcolm
Black as a falcon
How many shots I left depressed in your chest
I wasn't countin
But your back exploded (blaw!)
I episoded, with the weapon loaded
Let the next opponent
Get possessed with this merciless omen
The coldest crome to your dome
Sewn and holdin it's own
Let the barrel announce my ferocity
Twist spacious velocities
For haters watchin me
Make your block an atrocity
Break you down microscopic
Only doctors see, what the topic be
Drama through your armor
Bustin my two through your school of piranhas
My soldiers disapprove of your honor
We close captives, no conclusions
Let the revolver solve it
Evolve in this evolution
We shootin and pollutin

[chorus - fatal]
Pass the heat
And let me wave it in the air (air)
Guns bust, cowards fall
Niggaz just don't care (care)
To my lord I swear
We ain't never playin fair (fair)
On the streets you can't sleep
When the outlawz there
I know it's rainin on your block nigga (nigga)
You can't quit it
And you're prayin for it to stop nigga (nigga)
You shouldn't of did it
On a crash course chase of death (yeah, death)
Still thuggin on the streets (yeah)
Cause we the last ones left

[verse 3 - mac mall]
I take this thug shit seriously
Bought dirty gats with dope money
Atf can't fuck with me
My soldiers be
All there quiet
I'm holdin my crotch
Sippin henne nigga
You're life or you're not
Thug life my life
It don't stop
It's never too hot
And when I die I greet haze with glocks
Young crazy californians
Postin bout six in the mornin
On a quest to take the breath of my opponent
Them alls can't live
My cousins invite guns in they crib
Honey I'm home
Now nigga you're gone
Your bitch sing them songs
Like baritones to the rollers
When I saw her, I dumped on her
Like I supposed to
Now tell me what's funk without a mob year
And tell me what's a shrow without a witness
I only fuck with savages, soldiers, and hogs
From c.a. to n.j. mac mall be outlaws

[verse 4 - fatal]
Vocally undestructible
Your crew ain't got enough
To go clip to clip
When we shootin out on the strip
Cause I'm untouchable
I'll blast your
Chest through your back with kastro
Oh you ain't scared?
What the fuck you walkin so fast for?
Is you with me or against me
Don't run up on me and tempt me
To have your faggot ass bagged
Like a mother fuckin empty
And simply vengeance of dogs
We gets a real nigga
Let me borrow your bitch
And watch me go and chill with her
On a rise no lie
Go against me and die
Baby gated like a hive
On the side of me with a nine
Believe me
This shit makes circumstances much more devious
My murderous material
Got shorties livin mischievous
Smokin em is the easiest
The hard part is dealin with the fact
That I made it through rap
And gotta go back to killin
Cause broke niggaz be illin
Wantin money for a shoot or somethin
But you get nothin but murder when I be shootin somethin

Put the bullshit behind us, we movin' forward
Eat cheese and get you killed, and whoever you wasn't caught with
Signing statements, now I'm flying places
Denying that you hating, that's the way that ya go
How did I know?
Look at what the game done to me
Mother-fuck the world 'cause we grew up ? trust me
I stay dusty like I live down in New, I'm used to
Fell off the block now we're selling out stores
Yelling Outlaw when we riding down you street
Niggas think that Pac gone that it ain't no beef
You fuckin'' dickhead, Outlawz spit lead
And tonight, when you come home I'm gon' be laying in your bed
So when you put your key in the lock, make sure your heat cocked
You was scared when he was alive, but now you gotta face Pac, it's on

[Chorus: x8]

Sicker than same faces, Hussein case is not to
Be forgot, nigga ask Pac who shot you
Last block I got you, burnt it up on y'all
Can I stop you?, see'mon dogg, I turn it up on y'all
Little homo thugs and that's word to Kadafi
I spit at Mobb Deep, had to holla at Junior Mafia
Toured with Yak, watching fake niggas spit out
Ignored the eyes, told them jake niggas ""get outta here""
Hit em with that, I diss y'all and stand in the jects
Handiling techs, lick off and hit your man in the neck
And you was next, you ran so I spit on your back
My daughter a firebug, so she sit on the mac
Stop with your job, I cock and put my glock in ya eyes
You think I'd be sitting in the county if Pac was alive
I'm illa than that, Outlawz is realer than that
If ya wifey be feeling Hussein, then I'm feeling her back
You ain't no Outlaw

Watered down ass nigga, Bitch made nigga
Suck a dick!

[Chorus: x8]

Uh, Outlaw!
Operating Under Thug Laws As Warriors!
What? y'all niggas thought we forgot!
We still together! Outlawz forever!
This is resurrection shit!
We gonna keep on riding!
Get down! Liutenant will mash on you fake ass niggas!
Where you want it?!
Wherever you go, you got it comin', it's smothered!
We got the game in check!",I'm an Outlaw,2002
Fatal,"[Chorus]
How do you want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane; I'm for real
How do you want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane; I'm for real

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm bout to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessey
A favorite of my homies when we floss, on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how you want it
(Tell me how you want it! La-dy, yeah yeah)

[Chorus]

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic 
Cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' til the show is over, cause I'ma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alize, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggas play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, youse a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggas top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga tell me how you want it

[Chorus]

Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof, because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, SkyPager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetary
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade em all, these taxes
Got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin like they know me
Hahaha, but I'ma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it
How do you want it?

[Chorus: x2]

How you want it?
Yeah my nigga Johnny J
Yeah, we out

[Chorus]

Tell me

Fatal,"Ich kam sauber auf die Welt, blass wie milchweißes Fell
Elternhaus leicht kaputt, doch damals fehlte noch kein Geld
Zu 'nem Sportler erzogen, lehn' Kontakt mit vielen Drogen ab
Hängen mit Ganoven, der Teufel findet dich, dann kommt das Schicksal
Wie 'n Kescher, nimmt dich in den Schwitzkasten
Und die Hyänen, die darauf lauern, dass sie Schnitt machen
Im Schatten findet niemand seinen Weg
Denn es ist Kopf über Wasser oder leise untergehen
Dann war die Welt mein Problem, jeder Tritt von ihr tat weh
Und irgendwann wird jeder Hund mal aggressiv, wenn man ihn schlägt
Der Kopf geht kaputt, wenn man weiß, man kommt nicht klar
Und eigentlich hat man viel mehr Potenzial
Der Frust staut sich an und fuckt dich jeden Tag ab
Und irgendwann erbrach ich dann immer mein Inneres auf's Blatt
Das Gefühl war kurz weg, nur in Ketten zu liegen
Und immer, wenn der Beat läuft, hab' ich Frieden

Zu viele Stimmen, die uns leiten, zu viele Ketten, die uns halten
Wenn die Gedanken sich nur noch im Kreis drehen, wer soll uns beisteh'n?
Denn da, wo die Mauern zu hoch sind, bleiben Träume auf dem Boden
Doch ganz unten ist lang nichts verloren
Denn jeder Weg hier raus führt nach oben und

Jedes Mal, wenn ich rappe brechen Mauern um mich auf
Diese Welt bekommt einen Farbton mehr als nur grau
Auf einmal führen Wege aus dem Käfig heraus
Und alle Hunde durchbeißen ihre Ketten
Jedes Mal, wenn wir rappen, hört der Druck auf der Brust kurz auf
Bevor der Frust sich staut
Und auf einmal führen Wege aus dem Käfig heraus
Denn alle Hunde durchbeißen ihre Ketten, ha!

1-9-8-8, er erblickt das Licht der Welt
Seine Mutter noch ein Kind im Kopf, doch das Herz macht halt, was es will
Keine Perspektive, außer wahre Liebe und ein Vater, der nie da war
Was soll aus ihm werden? Ein Versager, auch wenn Mutter nur das Beste für ihn wollte
War sie leichte Beute, weil der Kleine war der Teufel
Was Schule, 24/7 high, nix gelernt, aber immer noch dieses eine Lied im Kopf
Ja, er war blass wie milchweißes Fell
So naiv, glaubte alles, was der Wu-Tang-Clan erzählt
Kulturschock in CAB, kannte die Straße vorher nur von 'ner DVD, nicht mal ein Film
Doch Mucke bleibt Mucke wie wenn man das selbe Blut hat
Egal, ob man es schwer oder leicht hat
Nur Abfuck im Alltag, wenn man wieder keine Zeit oder alles wieder leid hat
Gelacht oder geweint hat

Jedes Mal, wenn ich rappe brechen Mauern um mich auf
Diese Welt bekommt einen Farbton mehr als nur grau
Auf einmal führen Wege aus dem Käfig heraus
Und alle Hunde durchbeißen ihre Ketten
Jedes Mal, wenn wir rappen, hört der Druck auf der Brust kurz auf
Bevor der Frust sich staut
Und auf einmal führen Wege aus dem Käfig heraus
Denn alle Hunde durchbeißen ihre Ketten, ha!

Immer, wenn ich im Studio bin, bin ich nicht draußen
Wo die Queens Shit kaufen, Jungs ihren Schnitt brauchen
Du bist nur ein Schnittlauch, fang' an zu pumpen
Ich lass' mich nicht lumpen, denn ich kam ganz von unten
Ich kam aus dem Dunkeln, Parties und Alk
Mit Kopfschmerzen hart wie Asphalt, doch ich stapel es bald
Deshalb bin ich am rappen, für fettes Bling, fette Ketten
Edelsteine, Ringe, ich mach' Action
Ich dreh' auf für die Jungs, mach' die Scheiße für sie
Denn schon seit 2001 kick' ich Reime auf Beats
Jedes Jahr, was vergeht, ohne Para verdient zu haben
Steigert nur die Hitze meiner Artillerie
Fette Knarren, jede Zeile trifft
Doch man vergisst: Für die Kids hier ist jede Zeile Gift
Doch man vergisst: Ohne Mucke wären wir oft schon ausgetickt
Lass mir nur den einen Augenblick wenn ich rappe

Jedes Mal, wenn ich rappe brechen Mauern um mich auf
Diese Welt bekommt einen Farbton mehr als nur grau
Auf einmal führen Wege aus dem Käfig heraus
Und alle Hunde durchbeißen ihre Ketten
Jedes Mal, wenn wir rappen, hört der Druck auf der Brust kurz auf
Bevor der Frust sich staut

Ey, 
Auch wenn meine Songs jetzt im Radio laufen, vergess' ich nicht, woher wir kommen
Damals von Touries noch die Soundkarten klauen, statt Alben machen, nur dumm im Kopf
Lieber schnelles Geld, wenn der Hunger kommt, gestreunert wie Hyänen
Statt Bausparen tolle Laufbahn, immer klauen da, wo was geht
Schnell aus der Haut fahren wegen kaum was, alle rauf da bei Problemen
Alles Ausnahmen, was nicht gleich bei drei auf dem Baum war, und dann gehen
Von einem großen Loch, das im Bauch war, zu 'nem Schaumbad und ei'm Steak
Damals noch kleine Jungs mit kaum Bart, aber Augen kalt wie Schnee
Gestern hat niemand noch an uns geglaubt, Rohdiamanten versteckt unter Staub
Sechs Fuß tief unter dem Beton, wir schrien alles raus und dann brach er auf
Waren Sorgenkinder, heute selber Väter, bringen sauberes Geld nach Haus
Keiner, der mir sagen kann, was ich zu machen hab', alles mit eigenen Händen erbaut
Jetzt sind Probleme andere, wenn das scheiß Finanzamt dir dann all dein Erspartes klaut
Jeder mit dir redet, weil er nur an deine Patte will, dich dann noch einen Bruder nennt, nur weil er was braucht
Der Moment, wenn man den Tod im Business trifft, ist
Wenn der Teufel dich mit Botoxlippen küsst, Baby

Take his and hers, niggaz is couraged, I get wild 
So don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry 
I've got a lot of enemies, and they'd all like to bang me

Fine women, illegal tender, such is life 
When I feel like I ain't to be held, who could hold me? 
Hoes try to console me, rec' exec's want to own me 
Damned if I die slowly, drugged out broke and lonely

If you think that a nigga did it

Hit em in the chest and keep it movin'
Or go sit your silly ass down
don't give me no excuses that you turned your little life around (naw)
You were born into violence

You weave pain, ain't nuttin but a g thang
Anyway, you better get him 'fore he get you (get you)
Fuck around, fall asleep then he wet you
Fuck around he call the feds then they get you

They lace a thugged up on so much game (so much game)

End up in tragedy

It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion

Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love

Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true

I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
I never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through

No matter where I go, I see the same ho

No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

Or a nigga from the west side the best side, call me
Call me nigga, reach out and touch a nigga, cause uh
If you don't do that and I hear one of you niggas sayin somethin on a record, ha
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I'm comin'

Ah, from the pressure, yeah
You know how we do this Quik, Outlaws, untouchable
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Time to make y'all, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em
Visions of over packed prisons, millions of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crates (shh)
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas is defenseless I'm hitting fences then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless at these nigga's throats?
Only wish to breed, I explode into a million seeds
Y'all remember me legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take 'em to places face to face then erase 'em, and break 'em
Murder motherfuckers that are waitin' to quicken the pace

Aiyyo we won't stop, I let the '44 pop
Tanqueray and Alize' make niggas get shot
I'm smokin on some kush baby, you know it's all Gravy
Calicos, AK's, nigga's yellin' mayday
Payday, soon as the red dots connect
Off that haze and that 'dro, that Cali sticky icky
Strictly 2-1-3, 8-1-8, 3-2-3
3-1-0, we Outlawz, baby

I'm surrounded by thugs, slugs with crystals and pistols, callin'
Copy murderers that be softer than tissues
Got my persona soldier dedicated to the fuckin drama
My foes retreat like pros when they post my pros
Mashin' like piranahs or a pack of pitts
Bodies get wasted, paper chasin', tryna stack a brick
Dear mama, I'm touched for lots of lethal clutch, clingin' for a life which ain't much
And a lust for these guns to bust
Ain't no trust for these herbs tryna wet ya, keep my burner on the dresser
Wake up bustin' in the mornin' from the pressure

I never had a chance to be a buster, I was raised hard
With the only shed of tattooed tears out near the graveyard
I rep my Outlaws deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let the industry cheat me
Only behind the scenes do they see me as 2Pac the don
And this bitch with 2 Glocks, I'm wrong
The homie still gon' roll and standin' with your biggest G
You still gon' fold, I can guarantee you a lost
The homie 'Pac told me ""I can guarantee you a boss""
And it was in for a brief minute, far as my life
Since he disappeared, I still ain't found peace in it
But still strugglin like Mumia Abu, it was 'bout to end truly I knew
Named my daughter Assadah, for that alone, make 'em more than a rider
Got every homie trigger finger under the set
Dope but guaranteed now my 1 on 1 will connect

And I pretend that they're not there
I just stare
Up in the booth at the dread man spinnin the song
Spinnin it strong
Playing things like
We cannot house we can
That's my shit
What?
Whoooooo!

I get deep, I get deep, I get deeper, I get deeper
When people start to disappear
And it's about six o'clock
Whoo I'm feelin' hot
Take off my sweater and my pants
And I start to dance
And all the sweat just goes down my face
And I pretend that there's nobody there but me in this place
I get deep, oh I get deep

I get deep, I get deep, I get deep, I get deep
He takes all the bass out of the song
And all you hear is highs and its like
Oh, shit!
Ahh
I get deeper

I get deep, I get deep, I get deep, I get deep
And the rhythm flows through my blood like alcohol
And I get drunk and I oh all over the place
And I catch myself
Right on time
Right on line
With the beat
And its so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet

I get deeper
I get deeper
I get deeper

If the house music was ale
And Doctor love would be my song
And I would only take deep breaths
And fill my lungs with the rhythm or the bass
I get deep

Now it's about three and I see people goin'
Spinnin' jumpin' and grindin'
As if they had wings on their feet
Raising both hands in the air as if Jesus was the DJ himself
Spinnin those funky funky funky house beats

And in this temple we all pray in unity for the same thing
With matic pause without cause
Bass from those high definition speakers
Sitting in the corner on each side of the room
Givin' us the boom boom boom
To our zoom zoom zoom

The smell of a L lit while walking by
But the music gets me high
Saint defy like and old lady in church
We get happy
We stomp our feet
We clap our hands
We shout
We cry
We dance
And we say
Sweet Lord, speak to me
Speak to me, speak to me, speak to me
Because we love house music
And on this planet it brings us together
Like a family reunion every week
We eat
We drink
We laugh
We play
And we skate
So for all you hip hoppers
You do woppers
Name droppers
You bill boppers
Come into our house

That journey-a call my name

An' have me wonderin' all my days
That journey-a call me quick
That journey-a call my name
That journey-a have it's way
An' have me wonderin' all my days

I can't stay home, I gotta keep movin'
I gotta keep doin', I gotta get out
I gotta roam, it's somethin' that moves me
It's somethin' that uses me without a doubt
'Cause somewhere abstract coincidence happens
See someone in passin' while out and about
Next thing I know I'm happily travelin'
Puttin' in action ideas that I mouth
Cause I speak it and do it, talk it and walk it
I'm so bad about it, I shout it out loud
But try to stay open, the forces in motion
They keep me on course, it's just clear that I've found (?)
Imprissoned in flesh and reality's blesses
That made manifest every woman and child
I'll keep on expressin' reality's lessons
Explorin' my prison until I'm let out

That journey-a call me quick
That journey-a call my name
That journey-a have it's way
An' have me wonderin' all my days
That journey-a call me quick
That journey-a call my name
That journey-a have it's way
Have me wonderin' all my days

Travelin' East and West, on every known highway
South to North carryin' that torch until I'm old and grey

Well in the mean time in between I'm pushin' through this
I said in the main time in between I'm on my duty

Sometimes I get beat up, sometimes I'm the beater
Sometimes man my feet hurt from walkin' so long
Sometimes I'm defeated, sometimes I get cheated
Sometimes I just need it, 'cause sometimes I'm wrong
So the question's repeated, why even try?
When there's rocks in the road, pot-holes in the lawn
The victory's sweeter when obstacles either
Are side-stepped or crushed on the way to the door
So I go on my own, have faith in the road
I can share that control cause I'm never alone
I hear the creator speak to me through wispers
On winds the voices of friends and of foes
I listen to omens, the things that he shows me
Shows that he knows me and helps me along
And follow him closely, where he goes mostly
Guidin' my path on this map 'till I'm gone

That journey-a call me quick
That journey-a call my name
That journey-a have it's way
An' have me wonderin' all my days
That journey-a call me quick
That journey-a call my name
That journey-a have it's way
An' have me wonderin' all my days

And when they lay me down
To rest in my Earthly grave
And when they lay me down
Navigate that big sky wave

But in the meantime I, I got my duty
In the meantime in between time I, I got to do this
In the meantime in between time I, I'm pushin' through this
In the meantime in between time I, I got my duty

I got my.. I got my, I got my duty. I got my duty I know!

				",The Journey,2004
Fatboy Slim,"To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night

Switch the channel on my T-V,
And the cameras are fixed on me again,
I'm running and I'm running and I can't seem to hide,
The skies so red that I'm loosing my mind
I can't get my head to stop this feeling inside
The four walls are coming and I can't get outside

The fours walls have come taking all that's mind
There steeling my toys leave no memories behind
Everything's changing nothing seems the same,
They ? my thoughts not cars or trains
The thoughts were bought but kept me sane
Everything's changing nothing seems the same,

To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night

Stare out my window, I'm yearning for more
Bust for my borrowers and settle the score
I want my toys but the man out there's to hard
Running around, feet on the ground
Can't seem to understand this game there playing
And no one seem to wanna sit with me.

To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night

To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night

To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night",Long Way from Home,2004

I'm ready to forgive you honey
There's a light that shines between us
And it's worth the crying, lady

And my bones were cracking daily
No more weeping and lying now
And I'm holding you forever
And I'm holding you forever

Save us from the push and shove
Let us blend together
Find us and forgive us
Love love Lord above
Save us from the push and shove

Time they say, is the great healer
But I believe in chemicals baby
When the waves come crashing in
We are closer now than ever
We are closer now than ever

There was a cold space between us
Still we bridged that chasm lady
Desire love and friendship
We are sanctified together
We are sanctified together

Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah

All you used to do was put me down
But I found a way to pick myself up off the ground
And all you used to do was criticize me
But now I found the good and I emphasise, ya see

You would always get so sensitive
And try to turn your transgressions into my guiltiness
But now I'm certain of the way I live
And what I'm responsible for in this twisted game

And it's such a shame
That you try to make pain
Another word for my name
Whether giving or receiving
It's one the same
Just one more link
In your long-ass chain
But it's time to break
This frame and my strengthful will
Time to jump off this negative cycle we've built
Gave my heart
But my self-respection you won't steal
Now it's time to let ya know if you can hear me feel me

Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah

So I asked my mama for her two cents
And then I asked my little sister and I asked my friend
Then I asked my papa once and I asked him again
Came two little consensus from all them opinions
That life is too short to be unhappy
And since I know what I'm worth there'll be no settling for dirt
Knowing what I deserve is gold
If I want diamonds then I can't settle for coal

Maybe I was just too strong to let go
Maybe I was just too weak to let it show
Maybe I was just too stubborn to say ""No""
But whatever the case I can't take it no more

Sometimes I think maybe we'll patch it all up
Like a favourite pair of jeans that you won't give up on
Or maybe one of these arguments will make up
And start again like when we started this up
Back when everything was fresh
And every moment a blessing

You'd listen to my suggestions

With common decimation

ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah

All you used to do was put me down
But I found a way to pick myself up off the ground
And all you used to do was criticize me
But now I found the good and I emphasise, ya see

You would always get so sensitive
And try to turn your transgressions into my guiltiness
But now I'm certain of the way I live
And what I'm responsible for in this twisted game

And it's such a shame
That you try to make pain
Another word for my name
Whether giving or receiving
It's one the same
Just one more link
In your long-ass chain
But it's time to break
This frame and my strengthful will
Time to jump off this negative cycle we've built
Gave my heart
But my self-respection you won't steal
Now it's time to let ya know if you can hear me feel me

Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah

So I asked my mama for her two cents
And then I asked my little sister and I asked my friend
Then I asked my papa once and I asked him again
Came two little consensus from all them opinions
That life is too short to be unhappy
And since I know what I'm worth there'll be no settling for dirt
Knowing what I deserve is gold
If I want diamonds then I can't settle for coal

Maybe I was just too strong to let go
Maybe I was just too weak to let it show
Maybe I was just too stubborn to say ""No""
But whatever the case I can't take it no more

Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah

Sometimes I think maybe we'll patch it all up
Like a favourite pair of jeans that you won't give up on
Or maybe one of these arguments will make up
And start again like when we started this up
Back when everything was fresh
And every moment a blessing
I'd laugh at all of your jokes
You'd listen to my suggestions
One mind, one soul,
With common decimation
Now we can't help but fight over the direction",That Old Pair of Jeans,2006

They are blaming the insurgents; they are blocking off the streets
And the smoke is rising slowly from the barrel of a gun
The solution to disruption: Order 1081

Now the sunsets are incredible across Manila Bay
You can hear the bombers landing at the U.S. Air Force base
And somewhere in the distance, out beyond the setting sun
They will sign a proclamation: Order 1081

Now, we live down by the water in a shack that's made of wood
And the bankers need to huddle so they need some extra room
We will find us somewhere better; there's enough for everyone
Got a perfect explanation: Order 1081

I thought I ordered coffee, but they gave me 7-Up
Got to clear away these shanties and these ugly nipa huts
So the seeds of our great future, they can grow here when we're done
And it's clearly all because of Order 1081

The radio fell silent; nothing left to do but pray
And the senator he told us the guerrillas are on the run
And the reason they are hiding? Order 1081

They are planting plastic flowers on the seaside esplanade
The Pope is speaking Spanish, but we can't hear what he says
Got to stop all this confusion, got to wipe away this scum
And the way to make it happen: Order 1081

We'll recall just how
How she looked when she passed by

I know that you are in there somewhere
Whole Man drawing
Letters get misplaced in the mail
Guess that there was some confusion
Amidst those throngs and swells

Did you see me outside?
Did you see me wave
When you passed in your car?
Ah, well, that's okay

In body, in mind, and in spirit

You make him educated

What makes a home?
The answer is love
What is love when it's real?
The answer is beauty

We're talking about the whole man
When he's whole, we see him smile
But take just one part away from the rest
And now he's a a crocodile

What is love when it's real?
The answer is beauty

Beauty through time
Culture and spirit
At home where he lives
He's up when he's in it
The heart and the home
Wherever he lives
He's up when he's down
He takes when he gives

How do the children draw a tree?
Zero and one, are you following me?
Human order, woman and man
So on and on, are you seeing the plan?

Going in circles, chasing the dollar
Like a Pac-Man, a vicious creature
Here, over here, the center is mankind
But I'll never be a teacher

Was it something that I said?

How can you say this?
And when did you change?
You used to love me
Was it just pretend?

Why don't you love me?

Just look at Nixon
They tore him apart
How could you be so hard?
I gave you my heart

Someday they'll remember what I told you
Did it together, just you and me
Without a man in this family

I didn't raise them; it's you they love
They will remember the things you've done
Sometimes I felt that I've lost my mind
Things didn't work out the way we planned
And when they grow up and they make good
They will repay what I owe too

You'll be taken care of
And they'll remember you
Precious little children
On that you can be sure
You will never want for more

When they grow up, they'll be kind and smart
And you will see that they'll all go far
I haven't long, but I know it's true
These little ones owe a lot too

You'll be taken care of
And they'll remember you
Precious little children
On that you can be sure
You will never want for more

You'll be taken care of; they'll remember you
Someday they will give you things I never could
You'll be taken care of; on that you can be sure
If there's any justice in this world, you'll never want for more

Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now december found the love that we shared in september.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

I started with ten mack tens
And ten clips and ten pens
Got ten times richer in the span of ten years
Bitch I'm ten times two on a scale of one to ten
I'll battle ten crews with the strength of ten men

At nine, I was into crime, sex, and drugs
Pushin' an '89 Box Chevy sittin' on dubs
Nine thugs all ski masks, black suited with gloves
Break the imprinted chest with at least nine slugs

Man I ate eight clips with eight chicks
Watching eight flicks
You's 8-6 if you ate pussy with fake lips
I figure eight when my mind goes in circles
Did I do that or was it Mystikal and Urkel?

On to 7 AK 47, so what?
I got seven hoes stoppin' by at seven to fuck
Then put seven in your chest seven days a week
And add a foot for good measure you'll be seven feet deep

It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score

I got six hoes distributing on six blocks
It's blistering from cops tryin' to stop these rocks from distributing
Six gun shots left
One pint of Vodka before this pimp will hit
It's street justice, now it's six hole in your casket

Give me a high five and I'll put that nine lower than your esophagus
Then smack you so hard that you have to come with 2Pacalypse
Five stars, twenty rims, five cars
I'd add more but I had to subtract one from five bars

I got four forty-fours on a rip on the floor
For you niggas talkin' shit
I'm fixin' to show you what for
I did four months in the bing instead of a hearst
Now it's DTP for life, dog for better or worse

I fuck three best friends
Ran on all three the same game
In these streets I'm a murderer
I got three alias names
I'm three times insane
Three shots will cave your brain
On 3 fire and ready, cock back and aim

It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4

I'm packing two twenty-twos and twice the ammunition
But at Friday the 13th
What's up now superstition?
I'm a two timer with a couple of twins
Double jeopardy
With a pair of two deuces in the two seater Benz

I got one motto get dough till your gone
I got one main lady the rest of y'all is hoes
I'm numero uno with one more before I go
If you think I ain't the one bitch you too slow

And all you zero ass niggas ain't nothin' to me
Because I chop up O's, move dro', and chop keys
0-6 is my clique along with PC
Pretty Rick, Calil, V-Slim and Shondrez

It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1
Ludacris, Fake Feeze, and that nigga I-Twain
It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1

All this drinking going catch up
And all this smoking going catch up
But some niggas just really don't give a fuck
But some niggas just really don't give a fuck
And all this drinking going catch up
And all this smoking going catch up
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck

Now let me be quite Frank
Cause I'm that crazy nigga Luda
Always got a drink
And I'm steady smoking buddah
I do the
Evil that'll bend you when I get you
I'ma sit you down
Then take it to the mental and essential and clown
Every chance I get
Bitch I'm hit
Not by no bullet or no pellet 
But the smoke from the can a beer shit
I might just be too high
Then I put my middle finger up when I'm ridin' by
And say hi to plenty liquors and I know it's a sin
And if ya tell me stop drinking I'll just do it again
So when I get old I'ma rock, roll, shake, and shiver
With some blacked out lungs and a fucked up liver

[Chorus]

Hey yo I do this for bluntheads and whinos 
Steward Ave. Homes
Niggas from G-Ro committed to slanging blow
Doublin' dough 24-7
Fuck po-po's I'm blowin' dro out the Ac Legend
Running wit 2 strike felons
And I pack 4-4's like Hank Aaron
Then'll smoke a L
Bust shells
And dare ya to tell
Walk up in the club
Pretty thug
Fucked up off head shots
Sippin' Courvousier watchin' hoes drop it like it's hot
Shaking tits and twats
Placing big face 20's and cock
Loading clips and glocks
Knowing we got the haters hot
The ballin' don't stop
Just drop more G's on drink and drugs
Live it up young nigga cause it's gon' catch up

[Chorus]

Now wit the help of Hen and Coke
I grab my pen and pad and wrote
Something that I knew was dope
And represent for my kinfolk
Pimp a hoe until she broke
Wit mo lines than chopped coke
Hey yo it's 2-0 I'm Eastside's King
But I'm a writer with a twist of Amaretto
My shit even come out better
Grab a blunt put it together
What a nigga really need
Run up in the club and blow a motherfucker til he
bleed
Could it be an Icehouse put his lights out
Or the club get closed out
If it's hoes out I show out
Call Tyheed get Dro'd out
There's no doubt I love my life
Love the light
Love to write
Love the mic
So take a drag
Grab a bag and match up
Hennessey and bad weed
Believe me it catch up

High rights, low lefts, even stevens and fades

Hi-tec boots spray painted witcha names
T-shirts airbrushed that read the same
Thick herringbone chain, one gold with yo' initial
Harris Photos, group shots, can you remember?
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
When she disobeyed, had North Clayton crazed
Just to reiterate dog those was the days
Fo' the invasions of haters, man crews from all around
Used to get down at True Flavas, bumpin Key Lo
Rockin Damage, Cross Colour and Paco

Prom night, tux and Kangol was so cool
Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school)

Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids

In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
Hamwood and Diplomats
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
We was lovin' that
Before they started jackin' jacks
For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
College Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care
Kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin'
Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet
Want your Kool-Aid and sugar, smack your hands and say ""sweat""

I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets
Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin' all that got damn noise, man

Fates Warning,"Dark and dampness lingers
in body and in soul.
Dead wall of stone I cry out
for twenty years alone.
Exanimate a penance
not fit for man nor beast.
Innocent of mortal sin,
do hear me out at least.

Man of strong mind and soul
deserves a second chance.
Just to see a glimpse of light
would warm my icy hands.

Any kin or family
just an echo in my mind.
Silence loudens tribulations
that I left behind.
Just then a beam of light projects
from underneath a rock.
Could it be escape I'm free.
I'll dig my fingers raw.

Man of strong mind and soul
deserves a second chance.
Just to see a glimpse of light
would warm my icy hands.

Deep in your mind look for the answer,
it'll be there.
Life, strange illusion,
stay low, it'll take care.
Time is the sentence in which
you must abide.
Make sin your companion,
then Satan be your bride.

The tunnels deep and twisting
as I press my body through and through
Entrapped in this one way passage,
in light I must pursue and soon.
I grasp the bars at the end of my crawl,
as I gape down to the sea.
The skeleton of a man who tried,
a fool just like me.

Man of strong mind and soul
deserves a second chance.

Trapped within a world, a world apart
Desolate am I, a tempest raging silently
Lost a-barren, adrift at sea

Catatonic state, it sharpens life's depressing edge
The clamor draws me closer to the ledge
As I gaze upon this burning world, I curse this life
A life through which I'm hurled

Lies, lies upon this side and that
Truthless violence, deception, mourned by the wise
Thousands of voices drowning out his own
In a popular torrent of lies upon lies
Turn to stone

So intense the pain that has crawled
From the bleeding corpse of pleasure
That feeds the worm the writhes
Inside my brain

In the deep of night it stirs again
In the heart of the sleeper
From the crack of dawn I wake to curse
The rising of the sun

Every life is built on hope
Now my dreams have surely passed
Inner voices haunt my numbered days
Darkness calls me with her laughs

Torn between life and death inertia
Fills my soul
No will to be nor pride to care
Reapers take your toll

Strangers cast a menacing glance
As existence I defy
Shatter their dream like world I'm not
Afraid to die

Omen bird soars the desert land to the castle
Of idolence, there lies the shadow of a man
See the colored flowers and marble towers
They fade to brown

Like the unknown inscribed in stone
He's abandoned, abandoned flesh and bones
He's lost in silence, swallowed in vastness
Drowned in the depths of a meaningless
Past

Compelled I just can't resist it, take me

Take me away take me away
I want to know what's deep within
Take me away
Drawing near someone passes through me
A silent entity never looking back I won't dare

As I feared I travel not alone
Laughter echoes with the blatant wind
I have passed the threshold deep within me

No mortal dares to enter here

Spring eternal, spiritual water physical fire
Above center is sky, cold cold neverness
Just vastness filled with stars upon stars
In the four corners of life are the golden mirrors
Reflecting what you are and what you are to be
In the first is a young boy white dove in
His hand, in the second is a warrior in armor,
In the third is the old man, gold watch
In his hand, fourth and last

No reflection at all
No reflection at all
No reflection at all

Tears stream from her face
Unto my hand, unto my heart

I remembered you, will you remember me?

Helpless child without a name
With broken wings, catch me I'm fallin'

I'm a question with no answer who are
You that takes my life away from me
Unveil the boundaries of the black

I had a dream I was you
Strong as the fire in my veins
And when I called out your name

I would remain to witness the pain
I am beyond silent black
I will be back as your guardian

Angels in white you have sacrificed
You witness and bury the pain
Walk hand and hand with the fear stricken child
Strengthen the weak and the lame

Have you seen beyond the unborn?
Pillar of penance and lore
Perpetual journey into the realm
The sovereign servitor

I will wish upon a star, I believe in you
And if my will has strayed afar
I remembered you, will you remember me?

Fortunes found in holy halls
Redeem your every fault
When dogmas given are blindly held
And treasures given caught
Any wish can only last
Until the spell's descried
While subtle, wicked ways
Fracture weakened minds

Slaves of a different kind march to broken bells
Freedom in a bind and make it all sound well
Blackened blue etched in glass forming outer walls
Tell clearly of the emptiness and mute distressful calls

Lines lead to dead ends where
Plays seen are never clear
And those who ride never fare

Crowned voids forever rule
In worlds lived and learned of fools
Conformity's the teachers' tool

Driven by aging winds
The walls give way to the rush
And let reality in

Betrayed by innocence
Deceived by delusions
Plagiarized promises
Pale into empty hopes

In reference to daylight
As dreamers awaken
In sleepers somber shade
Ocean waves shift leaving
Only memories
Final traces of hope
Are swallowed in the deep
Despair sends a certain calm
A vague sense of relief
Released from all our longings
Silently we'll sleep
Hope leads to quiet desperation
When reality obscures the dream
Makes the mind a grave of memories
That wander like the lonely breeze
Whose whispers echo through ruins rust
Of towers torn and dreams turned to dust

Caving in

Beneath the dust of our days
Hides the key to our emotions
And it's been a while since we've been moved
Without going through the motions
No emotions

Feels like I'm descending out of reason
While mountains burn before my eyes

As the March flames take all away

Hand and hand with the ghosts of home
Another new horizon
Familiar scene of childhood dislocation
Fingers traced the colored lines
Another road, another destination

And farewell to the walls and windows
Waved to no one in particular

Stranger in a strange land
You walk the halls nervous and unseen
Keep your head down don't raise your hand
Alone in the crowd, a ghost in the machine

Home again, home again

Half remembered neighborhoods
Twisted branches in dying woods
Broken bones and childhoods
Broken homes in lost boyhoods

Summer wars in the woods
Fleeting blood brotherhoods
Hoped to run but never stood
Wished to stay but never could

What did you hope to find
Home again, what could you find?
In doorways and window panes, in broken glass and faded frames

Can clocks turn back, the years unwind
Are you still hiding there now
A ghost, trapped behind those walls?

Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you

They're just like the ones before

Father John Misty,"At six
For some reason when I go to the app

The comedy of man starts like this
Our brains are way too big for our mother's hips
And so Nature, she divines this alternative
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever greets us on the other end
Is kind enough to fill us in
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look after the kids
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this thing its milk?
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch
It's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy
Just waiting until the part where they start to believe
They're at the center of everything
And some all-powerful being endowed this horror show with meaning

Oh, their religions are the best
They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks, these unbelievable outfits
And they get terribly upset
When you question their sacred texts
Written by woman-hating epileptics

Their languages just serve to confuse them
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring
And hand out prizes when someone patents the cure
Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?
What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable?
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new gods
So they can go on being godless animals

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but to believe
Their horizons that just forever recede
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs
That they never ever have to leave

Oh comedy
Oh it's like something that a madman would conceive!
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive is the struggle to survive
But the only thing that they request is something to numb the pain with
Until there's nothing human left
Just random matter suspended in the dark
I hate to say it, but each other's all we got",Pure Comedy,2017

If you're bent on taking demons down with only your fist
And I've never known anyone who could lose himself in a bigger paper bag

Like the Starvation Army needs a marching piano in the band

It's nothing but teens in ravines
And antics on concrete down here
And are you really as free as all the great songs would have me believe?
Let me tell you why some day, Birdie, you're gonna envy me

Some dream of a world written in lines of code
I hope they engineer out politics, romance, and edifice
Two outta three ain't bad

Some envision a state governed by laws of business
Merger and acquisition instead of violence or nations
Where do I sign up?

Take off, little winged creature
It's nothing but falling debris, strollers, and babies down here
And you may be up in the sky but our paradigms are just as deep and just as wide
What with all our best attempts at transcendence
Something's bound to take

Soon, we'll live in a global culture devoid of gender or race
There's just one tiny line
You're either born behind
Or you're free to peek inside

Life as just narrative, metadata in aggregate
Where the enigma of humanity's wrapped up finally
That as they say is that

Oh, that day can't come soon enough
It'll be so glorious
When they finally find out what's bugging us",Birdie,2017
Father John Misty,"I was living on the hill
By the water tower and hiking trails
And when the big one hit I’d have a seat
To watch masters abandon their dogs and dogs run free
Oh baby, it’s time to leave
Take the van and the hearse down to New Orleans
Leave under the gaze of the billboard queens
Five-foot chicks with parted lips selling sweatshop jeans

These L.A. phonies and their bullshit bands
That sound like dollar signs and Amy Grant
So reads the pull quote from my last cover piece
Entitled ""The Oldest Man in Folk Rock Speaks”
You can hear it all over the airwaves
The manufactured gasp of the final days
Someone should tell them ‘bout the time that they don’t have
To praise the glorious future and the hopeless past

A few things the songwriter needs
Arrows of Love, a mask of Tragedy
But if you want ecstasy or birth control
Just run the tap until the water's cold

Where only the armed or the funny make it out alive

Mara taunts me 'neath the tree
She's like, ""oh great, that's just what we all need
Another white guy in 2017
Who takes himself so goddamn seriously""
She's not far off, the strange thing is
That's pretty much what I thought when I started this
It took me my whole life to learn to the play the G
But the role of Oedipus was a total breeze

Still I dreamt of garnering all rave reviews
Just believably a little north of God's own truth
""He's a national treasure now, and here's the proof
In the form of his major label debut""
A little less human with each release
Closing the gap between the mask and me
I swear I'll never do this, but is it okay?
Don't want to be that guy but it's my birthday
If everything ends with the photo then I'm on my way

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

I watched my old gods all collapse
Were way more violent than my cartoon past
It's like my father said before he croaked
""Son, you're killing me, and that's all folks""
So why is it I'm so distraught
That what I'm selling is getting bought
At some point you just can't control
What people use your fake name for

So I never learned to play the lead guitar
I always more preferred the speaking parts
Besides there's always someone willing to
Fill up the spaces that I couldn't use
Nonetheless, I've been practicing my whole life
Washing dishes, playing drums, and getting by
Until I figured, if I'm here then I just might
Conceal my lack of skill here in the spotlights
Maya, the mother of illusions, a beard, and I

2000 years or so since Ovid taught
Night-blooming, teenage rosebuds, dirty talk
And I'm merely a minor fascination to
Manic virginal lust and college dudes
I'm beginning to begin to see the end
Of how it all goes down between me and them

Plays as they all jump ship, ""I used to like this guy
This new shit really kinda makes me wanna die""

My first memory of music's from
The time at JCPenney's with my mom
The watermelon candy I was choking on
Barbara screaming, ""Someone help my son!""

That's when I first saw the comedy won't stop for
Even little boys dying in department stores

And I wanna stay on that magic mountain

The slower, the better
The slower, the better
'Cause there's no one old on magic mountain
There's no one old, old on magic mountain

And that was the very last barn I'm burning

Oh oh oh

My social life is now quite a bit less hectic
The nightlife and the protests are pretty scarce
Now I mostly spend the long days walking through the city
Empty as a tomb
Sometimes I miss the top of the food chain
But what a perfect afternoon

Industry and commerce toppled to their knees
The gears of progress halted
The underclass set free
The super-ego shatters with our ideologies
The obscene injunction to enjoy life
Disappears as in a dream
And as we return to our native state
To our primal scene
The temperature, it started dropping
The ice floes began to freeze

From time to time we all get a bit restless
With no one advertising to us constantly

Some nights has meat and dancing

Put em on tracks, and let's see how they act as the aftermath
Increase accelerate the sun behind you radiate, to burn to ashes
Ain't one of the parties you been crashing
Bring the beat and I'm a slash it
My niggas make sure the doors have been barricaded
It's about to sign off, some shit you can read in ? block spin?
But make no mistake, devil players, penetrate with your smarts
Redrum mania reincarnate to another shape
Bomb flashes, what can happen, new jack-in
Your rappin' ain't the magnum so when he cought up to half these
Niggaz even stole the soul of the streets in motion

Expand your mind
Seek and you shall find

Walkin through the penile glands, like it was a unfathered man
Knowledge is the key to the mind which is a mysterious doorway
Through a long dark hallway
Use your conscious as a compass to avoid bein' conquered
By nonsense, use your subconscious as a map
Once it's time to head back use your food for thought
And leave bread tracks
Now we can see the third eye, swift as you burn fly
You need common sense as a detour
Up ahead there lies three doors for you to see more
You might have to meditate to the soft melodies from a keyboard
Understandin' is your flashlight
It reflects the windows to your past life
No psychiatric's could raid you from off the mattress
As you fall deeper, and it's hypnotized you better read my lips
Cause that's the guide, out the hallways of negative
Which is always competitive, therefore
You must never let it live

Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind, seek and you shall find
Expand your mind, seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find

Why girls play with my feelings?
I don't know so that's why I ask
Maybe it's true that I set myself up
But then again it's the question I asked
I want someone for me who is straight
A kind of cutie. Yes, yep, a smart mate
I've been around searching for the right one
But it seems like a waste of my time
Every time that I meet the right 1
It seems as if she plays with my mind
So it makes me on the defense side
Because my offense is sort of slow
It doesn't pay to tell someone ""I love you""
Because in my vocab ""I love u"" is a no, no
I think I give in. My feelings, they show
I think I'd better not look back
I've been down a little too long
And now it's time that I get on track
So I must... 

Chorus

I like to mingle when I do mingle
I love to mingle when I do flirt
I get off hand and tell the stories
About my past & that's when it hurts
But I need to find for me a lonesome lady type
Who wants me for self
A woman who wants me because of Father
Not for the fame or for my wealth
So I can ""Show her how I feel""
Yeah, ladies I'm not that picky
But being picky is just for self
I must protect what I respect
And that is me & not someone else
I've been mistreated up on the downhill
Back in the days I used to be strong
I used to flirt, hurt, kind of jerk
Get the cash, the sex then I'm gone
But payback is a mother
And now I don't know who to trust
So I just... 

Chorus

Yeah, you know women? Yeah they tell me I'm lovely & cuddly but I just don't understand why they want to play with my feelings. But it won't happen again.
Nah, never.

(No, no no no no no...)

So listen ladies I'll treat you
How you treat me back in return.
I'm not rude. No, I'm not stuck up
But my feelings are my main concern
So don't think that I'd give in
Cause now I know how to show
My feelings when I get involved
I'll take it slow before I say ""Oh, No""
I'll treat you like you treat me
I'll be straight loyal & all
So don't take advantage of Father
Because I'll step up but not crawl
So give me what you can give me
Love, attention, a lot of respect
I don't ask for a whole lot
But I'm gone if you wanna step
That's why I like to take it slow
Not rush because I want more
The next time that I fall in love
Hmm, you bets I'll be sure

(I'm gonna treat you...)

They couldn't help enough
They shot my veins full of gelatin

I said, ""thank you very much
You're too kind!""
While they lived in luxury
I made do with money, sweet money

And now I'm going to measure the rain
And you can sit and watch me -- look! look!
Don't even think about not answering your phone
It might be me and I know you're always home

Destroy you

Lady Godiva, dressed so demurely
Pats the head of another curly-haired boy
A spurting pink toy
Sick with silence, she weeps sincerely
Saying words that have all so clearly been said (""You will do--"")
So long ago (""--what I tell you."")
[...]
Here today now and dipped in the water
Making love to every poor daughter's son
Isn't it fun?
""Doctor is coming,"" the nurse thinks SWEETLY
Turning on the machines that NEATLY PUMPS AIR
(""Make the incision at the base of the skull."")
The body lies bare

(""I want you to think of me as someone you can come to with your problems."")

Shaved and hairless, what once was SCREAMING
Now lies silent and almost sleeping
The brain must have got away
Strapped securely to the white table
Beneath the gauze the body will wither and writhe
Underneath the white light
Doctor arrives with knife and baggage
Sees the growth as just so much cabbage (""Take the bone saw--"")
That must now be cut away (""--and cut around the perimeter."")
Now comes the moment of great, great decision
Doctor is making the first incision
One goes here and one goes there
""Ether tubes are leaking"", says someone who's sloppy
Patient, it seems, is not so well sleeping
The screams echo up the hall
Don't panic, someone give him pentathol instantly
Doctor removes the blade cagily so from the brain
By my count of ten--the head won't move
(""And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen--the human brain."")

Haaaaa!! Here we go, everybody!!

She has killed for her pleasure / She makes you look slow and stupid
And you cannot escape her--no creator!
Her frantic behavior--no creator!

Rough ground to a dim horizon

Fatlip,"Hello, boys and girls, my name is Fat Lip
And this is my friend, Sammy the Salmon
Today we're gonna teach you some
Fun facts about salmon and a brand new dance

Let me introduce to you a brand new dance
I know you're gonna love it if you give it one chance
It's not complicated, it's not too hard
You don't even have to be a hip hop star

See, anyone can do it, all you need is style
Listen up, people gang, I'm a show you how
Your hands to the side as silly as it seems
Shake your body like a salmon floating upstream

(I float upstream)
You know how we do it
You know how we do it again

All my peeps spend part of their life
In fresh water and part of their life in salt water
Wow, very interesting
They change round a couple of days after spawning then we die

When I first did the salmon all the people just laughed
They looked around and stood like I was on crack
I heard somebody say out loud
""What the fuck is that?
This nigga's dancing like a fish, while he's doing the snap""

But the more I kept doing it, the more they were feeling it
And then I heard some bitches say, ""Yo, that nigga's killing it""
By the end of the night, everyone was on my team
And the whole club was dancing like a salmon floating upstream

(I float upstream)
You know how we do it
You know how we do it again

Most of our friends find their home waters by sense of smell
Which is even more keen than that of a dog or a bear
Wow, my family also rely on ocean currents, tides
The gravitational pull of the moon

(I float upstream again)
The moon? Fish pay attention to the moon?
Wow, who knew?

Did you know
What?
That I could go to Japan and back?
You're kidding me? Amazing, Geez

Polluted water can kill both baby salmon
That are developing and the adult salmon
That are on their way to spawn

Wow, what a shame, what a shame
Hey, kids, hey give it up for Sammy the Salmon
And his amazing salmon dance
What ya say? Alright, who's hungry?",The Salmon Dance,

Feelin' downtrodden
Fresh kid turned rotten
I can't believe I'm like E then I'm cotton
Over the years seems like I'm gettin' dumber
Reminiscing to a time when I was younger with a hunger
Full a dreams, determination, self-esteem 
But now it seems they hesitate to be on my team
You know the routine, when you winnin' and grinnin'
All up in your face, like they was wi'ch you from the beginnin'
But on the flipside,
When you washed up like a riptide
Fools clown 'bout how you slipped and let shit slide
Beside the fact
My voice is wack
Clowns is runnin' around, talkin' 'bout I smoke crack
Ain't got no homies that got my back
Yeah I'm a brotha, but some times I don't feel black
My girl is white
My game idn't tight

Type that try turn a ho to a housewife

I give respect
And feel for hoes niggas keep in check
I'm far from hard

I make myself sick

No one was givin us nuttin so we resorted to gunnin
Growin up and we comin, up the ladder not bummin
Dodgin warrants and summons, from the cops we were runnin
Goin to school not for nuttin they teachin lies and assumptions
And they tell us keep comin, comin to school now for what? When
Comin back to a system that's whack and really not runnin
Oh I'm sorry it's runnin, it's not PROPERLY runnin

But just like them dopefiends who keep comin back
Like the mayor of D.C., buyin Joey's crack
No disrespect to either one of them but look at that
Study the metaphors in this rap
We bigger than crack, but we keep buyin it
We bigger than rap, but we keep denyin it
Justice, equality, keep cryin it
But the only way to get it is to start applyin it

50 Cent that's my bro he shows 'nuff respect
Common! That's my bro he shows 'nuff respect

I'm livin for that hip-hop culture, shape it like a sculpture
Touch it why don'tcha, touch it why don'tcha
Hip-Hop is yours and mine and that's fine
But hip-hop's culture ain't about just crime
You caught up in the image and, don't know they rhymes
You caught up in they bodies and don't know they minds
So I'm, here to bring the truth in the place
Like don't think Common won't punch you in your face~!
And don't think Talib won't hold the heat
To stop the violence you gotta know your street
You gotta know who Tanga Reed is
Fat Joe's a leader, Busta Rhymes a preacher
KRS-One's a teacher
But through Cassidy my lessons are quicker to reach ya
We one community
I'm talkin about unity, in other words you and me

Fatman Scoop,"(Ohh!) Yeah (let's go!)
I said once upon a time in a city that's mine
There was a nigga named Nickel that spit like Big in his prime
He got a fifty two box, original tick in the mind
Listenin to 'Pac and them drop with a prestigious design
My niggaz is dimes, my bitches is dimes
I came up behind Eminem in '99 and I took the baton
I been runnin' shit ever since then, slaughtered MC's
Sit and watchin 'my green grow, like I'm waterin' seeds
The problem with me is I'm the heart of the streets
Niggaz callin' for peace, they can't even call the police
If I ain't better than you I'm harder to beat
Probably cause I live by the art of for-keeps
I get indicted after my product's released
We a different form, a different centrifugal force
Every line is like grippin' on a stick shift in a Porsche
My niggaz asked for direction to go on this track
I said fuck a direction, spaz out! Get 'em up high!


And for them wack songs that you made
I want you to throw your pin, but hold the grenade
Explode to your grave, and go straight to hell 
When your soul is enflamed for the road that you paved
The role that played, in fuckin' up hip-hop
You owe so you paid, the fo'-fo' close to your brain
Closer than the close shave of a low fuckin' fade
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with J-O-E
With Nickel we gon' make more cheese
Heavy hitter, call me Joell David Ortiz (what up!)
I point a burner at the plaque on your teeth
On some leftover shit, it's a wrap on the beef
I'm one in a mil', comin' to kill
It's like you wanting a pill, my gun put your back on the streets
Spine on the concrete lookin' at the sun
Eyelids heavy, ""Why did Crooked have to come?
He was full of 'gnac and rum, like a bully actin' dumb""
Fully-automatic umm, that's Crooked havin fun
Listen, don't make a nigga find your dame
And make the dime give me brains 'til my mind is drained
Listen, don't make me grab a nine and aim
And how your dime did me, do yo' mind the same
But different, the West Coast king Crooked I
I'm a kamikaze pilot, I stay fly 'til I die, get 'em up high!

Here we go again, you know I'm him, Mr. Ortiz
Soon as I hold a pen I co-defend the sickest MC's (Slaughterhouse)
Pick a disease we got it, I vomit sniffle and sneeze
Lyrics squeeze, listen please, Lord help get rid of this fever
I'm like a hundred and fifity degrees
sixteen's used to be sweet, now they're a bit of a tease
A nigga need a infinite instrumental just to be pleased
Used to dream about livin' now I'm livin' my dreams
The bitches fiend, made my dick a machine
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I am just as fuckin' big as I seem
When I'm spittin' this mean, me and government intervene
A couple presidents, literally live in my jeans
I give 'em residence, they just let me pick anything
When I'm in the mall, they show me the latest kicks on the scene
And I get 'em all, I ball like the nigga I am
Niggaz hate, bitches (Cheer) like Norm, Cliff and Diane
I'm in a state, of mind that should be the fifty verse
I run radio, but I don't use them itty bitty words
I ain't shabby with the nouns, I ain't shitty with the verb
When I reach heaven I want the nigga Biggie to be like ""Word""
City slicker, New York delivery when I swerve
Hold that mic like the Statue of Liberty, I deserve
A shot at the title, 'Spitter of the Year'
E'ry year, let's be clear, put some fingers in the air
And hold 'em up high! [echoes]

Work on your half-court shot, I'm money from far
Get 'em mad, see a ape on your monkey bars
And that's rate, gettin' hate from the wannabe stars
And that's great, mean he feel it and know he numb
See that bullet comin' from around the corner 
Like a shot from Angelina Jolie's gun; think Joey the one
I'm a fake? Ain't your run-of-the-mill
I'm from where they kill you for one of your bills
For me it's fun, your man think we evenly skilled
He Mel Gibson, all that shit he believe, gon' get his son killed
Play with a match, fuck what you take it as
No good straight jacket, all I did break the match
They say he talk tough with his fake ass
Four pounds put me in another weight class
(Great Escape) the (Pad)
Took the jumpsuit off my naked ass and ate the mask
You diss me, you wanna be a great that fast?
Take a fully-automatic and spray at gas
Me? Body a whole shit with a verse probably atrocious
In your whole camp, nobody focused
They say you the 'Ultimate Warrior', I agree
You die and come BACK, won't nobody know it
Drive by, screamin' it's a new crew reppin'
Hangin out the window, like it's ""227""
Get 'em up high!

Get 'em up high, get 'em up high
Get 'em up high, get 'em up high
Get 'em up high, in the sky
Put 'em up high, put 'em up high
Put 'em up high, fingers in the sky

To baggin and pitchin to gettin rid of it in a raid

Ain’t no problem, I’m on it oldest man in the club
Also one of the richest, a hundred bottles of bub
It’s just me and the Russians, we get all of the love
They was aware of the image, they wanna see what he does
TMZ in my face, Oprah all on my couch
Now I’m hosting the Grammys, what is this all about?
International baller, I must admit I had doubts
If they wasn’t callin’ me back, they was callin’ me out
Game moved to the South, I just closed my mouth
Intellect like Belichick when he be switching the routes
I’m too old for the games, no time for the lames
Next challenge? Get this generation screaming my name
Who could do what I did? Boy, I must be the shit
Waved 106 & Park to play date with the kids
People texting my wife, tryna ruin my night
So I help ‘em mind they business with some bottles on ice

Ice so cold you can see it through the fog

And if you step by the pockets, you gon’ be up in the morgue
The peoples is peepin’, peepin’
The bitches is dippin’, dippin’
So this is the mission, listen, I turn this shit up
It’s the party-rocking, nonstopping, four-hopping, rip and rock
Drippin’ in this motherfucker, burn up, now turn up!

We ain’t flirtin’, we talkin’ – we ain’t dancin’, we walkin’
Teenagers is pointin’, couple cougars are hawkin’
I don’t come here that often, but it’s totally awesome
When you livin’ for real, I don’t consider it flossin’
Panty lines are crossin’, I’m proceedin’ with caution
I don’t shit where I eat, gotta manage your portions

Representing alone, sittin’ on factory chrome
Shades on, in the zone – Kool Aid smile on my face
My security’s strapped, ain’t no beef, just in case
Me and my man Rich Whites, we in Vegas tonight
Claudine on the celly, make sure that money is right
Red carpet and tuxes, always where the bucks is
Paparazzi are snapping, I can’t believe this is happening
Frustrating the haters, they’re so sick of me rapping
I’m enjoying your blog, I’ve got the same type of passion

They ain’t think I can do it, that’s why I had to debut it
And let the critics review it, that way I spit and it’s Buicks

Had the guts to pursue it, that’s how a legend should do it

Fato,"Si pudiera ser tu cama
O la funda de tu almohada
Ser el agua que te moja
O la toalla que te abraza
Y secar tu piel mojada

Si pudiera ser tu sombra
Y seguirte a donde vayas
Ser el aire que respiras
El espejo donde a diario
Te maquillas

Pero solo soy, un simple terrenal
Que vive alucinando
Eso de llamarte por las noches y colgar
Se me sigue dando

Pero solo soy, un simple terrenal
Que sueña con tenerte
Mientras vivas yo no quito el dedo del renglón
Para tu buena suerte

Si pudiera ser la ropa
Que te viste y que te toca
Ser el cauce de tu río
El sueño más erótico, y prohibido

Pero solo soy, un simple terrenal
Que vive alucinando
Eso de llamarte por las noches y colgar
Se me sigue dando

Que sueña con tenerte
Mientras vivas yo no quito el dedo del renglón

Por fin me encuentro 
Frente a frente

Extraña sensación buscar adentro
En libertad de sentirme preso
Frente al espejo llorar mis miedos

Miedo de sentirme solo teniéndote
Miedo al no sentir tus manos sobre mi piel
Miedo al no saber que piensas si te hago falta
Ganas de tirar mi ego por la ventana

Y me pregunto qué hago aquí 
Sin ti

Esto de mostrarme frente al mundo
A cara limpia no sé si es justo

Se dice que el amor puede ser ciego
En libertad de sentirme preso

Miedo al no sentir tus manos sobre mi piel
Miedo al no saber que piensas si te hago falta

Made her look a little like a military man

As the rose of the dawning

With the tide in the dawning,
Still my heart's

Blue Italian skies above
I said, lady, I'm a rover
Can you spare
A sweet word of love?

Her hand I could see
She wore a plain golden ring
On her finger

When you treat me this way
I know I love you
But what can I do
I'm a fool to care
I'm a fool to cry
When you tell me goodbye
You left me so blue
When you were untrue
I'm a fool to care
I know I should laugh
And call it a day
But I know I was right
If you went away
I'm a fool to care
When you don't care for me
So why should I pretend
I lose in the end
I'm a fool to care

I don't do no more

You can tell from the smile I wear
Oh yes I'm livin' right

Gotta good thing goin' 
With the best lookin' woman in town
Lies I used to tell
I don't tell no more

I give to Stagger Lee

And talk about it all the time
History lesson number two
Not what you say but what you do
There you go just like that

We try to find the peace through war
Although it's never worked before
If we want peace we've got to start
To heal the hurt in every heart
There you go just like that

There you go just like that",Just Like That,2004
Fats Kaplin,"If life is like a candle bright
Then death must be the wind
You know you can close your window tight
And it still comes blowing in

So I will climb the highest hill
And I'll watch the rising sun
And I pray that I won't feel the chill
Till I'm too old to die young

[Chorus]
Let me watch my children grow
To see what they become
Lord don't let that cold wind blow
Till I'm too old to die young

I have had some real good friends
I thought would never die
But now all that I got left of them
Are these tear drops in my eyes

So if I could have one wish today
And I know it would be done
I'd say everyone could stay
Till they're too old too die young

[Chorus: x2]",Till I'm Too Old to Die Young,2004
Fats Kaplin,"Old dirty dog walking down the street
No shadow did he cast
Clock on the wall
No hands at all
No present, no future, no past

[Chorus]
You can't save everybody
No word, no deed, no praise
You can't save everybody
Everybody don't want to be saved

Old headstones, old buried bones
Just laying 'round cemetery deep
I'm burning matches
For the sake of making ashes
Just trying to get some sleep

[Chorus]

Poetry pages filled through the ages
With words that don't make no sense
Quart of beer in a brown paper sack
Two dollars away from the rent

[Chorus]",You Can't Save Everybody,2004
Fats Kaplin,"Someday we’ll roll away the stone that we’ve carried for so long
All our burdens will be gone, and I can’t wait
We will find our way to an understanding of all views
No prayer shall be refused, I can’t wait

It seems we’ve gone too far now we don’t know where we are
I believe we’ll find a guiding star, but I can’t wait
If faith is the final place where all fears have been erased
And the locks have fallen from the gates, I can’t wait.

Someday we’ll roll away the stone that we have carried for",I Can't Wait,2006
Fats Navarro,male speaking,The Chase,
Fats Navarro,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good",1977
Fats Navarro,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me [Live],1996
