The Strange Familiar,"Take the blame off your back,
It's a burden you don't own.
Lay your head in my arms, 
And I will be your home.
You can't carry this alone.

And I just wanna love you.
I don't wanna change you or judge you.
I just wanna love you,
But darling you have to learn to love you too.

I will count every line,
This life is carved in you.
Beauty lies in these eyes cause I can see the truth.
I see the strength in you.

And I just wanna love you.
I don't wanna change you or judge you.
I just wanna love you,
But darling you have to learn to love you too.
And I just wanna love,

You hide behind your massive stone.
You don't have to be alone.
Miles and lives you could've lived.
You're the only one you still need to forgive.

And I just wanna love you.
I don't wanna change you or judge you.
I just wanna love you,
I just wanna love you,

I just wanna love you.
I don't wanna change you or judge you.
I just wanna love you,
But darling you have to learn to love you too.",I Just Want to Love You,
The Strange Familiar,"Please don't go
Don't go away
Cause you and I
We're meant to be

It's more than love to me
Oh, this is gravity
 
Don't dent what's in your soul
When you left, you left a hole in my heart
There's no other choice I'd make
You're a risk I have to take
My mind's made up

Please don't go
Don't go and change
Don't ever change a thing for me
Please don't go
Don't go away
Cause you and I were meant to be

I can't fight the way I feel
Surrendering, let fate take the wheel
Can't you see I'm not afraid?
Cause I know what it costs to have already lost you

It's more than love to me
A wave upon the sea
Oh, this is gravity

Please don't go
Cause you and I were meant to be
Please don't go
Cause you and I were meant to be
It's more than love to me
Oh, this is gravity",This is Gravity,
The Strange Familiar,"The lights are going down
In every city town
But you’ll be fast asleep
There’s no one that can keep
The dream out of your heart
And when you fall apart
Just hold your head up high
You have an alibi in me

Can’t compromise me for you
That kind of trade would never do
Wearing shoes that don’t quite fit
You lose yourself bit by bit
Completely alone now, blank page beginning
Empty head the world is spinning
Control the strings, dancing puppet on a stage
A cage

The lights are going down
In every city town
But you’ll be fast asleep
There’s no one that can keep
The dream out of your heart
And when you fall apart
Just hold your head up high
You have an alibi in me

Late in the afternoon
The winter’s cold will soon
Rewrite the summer’s lies
With frozen alibis

The lights are going down
In every city town
But you’ll be fast asleep
There’s no one that can keep
The love out of your heart
And when you fall apart
Just hold your head up high
You have an alibi in me",Alibi,2012
The Strange Tones,"If you want some loving,
That I can give to you.
And if you want some hugging, 
Said I can hug some, too.

All I want, baby, now
Is some thought of you
And just a little of your affection,
You know, will see me through.

'Cause you know that you are my man,
And I want you to forever be mine.
I idolize you (Yes, she idolize you)
",I Idolize You,2005
The Strangeloves,"I know a girl who's soft and sweet
She's so fine, she can't be beat
Got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire

I want candy, I want candy

Go to see her with her hair hung down
Ain't no finer girl in town
Candy's just what the doctor ordered
She's so sweet, she makes my mouth water

I want candy, I want candy
I want candy, I want candy
I want candy, I want candy

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Candy on the beach, there's nothing better
But I like candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make her mine
Then I'll have candy all the time

I want candy, I want candy

Hey
Hey
Hey",I Want Candy,1991
The Strangers,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

It's too late baby, it's too late now darling
It's too late.",It's Too Late,1995
The Strangers,"My driftin' memory goes back to the spring of '43,
When I was just a child in momma's arms.
My daddy plowed the ground and promised someday we would leave
This run-down mortgaged Oklahoma farm.
Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my momma
That he'd finally saved enough to go.
California was his dream, a paradise, for he had seen
Pictures in magazines that told him so.

California cotton fields,
Where labor camps were filled with weary men with broken dreams.
California cotton fields,
As close to wealth as daddy ever came.

Nearly everything we had was sold or left behind,
From my daddy's plow to the soup that momma canned.
Some folks came to say farewell or see what all we had to sell",California Cottonfields,
The Strangers,"Carolyn, let me tell you what I heard about a man today
He didn't come home from work and he went away
Till he came to a city, bright in the nighttime like day
There they say he met with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Their warm lips like a honeycomb, dripped with honey
And somethin' about the smell of strange perfume
Made him feel warm, and not alone

Yes, Carolyn a man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
I believe a man will do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn, a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home 

Yes Carolyn a man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
And I believe a man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn, a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home",Carolyn,
The Strangers,"Tonight there'll be candlelight and roses
In this little country chapel that's almost falling down
There'll be tears in this old farmer's eyes this evening
When I give my one possession to that city boy from town

His hair is a little longer than we're use to
But, I guess I should find something good to say
About this man whose won the farmer's daughter
And will soon become my son-in-law today

Mama left eight years ago December
And it was hard to be a Dad and Mama too
But, somehow we made home of this old farmhouse
And love was all my baby ever knew

He could be the richest man in seven counties
And not be good enough to take her hand
But, he says he really loves the farmer's daughter
And I know the farmer's daughter loves the man",The Farmer's Daughter,
The Strangers,"That old white haired judge in Dallas
Didn't pay my story no mind
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
I'm bringin' in a load of time

They caught me on a caper that I planned for days
And proved everything I done
I'm on my way to Huntsville
But I'm looking for a chance to run

My hands don't fit no choppin' pile
And cotton was never my beg
They better keep both eyes on me
Or they're gonna lose old Hag

Hey there ain't so far to Mexico
There I can find my way
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
But I'm not gonna stay

They got me chain and leg irons
I guess they got a good excuse
They know I'm gonna run the first chance
I get cause they never gonna cut me loose

And I don't care if they shoot me down
I'll never be free again
I've got two long life turns to do
Both runnin' in the end

Hey there ain't so far to Mexico
There I can find my way
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
But I'm not gonna stay",Huntsville,
The Strangers,"It's a way of mine to say just what I'm thinking
And to do the things I really want to do
And you want to change the part of me I'm proud of
So I can't be myself, when I'm with you

Oh, you never liked the clothes I wear on Sunday
Just because I don't believe the way you do
But I believe the Lord knows I'm unhappy
'Cause I can't be myself when I'm with you

I can't be myself and be what pleases you
And down deep inside, I don't believe that you'd want me to
And it's not my way to take so long deciding
That I can't be myself, when I'm with you

I can't be myself and be what pleases you
And down deep inside, I don't believe you'd want me to
And it's not my style to take so long deciding

No, I can't be myself, when I'm with you",I Can't Be Myself,
The Strangers,"I feel like a stranger in this home I built for you
And I can't understand this awful change you're going through
But lately I've been watching you grow colder every day
And I'd rather be gone than in your way

I'd rather be gone than in your way I'd rather see someone else here in my place
And if I decide on leaving my world will end today
But I'd rather be gone than in your way

I'd rather be gone...
I'd rather be gone",I'd Rather Be Gone,
The Strangers,"Yeah I'm a good loser born to be that way this dog he never had his day
Yeah I'm a good loser so don't worry bout my pride
Me don't look back you can't see my hurt inside
There must be a sin I'm payin' for cause I felt my share of heartaches long before
This same life runs in cicles I can't say they're wrong
My lucks been running bad too long
But I'm a good loser...

The Strangers,"Did you ever steal a quarter when you was 10 years old?
Ever wear a brogan with a hole in the sole?
Did you ever ride a freight train while runnin' from the law?
I've done it all, Lord, Lord, I've done it all

Did you ever spend a winter in a dirty jail?
Did you ever buy a topcoat at a rummage sale?
Did you ever spend a Christmas inside detention hall?
I've done it all, Lord, Lord, I've done it all

Well, I've picked my share of cotton, boys
And I drove one railroad spike
And I've been everywhere I talk about

I've even been to 'Frisco wearin' regular clothes
With them modern hippie folks starin' down their nose

Have mercy on a guy that's gonna miss you
I know you're in a hurry
But consider all the hurt I'm going through

Let me brace my heart so I can face the part
That I've been dreading for so long

The Strangers,"Like the ancient Roman empire, this world is doomed to fall
And it's much too big a thing for mortal man
Just take a look around and see the writing on the wall
Somehow we've got to find a helping hand

This world has never been in the awful shape it's in
And people scorn the things our leaders do
It's time a prayer was spoken from the heart of every man
Jesus, take a hold and lead us through

The mighty roar of gunfire is now a local sound
And our city streets are filled with angry men
Law's now a mockery throughout our troubled land
And destruction seems to be the current trend

And my income tax return will soon be due
I just made my last big payment on my 68 Corver

I came up with a winnin' ticket on a ocean liner cruise
And the trip and everything was planned for two
And I arranged for our vacation and the time I thought we'd leave
Now the only trouble, at all, is you

Yeah, the only trouble with me is you
And it's driving me out of my mind
Hey, I've done everything a man can do

Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away

Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game

The rampage grew wilder with each passing day
The odds growing smaller with each getaway
With the end growing closer, the harder they fought
With blood on their hands, they were bound to get caught

They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dyin' they pulled to the side

With only these few million tears I cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come

The Strangers,"THE TRAIN THAT NEVER STOPS
(Dallas Frazier)
Â« Â© '67 Acuff-Rose Music, BMI Â»

For years I've tried to leave this poor man's valley
On a train that's on its way to richer ground
Where rivers never overflow and dreams cannot be drowned
But the train never stops at our town
I'd like to buy a mansion for my darling
On a way upon a mountain look it down
I know there's a restless goal up there just waitin' to be found
But the train never stops at our town
Failure has to find something to blame
And the only thing that's left is that old frame
The darkness of the night catches me crying
A whistle soon will blow a lonesome sound
A spark of hope becomes a flame each time the train slows down
But the train never stops at our town that old train never stops at our town



",The Train Never Stops,
The Strangers,"Just outside these prison walls a hanging tree is waiting
Tomorrow I'll meet darkness as death will say hello
Darling put you lips to mine and tell me that you love
Hold me close again before you go

[Chorus]
T
Will you visit me on Sundays, Will you bring me pretty flowers
Will your big blue eyes be misty, will you brush brush away a tear
A grave is filled with silence, but if a sleeping man could hear
Darling, will I hear your footsteps up there.

Promise me that time won't separate me from your memory
That you will still remember me in days of silver hair
If not for you I know I'd lose my life before the morning
Hold me close and tell me that you care

[Chorus]",Will You Visit Me On Sundays?,

I could make those people dance 
And maybe they'd be happy for awhile 

Did you write the book of love 
And do you have faith in God above 
If the bible tells you so 
Now do you believe in rock n roll 
And can music save your mortal soul 
And can it teach me how to dance real slow 
Well i know that your in love with him 
Cause i saw you dancing in the gym 
You both kicked off your shoes 
And i did Gods rhythm and blues 
I was a lonely teenage brock of luck 
With a great carnation and a pick up truck 
But i knew that i was out of luck 
The day the music died 
I started singing 

[Chorus] 
Bye bye Miss American Pie 
Drove my chevy to the levy 
But the levy was dry 
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye 
singing 
This will be the day that I die 
This will be the day that I die 

I met a girl who sang the blues 
And i asked her for some happy news 
But she just smiled and turned away 
Well i went down to the sachet store 
Where i heard the music years before 
But the man there said the music wouldn't play 
Well now in the streets the children screamed 
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed 
But not a word was spoken 
The church bells all broken 
And the three men i admire the most, 
The father, son, and the holy ghost 
They caught the last train for the coast 
The day the music died 
I started singing 

Bye bye Miss American Pie 
Drove my chevy to the levy 
But the levy was dry 
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye 
singing 
This will be the day that I die 
This will be the day that I die 

Bye bye Miss American Pie 
Drove my chevy to the levy 
But the levy was dry 
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye

This will be the day that I die

The Stranglers,"A fine day for the classroom and the pupils are here 
Julie's got a headache but the others don't care 
Sarah's got to stay behind and help with the drill 
Teacher's got his eye on her 
Moves in for the kill. 
Nobody can see or hear the things that they do 
All the books stay closed, there must be something they do 
Only teacher knows about the subjects they span - span 
Education's secondary, being a school mam 

Oooooeeee! 
Teachers doing fine as far as I can see 

Being a school mam 
Long holidays in the summer 
Being a school mam 
Free milk in your coffee break 
Being a school mam 
Government paid monthly salary checks 

Noises heard the principal investigates 
She turns on all the cameras but it's too late 
Catches both their pants down in a passion war 
Hasn't seen it happen since the day she was born 
Reaching down for glasses that just can't be found 
By the time she finds them, why their down on the ground 
Tossing and a turning they've got feverish hands 
Lead can be so fluid when you're being a school mam 

Oooooeeee! 
Teachers doing fine as far as I can see 

Being a school mam 
Controlling promiscuity after hours 
Being a school mam 
Giving out detentions by the dozen 
Being a school mam 
Give her fifty lines (of speed) 
Being a school mam 

Sucking on her fingernails she can't believe what she's seeing 
She's seeing something close to what appears on the screen 
Locks her door, with trembling hands and her hearts beating very fast 
She pretends she's down there on the floor in the class 
Gives herself to teacher although he doesn't know 
Works herself into a frenzied state and it shows 
Sarah's almost at the top but try as she can 
She can't reach her helter skelter 
Down with the school man 

Just watch her go and help her try if you can 
Use your twentieth century imagination - if you've got any 

Oooooeeee! 
Now she's at the top and teacher sets her free 

Being a school mam 
Disgusting behavior 
Being a school mam 
All over the parquet flooring 
Being a school mam 
Letting the flood gates open wide 
Being a school mam 

Now the principal collapses dead on the floor 
With contentment on her wrinkled old face ever more 
She went out the very best way that an old woman can 
She was where the action was 
Down there with the school man 

Oooooeeee! 
Teacher never will discover who could see 

Being a school mam 
One and one make two if you're very lucky 
Being a school mam 
Two twos make four if I remember correctly 
Being a school mam 
Four fours make sixteen and sixteen's over age 
Sixteen and sixteen makes thirty two 
That's approaching middle age 
Thirty two and thirty two makes sixty four 
That's OAP land 
Sixty four and sixty four makes a hundred and twenty eight 
A hundred and twenty eight divided by three 
Let me pause for reflection for a second
But teacher! 
Three doesn't go into a hundred and twenty eight exactly, 
But it goes forty two and a bit 
Forty three, forty four, forty five, forty six, forty seven
Forty eight, forty nine, 
Forty nine, point one, forty nine, point two, forty nine, point three
Forty nine, point four, 
Forty nine, point five, forty nine, point six, forty nine, point seven
Forty nine, point eight,

Sat and watched the rain all night
He couldn't sleep a wink as all the drops fell

Hidden in our foreheads
He told me of the ugliness
We show instead

From all the pain
A midnight summer dream as he watched the rain

Then at midnight he poured another drink
And bent my ear
After midnight we sat up half the night
Or maybe more
And he began to tell me what it was all for

I woke up in an armchair
He had gone I don't know where
Left me there to sit and look at the rain

Don't remember much at all
But his words were echoing
A midnight summer dream and then wake again

Maybe I'll never find him
Maybe he's gone forever
Maybe I'll have to sit here
Watching the weather

One thing's pretty certain helped me
Make it in the night
Showed me somewhere else between wrong and right

And at midnight if you can't sleep
Then I can bend your ear
After midnight we'll sit up half the night
Or maybe more

The Stranglers,"Punch remembers where he has been
Judy knows he's being fair
Punch has always hugged her tightly
Judy's waited on his touch
Punch has dreamed about her every night
And Judy's never had that much
Punch always had a sense of humour
And Judy must've realized that
He always cut a famous figure
With his truncheon and his hat
Judy's always been his bright flag
Shows the audience a smile
'cause she knows when they've all gone home
She can lick him clean in style
See such soul and beauty
In Punch And Judy
Punch has played the famous villain
Wants to rest his aching feet
Judy says she's more than willing
Wants to lay back in the heat
There's a few more shows to pack in
'cause his loyalty is strong
The way he's hitting on her tonight
She won't have to wait that long
See such soul and beauty

Offering sacrifice
Up to the temple on the hill
Can human heart suffice?
Can I survive the world alone
Without a well within my home
Without the one idol's love
Shining down upon me?
She eats Souls
She eats Souls
All that I'm offering's the heart
That's all I have to give
With all this heat surrounding me
My deity forgives
And if she needs it every day
I'll climb the steps my savage way
Uttering incantations up up above me

The Strawbs,"Wake up one day, you're left alone
From now on you're on your own
The sands of time are running low
You'll have nothing left to show

The months slip by and change to years
Soon the twilight gloom appears
And then one day before you know
You'll have nothing left to show

Where is this dream of your youth?

The pictures on the walls are shaking
They can hear the storm a-breaking
Storms may come and storms go
You'll have nothing left to show

They can hear the earth a-quaking
Buildings come and buildings go
You'll have nothing left to show

Tomorrow brings another dawn
It might be better from now on
Before too long that day will go
You'll have nothing left to show

You'll have nothing left to show
You'll have nothing left to show
You'll have nothing left to show

The Strawbs,"Jimmy Wilson had a glass eye, I could see it
And he stuttered sometimes
And he needed a girl friend night times
Didn't know how to go about it
Poor Jimmy Wilson, poor Jimmy Wilson

All the boys used to tease him, I know I did it
And he was my friend
At school we were always close together
Hardly a day I didn't see him
Poor Jimmy Wilson, poor Jimmy Wilson

He used to go out for walks on his own
With no-one to talk to at all
He'd walk in the park till the evening grew dark
Just feeling quite incredibly small

He was sitting in the park one Sunday evening
Around about five
When along came a lady, a total stranger
Wanted young Jimmy to go with her
Poor Jimmy Wilson, poor Jimmy Wilson

Well she was so persuasive and seemed quite friendly
So he went along
And the lady who was lonely gave him tea
And she was his friend for ever after
Poor Jimmy Wilson, poor Jimmy Wilson.",Poor Jimmy Wilson [BBC Radio One Top Gear Session][*],1969
The Strawbs,"An orange balloon on the distant horizon
The air had a nip for the sun was still rising
A delicate fusion of ambery tone
Brought warmth to the shore where I walked all alone
Another day begins.
A crab scuttled awkwardly, shyly away
Perhaps the strangest of all nature's rebels
Night shed its cloak with the sounds of the day
The gentle lap of the tide on the pebbles
Another day begins, another day.
The gulls on the breeze, soaring over my head
Like marionettes with invisible thread
The day unfurled like the flags on a mast
Spelling a message of sunshine at last
Another day begins, another day.
I walked along for miles
The clear blue sky was free
And the smiles shone like pearls on the sea
Another day begins, another day.
Far too soon it was time to be leaving
A gull flew ahead of me bobbing and weaving
It caught my eye with a quizzical stare
Was it my love, was it she who was there?
Another day begins.
I climbed the steep path to the high cliff top's heather
The sea was as clear as a fresh mountain stream
The gull as it circled away dropped a feather
A souvenir of a beautiful day dream

The Strawbs,"Her hair the weeping willow
At the water's edge
And from my windy crag
Above the moorland sedge

I see the willow fronds
Caress the ripples
I feel her nipples
At my fingertips

Her breasts are gentle snowdrifts
In an open field
The supple fingered winter wind
The grass concealed

And though the winter wind
May be deceiving
I feel her breathing
At my fingertips

Her legs the spreading branches
Of the tree of life
The willow wand will bend
Before the woodman's knife

The tangle thicket parts
Before the forest fire
Her warm desire
Is at my fingertips

",Fingertips,1970
The Strawbs,"The boatman rose to the sound of his heartbeat
Loud in the silent approach of the dawn
He glanced through the window at mist on the lake
Which hung like a shroud in the still of the morn
The silver cobwebs spun with the dew
Hung from the bushes in filigree splendor
And water lilies asleep on the lake
Were reflected so delicate, tranquil and tender.

The boat man sighed as he strode through the woods
To the place where his boat lay moored to a stake
The hollow sound as his footsteps echoed
Until the sound was lost on the lake
He cast off, poling the boat from the shore
Peering a head through damp clinging haze
He thought that he saw strange swirling shapes
A trick on the eyes that the mist often plays.

So intent was the boatman on crossing the lake
That he failed to notice the current that flowed
Leading his boat from familiar parts
He was firmly, yet somehow unknowingly, towed
All at once the mist seemed to lift
Sufficient to show the boatman a pool
That he'd never seen in the whole of his life
Unnaturally deep, black and silent, and cool.

The boatman's shirt clung to his back
He was sweating both from exertion and fear
He had the sensation that someone was watching
He felt the presence of somebody near
An invisible force prevented him moving
The strength of his arms was utterly sapped
The twisted bushes converged round the lake
Like a fish in a net he was trapped.

Suddenly out of the water before him
The wraith-like form of a maiden appeared
Clad in shimmering radiant robes
The maiden materialized as she neared
The hair which finely crowned her head
Was a halo of golden reflecting the sun
All of the beautiful women of time
Were formed all at once into one.

She handed the boatman the sword she was holding
Which flashed iridescent before his eyes
Excalibur surely was hardly a match
For a sword that simple description defies
The boatman stood transfixed by her gaze
Which reached to the depths of his very soul
To he who could conquer the evils of life
She offered herself as a whole.

The maiden vanished before his gaze
Leaving him clutching the sword in his fist
The hairs on the nape of his neck seemed to stiffen
A creature approached him from out of the mist
It was powerful, huge and yet stupid indeed
For it held right back and failed to attack
The boatman struck at its small stupid eyes
And it crashed to the ground and lay on its back.

Without a warning the sky seemed to blacken
As though the sun were in total eclipse
The boatman crouched low as a vast eagle swooped
And a horrified cry escaped from his lips
It strutted before him with pride in its bearing
Admiring its talons both vicious and cruel
Taking advantage the boatman struck fast
And the eagle slid to the depths of the pool.

The terrified boatman tried moving his boat
But his pole had grown roots in the watery deep
The bank grew alive with the coils of a snake
And all you could hear was its slither and creep
It cast an envious stare at the boatman
Slid into the water and swam to the boat
He stood hypnotized by its green jealous eyes
As it came from the water and coiled round his throat.

As its coils tightened slowly his breath came in gasps
As he choked so he lifted the sword in despair
As the snake was still gloating he severed its head
And in death the snake's coils thrashed wild in the air
The boatman wiped the sweat from his brow
His heart was pounding as never before
His eyes like a lizard's tongue darted around
Not daring to rest for a minute or more.

An involuntary shiver went up his spine
As he heard the sound of eerie howls
A wolf appeared on the banks of the pool
Saliva dripped from its loathsome jowls
Hatred smoldered deep in his eyes
Which glowed like coals from Hades fire
It seemed to grow as it crouched and snarled
And watched as the boatman began to tire.

It was almost as though the wolf had learned
For it did not attack as the others had done
But bended its time until the moment was right
And sprang as the boatman stared into the sun
But the boatman too had learned to hold back
And holding his sword as though a knife
He plunged it deep into the wolf's heart
Then fell to his knees and prayed for his life.

As he felt a hand on his shoulder he whirled
To find the maiden by his side
She smiled and the world seemed to open before him
He tried to speak but his tongue was tied
You must plunge the sword deep into my heart
Lest I should crumble into dust
She offered the boatman the meaning of life
And love, if he could but conquer lust.

She bared her breasts before his eyes
The boatman still was stricken dumb
He flung the sword back into the water
Back to the depths from which it had come
The water around him began to boil
The maiden began to wither away
His boat was swamped as the creatures arose
And evil lived for another day.",The Vision of the Lady of the Lake,1970
The Strawbs,"The night sky hung so heavy
The wet road shone so bright
Reflecting back my headlights
As I drove on in the night
To Stormy Down.

I drew into a lay-by
My eyes were dark with strain
Turning up my collar
I walked out in the rain
On Stormy Down.

The Strawbs,"The bird had silver wings, my friends,
And reached out for the sky;
It found its wings were broken,
It had lost the right to fly.
The pink-eyed salamander
Changed its colours for the day;
It changed from white to purest gold
And left the stag at bay.
Now I am but a p;oor man
In the apple blossom state,
I choose to fly where'er I please,
The stag must needs a mate.

My golden salamander,
You must take me as I am.
I cannot change my colours,
I am but a simple man.

The golden salamander
Had become the rite of spring;
The silver bird made promises
That scarcely meant a thing;
They told the wicked huntsman
Where the stag had run to rest.
Now the elderly survivor
Knew this was not for the best;
He opened up his heart
And prayed for peace for all mankind.
He asked a fortune teller
But found out that she was blind.

The clouds were passing over,
There was little sign of rain;
The sun was slowly rising
From its slumberdown again.
The stag had run to cover
In a copse beside the lake;
The huntsman broke the silence
And the birds began to wake.
The fortune teller smiled
As the survivor spoke of fate.
He thanked her for her interest
But knew it was too late.

The Strawbs,"The willows stand on guard in the dark
Where lovers are rowing alone in the park.
In awe of each other they make a mistake,
And find they must spend one more night on the lake.

And I don't care if anyone knows,
There's no-one so fair as my Tokyo rose.
I don't care if anyone knows,
There's no-one so fair as my Tokyo Rosie.

The blossom has fallen before the west wind;
The butterfly lies with its silken wings pinned;
Alone in the temple the lovers rejoice
And sing to each other with one single voice.

I wear my silk kimono black,
Get you monkey off my back.
No matter where the west wind blows,
You'll never find a fallen rose.

The flowers of heaven are roses in bloom;
The east wind turns west in the walls of my room.
I build my defence in the palace of sin,
The lovers make home and the loser must win.

The Strawbs,"Maybe you think, a lot like me
Of those who live beside the sea
Who feel so free, so I surmise
With their comfortable homes, and wives
Who end up drinking tea together
In the afternoon of their lives.

They build their homes upon the seashore
The quicksand castles of their dreams
Yet take no notice of the North wind
Which tears their building at the seams.

In their dismay and blind confusion
The weeping widows clutch their shawls
While as the sea mist ever deepens
The sailors hear the sirens' calls.

And in the maelstrom sea which follows
The lifeboat sinks without a trace
And yet there still remain survivors
To bear the shame of their disgrace.

Last night I lay in bed
And held myself
Trying to remember 
How it once was with you
How your hands were softer.

Yesterday I found myself 
Staring into space

You would surely know what I mean

That tumbled down the daunting cliff

With a drawbridge and a moat
And light my open fires

Falling in a graceful curve

Mulled wine by the fire
And the finest ermine stole

The Strawbs,"The village square stands quiet
The curfew still enforced
The streets are even clear of dogs and whores

Like some evil bird of prey
The scaffold spreads its wings
The people build their fires and bolt their doors

The mayor is giving dinner to the officers’ wives
His eldest son is learning how to fawn
The barrack block is hushed and tense
The soldiers drawing lots
Who will be the hangman in the dawn?

The lot falls on a young man
Who has served for but a year
His home is in the village close nearby

He shivers at the thought of what
He’s forced to do next day
He wonders who it is, who has to die?

And the full moon casts a cold light
On the gloomy prison walls
The papist walks his cell, he cannot sleep

He hears the waiting gallows creaking
Just beyond that door
He prays for he has no more tears to weep

The day begins to break
A muffled drums begins to sound
A crowd begins to gather in the square
The presence of the hangman in his terrifying mask

Weighs heavy on the minds of all those there
The colonel reads the sentence
Which the papist knows by heart

He has failed to show allegiance to the King
His crime is thus with God himself
And in His name he must hang
The papist, head held high, says not a thing

The jailer binds his hands
And puts his blindfold to his eyes
He leads him through the door before the crowd
The hangman sees his victim

And the blood drains from his face
He sees his younger brother standing proud
The hangman tries to protest
But is ordered to proceed

His trembling hands begin to take the strain
His eyes are blind with streaming tears
And he cries for all to hear

Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name

Bringing their wives and children.

Watching their sheep driven from the pen

They're frightened 
Dogs are snapping at their heels 
Jumping on each other's backs

The Strawbs,"In the early dawn the Bishop's men
Shivered in the damp
But the shiver came not from the cold
And spread throughout the camp

The trembling horses sensed the fear
Of silent thoughtful men
Who prayed that wives and families
Might see them once again

The bishops sent a dawn patrol
To investigate the weight
Of forces at the King's command
Ensconced behind the gate

The ground mist hid the patrol's approach
As they drew close enough to show
The sentries on the battlements
And an archer drew his bow

From the topmost tower a sentry fell
As an arrow pierced his skull
And his headlong flight into the moat
Seemed that of a gull

The patrol reported little
There was nothing much to see
But the strong and silent castle
A symbol of the free

The King's men took communion
As the first rays of the sun
Lit up the castle's gloomy walls
The fatal day begun

From the castle green the rooks took flight
To the high trees in the east
To their carrion minds the battlefield
Set a table for a feast

A tide of black, the Bishop's men
Equality their right
Swarmed like ants across the hill
Their aim at last in sight

The King's men dressed in purest white
Were driven back by force
And the fighting grew more violent
As the battle took its course

The Bishops gave the order
No mercy to be shown
The sacrifice will reap rewards
When the King is overthrown

The sight of children lying dead
Made hardened soldiers weep
The outer walls began to fall
They moved towards the keep

The rooks surveyed the battlefield
Their hungry beady eyes
Reveled in the sight of death
Showing no surprise

The pressure mounted steadily
As the Bishops neared the gate
And the desperate King called to his knights
It's your lives or the State

When the anxious King began to fail
As many thought he might
The Queen ran screaming round the walls
And urged the men to fight

The Bishop's men were tiring
As the afternoon drew late
And the King's men lowered the drawbridge
And poured out through the gate

They fought their way across the bridge
The men like falling leaves
Or ears of corn that fall in swathes
The vicious sickle cleaves

The tide receded up the hill
The waste of reclaimed land
Once decaying swamp became
A shore of pure white sand

A blinded priest was seen to bless
Both dying and the dead
As he stumbled around the battlefield
His cassock running red

If uniform were black or white
His eyes could never see
And death made no distinction
Whatever man he be

As darkness fell both camps withdrew
Their soldiers slain like cattle
Leaving the rooks to feast alone
The victors of the battle

At evensong both camps reviewed
Their sad depleted ranks
As survivors of the battle
Gave God their grateful thanks

And I said ""You must be joking"" but he slowly shook his head
And said ""That's what they all say, I might as well be dead"".

I said ""Well try a church or maybe Brighton beach""
And I was trying to be serious but he didn't seem impressed
He said ""You think I'm crazy, you're just like all the rest"".

I was really quite embarrassed, he was looking so sincere
So I said ""I close the shop soon, won't you come and have a

But mostly they were frightened and they looked at him wide eyed
And when he said his name was Jesus, one girl even cried.

And he said although he'd thought about it there was really not a hope
Then he said he thought he'd better go, he had some work to do

Who knows where the time goes?

Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time

For who knows how my love grows?
And who knows where the time goes?",Who Knows Where the Time Goes,2005
The Strawbs,"If in some capricious moment
I should give you cause to fear
Then you have but to remember

That my being here is mere fortune
For the rules have laid down
To guide the thoughts of those who stray

If in some deserted hour
We should murmur last goodbyes
With the snowflakes falling softly
As the tears well in your eyes

Then we kiss but once and walk away
Never turning round
And the snow falls on our footsteps
Leaving nothing to be found

And my life is yet determined
By the span of what it holds
And the span grows ever shorter
As my lifetime folds away

But again we're back in like a day
Chattin' shit sittin' at the wall table telling jokes
Playin with the salt looking out the window
Girl brings two plates of full English over
With plenty of scrambled eggs and plenty of fried tomato
Get my phone out about give this girl a shout
See if she had a nice time last night uptown
Ask if she fancy's tryin' it again some time
Then Cal grabs the phone like oy!oy!oy!oy!

By all means, you can vibe with this girl

I mean I'll fuckin', I can take it or leave it, believe

Walk past the gate

In the chase, I sat down, got a fat frown
Weeping and drown in my senses

And whether I try to pull a girlfriend 
That's it who's got dough? 
Hey, you know I'd pay but I'm broke, only got coinage to show 
Putting off walking home on my own to my thrown 
Two empty takeaways ashtrays and remains of the day stoned 
Pick a bottle off the table, peel the label tell a fable 
Offer opinion for free and a solution to the latest big news story 
Football and smut daily as I ponder winning the lottery 
Buy a drink, chat to a lady, the girls well fit definitely, not maybe, she's rude I'd shag

Raining cats and fog but nice and dry in the black dog 
Down it in one my son, can't sit here, gotta run.. things need done 
If they don't win this and the next run they getting relegated to the third division 
At street level, real people saying repeated sequel 
Rock and roll fall to the floor like last night, yesterday morning 
And the night before and the night before

And when the blues unfold 
It gets cold silence burns holes 
You're going mad 
Perhaps you always were 
But when things was good you just didn't care 
This is called irony 
When you most need to get up you got no energy 
Time and time shit'll happen 
The dark shit's unwrapping 
But no-one's listening your mates are laughing 
Your brethren's fucking and then you start hating 
Your stomach starts churning and you mind starts turning. 
So smoke another draw 
It won't matter no more but the next day still feels sore 
Rain taps on your window 
Always did tho but you didn't hear it when things were so-so 
You're on your own now

Good thing about brown is it always will 
It's easy, no-one blames you 
It's that world out there that's fucked you 
You know less of a person and if God exists 
He still loves you 
Just remember that - the more you sink the further back from that brink 
Maybe you've lifetime scars and you think tattoos might be more fitting 
But who's picking? 
Searching for yourself you find demons 
Try and be a freeman and grasp that talisman

We all need our fellow man 
We all need our Samaritan.

It's fitting, I'm miles ahead and they chase me
Show your face on TV then we'll see, you can't do half
My crew laughs at your rhubarb-and-custard verses
You rain down curses but I'm waving your hearses driving by
Streets riding high with the beats in the sky
All stare, eyes glazed, garage burnt down
The fire raged for forty days and in forty ways
But through the blaze they see it fade
The sea of black, the beaming heat on their faces
Then a figure emerges from the wastage
Eyes transfixed with a piercing gaze
One hand clutching his sword raised to the sky
They wonder how, they wonder why
The sky turns white, it all becomes clear
They felt lifted from their fears
They shed tears, in the light after six dark years
Young bold soldiers, the fire burns, crackles and smolders
Five years older and wiser
The fires are burning, on fire, never tire
Slay warriors in the forests, and on higher we sing
Hear the strings rising, the war's over, the bells ring
Memories fading, soldiers slaying, looks like geezers raving
The hazy fog over the bullring, the lazy ways the birds sing
A new baby's born everyday, few men may be scorned today
But look at things the other way cause it may well be your final day
And then crowds roar, they slay, they all say
I produced this using only my bare wit
Give me a jungle, a garage beat, and admit defeat
Use war and past injuries, my metaphor is simile
Get all applications in to me before the deadline
'Cause it's a fine line between strife full time and a life of crime
But you will reach the day
And it's all mine, you can take it or leave it
I shake and reveal stage tricks like Jimi Hendrix
In the afterlife gladiators meet their maker
Float through the wheat fields and lakes of blue water
To the next life from the fortress
Away from the knives and slaughter, to their wives and daughters
Once more before the Lord judges over all of us

He'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learn 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But this is gonna pay, he feels it this one'll be fine

Is can I see us not battering them? 
If I cant see that, happening then 
I'm gonna put all my money down on one fat bet 
Now I don't know the first thing about football 
But my instincts tell me this is my windfall 
It's his lucky day, that's a given 
He'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learn 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But this is gonna pay, he feels it this one'll be fine

I woulda held in my hand the whole jackpot

Cause I couldn't make it to the damn shop 
Might as well put tea in that pot 
Ive got nowhere else I have to bop 
The question I have to ask one 
Is how I managed, not to manage the trot 
Maybe I could phone in and slap it on 
Put all my money on a mid-match one 
Yes, I don't know the first thing about football 
But my instincts tell me this is my windfall 
It's his lucky day, that's a given 
He'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learn 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But this is gonna pay, he feels it this one'll be fine 
Shit, I'm mad glad I didn't back that match 
Suppose to be an unproblematic catch 
Full time the whistle blasted after 
The last passer, passed the last pass 
Would you believe how we fell back 
Three goals lost in the last half 
So glad I was stranded back at the flat 
Wincing at every goal we let em have 
The question I now have to ask 
Is how the fuck did we get smashed that bad? 
I just very, very nearly, nearly 
Lost every penny of all my cash 
Yes, I don't know the first thing about football 
And my instincts almost led me to a pitfall 
It's his lucky day, that was barmy 
He didn't tick the box on the slip, and what a relief 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But next time he will be more lucky, next time he'll be fined

Gotta get rid of this pill taste, what are they chattin' so much for?
Glad I'm not a girl in this place, they'll be here 'til dawn
Sure my belly's tingling a bit, somethings happening I'm sure
And I'm thinking

Lights are blinding my eyes

Maybe I shouldn't have done the second one, I feel all fidgety and warm

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

Whoa, everything in the room is spinning, I think I'm going to fall down
My heart's beating to quick, I'm fucking tripping out
I wonder whether they got in, turned away no doubt
Who cares, there is a tune coming in, that one noise is like
I'm thinking

Lights are blinding my eyes

My eyes are rolling back, I'm rubbing my thighs with my hand
And I'm thinking

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

Yeah yeah they cheer
Can they see my hand in the air?
Need to wave 'em over here
Swear Simone's kissing Dan
My head is twisted sever, body's rushing everywhere
They could have texted me when they were near, but I'm fucked and I don't
Care

Lights are blinding my eyes

The Streets,"'Cause her last relationship fucked her up
Got hurt majorly, finds it tough to trust
Looked at the ashtray, then looked back up
Spinnin' it away on the tabletop
She looked much fitter than Saturday just
She worked in JD's with Dan
Back then I figured she was pretty damn rough
But she was only wearin' her work stuff
And in these clothes she looked more than buff
She stirred her straw, sat up to adjust
I told her I thought it was important
That you could get lost in conversation
Chattin' shit, sittin' in, oblivion
With that person who's your special one
She said she was the worst pool player under the sun
But blokes go easy so she always won

[Chorus]
I saw this thing on ITV the other week
Said, that if she played with her hair, she's probably keen
She's playin' with her hair, well regularly
So I reckon I could well be in

She didn't look too bored with what I was sayin'
Her hair looked much better than the other day
She had her fingers 'round her hair, playin'
I Saw on the telly that's a good indication
Stood up to buy the next drink though, ""Nay.""
Suppose that's just our girl's way
I'm tryin' to think what else I could say
Peelin' the label off, spinnin' the ashtray
Yeah actually, yes, she did look pretty neat
Her perfume smelled expensive and sweet
I felt like my hair looked a bit cheap
Wished I'd had it cut back last week
She kept givin' me this look, cause she would speak
Was she only friendly, or was she a keep?
Asked her if she wanted the same again to drink
Started to turn and get up out my seat

[Chorus]

She said that her close mates all were
Always the most important thing to her
I said I thought it was a bit more blurred
She asked what I meant by that as she stirred
I told her about the money and what had occurred
With it goin' missing from the living room, so
With my best mates all there standin' by
Right where I left it, under their eyes
So surely one of them might have spied
What happened to my money at that time
I felt like they were all smilin' on the side
She was like ""fair play"" she couldn't say why
She didn't know what all my mates were like
And I said she just might be right
Wish I had someone I could always rely
Someone to get lost chattin' to all night

[Chorus]

As I walked back with more drinks to our place
She had her phone stuck to the side of her face
I sat for a minute while she chatted away
'Bout somethin' with her mom and her birthday
Played for a bit with the same ashtray
Thought about things while I sat and waited
It was nice to chat about the shit in my head
Someone who just listens to you instead
I looked at the barman, wiping down again
Looked at the football on the TV set
Tryin' to look like I weren't just waitin' there
For her conversation to come to an end
I look at my watch and realized right then
That, for three hours, been in conversation
Before she put her phone down, she switched to silent
And we carried on chattin' for more than that again

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]",Could Well Be In,2004
The Streets,"In one single moment your whole life can turn around, I stand there for a minute staring straight into the ground.
Looking to the left slightly then looking back down the world feels like its caved in proper sorry frown. 
Please let me show you how we could only just be for us, I can change and I can grow or we can adjust. The wicked thing about us is we always have trust. 
We can even have an open relationship if we must. 
I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me but her eyes glaze over like she's looking straight through me. 
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity, when they opened up she's lookin down at her feet.

[Chorus]

Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.

So then I moved my hand off and down by my side, shaking, my life is crashing before my eyes.
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies, touched the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh.
Because I can't imagine my life without you and me, there's things I can't imagine doing, things I can't imagine seeing.
It weren't supposed to be easy, surely, please please, I'm begging, please.
She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested she wraps her fingers around mine with the softness she's blessed with.
She peels away my fingers looks at me and then gestures, by pushing my hand away to my chest from hers.

[Chorus]

Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.

And I'm just standing there.
I can't say a word.
'Cause everything has just gone.
I've got nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

Trying to pull her close out of bare desperation, put my arms around her to try to change what she's saying.
Put my head level with hers so she might engage in.
Look into her eyes to make her listen again, I'm not gonna fuckin' just fuckin' just leave it all now.
'cause you said it would be forever and that was your vow, and your gonna let our things simply crash and fall down.
Your well out of order now, this is well out of town.
She pulls away, my arms that are tightly clamped around her waist gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight.
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face, takes one step forward, looks back and then walks away.

[Chorus]

Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.

I know in the past I've found it hard to say, telling you things but not telling you straight. But the more I pull on your hand the more you pull away.

No one's going to fucking tell me jack
But can you rely on anyone in this world?
No, you can't
It's not my fault there's wall-to-wall empty cans
Everyone wanted this to all go wrong for me from the start
It's fucked up that a man's life can just be attacked
Watching this morning with a beer
Is much better than relying on
Unknown cunts for mates I was given
That don't have my back
Scott texted me to say he'd have a look at the TV for me
But I laid it down telling him to fuck right off chap
Phoned this company out the yellow pages
Told them to take away the TV and fix it quick snap
The next day they took away the TV
Told me they would repair the little bit
That's broken round on the back
I thought that would be that but the next bit was on top
This was where it all started to get a bit out of hand

The TV man comes back later, knocks on mine
To say he's found something in the back of the TV
I'm looking at it absolutely speechless, can't quite believe
He's trying to pull this fucking stunt on me
I knew it was a simple case of the power supply gone on the back
But he's trying to tap me up for more money
He says it's not like that and I'm like ""Fuck off and die!""
And stick up my two fingers and one more to make three
He says ""Don't talk to me like that"", and I don't understand
My face is in his face, I tell him I understand perfectly
And he grabs my shirt and I grab his face with my hand
So he brings his fist up and twats me a good one on my cheek
Now I'm trying to pull his head down so I can knee it
But he's got my ear
He's twisting it round so much that it's
Really hurting me
And we both go down on the floor, and he pushes my head back
Onto the corner of the fridge which is, total agony
Then he gets up and runs out the kitchen, and out of the door
Shouting stuff to me, slams his door, shouting at me
So here I am in my house, drinking on my own settee
Everyone's a cunt in this life, no one's there for me

[Chorus 1]

If I want to sit in and drink super tenants in the day I will
No one's going to fucking tell me jack
But can you rely on anyone in this world?
No, you can't
It's all my fault there's wall-to-wall empty cans
I sat in the kitchen all fucked off
Imagining over and over what they're all doing behind my back
Dodgy things going on, actions I regretted
Stain bottle with a pipe and tin foil on the mat
Scott texted me to say he'd have a look at the TV for me
And I felt like just telling him to fuck right off chap
But what he said about wanting to do the right thing by both mates
And then opting to stay out? It seemed to match
But I told him he could make it up by fixing the TV
He said that's the least he could do to square things flat
I thought that would be that but then the next bit was mad
This is where everything started to all turn back

[Chorus 2]
The end of the something I did not want to end
Beginning of hard times to come
But something that was not meant to be is done
And this is the start of what was

He had to unscrew about fifteen screws
Before he could pull the panel off the back
To get in the fecking thing
But just as he did so, he said he saw something
That slipped inside behind the panel
Down the back of it
Must have been some leaflets or a bill maybe
I didn't want to lose the bill in case it was a final warning
So we both tried to get the back off and work out
If there was any more screws to get out
Or if we left any in
And when he looked down the back of the TV his eyes just froze
Before he rammed his hand in, saying, ""No shit!""
He's looking at me absolutely speechless
He can't quite believe what he's trying to pull, out the slip
I get up wondering what he's smiling about
He's shaking his head at this point with, the biggest of grins
I look down the back of the TV and that's where it was
In all its glory?my thousand quid

[Chorus 2]

About two this afternoon the last of the people left my house
'Cause they never stop chatting 'til all the rackets gone
I really feel like things clicked into place at some point
Or maybe it's the fact that me and Alison really got on
Or maybe it's that I realized that it is true
No one's really there fighting for you in the last garrison
No one except yourself that is
No one except you
You are the one who's got your back 'til the last deeds done
Scott can't have my back 'til the absolute end
'Cause he's got to look out for what over his horizon
He's gotta make sure he's not lonely, not broke
It's enough to worry about keeping his own head above
I shut the door behind me, huddled up in my coat
Condensation floating off my breath, squinted out the sun
My jeans feel a bit tight, think I washed them too high
I was gonna be late, so I picked up my pace to run

The Streets,"Excuse me, girl
I know it's a bit embarrassing
But I just noticed some tan lines on your shirt

See, I reckon you're about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in four beers' time
That blue Topshop top you've got on is nice
Bit too much fake tan, though, but yeah, you score high
But there's just one little thing that's really, really
Really, really annoying me about you, you see
Yeah, yeah, like I said, you are really fit
But my gosh, don't you just know it?

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

So when I looked at you standing there with your horde
I was waiting in the queue, looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction, your eyes locked onto my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Are you smoking crack or something?
Mike, just leave it, just leave it

It's not worth it, Mike, just leave it
Don't touch me
It's not worth it
Don't touch me, look, I'm alright, don't touch me

For a while there I was thinking, yeah, but, what if?
Picturing myself pulling with bare white hot wit
Snaring you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it, I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clocking onto you, too, yeah, I had to admit
That yeah, yeah, you are fit and yeah, I do want it
But I stop sharking a minute to get chips and drinks

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Now, I bashed my head hard earlier due to the brew
But I am digressing slightly, so I'll continue
I didn't want to bowl over all geezer and rude
Not rude like good but just rude like uncouth
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
Well let me tell you, see, yes, yes, you are really rude
And rude as in good, I knew this as you stood and queued
But I just did not want to give the satisfaction to you

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

And just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like, nah, I can't even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smiling hard suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty, hearty-looking tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Oh, what do I give a fuck? I've got a girlfriend anyway
We're all a bit drunk, we've had a few, fair play
I got this Stella I bummed from that last cafe
This night's not even begun, yes, yes, oh yay
I did fancy you a bit, though, yeah, I must say
I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
In an otherwise total result of a holiday

I'm not trying to pull you

Just take back the DVD
Withdraw that extra money
Tell mum I wouldn't be back for tea
Then grab my savings and hurry

To avoid that big fine
I had to do a fast hill climb
But a faster decline
But I flew a bit quick
Arms like a lunatic
Had to stop for a few ticks
I started feeling sick
Got to the video shop in a state
But chuffed it, wouldn't be late

I'd left the disc at my place

The Streets,"Yeah safe man, you okay? Just calling to ensure you got back in
Hope you coped yesterday 'coz I felt well damn grim
But yeah in the air on the plane my stomach was turning
Man I was hanging head-to-stead on the headrest in pain

Prayin' away all my bad sins
Lost count of the plain Chardonnays before the fourth or maybe the fifth
In future I need to abstain, if only I'd had a bit of discipline
But worth every bit of spare change, pure clowning down to the last drink

Hang on let me slam the door, mate
Just pause that thought for a bit

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that?
'Coz yeah it felt like we were through though
But I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat

I've been pacing the place
Well paralyzed since I got back in with my bags though
Yeah I'm too aware that last night was way mad slack, I know
Carried in a gang I lost sight of Simone on her own, back at home

Distracted from the fact it weren't right
Could have raised up the hand but no
Simone was moaning and
That about me playing away on this holiday

She was watching the box at her Dad's house
There preparing spliffs away
As I'm smacking glasses down at George
Best, best session rate

Can you hear me? Na sorry mate
You're fuzzy mate, I can't hear you

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that
'Coz yeah it felt like we were through though
But I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat

So, I lost you for a minute, yeah, yeah I can hear you now
See I mean that the true thing though I suppose I chose myself to allow
I was weak and stupid but as far as I viewed anyhow
She couldn't have been it for me the only girl I'd ever go out with

I didn't want to waste my youth in a girl's house to the sound of spliffs
And when she got in a mood with me in that text about that thing
I just switched off the phone when she started shouting
Coming to a conclusion I couldn't be bothered with anymore rowing

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that
'Coz yeah it felt like we were through though
But I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat
(Nah nah nah)

And then after shots made me lose the plot, it all got a bit bizarre
And that incident with the ice cream I forgot, it all ended in our vodka
What I can remember is a blotch, I got a fat bruise on my arm

She weren't even much too hot but she totally mugged me up like rah
She knew exactly what she was doing and it all went a bit too far
She was with that bloke in the white top in Mcdonalds' car park
And then she let me chat her up later on in that lovely little bar

Hello? Ahh fucking phones, man!

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that
'Coz yeah it felt like we were through though
But I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat

Yeah I think we got cut off, yeah I got crap reception in my house
I have to stand in a certain spot in my kitchen or it cuts out
Yeah you know I was potty to even let myself allow it
I would if I could just swap what happened then for right now

And if she ever found out how far it got it would be more than just a row
This whole thing just got on top but it's her that I want, no doubt
So in a way its helped me doing wrong, I know I've fucked up now
This is where that dodgy shit stops, she's just gotta not find out

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that

I wish I could read what his eyes are sayin' 
Staring straight and not blinking 
He's not giving anything away 
What is he thinking? 
I wish I could read what his eyes are sayin' 
Staring straight and not blinking 
He's not giving anything away 
What is he thinking? 
[Mike] 
What the fuck's he saying she had the garm' 
Either he has gone John Barnes 
Or he's tryin' to spin me a con's yarn 
He think's he's the fucking don gar 
How long have I undergone his smarm? 
Shruggin' it all off as fun charm 
If he don't stop lookin' at the TV though 
I'm gonna wrap the cable round his wee throat 
Hang on Scott says Simone had the coat 
Where did he see her on the d.low 
What is it I don't need to know? 
Is he scheming to be near Simone? 
In the club I wondered what was on the go 
Dan was tryin' to keep Scott from being close 
And Scott teefed me money and his teefed me coat 
And he's trying to steal me girlfriend from under me nose

[Wayney G] 
Right I can't be bothered with this no more 
I'm gonna have to tell him I owe him the score 
I wish I could tell him about the dough on the draws 
That's somethin' I don't know, I swore 
The coat thing will look dodgy loads more 
If I don't throw it down as the crow soars 
I'd better put the video on pause 
Face up toe-to-toe over the floor 
He really needs to know how his jacket 
Miraculously appeared round my gaff, here 
And the man that left it's been shagging 
Mike's girl behind Mike's back and thing 
This shit's all got a bit out of hand 
There's no options I'm all down on plans 
I'm jus' gonna have to split it now, man

The Streets,"I should be standing at the bar, waving a ten pound note around
But I sit here on the sofa at my girl's house
I should be chatting shit as I'm nubbing out another snout
But I'll roach a spliff watching the TV for now
I should be watching the fruit machines, for which one will pay out
But I sit on the sofa at my girls, anyhow
I should be legging it from a cab, like a mad little lout
But I'll roach a spliff watching the TV, throughout

[Chorus]
I know I never tell her, but every single day, man
I'm always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me, and
I don't know what I'd do without her

I should actually go out and about, flip some beer mats
Instead of sitting her at my girl's gaff
'Cause, all I seem to do is sit in this habitat
Just roaching a spliff, watching the TV and that
And the TV at my house is a bit broken on the back
So I use my girl's TV to watch the match
Yeah, I, might head out later to get off this beaten track
Of, watching the TV, roaching up, I'm the same old man

[Chorus]

But on second thought, so why don't you shots
No, I, think, I, will, sit on the sofa
And eat my TV meal
I would actually much prefer to just sit here and chill
Roaching a spliff, watching East-Enders or the Bill
'Cause basically I love her, and I love being here still
And I love sitting on the sofa with my girl, for real
I don't want to knock my mates
But there it's the same old drill
Roaching a spliff, watching the TV is my will

[Chorus]

No fuck that
I might ask my mates where they'll be drinking
From the sofa giving them a ding
Tell 'em, I will go freeze on that ground later on this evening
Instead of roaching a spliff, watching the TV again
And then go out
Whilst back at her's, she does her ting
Sitting on the sofa at her end
But, as I watch the big screen I know I will quite miss
Me and her roaching a spliff, watching the TV again

I know I never tell her, but every single day, man
 I'm always thinking loads about her
(That's exactly what I'm talking about)
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
(I wouldn't have it any other way)
And I don't know what I'd do without her
(I'll tell you this)
I know I never tell her
(There's a whole world out there)
But every single day, man
(A whole world)
I'm always thinking loads about her
(But do I give her?)
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
(Do you know what I mean?)
And I don't know what I'd do without her
(There's a whole world out there)

The Streets,"And I'm just standin' there, I can't say a word
'Cause everything's just gone
I've got nothin', absolutely nothin'

In one single moment your whole life can turn 'round
I stand there for a minute starin' straight into the ground
Lookin' to the left slightly, then lookin' back down
World feels like it's caved in proper sorry frown

Please let me show you where we could only just be for us
I can change and I can grow or we could adjust
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
We can even have an open relationship, if you must

I look at her she stares almost straight back at me
But her eyes glaze over like she's lookin' straight through me
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
When they open up she's lookin' down at her feet

Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

So then I move my hand up from down by my side
It's shakin', my life is crashin' before my eyes
Turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies
Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh

'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me
There's things I can't imagine doin', things I can't imagine seein'
It weren't supposed to be easy, surely
Please, please, I beg you, please

She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested
She wraps her fingers 'round mine with the softness she's blessed with
She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures
By pushin' my hand away to my chest, from hers

Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

I know in the past I've found it hard to say
Tellin' you things, but not tellin' straight
But the more I pull on your hand and say
The more you pull away

Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now

The Streets,"She said meet me at the gates at eight
Leave now don't be late
She said one day she'd walk away 'cause I'm always late
Thought things were o.k.
Didn't care though anyway
Say sorry babe, I had to meet a mate, tempting fate
We first met through a shared view, she loved me and I did too
It's now 7:50 getting ready better be nifty
Do my hair quickly, step out it's cloudy
Mate bells me to borrow money, I got two Henry's and a dealer to pay
Call up on geezers to rid these green trees of my reeking jeans
Got a you think I care outglaring geezers stares
I'm here and I'm there
Couldn't see past the end of my beer
What was getting near, all the silence after the cheers 

[Chorus]
She said meet me at the gates
Don't be late, but pretty soon the day came for change
And I was glad she never walked away
So I'm choosing what to wear, doing my hair with an hour to spare
When my life went pear, she'd been there with a thick stare
Big wheel climbed to the top, geezer scares bounced off
Standing at the top of this huge mountain, smiling and shouting
Spring flowers sprouting, not one inch of doubt in my mind as I reached the gates
Came round the corner at a rate
Risked her love but I'm gonna set things straight
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late

[Chorus]
I said meet me at the gates
Leave now don't be late
I waited for a while listening to her voice mail, mind set sail
Then the facts turned me pale, wind rain and hail
My fears unveiled, for my fair female
She'd walked away, too little too late
I step up the pace, walk past the gates, rain runs over my face
Spirit falls from grace
I purchase a hazy escape at the alcohol place in the chase
Sat down I got a fat frown
Weeping and drowning my senses
For this love game's expensive
I walk in a trance
Got a wounded soldier stance
The everyday geezers stares throw me off balance
Now nothing holds significance
And nothing holds relevance
'Cause the only thing I can see is her elegance",It's Too Late [Live in France],2004

Bit too much fake tan though,

I get a crime reference number for my most recent phone
The police code that's the code for a free phone
Take one camera phone
Tell em I got jacked of the phone

The previous evening back at home
I played baby foot
No-one jacked my phone
I madly gambled my phone and got smacked

Don't fucking go mad over your chick,
This that, this that,
It's for your own good,
Its called, na na, it is, its called experience.
Bruv, you know what yeah, what experience?
What so you've gone mad over a chick.
Yeah I have once, and I'm not doing that shit again,
You're fucking crazy.

There's no point in telling her the truth,
Cos she's not gonna believe it.
You know what I mean,
She's just gonna listen to her friends,
Her fucking friends, you know what I mean.
So like, just like, forget about her, let's go get some drinks,
You know what I mean, go check some more yetis.

Bruv why did she hang up?
I know there's still anger
I put my hands up ? yes I was a wanker.
I did lead with Tanya, when I left Tantra,
She had one too many so I called a cab.
I don?t understand her, I never did grab her
She?s listening to Amber, and we don?t get on,
OK before, I did get caught,
But to jeopardise us again, I couldn?t do.
Her friend, ain?t talking sense,
See me and Tanya we?re only just breadrins
Her friend, never saw anything
We got in, I dropped her off to her rents.

{CHORUS}
This morning it got light, but I?d still not been to sleep,
Thinking of what to do to ease this grief.
I know I lied but I had a reason please believe,
I fold the pillow, and try n squeeze some sleep


{Verse 2 ? Mike Skinner}
Please don?t delete, my phone number please,
I know you don?t need, to mope about me.
I did go with Lis, she phoned to speak,
She wants me back, but I want you.
Don?t shoot through, you?re going to lose
A bloke who?s truly devoted to you
I owe to you, to know a few truths,
Home truth truths, you going to screw.
Your friends, are not talking sense,
Are you sure your head ignores them?
Your friends, never saw anything,
We talked then, I walked to my ends.

{Verse 3}

Bruv I?ll tell you this for free, Ambers chatting shit again.
She needs to go on Trisha, with all her fucking shenanigans.
She?s just sad and bitter, cos her and her man split up.
So now she wants her and the girls to be a gang of spinsters.
And bruv, huh, I told you, you cant be chatting to Tanya.
So when she calls you, just blank her.
That night I went to Ten Rooms after Tantra,
But I didn?t think you and her would jump in the same cab bruv.
Listen bruv, just give your girl time and space.
Maybe a couple of days, to get her mind straight.
Serious bruv listen, ?llow it for a bit,
And if she?s got any sense, she?ll know Amber?s chatting shit.

You were letting her down,
You were tempted and failed.
You showed her up,

She defeated you gradually
So you must then be honest you must then get on this.

To ease it off your chest, to be relieved of the mess that's being proper selfish,

But you didn't wanna be with her

It would spare her weak heart

Then the passionate act won't happen, 'cause you plan not to have the chance,

The Streets,"Using the following, I'm going to show you:

A) how to con someone using their own greed,
B) that you won't feel bad 'cos they're trying to con you anyway, and
C) taking their money!

As I have come to realize, running the beats is just getting people's confidence.

This scam only works 'cos that man thinks he's working this scam
And that you man off his mark
Get your mate, let's call your mate piers
No, not piers, let's call him Farquhar
Anyway get Farquhar to crawl into a bar with his dog
Like I said, the barman will try and con you later
But you're gonna take all his money.
Anyway, get Farquhar to pass into a local bar
And call to the bar to look after a dog for a dart
Just for twenty quid for a while, claiming that he hated it
But it was worth more than his car
This, by the way, requires that you find and supply Farquhar
With an animal, and a life, from your local park.
Get a nice dog that doesn't bark
But not so nice that someone might miss this mutt from the park

Anyway, using this technique you're gonna take all this man's money
But you're not gonna care, cos he's gonna fucking deserve it

[Chorus]
You'll never con an honest john
An honest john you can't drag down (exactly!)
Con-do-lee get conned
When they think they're the cunning one (it's all one big con)
Neighbor you won't con
An honest john

Now listen, get Farquhar to dart out the bar
And just shop for some garm's, maybe
Just to pass an hour or so
I would go shopping cos' I gave up drinking
But whatever, just have Farquhar down the road
Now you walk in the bar, walk up to the barman
Order a jar, when you've caught him slouched on his own
Start eying the dog that he's minding by his side
Currently vibe him and start on about the dog you own.
Start asking the barman, if it's his fine specimen of a dog
Nod, smile, agree, look interested and cool
When he tells you it's someone else's you've just left previous
Tell him, 'this is a very rare breed of animal.'
Last time I lied my manager swiped me
But lie, and tell him it's like a fucking red-eared hunting spaniel.
Tell him it's worth 600 quid and you would pay handsomely if you were to accept finance at all

[Chorus]
You'll never con an honest john (sometimes...)
An honest john you can't drag down (...sometimes I think I should just go completely...)
Condolee get conned
When they think they're the cunning one
Neighbor you won't con an honest john (keep listening though, it's important that you keep listening...)

Now take all his shopping off him
Get your mate Farquhar to pop in
Looking straight gutted a bit later on
He should order a jar, talk at the bar
Ensure he looks calm, warm with the barman
And generally start conversating on.
Farquhar should start falling apart
About how he's arsed up some chance
And how arsed up his day was.
Or in the event, the spread betting he's getting ready to accept
That his rent's not getting payed up.
The barman's mind will chime slowly for a while
He might wipe the bar, as his mind is making sums.
Farquhar should continue to moan about money
And that this mutt is not the greatest of his worries.
And like 'ching!', the barman will five out of six times
Kindly offer his greed to buy the dog for a price of three hundred quid
And after some bartering, your barman will haggle and charge harder
In greed of the scent of the scheme in his head. (that's right, neighbor!)

You'll never con an honest john
An honest john you can't drag down
Condolee get conned
When they think they're the cunning one
(the barman, is gonna see how much he can stitch you up for.)
Neighbor you won't con an honest john
(how does that work? cos' every time it's based around someone who thinks they're conning you.)

They'll never imagine the whole scenario is prepared solely for him
Why should he?
That sort of paranoia can get you in the loony bin!

As I have come to realize, running the beats is just getting people's confidence.
And than taking their money!

The girl in my bed is kinda distant right now,
I know shes thinkin' shes a bit frightened somehow,
I don't think she realized what I'd invited her back to my house
I don't want anyone to see me like this right now
I sorts thoughts rollin' back in my eyes
I've been a poor sports thoughts dance in my mind
A banging headache dancin' prang'd by their side
Dancin' with the pictures from the past of my life
I don't remember any of what I just thought at all
The conclusion prior to when I forgot it all
Panicing a bit, gettin' frightened 'n fuck all
So nursing my bruise I drink right from the bottle
I don't want anyone I know to see my like this
My fibs and single became lies and lists
She's gonna sell-tell no doubt fuck it

My laptop must have slipped down and gone to sleep
Before the prangers pain must've dawned on me
Stupid idiot!
Around the time I was skethchin' tryin' to con some sleep
And the new day on me was nearly dawning in here
I must have flaked while I puttied
Way to loads more
'Cuz I'd staked on bookings
Waited to tell the score
Why do I break my rules not to wager any more
I flaked on the bookings and majorly totaled on the score
I've got a simple problem
But my minds spinning out
I remembered the website between the wine and the stout
The rush of fear made me forget how fucked I'd been
This time I'm drying my eyes and a fuckin' nose bleed
Turnin' the phone off when my promo bloke phones me
Evaded for it got nasty when my manager when he only beat me
I threw his wallet out the window as it had grown heated
He said 'sort your life out' as he punched me onto my feet

Your task is to make her notice you fast but hanker when you don't close in after

How the hell am I supposed to be able to do a line in front of complete strangers, when I know They've all got cameras?

When you're a famous boy, it gets really easy to get girls,
It's all so easy you get a bit spoiled.
So, when you try to pull a girl, who is also famous too,
It feels just like when you wasn't famous.

The celebrity pages in papers don't tell tales that are always to the line of the truth.
It's 'til a line at which most likely you'll have the time, or enough finance to sue.
Which is why it's so frightening buying papers in the morning fearing the next Mike Skinner scoop.
'Cause I used to believe what I read, so now I know that others will believe that it's true.

But I realized, with you the truth could be, a whole lot worse than the flack.
My whole life I never thought I'd see, a pop star smoke crack.
And I must admit I was quite shocked, with that thing you did with me on my back.
But, outside in the lobby, I shouldn't have laughed when you slapped that man.

When you're a famous boy, it gets really easy to get girls,
It's all so easy you get a bit spoilt.
So, when you try to pull a girl, who is also famous too,

You were so much fun, I really got to like you more than you liked me,
I really hoped that you'd stay.
Considering the amount of prang you'd done, you looked amazing on cd:uk.
You learn dances, do promo, cameras flashing, get in the van, zoom away (reeeoow).
I wake up high, diss my beat feel hung over and sorry for my doomed day.

But I know I got a bit close to you, and that you found it fucking boring.
You taught me so much about how to deal with the how far I'd fallin' in.
And what version of a rumor would next day be everyone's story of me.
You taught me all the realities and turn the page and ignore 'em.

When you're a famous boy, it gets really easy to get girls,
It's all so easy you get a bit spoiled.
So, when you try to pull a girl, who is also famous too,
It feels just like when you wasn't famous.

Anyway, I had to rest my beer hat, delete my dealer's number and unroll my bank notes.
And we were on borrowed time anyway, what with the daily toilet papers not knowin'.
And I knew that when the people who thought they knew you, when they found out, 
I would've been mocked.
Which is ironic, 'cause in reality, standing next to you I look fucking soft.

Whenever I see you on MTV, I can't stop my big wide smile.
And past the 'children's appeal', I see the darkness behind.
We both know the scratches on my back, much better than the alludes and lies.
I miss the bitchin' and shoutin', but I'm glad I got out in time.

Is can I see us not battering them?

The points for right lying out and guides them good
They never really mimic every word by eye
'Cuz if they did they'd be in a whole world of strife
The book's quite old school, but then it was tough
It contains some quite experimental justice
The thinking people are thinking that without this book
That without these verses we'd pillage and murder but
Following this red book word for word
Leads you to actually pillage and murder
Could it be so what we think to be right,
Is simply the opinion that survived?

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright
'Cuz when you're bad you will feel sad
That's the religion I live by

There's a bloke in the book who made everything
He knows every individual and every trick in them
Way above emotion, never getting stressed
But when men choose against him, gets jealous
People fight for him in crippling wars
But since he has the power of infinite awe
We're merely itching on futilities floor
Should we really be needing to assist him at all?
If he loves us all, knowing all we think
Should he only like people with faith in him?
Given I can't control what I truly believe
Can I be forgiven for only believing who I see?

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright
'Cuz when you're bad you will feel sad

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright

So we wouldn't be blind when joining up
Could we see both sides of the coin for the good?
Breed less strife on our voyage for good?
Getting threatened by men with questions
We'll never get anywhere rejecting evidence
Could we test everything instead of betting
On alleged legends?
If we teach that it's right to blindly believe
If we reach to the sky to define our meaning
Well I agree what's right will keep driving people to fight with people

Throw a stone as high as you can
And hearing with hand not hear it land

My window and world spins and twirls
The walls then fall, I recall the sore
White clouds white wash faded spotless
The weighty shadows, ranges of rocks
The cold is all illusion thought up
The stroll on the shore, snooze and explore
All possibilities in each new morning
Until satisfied reaching out, yawning
Fish in a big dish, some rice and spice
Salt over shoulder never (?)

Life lies in the blink of an eye

New life born is like changing

There's nothing to witness
I said as I looked back from the edge of a cliff
The old man looking down bent over the ridge 
Struck with a grin as if a blessing had hit him

I slumped on the jut of the cliff
Just leave me alone, this is none of your business
I will, said the old man, but just one thing
And what he said was so lovely it stunned me

He said: I lay right there once at the edge of the rock
I was ready to jump, I was ever so lost
But this gentleman stopped and said something I never forgot

[Chorus:]
For billions of years since the outset of time
Every single one of your ancestors has survived
Every single person on your mum and dad's side
Successfully looked after and passed on to you life
What are the chances of that, like?
It comes to me once in a while
And everywhere I tell folk it gets the best smile

And then the old man walked away and out of sight
Til the sound of him hiking turned to the sound of silence.
I just froze in a profound surprise 
And from down on my pride I found a smile to my eyes.

And for many days again I've been passing the same cliff 
And on many occasions I'd chance on the same thing

Laying in the moss, in the same way I was 
Would be another man looking like he needed a change of luck

So I'd say: I lay right there once at the edge of the rock
I was ready to jump, I was ever so lost
But this gentleman stopped and said something I never forgot

The Streets,"From the point he gazed from the choice was made, but 'walk the cave or the shore?'
The oily cave seemed to breathe on him through gravestone jaws
His little hand grasped in anguish as he weighed up his coin
Somewhere a blue-eyed girl in the world is just waiting for a boy
Footprints trailed as if trod by slaves up to the grey cave floor
But not one graze from anything ever escaping this fort
So with coin on hand his joy came back when ordered to take the shore
'Why on earth', as he wandered the warmth, 'am I obeying this coin?'

Turn your life on the flip of this coin
Turn upside a choice you'd normally avoid
And promise me you'll follow what it says
Whatever it says

Again, walk within the trusted beach or swim the swell of the sea?
And again the scarier alternative looked like certain death to he
He'd never learnt to skill of swimming - it never occurred to be very easy
And again he winced as he flipped the coin and it twirled to his feet
'How is this sane?' he blamed the coin now aiming for the waves
As he hesitated at the swirl of water as it raged and rained
Blue-eyed girls were waiting and he was drowning in the spray
Blue-eyed girls he should have been acquainted with but for shouting and flailing

Turn your life on the flip of this coin
Turn upside a choice you'd normally avoid
And promise me you'll follow what it says
Whatever it says

He finally slugs it back to land feeling chewed-up and foolish
Empties his pockets on the sand spewing a pool each
Staggers back to his dad who's too cool to be
So he says 'why did you have me follow this stupid rule, please?'
To be honest little fellow I'll tell you
I was just as afraid as you
But you said you wanted to get with people and places ever new
And I got a bit scared of the fate of my baby son's future
So I invented a reason to see if you could ever make do
As soon as you appeared behind that rock looking angry at me
I soon realized what a hell of a man you've ended up being
I knew you'd worked out how to swim, which I hadn't had in me
And I stand as a companion of you, proudest a man has ever been

With all the cloves and all the rose tinted rows that go and sully

Sweeping and sweeping, the speaking unceasing
From steeple to steeple, the people are shrieking
Soon we parade through the fence, absolutely Dame Judy Dench'd
And then stop, tell them to score and they flop

The points for right lying out and guides them good
They never really mimic every word by eye
'Cause if they did they'd be in a whole world of strife
The book's quite old school, but then it was tough
It contains some quite experimental justice
The thinking people are thinking that without this book
That without these verses we'd pillage and murder but,
Following this red book word for word
Leads you to actually pillage and murder

Is simply the opinion that survived?

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright
'Cause when you're bad you will feel sad

There's a bloke in the book who made everything
He knows every individual and every trick in them
Way above emotion, never getting stressed
But when men choose against him, gets jealous
People fight for him in crippling wars
But since he has the power of infinite awe
We're merely itching on futilities floor
Should we really be needing to assist him at all?
If he loves us all, knowing all we think
Should he only like people with faith in him?
Given I can't control what I truly believe,
Can I be forgiven for only believing who I see?

Could we see both sides of the coin for the good?
Breed less strife on our voyage for good?

We'll never get anywhere rejecting evidence
Could we test everything instead of betting,
On alleged legends?
If we teach that it's right to blindly believe
If we reach to the sky to define our meaning
Well I agree what's right will keep driving people to fight with people

And the sun was beatin down

And had a run-in with the man

You can't bust me, cause you don't know what you found.

I even offered her some cash
But she wouldn't listen she was callin the cops
Because her gutter had been smashed
Next thing I knew when I walked outside
There were police all around
Askin who was the driver of the vehicle?
Can I see your license Whatca doin in our town?

I call you up, get you on the line
I call you up on the phone
But I can't see you smile

I think of you when I'm gone
I think of you, honey, all the time
I think of you when I'm gone
But I can't see you smile

How the story ends, baby, I don't know
And what's to come, I can't say
And how the story ends, baby, I don't know

Maybe I'll stop travelling some day
I count the days while we're apart
I count the days and I count the miles
I count the days that we're apart
Until I can see you smile

I know that you feel just the same
You wish that I wasn't gone so long
I write this down from so far away
Now I'm coming home

I love you there's no doubt
Your picture is hung above my bed
I look at it as we're travelling around
But I wish I were holding you instead

Well it's a long and windy road
Our love is strong and the future's bright
It's a long and windy road
Until we reach the light
I know things are going to be all right

Because you're in my dreams when I sleep at night
You turn around and you look at me
And I can see you smile
I can see you smile (repeats)",Smile,2001
The String Cheese Incident,"Spend our lifetime reading 
Books that we've been told to
Are we catching the meaning?
Are we really supposed to?

It's time that we start seeing
The shades of color between the lines
Find a true way of being 
Don't you think we're wasting time

Have you heard of Douglas town?
And the Irish of another skin
A million people have died there
How come we never heard a thing?

You envision a world without chains
Listen do you hear the call?
Dr. King and those who rise and fall
Fought so hard to bring peace to all

[Chorus: ]
Can't you see
That not everything is black and white? 
Can't you see,
That we need each other's strength and might?

In this world of illusion 
It's so easy to be blinded
Out of created confusion
Separation in minded
See if we can believe in

The truth that all our children know 
It's about time we start thinking
It's not all about what we're told
Can't you see
That not everything is black and white? 

Can't you feel
That we need each other's strength and might? 
When we believe
That there's no need for these walls to grow 
We'll all see
That it takes all colors to make this rainbow 
Higher, higher, higher....(and so on)",Black and White,2001
The String Cheese Incident,"Work his whole life to get where he is
Nothing gonna bring him down

Looking for something to light his way
Living for then and not for now
He wants to be free but he doesn't know how

All he knows is what he sees
So much more behind the scenes
Open wide, crawl deep inside
Open wide

He lost his way he's off the path
Gotta keep moving can't look back
Where he is and where he was
Will never be the same

Has no key, it?s an open door
The love he needs and hopes to find
Has been with him all the time

Look again and wonder why
See all my fears come up inside

The String Cheese Incident,"Can you tell me what happened to the blossom
Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy 
Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush 

When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom 
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow 
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses 
And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow 
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon 
Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush 
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush  

I was picking berries when that crow flew above me 
Carrying my lover so far away 
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom 
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay 
The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard 
With weeds growing over in the old graveyard 
And the day settles down to an evening hush  
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush",Blackberry Blossom,2002

If I get home before daylight 
I just might get some sleep tonight

I spent that night in Utah 
In a cave up in the hills 

I ran down to the levee 
But the Devil caught me there 
He took my twenty-dollar bill 
And he vanished in the air 

Got two reasons why I cry 
away each lonely night 
First one's named sweet Ann Marie 
and she's my heart's delight 
Second one is prison, baby 
the sheriff's on my trail 
And if he catches up with me 
I'll spend my life in jail

And one in Cherokee

They flew him out of the sticks

The way he spat at his mic

They said he'd be a superstar
If he could handle the pressure

They took him to tea
And told him just a couple changes
That they wanted to see

Oh what a shame
But it's easy, can't you see?
Oh what a shame
That they won't ever let you be

They said his hair would be better
If he colored it black
And that he wouldn't sound as harsh if he could tone it all back
They dressed him up in a craze
To make him look pretty
They said the kids would dig
If he looked like he came from the city
They listened back to his cut
His music was tight
But if he changed a couple lyrics
In the chorus it might
Sound fresher than ever

'cause they won't shake the roots of the money tree
No good praying to the pristine alters
Waiting for the blessing with holy water
They like the same old wealth in the same old hands
Means the same old people stay old people stay in command
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
They got it wrapped up tight, they got it safe and sound
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

Too much money in too few places
Only puts a smile on particular faces
Said too much power in not enough hands
Makes me think ""get rich quick; take all I can""
They're too busy spending on the means of destruction
To ever spend a penny on some real construction

Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
They amuse themselves as they fool around
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like they say, make them vulnerable

No good looking to the empire corners,
""civilization"" built on slaughter
Carrying hopes and carrying maps
The spineless ones fall in their laps
The brave and the bold are the ones to be fooled
With a diet of lies by the Kipling school

Watch your money-go-round, watch your money-go-round
But I just can't help being cynical
Watch your money-go-round, watch your money-go-round

They bend your arm and they bend your ear
Said they bend your mind as you talk in circles
Bend over forwards, this won't hurt you
Till there's blood in your lap, blood on your hands

Come spend a penny, go out with a pound

Said come back later when the slates wiped clean

Watch the money-go-round, watch your money-go-round

The Style Council,"I stood as tall as a mountain
I never really thought about the drop
I trod over rocks to get there
Just so I could stand on top

Clumsy and blind I stumbled
As I crawled through desert sands
I didn't stop to think about the consequences
As it came to pieces in my hands

Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu
Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu

I thought I was a maritime marvel
I believed that I ruled the waves
All I could say is time is motion
And every effort others made I would save

I was a shit stained statue
School children would stand in awe
I truly believed I was a ceiling of sky
Never thought about having flaws

Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu
Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu

I felt as reverent as Jesus
The sanctimony stunk
I thought I was admiral of the missing fleet
I couldn't see that I was sunk

I roared my pride in the darkness
I scratched away at the stars
I thought I was lord of this crappy jungle
I should have been put behind bars

Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu
Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu

But now I sit with my head in my hands
And wail to the weeping wall
The avalanche of my emotions
Holds the audience of one enthralled

I'm learning the lesson the hard way
Like a fall from command
I thought I was king of the whole wide world
But it just came to pieces in my hands
",It Just Came to Pieces in My Hands,1984
The Style Council,"Handed down from fathers to sons
Was the hatred of weakness and the love of guns
A talk of peace but not in our time
To save our souls and stop the crime

Onwards and upwards but going nowhere
So how many now truthfully swear
That they do no evil, see no wrong
The ad-mass agents, the writers of song
The bankers, the poets, the modern day seers
Clouding an issue that was never quite clear

Sent through the ages of boy to man
The living testament of making a stand
Killing the wicked then raising the dead
Eating propaganda and shit spoon fed

Grasping for wisdom, but thick all the same
So how many innocents now can claim
That they play with fire and get burnt
And through the same mistakes never get learnt
Hoping for a time it will fall to place
Faith shall show as our saving grace

Handed down from God with love
Was the whole wide world and some above
But not content to share the land
Greed was shown the winning hand

And those whose greed was the strongest of all
Took upon themselves to lead the call
That some must work while other rest
Without the question of what is best
The leaders, the losers and the kings
Pass the rifle butt that tyranny brings

Passed on over to the chosen few

Was the promise of freedom with a breadline queue
Ghetto's, gateaux and eating it too
Forcing it all down with a cola brew
The first amendment and the hunt for reds

A conscious contradiction with something said
That they see no evil with eyes shut tight
A cocaine culture that offers no fight
Dragged from birth, drugged to death
The common excuse is just being yourself

Hand us down before it's too late
The strength and wisdom to change our state
Governed by evil and all it will bring
I can't wait for the day they do the lamppost swing

And no mercy should they be shown
For you cannot reason with the devil's own
They say, they hear no evil, hands clasped tight
To shut out the victims' screams of ol' Uncle Sam fights
He sweats and he strains as his boney frame comes

Into the womb of an innocent one
",A Gospel,1984

When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
and this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?

Naive and wise with no sense of time

Untouched by unhuman hands
'Cause only God knows I don't call that a man
Who spends his waking days
Telling others what to think and what to say

And greedy hands rub together again
Shipping out the profits that they've stolen

With only myself to blame for playing that stupid game

The Style Council,"May I walk you home tonight
On this fine and lovely night tonight
We'll walk past the luscious houses
Through rolling lawns and lovely flowers

Our nice new town where the curtains are drawn
Where hope is started and dreams can be borne

Let us share our insanity
Go mad together in Community
Boys on the corner looking for their supper
Boys 'round the green looking for some slaughter

We used to chase dreams, now we chase the dragon
Mine is the semi with the Union Jack on

In our paradise lost we'll be finding our sanity
In this paradise found we'll be losing our way
For a brave new day

May I slash my wrists tonight?
This fine Conservative night
I was looking for a job so I came to town
I easily adopt when the chips are down

I read the ad about the private schemes
I liked the idea but now I'm not so Keyne

If you can't find work in your own town.

As I rise from my bed I can hear the old man
Blaming Heaven & Mother for this
30 Years with one firm, 13 months redundant,
Yes I'd say that's unlucky for some -

Now our tears fall like rain, as my Mother walks me to my train,
With a kiss & a wave - ""Come home weekends"" - that's if I can save.
I swear I'll take it out on the man -
Who ever devised this economy plan.

On a boat that's bound for hope - But left you in the queue
With your shouting, waving, taunting, flaunting friends as crew
Telling you that every lie you ever heard was true
Have you stood upon that deck - Have you ever had it blue.
Have you ever woke to find the morning didn't come
Undelivered with the papers - stolen by someone
Found the milkman bound and gagged and shackles ' round the sun
And the holder of the keys turns out to be the one
The girl you had your heart set on - Have you ever had it blue.

Have you ever watched the day, passing by your door
Powerless to change its course, your feet fixed to the floor
When all the people you thought you knew are changing more and more

Bitter turns to sugar - some call a passive tune
But the day things turn sweet - for me won't be too soon
The hush before the silence
The winds after the blast
I wish we'd move together - this time the bosses sued
But we're caught up in the wilderness and an ever changing mood
Teardrops turn to children - who've never had the time
To commit the sins they pay for through - another's evil mind
The love after the hate
The love we leave too late
I wish we'd wake up one day - an' everyone feel moved
But we're caught up in the dailies and an ever changing mood

Evil turns to statues - and masses form a line
But I know which way I'd run to if the choice was mine

And the future we always leave too late

I wonder how she feels today.
She threw it all away
I wonder if she's there to stay.

Watch the money-go-round; watch your money-go-round

The crimpoline dresses who have no sins
Christians by day, killers in war
The hypocrites who know what they're fighting for
Killing for peace, freedom and truth
But they're too old to go so they send the youth

Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round

Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
I must insist - he was a Socialist!

From Satan's power and might.""

Rejoiced much in mind,

With every single step you take,
The longer you will have to wait.
The sigh in a silent room is a big mistake.
And now I forget my name,
I left it back in yesterday.
I'll never see, never know what's coming round my way..
What's coming round my way? 
The thieves and the rebels,
They know it all, they know it:
Where you go I follow!
Take me away to another place..
Each day comes, it passes.
And I walk by with my head held high;
Where you go I follow!
Take me away to another place, UGH! 
And now I forget my name,
I left it back in yesterday.
I'll never see, never know what's coming round my way..
What's coming round my way?

They know it all, they know it:

Where you go I follow!
Take me away to another place...

In a silent room, It's a big mistake!

Loose change lonely, not the right amount
Forgotten man of an indifferent nation
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station
Somebody's calling you again
The sky is falling
Jimmie's standing in the rain

Nobody wants to buy a counterfeited prairie lullaby in a colliery town
The hip flask and fumbled skein of some stage door Josephine is all he'll get now

Mild and bitter from tuberculosis

Her soft breath was gentle on his neck
If he could choose the time to die
Then he would come and go like this
Underneath a painted sky

She woke up and called him ""Charlie"" by mistake
And then in shame began to cry
Tarnished silver band peels off a phrase
And then warms their hands around the brazier

Forgotten man
Indifferent nation
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station
Somebody's calling you again

Your soft plaintive whistling
And your wan wandering smile
Died down at The Hippodrome
Now you're walking off to jeers, the lonely sound of jingling spurs, 
The ""toodle-oos"" and ""Oh, my dears"" down at ""The Argyle""

Vile vaudevillians applaud sobriety
There's no place for a half-cut cowboy in polite society

The Sugar Canes,"I'm cutting up her pure white dress
That I dyed red
That I dyed red
I'm putting scraps in cheap tin lockets
What time erases and memory mocks
I'll send them over the ocean foam
Right into those gentle European homes

The slave ship ""Blessing"" slipped from Liverpool
Over the waves the Royal Navy rules
To go and plunder the Kingdom of Benin
Where certain history ends and shame begins

Dahomey traders paid in powder and shot
Line up their prisoners and they sell them in lots
They packed them tight inside those coffin ships
And took them to the brand new world of auction blocks and whips

So I'm cutting up her pure white dress
That I dyed red
That I dyed red
I'm putting scraps in cheap tin lockets
What time erases and memory mocks
I'll send them over the ocean foam
Right into those gentle European homes

White is the sheet on your fine linen bed
The blood stained red on each cotton thread
The merchants gather at St. George's Hall
To unveil the kneeling slave who is carved upon the wall

So picture the scene on the old Salt House docks
Where they loaded the iron shackles and locks
Between a sandstone crocodile, a barrel and a bale
You will see the nameless faces they were offering for sale

So, I sing the praises of God's glory
As a blue cetacean floats in the basement
An elephant on the second story
They queue all day to see him
In my American Museum

But the Lord will judge us, with fire and thunder
As man continues with all his blunders
It's only money
It's only numbers
Maybe it is time to put aside these fictitious wonders

And man is feeble
Man is puny
And if it should divide the Union
There is no man who should own another
When he can't even recognize his sister and his brother",Red Cotton,2015

The Sugarcubes,"Walk through here
When I've been just by myself
I start thinking too much
Unhealthy things start to happen
Like gastric disorders
I just go out walking
With my favourite piece of wood
With a 4 inch nail driven through it
When I am just by myself
I think too much
I start polishing my behaviour
Without any mercy
Somehow people
Don't seem to like me,
I don't know why,
I really don't want to hurt them
When I've been just by myself
I start thinking too much
I know I'm not talkative
What! I've become dry?
An emotional biscuit
That's nonsense!
Sir, this nail of yours is rusty
It's evil
I like them but when I hit them
They scream and run away
Even though I say I'm sorry.
I like meeting people.

She scratches his beard.  she's painting huge books, glues them together,
They saw a big raven; it glided down the sky, she touched it.

He's dragging you
Along..
On a leash called love.

Einar
You have torn me, inside out.
Nothing but, a nervous wreck.
You have got me, on a leash,
You whip me with, a leash called love..
I've lost all sense of direction, you make me a victim
To your friends' nasty remarks, and I don't know how
I survive, I can no longer
Distinguish from, right or wrong,
Sane insane, whip me back,
Back and forth, paranoid.
Leash called love..

I've tried a lot and most things excite me.
But what tops it all is doing two things at a time.

Einar
Life and death, glass and water
Rock and roll, wash and dirty
Christ and jesus, time and hours

Björk
To drive a car and listen to music.
To read a book and ride a train.

Einar
Watch and maker, God and dog
Hammer and saw, babies and nappies
Stop and hold, moon and stars

Björk
To be a charming combination,
Tense me up.
I'm into trying a lot and most things excite me.
But what tops it all is doing two things at a time.

Einar
Knife and fork, pad and felt
Window and pane, country and western
Rhythm and blues, yawn and sigh

Björk
This is a lucky night for me
A night when one plus one is three
To read a letter and fall in love
To not sleep and be not unhappy
To watch tv and cuddle
Crême de la crême
Is doing two things at a time

Einar
To do two things twice at once
It's so nice, is there a point? 

Björk
Two things... two!

Einar
To be or not to
Time and logic finally
You must enter my two nostrils
Can that be, or am I just thinking?

Glass and water...

The golden landscape.
I wanna be there
Right with you.
That's where I'm staying,
Where no-one can find me
In the depths of the valleys
Magnificent landscape

Delicious boy,
With animal eyes,
Beautiful buttocks,
Haunting movements.
But the thing that makes me love you
Is the unforgettable smell of your skin.

There's a hole and there's a stick.
There's a cove and there's a ship,
That goes in and out of the harbour.

The heavy pear,
Totally ripe.
Adorable fruits
So generous.

I'm in the landscape
Crawl into the canyon
Into the rain forest
Crawl up the cravasse
Jog along the tundra
Walk up the slope
Have a breather between the hills
Admire the view
Not yet on the peak
Walk further and rest
Between two tranquil pools
Then climb the peak
And admire
I'm captivated.

The Sugarcubes,"Riding on my bicycle i saw a motorcrash,
A proper motorcrash and lots of spectators.
I rushed to the centre saw the injured parents,
Cuts on the children, an awful motorcrash.
Dangerous terribly bloody motorcrash, destructive motorcrash.
Took the mother, sneaked with her secretly all the way to my home,
And nursed her gently put on her bandages, gave her milk and biscuits,
She sighed pleasantly after this awful motorcrash.
That girl on that bicycle showed great interest in all the motorcrashes in the
neighbourhood,
She look quite innocent, but believe you me i know what innocence looks like
And it wasn't there, after she got that bicycle.  then we disguised ourselves,
Took a taxi to her home, when her husband opened the door she introduced
herself,
He said ""where have you been all this time?""",Motorcrash,1993

With the sureshot m.c.s for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same

But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat beat, its so unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a you don't stop
Rock it out baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie da beat

I said I can't wait til the end of the week
When I'm rappin to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on hank sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong

Well, I'm imp the dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three mcs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker mcs try to prove a point

We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mike til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was comin home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mike and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said damn fly guy I'm in love with you
The casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said I go by the name of lois lane
And you could be my boyfiend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppoose
Flyin through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it , do it
An I'm here an I'm there I'm big bang hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it don't stop why'all a tick a tock why'all you don't stop
Go hotel motel what you gonna do today(say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank drive off in a def oj
Everybody go hotel motel holiday inn
You say if your girl starts actin up then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my oj
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to master gee so he could shock the house 
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin to the beat and feelin all right
Everybody was dancin on the floor
Doin all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya somethin we're a helluva crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
For you to party ya got to have the movies
So we'll get right down and give you the groove
For you to dance you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rockin affair
But let me tell ya somethin there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over you're makin it home
And tryin to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleepin ya start to dream
And thinkin how ya danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doin a do
Rockin ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
On n on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of wonder mike
Come on wonder mike do what ya like

Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin fiend that does not bet
Like dracula with out his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin up and not comin down
Is just like the beat without the sound no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin that you're full
And then your friend says momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh uh that's bull
So your heart starts pumpin and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says man there's plenty of food
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin here makin myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says I understand about the food
Baby bubbah but we're still friends
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop a you don't stop the rockin
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say hank can ya rock
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo
I said come on 
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A big bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said sit down punk I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a mc steal your rhyme
So from sixty six til this very day
Ill always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker mcs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that's called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a god d--m word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker mc's can bite all night
A tick a tock why'all a beat beat why'all
A lets rock why'all ya don't stop
Ya go hotel motel whatcha gonna do today (say what)
Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spankin

Givin all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive

The Sugarhill Gang,"I said a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip hip-hop, and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang-bang, boogie say ""up jump""
The boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now, what you have here is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say ""hello""
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say ""up jump"" the boogie to the bang-bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the riddle that will make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along
And next on the mike is my man Hank
Come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out, I'm the c-a-s-an-the-o-v-a
And the rest is f-l-y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix
And these reasons I'll tell ya why
Ya see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun
And I dress to a t
Ya see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool
Which really is on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see
The Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking bout checkbooks, credit cards
More money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again
You go hotel motel whatcha gonna do today (say what)
You say: ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spanking
Drive off in a def oj
Everybody go, hotel motel holiday inn
Say if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend
Master Gee, am I mellow
Its on you so what you gonna do

Well it's on and on and on on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said m-a-s, t-e-r, a g with a double e
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there could ever be
Now I'm feeling the highs and ya feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
Ya start popping ya fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And the damn ya start doing the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rocking to the rhythm, shake your derrière
Ya rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot m.c.s for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on on and on
Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop ya don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what ya got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on on and on
Rock rock y'all throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on girls get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all a-gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4 tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip hop, a you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie say up jumped the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scoobie doo
And guess what America we love you
'Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a you don't stop
Rock it out baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie da beat
I said I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mike 'til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said damn fly guy I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said I go by the name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An I'm here an I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it don't stop y'all a tick a tock y'all you don't stop
Go hotel motel what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank drive off in a def oj
Everybody go hotel motel holiday inn
You say if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit 'em all inside my oj
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rocking to the beat and feeling all right
Everybody was dancing on the floor
Doing all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya something we're a helluva crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cutting the jams and making it freak
For you to party, got to have the movies
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rocking affair
But let me tell ya something there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over you're making it home
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleeping ya start to dream
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene
Our name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doing a do
Rocking ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
On and on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man coming on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on Wonder Mike do what ya like

Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like going up and not coming down
Is just like the beat without the sound no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh uh that's bull
So your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says man there's plenty of food
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says I understand about the food
Baby bubbah but we're still friends
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop a you don't stop the rocking
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say Hank can ya rock
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo
I said come on, make, make the people move

I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientèle
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A big bang, I got clientèle
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said sit down punk I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme
So from sixty six 'til this very day
Ill always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a goddamn word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock y'all a beat beat y'all
A lets rock y'all ya don't stop
Ya go hotel motel whatcha gonna do today (say what)
Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spanking
Drive off in a def oj
Everybody go hotel motel holiday inn
Ya say if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends
A like that y'all to the beat y'all
Beat beat y'all ya don't stop
A master gee am I mellow?
Its on you so whatcha gonna do

Well like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singing holy ghost
The sounds to throw down they're played the most
It's like my man captain sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off y'all I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like getting right down for you tonight
Like moving your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like coming alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one my life begun
At the age of two I was doing the do
At the age of three it was you and me
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four I was on the floor
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee its all the way live
At the age of six I was a picking up sticks
Rapping to the beat my stick was fixed
At the age of seven I was rocking in heaven dontcha know I went off
I got right on down to the beat you see
Getting right on down making all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was really great
Cause every night you see I had a date
At the age of nine I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on and on and on on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A saying on and on and on on and on
Like a hot buttered de pop de pop de popcorn
A saying on and on and on on and on
'Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mike
I am the definite feast delight
I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight

The Sugarhill Gang,"I said a hip hop,
Hippie to the hippie,
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Now, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat,
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,
The purple and yellow  But first, I gotta
Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie,
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,
Let's rock, you don't stop,
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,
And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
C'mon, Hank, sing that song!

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,
And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why
You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a color TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball  Hear me talk about
Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
Than a sucker could ever spend,
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again  Everybody go
Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
'cause I'm a get a fly girl,
Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ  
Everybody go ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
Master Gee!  My mellow!
It's on to you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn!  Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn!  Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on

You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much, Raaah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high 
Built to shelter the rich and greedy 
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows 
Looking down on the poor and the needy 
Miles of people, marching up the avenue 
Doin? what they gotta do, just to get by 
I'm living in the land of plenty and many 
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, too many people, too much 
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump 
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump"" 
?Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed 
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through 
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought 
He got nothing to eat, no shoes on his feet 
She even left his clothes out in the street 
He keeps hearing noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone 
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib 
In this man's world, so much for Women's Lib

New York New York big city of dreams 
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly 
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes 
They're sugar and spice and everything nice 
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat 
I barely can stand, on my own two feet
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it 
Something?s on my mind and I just can't shake it 
I need some time, and I want some space 
I gotta get away from the human race?

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Raaah!

Staring at a skyscraper reaching into heaven 
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell 
Just play ball or be an entertainer 
'Cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares 
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin' in a nightmare 
Paranoid schizo, set back, snowbound 
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!

I might find the strength to make another day 
If I didn't have to get up and do my thing 
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin' bout ice cream 
Whipped cream, fruits and a cherry on top 
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh 
The pressure is on, It ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind 
I don't want to be kissing nobody's behind 
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk 
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash 
Should?a been thinking and tried to fake whiplash 
A crowd gathered round, they're callin' me fat

On 42nd Street, lookin' for some action 
Women standing on the corner selling satisfaction 
One young punk just leaning on the fence 
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster 
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands 
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up

A baby cries and a mother dies 
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes
Because in this room, on this day 
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh!
The gift of life really means a lot 
And in the ghetto your life is all you got 
So you take to the streets, trying to exist 
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be 
But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex 
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there 
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!"" 
You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail 
When you put your baby in the garbage pail 
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid 
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!
The muffled screams of a dying baby 
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy 
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain 
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane

All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on

But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much, Raaah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high 
Built to shelter the rich and greedy 
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows 
Looking down on the poor and the needy 
Miles of people, marching up the avenue 
Doin? what they gotta do, just to get by 
I'm living in the land of plenty and many 
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, too many people, too much 
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump 
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump"" 
?Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed 
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through 
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought 
He got nothing to eat, no shoes on his feet 
She even left his clothes out in the street 
He keeps hearing noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone 
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib 
In this man's world, so much for Women's Lib

You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly 
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes 
They're sugar and spice and everything nice 
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat 
I barely can stand, on my own two feet
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it 
Something?s on my mind and I just can't shake it 
I need some time, and I want some space 
I gotta get away from the human race?

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Raaah!

Staring at a skyscraper reaching into heaven 
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell 
Just play ball or be an entertainer 
'Cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares 
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin' in a nightmare 
Paranoid schizo, set back, snowbound 
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!

I might find the strength to make another day 
If I didn't have to get up and do my thing 
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin' bout ice cream 
Whipped cream, fruits and a cherry on top 
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh 
The pressure is on, It ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind 
I don't want to be kissing nobody's behind 
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk 
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work

One young punk just leaning on the fence 
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents

So you take to the streets, trying to exist 
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be 
But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex

You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you

Chaka Khan won't you tell me what you wanna do
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

I was sitting on the corner just a wasting my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme
I got on the microphone and what do you see huh!
The rest was my legacy
I was born to be the king of the be bop swing
To have Stallions and medallions, big diamond rings
To own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
'Cause rap is the game that I control
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap something people wanted to hear
See before my reign it was the same old same
You took ""the ba with the ba""
That's street-talk game
So if you ever, let me make this clear
If you ever think that we're stepping out of here
You ever think you're getting up, down, around or in huh huh!
You better think again my friend
Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off

Well, I'm Keith Cowboy and you're my cow
So what ya M.C's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan
You won't even get bread and water my man
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry
It's the beautiful round up in the sky
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's at cock
I'll be carrying out bodies stiff as a rock
Carrying out a million dollars in my pockets and hand
But I carry out orders from no man
'Cause anything you wanna do I already did
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid
But in my M.C school, my class was packed
And tricks were for kids so I left your ass back
The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another
I'll buy a mansion for my mother
A 24/7, the cool-aid smile
Say hey Track 11, look at my power

Because I look good, do you hear my man?
And if you can't take that ya chump ya own hand
You one-girl-at-a-time getting M.C
So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework you would surely find
When Scorp get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talking don't pay, you're drifting away
When I see you on a stage I'm a blow you away
You're right, there is no difference between me and you
Except I look good and you look Through
Take that!

Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped in to the M.C scene
Biting your moves, taking fake awards
Saying everyone else was perpertrating a fraud
But your nothing but a clone of my flesh and bone
Now you trying to play grown on the microphone
But I'll tell ya 'bout a night, and ya know I'm right
When you listen to us rocking to the broad daylight
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive
For eternity the source is alive
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpertrator
Forever in a world of you and a girl
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl
You must spread the word of the master teacher
Or you die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat ya
The words are a gift we will never flaunt
That's why were gonna get everything we want
'Cause like a shadow in the night, I'm the sight unseen
And I'm the bona-fide vocal master supreme
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
'Cause my rhymes make vowels plus they make sense
See I'm down with Cowboy, you will rock the show
With King Lou, Tommy Gun and huh! Scorpio
Kami-Kazi, Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And going down in the books is the king of the night
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm a make you my slave
And I'm a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme then bury yourself huh!
I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only M.C that'll never die

The Sugarhill Gang,"It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so-so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""you want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, say what?

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them
Huh, smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Till one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young

So don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under, ha-ha
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under, ha-ha",The Message,1999
The Sugarhill Gang,"I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jumped the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now what you hear is not a test
I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends
Are gonna try to move your feet

See I am Wonder Mike and I like to say hello
To the black, to the white,
The red, and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the riddle that will make your body rock

Well so far you've heard my voice
But I brought two friends along
And next on the mike is my man Hank
Come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong
Well, I'm imp the dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three mcs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker mcs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mike til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was comin' home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mike and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said damn fly guy I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said I go by the name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it , do it
An I'm here and I'm there
I'm big bang Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it don't stop
Why'all a tick a tock why'all you don't stop
Go hotel, motel what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl
Gonna get some spank drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel Holiday Inn
You say if your girl starts actin' up
Then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee
So he could shock the house


I said m-a-s, t-e-are, a g with a double e
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the master gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there could ever be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat
And the damn ya start doin' the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sureshot MC's for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I dot a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singin on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin on n n on n on on n on
Like a hot buttered a
Pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop ya don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what ya got

And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin on n n on n on on n on

Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scoobie doo
And guess what America we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old

But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, its so unique

To the hip hip hop, a you don't stop
Rock it out baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie da beat
I said I can't wait til the end of the week
When I'm rappin to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on hank sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong
Well, I'm imp the dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight

So he could shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin to the beat and feelin all right
Everybody was dancin on the floor
Doin all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya somethin we're a helluva crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
For you to party ya got to have the movies
So we'll get right down and give you the groove
For you to dance you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rockin affair
But let me tell ya somethin there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over you're makin it home
And tryin to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleepin ya start to dream
And thinkin how ya danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doin a do
Rockin ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet

Now I got a man comin on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of wonder mike
Come on wonder mike do what ya like
Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin fiend that does not bet
Like dracula with out his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin up and not comin down
Is just like the beat without the sound no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat

Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin' that you're full and then
Your friend says momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh uh that's bull
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says man there's plenty of food
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky foods steamin'
Your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate
And your chickens slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says I understand about the food
Baby bubbah but we're still friends

That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""by the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane""

""And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""he's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit""
I said, ""you need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm

It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on

A firing squad, sensed the danger
When they're stung by the rapping ranger
Had a little talk with my medicine man
He said, ""Get them squaws, fast as you can""
To all you girls, that want to join my Tribe
Just move to my rhythm, and feel my vibe
Put up a fuss, in the end you'll agree
When you come inside, my tee-pee
As I said before, you could sense the danger
When you're stung by the rapping ranger
When Silver and I, take a route
All you suckers better step aside
I sting squaws, then I run away

Woogie betcha want to boogie again
And you can put me to the test at your request
I rock you out of your moccasin
Kemosabi got down, took off his mask
He kicked off his shoes and did the Monster Mash
Tommy came along, saw what was happenin'
His head began to boppin' his foot start to clappin'

The Sugarhill Gang,"Now, what you hear is not a test I'm rappin' to the beat,
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,
The purple and yellow. But first, I gotta

Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie,
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,
Let's rock, you don't stop,
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,
And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
C'mon, Hank, sing that song!

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,
And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why.
You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
And I dress so viciously.
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac.
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a colour TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball. Hear me talk about
Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
Than a sucker could ever spend,
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again. Everybody go
Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
'Cause I'm a get a fly girl,
Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go
Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend.
Master Gee! My mellow!
It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee.
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls.
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be.
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn! Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn! Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair.
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same.
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere.
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I put the dick, dick, dick in your behind. I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old.
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's so unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

Ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""

So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate

The Suicide Machines,"Some persecute their brothers
Because of the color of their skin, oh yeah
Well, that's wrong, we know it all too well
But I guess it doesn't matter to some

Get it through your head, it's a black and white world
But you're really no different from me
Get it through your head, it's a black and white world
But you're really no different from

Some walk around, never knowing
They only listen to what they've been told
They walk around blind for years
'Cause they're only seeing what they've been shown, yeah

Well, colors are deceiving
But if you open your mind to see what's right
Wipe the anger from your eyes
And take a look you'll find

Get it through your head, it's a black and white world

'Cause they're only seeing what they've been shown, yeah

Sometimes it's hard, yeah
'Cause there's so much trouble in the world today
We stereotype the masses
And everybody's saying, you've got to do it my way

But you're really no different from me
Get it through your head, it's a black and white world

The Suicide Machines,"Hatred! a deadly disease
It's pumping through the veins of every being on the planet
Or so it seems..""maybe you, not me""
I see it clearly through the red film on my eyes
That we must...... FIGHT!

Prejudice! our nation's biggest sickness
Is taking place before our very eyes
I'm just as guilty as the next
And that I'll try to change
Unfortunately, some aren't so easily persuaded
So we.... FIGHT! FIGHT HATRED!

This doesn't have to be a physical war- NO!
Reverse the ignorance to which we were born
And yes, this may become a violent fight
And we may never win but no one can ever say we didn't try

A bunch of people who don't know shit about Unity

Then please explain to me why we fight all the time 
I can't take it anymore, this is bothering me 
Got people killing each other 
Why does this have to be? 
I wish I knew, I really wish I knew 
How people can see there's no real difference between me and you

do I need a conscience or a gun you say I
need drugs I think that depends I think
revenge is the best medicine a prescription
of Prozac and Vicodin will these panic attacks
ever end a little less sadness and no more pain
another fucking night I can't sleep again

finally wears me out then I fall asleep
waking up depressed not knowing why
sometimes I feel like I want to die there's
so much paranoia that I can't think depression
keeps getting the best of me I need a fucking
will or an ounce of hope the solution doesn't lie at
the end of a rope

Hey you know that things can't stay the same
Hey don't be afraid to make the change 
Hey don't be afraid to make the change 

Everyone's telling you you've gotta stand tall
Just stick to what you know and you know you'll never fall
I guess that I can say there's some truth
in what they're saying have no fear move on and
stop delaying

[Chorus]
As much as we'd like things to always stay the same
there comes a time in everyone's life when we feel
strange doing the same old things again the same
way we've gotta break away to something new we'll
do it someday

I'm losing my mind 
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind

One more time Another broken home
One more time A cold heart of stone
One more time Are children born to die
One more time Is it any wonder why

Can you tell me why this is they're just kids
One more time A child's been abused
One more time Power's always misused
One more time A cry that goes unheard
One more time I can only think the worst
