Milt Jackson,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars [Take 2] [take 8][*],1961

Milt Jackson,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In,1961
Milt Jackson,"Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She is my baby and she lives next door
Every mornin' 'fore the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friend
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say, ""She told me so""
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her (knock, knock, knock, knock) on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four

When there is nobody else around

And tells me, ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know, I just love her so?
She's my little woman, waitin' all this time
Babe, I'm a little fool for you, little girl","Hallelujah, I Love Her So",1961
Milt Jackson,"Three little words
Oh, what I'd give for that wonderful phrase
To hear those three little words
That's all I'd live for the rest of my days

And what I feel in my heart, they tell sincerely
No other words can tell it half so clearly
Three little words, eight little letters
Which simply mean I love you",Three Little Words,1961
Milt Jackson,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1962
Milt Jackson,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1962
Milt Jackson,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes (Take 5),1962
Milt Jackson,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,1962
Milt Jackson,"They say, Ruby you're like a  dream
Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so
I only know, Ruby, it's you
 
They say, Ruby you're like a song
You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do? 
 
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came 
And though I should beware
Still I don't care you thrill me so
",Ruby,1962
Milt Jackson,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay

",On Green Dolphin Street,1962
Milt Jackson,"What's your story, morning glory
What makes you look so blue
The way that you've been acting
I don't know what to do
For I love you, sure as one and one make two
What's your story, morning glory
Got a feeling there's a lot you're concealing
So, won't you let me know your point of view

What is your story, morning glory
You've got me worried too
The postman came this morning
And left a note for you
Did you read it, then you know that I love you
What's your story, morning glory
Give your answer to this patient romancer
Oh, won't you tell me that you love me too",(What's Your Story) Morning Glory,1963
Milt Jackson,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,1964
Milt Jackson,"Please forgive this platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Never could find

Honey, I'm so keen on you
I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side
When you're gone, my sugar candy
I get so lonesome, I get blue

But when you're handy
It's fine and dandy
But when you're gone
What can I do?",Fine and Dandy,1964
Milt Jackson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1964
Milt Jackson,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",Someday My Prince Will Come,1971
Milt Jackson,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,1973
Milt Jackson,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me

Milt Jackson,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1976
Milt Jackson,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1976
Milt Jackson,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

Milt Jackson,"So close your eyes
For that's a lovely way to be
Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream
Together

You can't deny; don't try to fight the rising sea
Don't fight the moon, the stars above, and don't fight me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream
Together

When I saw you the first time, it was half past three
When your eyes met mine, it was eternity

By now we know the wave is on its way to be
Just catch that wave don't be afraid of loving me

You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

Got as far as the door

Milt Jackson,"Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
He'll build a little home
That's meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you
And so all else above
I'm dreaming of the man I love",The Man I Love,1998
Milt Jackson,"Hush now don't explain
I know you raise Cain
I'm glad you're back
Don't explain

Quiet, don't explain
You mixed with some dame
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you and what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry to hear folks chatter, and I know you cheat
But right and wrong don't matter when you're with me sleep

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours love
Don't explain",Ill Wind (You're Blowin' Me No Good),1998
Milt Jackson,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Milt Jackson,"When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you

Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing

The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2007

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

After it brought my lover near

Milt Jackson Quintet,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we

Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1969

And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so
I only know, Ruby, it's you
 
They say, Ruby you're like a song
You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do? 
 
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came 
And though I should beware
Still I don't care you thrill me so

And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

They ski down a hill that's a snowplow turn
And look there's a spill
There's a spill on the hill 
When you're down it's a thrill to go up again.

Ev'rybody ought to learn to ski for that is how we first met
We were that Jack and Jill that came down a hill,
When I looked at you my hearttook a spill
Took a spill on a hill

There were sunbeams in the snow
and a twinkle in your eye
I remember oh so clearly
that you nearly passed me by

Then It Happened In Sun Valley
when you slipped and fell and so did I
Now ev'ry year we go back
and then we recall that fall and that moment
When we were there on a hill
So we both take a spill and we're Jack and Jill again.

But I gotta dedicated a very special song
To the one who gave me everything and kept me strong
From a child you protected me and I kept you busy
Sold so many times that it missed me
Thank you for my mom, my abuela and others
My babies, my lady and the worlds best brother
My friends, my fans, I call it my family
Everything good that I got, you handed me
My only big sister, she’s on top of my list
She taught me how to write poems and now it’s my gift
Her hand was heavenly

And it still ain’t over
Tho I’m deep in the struggle
You can still see my feet while I sleep on the rubble
Your boy still breathing and I ain’t trying to be even
Cause everything happens in this life for a reason
My heart is healing and my mind is seeking
My eyes are blinking and my rhymes are reaching
Every soul that is lost there is hope on the cross
People walk away like they don’t know what it cause
And I’m not saying that I’m any better than you
You will see for yourself if you stepped in my shoes
I ain’t blind but it’s times, I’m too stupid to see
But I just wanna show what Gods doing for me

We try to resolve them with our physical minds
Sometimes you gotta give us unreasonables
To him whom makes end possibilities possible
I know that it’s easier said then done
But just try your best and the rest will come
They gave me 45 long years up in prison
But I never let the tears interfere with my vision
I keep on moving, I can see things changing
I feel my soul strengthening and it keeps me patient
Knowing that I’m loved in a world so crooked
Jesus Christ died so the rest of us wouldn’t
There is only one truth and a zillion lies
That truth is NOT just for biblical times
And tonight, before I lay my head to sleep

Milton Brown,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Milton Brown & His Brownies,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Milton Craig Nealy,"Okay folks here's a little story just for you
Now one night Farmer Brown was takin' the air
He locked up the farmyard with the greatest of care
But down in the hen-house something stirred
And when he shouted, ""Who's there?""
This is what he heard

There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
We chickens tryin' to sleep, and you butt in
And hobble hobble hobble hobble it's a sin

Now Farmer Brown lit his corn cobbed pipe
He looked down at his trusty dog
And he said, ""Hey I'd the chickens said they alright they are alright
Let's head back to the shack Jack""
But the dog wasn't convinced, he said, ""Go back to the hen house""
Gave a little doggy knock and in his best chickenese said
""Is everything alright?""

I said there ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
You're stompin' around and checkin' around
And kickin' up an awful fuss
We chickens tryin' to sleep, and you butt in
And hobble hobble hobble hobble it's a sin

""Okay, okay, okay"", said the dog and he turned to leave
Just then a very unchicken like sneeze came
From the hen house, ""Achoo""
Farmer Brown cocked his gun, he says, ""I'm a comin' in
You better open that door just a teeny weeny
Bit so I can take a peek""

No, tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do, we got eggs to lay
Ground to dig, we've got worms to scratch
You know it takes a lot of sittin' gettin' chicks to hatch
Besides there ain't nobody here but us chickens

There ain't nobody here at all
So stop that fuss and raisin' dust
Hey there ain't nobody here but us
So kindly point that gun the other way
And hobble hobble hobble off and hit the hay

Okay, I guess you're right, I'm off to sleep
Goodnight

And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

Te tira atrás, te pide más y más
Y llega un punto en que no querés

I didn't have too much to say
I was needing some inspiration
And you just got in my way
I took a shot at an easy target
You were too stunned to say anything
You were the unsuspecting martyr
You were not the most dangerous game

Bring my courage back now
Bring it back to me
I'm tired of being afraid of what I can't change
I want to be living free

Well it could be that I was mistaken
Or maybe I deceived myself
But it's hard to understand somebody
Doesn't want to understand himself
There's an ocean of unlatched windows
And a world of unlocked homes
The only reason anybody can still feel safe
Is most people still knock on the door

Would you bring it back to me
I'm tired of being afraid of what I can't change

I don't want to be a prisoner
Bound in these chains
Don't want to be a prisoner
I want to be free again

And though we all return to dust
There's a lot of us in a terrible rush

Some take the road to Damascus
Some take the road to Hell
I'll take Highway One to the evergreens
And everything will turn out well

Bring my courage back now
Would you bring it back to me
I'm tired of being afraid of what I can't change

Slave to my fear

Parte, tem os olhos tristes, deixando o companheiro na estação distante

Pra poder te entender
Mutante
Que nomes você tem?
Poço de carinho
E estouro de boiada
Corre no meu peito
Vem cor de pecado e lua
É, pássaro que chega
Quer luz e calor
Como o mar do nosso amor
Namorar no parque
Viajar no quarto
E muito que se viver
Busca da loucura
Doce criatura
É tanto pra se querer
Viagem
Que ninguém descreveu
Voa contra o tempo
Vive a noite e o dia
Muda a geografia
Faz qualquer rincão tão perto
E o pássaro que volta
Traz luz e calor
Como o mar do nosso amor",Mar Do Nosso Amor [Sea of Our Love],1985
Milton Nascimento,"Não se espante assim meu moço com a noite do meu sertão
Tem mais perigo que a poesia do que o julgo da razão
A tormenta gera história é tão vida quanto o sol
São cavalos beirando o rio, é o corpo da menina ofegante ali do lado
Ansiosa pelo tato do carinho arrebatado do calor da tua mão

Não se engane que o silêncio não existe no anoitecer
Fala mais vida que a cidade, tem mais lenda a oferecer
Não demore ela é donzela mas conhece outra mulher
Seu desejo e a madrugada só esperam teu carinho
Quando o ato terminado
Chegue perto da janela olhe fora e olhe dentro
A paisagem se molhou",Noites Do Sertao [Country Nights],1985
Milton Nascimento,"Bom dia, natureza
Pulmão da terra mãe
Portal da cor, futuro
Cada nascer do sol

Carinho, companheiro
É como se a paz
Cobrisse o mundo inteiro
Terra, água, fogo e ar

Quero o sabor, o som
Quero tocar, visão
Cheiro de vida
E um mar de gerações

Procuro a resposta
Por que criar a dor?
Se quando estamos juntos
Temos sonho, força e amor

Gema da criação
Herdeiro do pintor
Dono do amanhã
Do sim, do não

Coragem, companheiro
Pra que fechar a voz
Se a força do desejo
Pulsa em cada um de nós",Portal da Cor [Threshold of Colours],1985
Milton Nascimento,"Mais que a dor do amor 
Viver a dor me doeu
Eu quero mesmo é ser feliz
Amar, amor

Quem não semear não vai colher
Ai de quem é um e nunca será dois 
Por não saber

Quem irá me valer? 
São pessoas, é a caminhada
Quem irá me valer? 
São meus sonhos no pó da estrada
Quem irá me valer? 
É o sorriso que guardo comigo
Quem irá me valer? 
É segredo de fazer amigo",Pra Eu Parar de Me Doer [So I Can Stop Feeling Hurt],1985
Milton Nascimento,"Lá vem a força, lá vem a magia
Que me incendeia o corpo de alegria
Lá vem a santa maldita euforia
Que me alucina, me joga e me rodopia

Lá vem o canto, o berro de fera
Lá vem a voz de qualquer primavera
Lá vem a unha rasgando a garganta
A fome, a fúria, o sangue que já se levanta

De onde vem essa coisa tão minha
Que me aquece e me faz carinho?
De onde vem essa coisa tão crua
Que me acorda e me põe no meio da rua?

É um lamento, um canto mais puro
Que me ilumina a casa escura
É minha força, é nossa energia
Que vem de longe prá nos fazer companhia

É Clementina cantando bonito
As aventuras do seu povo aflito
É Seu Francisco, boné e cachimbo
Me ensinando que a luta é mesmo comigo

Todas Marias, Maria Dominga
Atraca Vilma e Tia Hercília
É Monsueto e é Grande Otelo
Atraca, atraca que o Naná vem chegando
",Raça,1985
Milton Nascimento,"Amigo é coisa pra se guardar
Debaixo de 7 chaves
Dentro do coração
Assim falava a canção
Que na América ouvi
Mas quem cantava chorou
Ao ver seu amigo partir

Mas quem ficou, no pensamento voou
Com seu canto que o outro lembrou
E quem voou, no pensamento ficou
Com a lembrança que o outro cantou

Amigo é coisa pra se guardar
No lado esquerdo do peito
Mesmo que o tempo e a distância digam não
Mesmo esquecendo a canção
O que importa é ouvir
A voz que vem do coração
Pois seja o que vier, venha o que vier
Qualquer dia, amigo eu volto a te encontrar
Qualquer dia, amigo, a gente vai se encontrar",Canção da América,1988
Milton Nascimento,"Cheguei na beira do porto
Onde as onda se espalha

Ai quando eu vim
De minha terra
Despedi da parentália
Eu entrei no Mato Grosso
Dei em terras paraguaia
Lá tinha revolução
Enfrentei fortes batáia, ai, ai

A tua saudade corta
Como aço de naváia
O coração fica aflito
Bate uma, a outra faia
Os zóio se enche d'água
Que até a vista se atrapáia, ai ai

E os zóio se enche d'água

Milton Nascimento,"Filho, oh meu menino
Será esse o desitino
Viajar em seu navio
Pelos mares, pelos rios
Andar sou filho

Oh meu pequeno
Será esse o caminho
Navegar assim sozinho
Sem alguém que nos espere
Nos cais

Toda  vida existe pra iluminar
O caminho de outras vidas
Que a gente encontrar
Homem algum será deserto ou trilha
Como não pode o rio negar o mar

Seja lá em qualquer norte ou no sul
Seja lá na Dinamarca ou aqui
Sonho, sonho solidário
Faz crescer o amor diário
Faz amigo em cada rua
Ou bar

Vai, abre as portas do navio
Beba o mar e beba o rio
Viva a vida e viva o tempo
De amar, filho vai tua vida

",Filho,1988
Milton Nascimento,"Pensam que não vale mais eu vir cantar
Rumos de povo e coisa e tal
E sonhos de moço pensam ser devagar
Morreram com quem já não é
É hoje, sempre, amanhã, sempre está

Sou homem, sou jovem, menino, sou eu
Por mais que me mate o amanhã
A fé me transborda essa manhã
O pão, mais um dia, o dom da vida
O sol da vida, eu quero acreditar
O pão, me mereça essa manhã
Que importa se estou a repetir
68, qualquer dano, o dano todo, quero acreditar

Mas de quem tá atrás de mim quero ver
Um amanhã em tudo meu
Dar liberdade quem está atrás de mim
Menino, quero acreditar
Ah, isso eu quero acreditar

Como o vento levou a folha

Minha Mamãe soberana
Minha Floresta de jóia

Brilhas também lá na praia

Some na curva do rio
Tudo é dentro e fora

tem aquela imensidão
tem sombra da Floresta
tem a luz do coração

Fez-se noite em meu viver
Forte eu sou mas não tem jeito
Hoje eu tenho que chorar
Minha casa não é minha
E nem é meu este lugar
Estou só e não resisto
Muito tenho pra falar

Solto a voz nas estradas
Já não quero parar
Meu caminho é de pedra
Como posso sonhar
Sonho feito de brisa
Vento vem terminar
Vou fechar o meu pranto
Vou querer me matar

Vou seguindo pela vida
Me esquecendo de você
Eu não quero mais a morte
Tenho muito que viver
Vou querer amar de novo
E se não der não vou sofrer
Já não sonho, hoje faço
Com meu braço o meu viver

Solto a voz nas estradas
Já não quero parar
Meu caminho é de pedra
Como posso sonhar
Sonho feito de brisa
Vento vem terminar
Vou fechar o meu pranto
Vou querer me matar

Vou seguindo pela vida

Orando sempre no meu coração
Toda vez que o adulto balança
Ele vem pra me dar a mão

Há um passado no meu presente
O sol bem quente lá no meu quintal
Toda vez que a bruxa me assombra
O menino me dá a mão

Ele fala de coisas bonitas que
Eu acredito que não deixarão de existir
Amizade, palavra, respeito
Caráter, bondade, alegria e amor

Pois não posso, não devo
Não quero viver como toda essa gente insiste em viver
Não posso aceitar sossegado
Qualquer sacanagem ser coisa normal

Bola de meia, bola de gude
O solidário não quer solidão
Toda vez que a tristeza me
Alcança o menino me dá a mão

Consagrada em teu girar
Navegante das solidões
No espaço a nos levar
Nave mãe e o nosso lar

Esqueceram tão grande amor
Ofereces os teus tesouros

Ou se é fantasia
Que a luz da candeia alumia
Pra gente contar

Um dia morena enfeitada
De rosas e rendas
Abriu seu sorriso moça
E pediu pra dançar

A noite emprestou as estrelas
Bordadas de prata
E as águas de Amaralina
Eram gotas de luar

Era um peito só
Cheio de promessa era só
Era um peito só cheio de promessa
Era um peito só cheio de promessa

Quem foi que mandou
O seu amor
Se fazer de canoeiro
O vento que rola das palmas

Arrasta o veleiro
E leva pro meio das águas de Iemanjá
E o mestre valente vagueia
Olhando pra areia sem poder chegar
Adeus, amor

Adeus, meu amor
Não me espera
Porque eu já vou me embora
Pro reino que esconde os tesouros
De minha senhora

Desfia colares de conchas
Pra vida passar
E deixa de olhar pros veleiros
Adeus meu amor eu não vou mais voltar

Foi beira mar ê, foi beira
Foi beira mar ê, foi beira

Milton Nascimento,"Bem mais que o tempo que nós
Perdemos ficou pra trás
Também o que nos juntou
Ainda me lembro que eu estava lendo

Só pra saber o que você achou
Dos versos que eu fiz e
Ainda espero resposta

Desfaz o vento o que há por dentro
Desse lugar que ninguém mais pisou
Você está vendo o que está acontecendo

Nesse caderno sei que ainda estão
Os versos seus, tão meus que peço
Nos versos meus, tão seus que esperem
Que os aceite

Em paz eu digo que eu sou
O antigo do que vai adiante
Sem mais eu fico onde estou
Prefiro continuar distante

Milton Nascimento,"I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song

Milton Nascimento,"Pai, afasta de mim esse cálice
Pai, afasta de mim esse cálice
Pai, afasta de mim esse cálice
De vinho tinto de sangue

Como beber dessa bebida amarga
Tragar a dor, engolir a labuta
Mesmo calada a boca, resta o peito
Silêncio na cidade não se escuta
De que me vale ser filho da santa
Melhor seria ser filho da outra
Outra realidade menos morta
Tanta mentira, tanta força bruta

Como é difícil acordar calado
Se na calada da noite eu me dano
Quero lançar um grito desumano
Que é uma maneira de ser escutado
Esse silêncio todo me atordoa
Atordoado eu permaneço atento
Na arquibancada pra a qualquer momento
Ver emergir o monstro da lagoa

De muito gorda a porca já não anda
De muito usada a faca já não corta
Como é difícil, pai, abrir a porta
Essa palavra presa na garganta
Esse pileque homérico no mundo
De que adianta ter boa vontade
Mesmo calado o peito, resta a cuca
Dos bêbados do centro da cidade

Talvez o mundo não seja pequeno
Nem seja a vida um fato consumado
Quero inventar o meu próprio pecado
Quero morrer do meu próprio veneno
Quero perder de vez tua cabeça
Minha cabeça perder teu juízo
Quero cheirar fumaça de óleo diesel
Me embriagar até que alguém me esqueça",Cálice,1999

Que nunca tiveram fim
Vou me encontrar
Longe do meu lugar
Eu, caçador de mim

Nada a temer senão o correr da luta
Nada a fazer senão esquecer o medo, medo
Abrir o peito a força, numa procura

Mas onde se chega assim
Vou descobrir o que me faz sentir

Em troca de pão
Que muita gente boa pôs o pé na profissão
De tocar um instrumento e de cantar
Não importando se quem pagou quis ouvir
Foi assim

Cantar era buscar o caminho
Que vai dar no sol
Tenho comigo as lembranças do que eu era
Para cantar nada era longe tudo tão bom
Até a estrada de terra na boléia de caminhão
Era assim

Com a roupa encharcada, a alma

Mas eu sempre vou só
Nessa terra desse jeito

Só do tempo eu não posso me livrar
E ele corre para ter meu dia de morrer
Mas se eu tiro do lamento um novo canto
Outra vida vai nascer
Vou achar um novo amor
Vou morrer só quando for
A jogar o meu braço no mundo
Fazer meu outubro de homem
Matar com amor essa dor
Vou
Fazer desse chão minha vida

Sabe que a paz é passageira

hold me, caress me)

Agora, entrega de vez meu rumo, e vida

all, and life)
From where I stand, the truth isn't black and white,
Alone we live and die, we love and fight,
Breath after breath, we carry this mortal coil,
Safe for tomorrow.
Do I dare, O do I dare,
Follow through the footsteps my whole body hears?,
Beating on my heart like a feather
Beating of a moment til I disappear.
Diga uma palaura alegre (Say a happy word, something happy)
Manda um recado que seja agora (Send a message that is new)
Faz o mundo ficar novo
E dancar no colodo tal de amor (Make a new world and dance in the arms
of love)
From where I stand, the truth isn't black and white,
Alone we live and die, we love and fight,

Just as we slip on through to eternity
Breath after breath we carry this mortal coil,
Safe for tomorrow

Bem alegre (Very happy)
Corre, manda logo um recado (Run, send me a message)
Me abraca, Faz um clima doce (Embrace me, make the weather pleasant)
Me arrepia! Chega de sufocol! (You give me goose bumps, no more
struggle!)
Me poe lovro! Me faz diamente
Teu amante (You drive me crazy! Make me diamonds
of your love)
Danca do somo do rento,
Me ensina (Dance to the sound of the wind,
teach me)
Basta de sufoco, Nao faz jogo (Stop the struggle, don't play games
with me)

A flame of love is burning
Always...
The song is of the planets
oh whoooooooo
The dance is to the rhythm, of the rain
Where everyone is coming from, is coming to
And birth is just a breath after breath.

Abriu seu sorriso moça
E pediu pra dançar

A noite emprestou as estrelas
Bordadas de prata
E as águas de Amaralina
Eram gotas de luar

Era um peito só
Cheio de promessa era só
Era um peito só cheio de promessa
Era um peito só cheio de promessa

Quem foi que mandou
O seu amor
Se fazer de canoeiro
O vento que rola das palmas

Arrasta o veleiro
E leva pro meio das águas de Iemanjá
E o mestre valente vagueia
Olhando pra areia sem poder chegar
Adeus, amor

Adeus, meu amor
Não me espera
Porque eu já vou me embora
Pro reino que esconde os tesouros
De minha senhora

Desfia colares de conchas
Pra vida passar
E deixa de olhar pros veleiros
Adeus meu amor eu não vou mais voltar

Foi beira mar, foi beira mar que chamou
Foi beira mar ê, foi beira
Foi beira mar ê, foi beira

",Conto De Areia,2004
Milton Nascimento,"Você viu só que amor nunca vi coisa assim
E passou nem parou mas olhou só pra mim
Se voltar vou atrás vou perdir vou falar
Vou contar que o amor foi feitinho pra dar
Olha é como o verão quente o coração
Salta de repente só pra ver a menina que vem

Ela vem sempre tem esse mar no olhar
E vai ver tem que ser nunca tem que amar
Hoje sim diz que sim já cansei de esperar
Nem parei nem dormi só pensando em me dar
Peço mas você não vem
Deixo então falo só digo ao céu mas você vem",Samba De Verão,2005

Milton Sledge,"Oh  the snowflakes fell in silence 
Over Belleau Wood that night 
For a Christmas truce had been declared 
By both sides of the fight 
As we lay there in our trenches 
The silence broke in two 
By a German soldier singing 
A song that we all knew 
Though I did not know the language 
The song was ""Silent Night"" 
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
""All is calm and all is bright"" 
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me 
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong 
But I stood up on my trench 
And I began to sing along 
Then across the frozen battlefield 
Another's voice joined in 
Until one by one each man became 
A singer of the hymn 
Then I thought that I was dreaming 
For right there in my sight 
Stood the German soldier 
'Neath the falling flakes of white 
And he raised his hand and smiled at me 
As if he seemed to say 
Here's hoping we both live 
To see us find a better way 
Then the devil's clock struck midnight 
And the skies lit up again 
And the battlefield where heaven stood 
Was blown to hell again 
But for just one fleeting moment 
The answer seemed so clear 
Heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's just beyond the fear 
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's for us to find it here",Belleau Wood,1997

We're buddies
And we've been since we first met
Me any you
Well we've sure been through
Our share of laughter and regret
Lord knows we've had our bad days
And more than once we've disagreed
But you've always been a friend to me
You can be so stubborn
There's times I think you just like to fight
And I hope and pray
I live to see a day
When you say I might be right
And there's times I'd rather kill you
Than listen to your honesty

You've always been
Time and again

Milton Sledge,"Drove to the church 
In my suit and tie 
But I just couldn't bring myself 
To go inside 
So I sat alone 
In my truck across the street 
Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes 
By that long white limousine 
I could just imagine 
What was goin' on in there 
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass 
And those flowers in her hair 
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall 
Those bells rang loud as thunder 
As they opened up the doors 
Now I don't have to wonder anymore 
Laughin' and a cryin' 
Tossin' that bouquet 
And when you got in that limo 
I drove off the other way 
And I still don't know 
Why things happened like they did 
But I parked that old pickup 
On that lonesome river bridge 
I took your ring from my pocket 
And I held it one last time 
Watched that diamond sparkle 
I drew back and I let her fly 
And in less time than it takes to tear to fall 
Oh that old ring went under 
Lord and now it's gone for sure 
No and I don't have to wonder anymore

Mimi Fariña,"In the chilly hours and minutes
Of uncertainty
I want to be
In the warm hold of your loving mind.

To feel you all around me
And to take your hand
Along the sand,
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while
Behind your smile,
And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find.

For me to love you now
Would be the sweetest thing,
'T would make me sing,
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

Diddy di dee dee diddy diddy,
Diddy diddy diddy dee dee dee.

When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fears,
To help me to leave all my blues behind.

For standin' in your heart
Is where I want to be
And long to be,
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.",Catch the Wind [#],1993
Mimi Fariña,"Come wander quietly and listen to the wind
Come here and listen to the sky
Come walking high above the rolling of the sea
And watch the swallows as they fly

There is no sorrow like the murmur of their wings
There is no choir like their song
There is no power like the freedom of their flight
While the swallows roam alone

Do you hear the calling of a hundred thousand voice
Hear the trembling in the stone
Do you hear the angry bells ringing in the night
Do you hear the swallows when they've flown?

And will the breezes blow the petals from your hand
And will some loving ease your pain
And will the silence strike confusion from your soul
And will the swallows come again?",Swallow Song,1995
Mimi Fariña,"Willie Moore was a young man, his age 21 and he courted a damsel fair
Oh, her eyes were as white as a diamond after night and a wavy jet black wore her hair
He courted her by night and day until marriage they did agree
Oh, but when he came to get her parents' consent they said it could never be

She threw herself in Willie Moore's hands as often they've done before
Oh, but little did he think as he left her that night, sweet Annie he would see no more
It was about the 10th of may, a time i remember it well
That very same night little Annie disappeared in a way no tongue can tell

Sweet Annie was loved both far and near, she had friends almost all around
And near a little brook not far from her home the body of sweet Annie were found
Her parents now are left alone, one mourns while the other'n weeps
And near a grassy mound outside the cottage door the body of sweet Annie sleeps

Willie Moore scarcely spoke to his friends they say from the moment they both did part
And his last day was spent near his true lover's grave where he died of a broken heart",Willie Moore,1995
Mimi Fariña,"No use crying, talkin to a stranger
Naming the sorrow you've seen
Too many bad times, too many sad times
Nobody knows what you mean

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use rambling, walking in the shadows
Trailing a wandering star
No one beside you, no one to hide you
And nobody knows who you are

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use roaming, lying by the roadside
Seeking a satisfied mind
Too many highways, too many byways
And nobody's walking behind

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation

Her lips are much too close to mine

Then let the fire start

My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1994

Mimmo Locasciulli,"I was hell-bent on destroying my powers of concentration
While you were living like a saint
And all the time the very one you trusted was washing off
Somebody else's paint

Now you've got yourself a brand new occupation
Every fleeting thought is a pearl
And beautiful people stampede to the doorway
Of the funniest fucker in the world

They're here to help you
Satisfy your desire
There's a bright future for all you professional liars

[Chorus]
Now you know how to be dumb
Are you ready to take your place in the modern museum of mistakes?
Don't you know how to be dumb?
Like a building thrown up overnight in one of those reverse earthquakes

They emptied out all the asylums, they emptied out all the jails
The ""new bruise"" was the name of a dance craze
By ""Jesus cross and the cruel nails""
Followed up by ""torturing little beaver""
With their contraption of barbed wire
Between the fear and the fever lies all the rejection they require
They'll be howling by midnight, they'll be drooling by dawn
Skulls shrunk down to the size of their brains
Heads shaven and shorn

[Chorus]

Trapped in the house of the perpetual sucker
Where bitterness always ends so pitifully
You always had to dress up your envy in some half-remembered
Philosophy

Now you're masquerading as pale powdered genius
Whose ever bad intention has been purged
You could've walked out any time you wanted but face it you
Didn't have the courage
I guess that makes you a full time hypocrite or some kind of
Twisted dilettante
Funny though people don't usually get so ugly 'til they think
They know what they want
Scratch your own head stupid
Count up to three
Roll over on your back
Repeat after me

Are you ready to take your place in the modern museum of mistakes?
Don't you know how to be dumb?

pero ahora solo akwid a logrado

No hay manera de que puedas parar esto 
como un corrido
 akwid a regresado con un nuevo sonido
a empesar a hacer feria como un rey un juego 
muy avansado para un guey

Vivo mi vida why diario yo reposo con un 
par de morras con viejas pero no esposos
why me puedes allar en la calle con cualquier
tipo gastando feria con mi equipo

Parese que me hice padrote mis bolsas no estimo asta cambie la moda que camino
si piensas que soy falso, ponteme de frente, 
te pongo estos punos en tus dientes.

why no me jusgues a mi mundo, mi mundo no es fijo 
le acabo de dar feria a las jefas de mis hijos 
why aqui estoy elejible pa' las mujeres primero cumplir con mis deberes.

Chorus

Como te puedo pagar, todo lo que haces por mi 
todo lo feliz que soy, todo este grande amor (2x)

A pasado mucho tiempo, mucho mucho tiempo 
doy gracias que todo he conquistado, no miento
pa' que seguir sufriendo por alguien, que feliz es solamente siendo infiel, si.

El juego de la vida nunca se me olvida why esto es puro estilo como la bebida , estranarte no es cuestion de explicar , es tristesa verte en tu final.

Chorus(2x)

pa' que maldesirte mejor debo agradeser why doy gracias por que tu me hicistes ver , tras de cada mentira que te pase, me ensenaste todo lo que pudiste hacer.

Desilucion para ti lo que logre, yo soy hombre why esto no parare, no te pasa, el vato te conduce con la raza manera de seguir en la masa

Asta aqui estoy bien no me paso en la esquina soy el mismo perro que salio de la neblina why aqui hacer ruido con la voz mas alta, a mi me sobra lo que te falta 

Has lugar para mi primer vez sin practicar a hacer tu mujer una buen fanatica why ahora que dije todo no he comparado, el movimiento de akwid a comensado.

Cop it
Object
Put it in the pot
Then rock it
Put it out
Look how I profit
Haters tryin' to knock it
But I won't stop
'Cause they know I'm about to blow

Yes, it's me
The underestimated emcee
So ill with the flow I need a M.D.
Somebody call a doctor
I make 'em all sick when I hop out the Phantom of the Opera
Opposite to what I call a failure
I am the reason y'all can't look in the mirrors
But don't worry: I see shit a lil' clearer
Go ahead and act funny, but you ain't stackin' money
And therefore we ain't here for the best
Matter of fact, homey, I can't hear y'all
I'm deaf
I spit it in sign language, mob language
Keep me around bread like a sandwich
Dammit
The plane done landed
The plan unveiled
Now, gimme some space; I'm outta this world
Some niggas say they just tryin' to get a nut
That may be true, but I'm a very big squirrel
Y'all niggas get in some shit and just bail
I'm at the precinct like, ""Fuck it, it's just bail.""
Me, I'm a very big deal with some very big work on a very big scale

[Chorus]

I heard it was: squeeze first, ask questions later
So which one of y'all is the next to ask?
Be the same one of y'all up next to blast
I suggest you raise up, like Exxon gas
You bullshittin', I'm talkin' what I could do
Mims is hotter than some cooked food
I'm a good dude, so usually I chill
But if you look close enough, you can see my steel
Yes, I'm concealed
Yes, I'm the shit
You think his paper long? You should see my deal
I'm Microsoft Mims, I rock wit' Bill Gates
First week, shipped a mill out the gate
And I ain't tryin' to brag, I just set the record straight
My shit push four; I'm just tryin' to move eight
You tryin' to catch up with me, ya too late
All you do is lose weight
I move weight
Drive through states
Push meals like every day was a Tuesday
Wow, that's real
Y'all iced grill
I'm laughin' on my way to the bank wit' a nice meal

I'm a Range Rove rapper
Plain-clothes rappers
Need to stop actin' like the thang won't clap ya
I am not a killer, nor do I defend 'em
I don't swing at dudes; I am not a pendulum
I don't write laws or rules, nigga, I bend 'em
I don't start careers when I beef, nigga, I end 'em
You don't want it with me; I can see clearly
You match up with I?
Please, barely
Dog, I'm nearly as high as it gets

I'm fucked up man
I think I need to see a psychiatrist
My mind's playin' tricks on me man

I said doctor, doctor won't you help me?
So many sick thoughts see my mind ain't healthy
Mad at the fact that I ain't wealthy
So I sell drugs ain't shit you can tell me

When he got 10 cars and I got no car
Waiting at the bus stop I can't go far
You ain't poor, you don't know what it is like
To be in my shoes man and see what I live like

Now how could you live life?
Twenty plus years old caught in a midlife crisis
Fuck who's the nicest
It?s about copping 'em new devices

Italian ices, gougin' prices
When you on top you should see how life is
So unrighteous but it feels so good
Mad at me like he ain't no good but I feel so good

I mean, I mean damn doc
Shit is going real good for me
I got a lot of fame now
But I don't think I could take it man, check it out

I said doctor, doctor I need help now
Ain't slept in years, so I see a meltdown
Either that or a permanent breakdown
'Cause my height man, ain't learning the breakdown

I'm on tone now, my voice is toned down
Moving too fast but I can't slow down
Doc said to rest, time to cancel the show now
Fans upset like I'm a no show, wow

But I ain't do it on purpose
Behind the fame man I'm a regular person
But I feel worthless, the gift and curses
If I fuck up my voice then it ain't worth it

But I gotta give them what they purchase
If I'm the disciple then what they worship
Is hip hop not just a couple of verses
But doc hold up I'm just touching the surface

I mean damn doc
I can't take this no more man
I'm cracking under pressure
It?s a little too much for me man
My mind's going crazy right now, check it out

I said doctor, doctor I'm losing my mind quick
Ain't been shot, but it feels like I'm hit
Who would have thought after all I did
And all I gained I would call it quits?

Five nine but I'm tall as shit
The sky is the limit, then watch how tall I get
Wait, this is what other niggas would call dreams
For me this is life meaning it was foreseen

So why am I complaining?
God bless me man
I'm an angel in training
Now they came in the game with a dash like Damon

Predicted the rain man, just like Rain Man
Down in the sun on the Island of Cayman
While you and your main man, still on the mainland
Even real niggas know what I'm sayin'
Ya shit change but I ain't changing for nobody

I mean God damn doc
I been coming to you for the last three years
And you ain't say shit
Seem like I talk my way out of my own problems
See now I pay you all this money

I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
I'm crazy man, I'm crazy

I hit it once right after I dissed her
Then after that tried rap to a sister
Same day, I had her ass in the bed, y'all
Same day and she giving me head, y'all
I don't lie; I'm a player for real
I learn the game, so I'm playing the field
I tell the truth; I don't fill her with lies
They feel on my hair, I feel on their thighs
It's a trade off, baby, it ain't a surprise
You call me a four, she call me a five
That's thirty to skeet, and thirty to slide
And according to me it's plenty of time, so

Always in my ear like she ain't no groupie

I'm trying to see where this bottle of Hypno go
I'm tyring to take this to the mo' and slide
You show a lil' thigh, I show a lil' mojo

Shut the club down
Leave with a couple broads
You're fucking with a star
You can see the glow
I'm pushing forty stacks for a ten minute show
Nigga, do the math
I'm a need a bath
'Cause I'm filthy rich, making money out the ass
My little cousin told me
This is my year
I won't stop till a nigga shuttin' down Times Square, yeah!
I do this for the block, no lies
So I can drop the top on the 645
See, until you're on top, niggas don't show respect

There ain't a place I ain't been
Every strip, every scene
Like my nigga B.I.G. said, ""It was all a dream.""
Now I'm sitting in the Beam, inside money green
Nigga all about the cash; you can tell how I lean
Keep your eyes on the beam like I told you in the hot song
It's all about the cake, being broke ain't an option
Haters in the hood with the heat trying to pop strong
I'm a quick grip when they see me with the rock song

Flip a few styles
Ten times out of ten you gon' like the way it sounds

I can sell a mill, sell you nothing on the track 
I represent New York 
I got it on my back 
And they say that we lost it 
So I'm a bring it back 
I love the dirty, dirty 
'Cause niggas show me love 
The ladies start to bounce 
As soon as I hit the club 
But in the Midwest 
They love to take it slow 
So when I hit the H 
I watch you get it on the floor 
And if you needed hyphy 
I take it to the bay 
Frisco to Sac town 
They do it e'ryday 
Compton to Hollywood 
As soon as I hit L.A.
I'm in that low, low
I do it the Cali way 
And when I hit the Chi 
People say that I'm fly 
They like the way I dress, they like (they like my) my attire 
Move crowds from side to side 
They ask me how I do it, and simply I reply

This is why I'm hot 
Catch me on the block 
Every other day 
Another bitch, another drop 
Sixteen bars, twenty-four pop 
Forty-four songs, nigga, gimme what you got 
I'm in there driving cars 
Push them off the lot 
I'm into shutting stores down so I can shop 
If you need a bird, I can get it chopped 
Tell me what you need; you know I get 'em by the flock 
I call my homey black; meet me on the ave 
I hit Wash heights with the money in the bag 
We into big spinners 
See my pimping never dragged 
Find me with different women that you niggas never had 
For those who say they know me know I'm focused on my cream 
Playa, you come between; you'd better focus on the beam 
I keep it so feen the way you see me lean 
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean 

[Chorus] 

This is why I'm hot 
Shorty see the drop 
Ask me what I paid, and I say, ""yeah, I paid a quap""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top 
So chicks around the way - they call me cream of the crop 
They hop in the car 
I tell them all about 
We hit the studio; they say they like the way I record 
I gave you black train, and I did you wrong 
So every time I see them, and they tell me that's their song 
They say I'm the bomb 
They love the way the charm hanging from the neck 
And compliments the arm which compliments the ear, then comes the gear 
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare 
Then niggas start to hate, rearrange their face 
Little do they know I keep them things by waist side 
I reply, ""nobody gotta die""
Similar to Lil' Wiz 'cause I got the fire

Le let me take you all some place

(Verse 1)
I remember When I was young my momma said she was goin out
You see the problem is she was always going out
Grandma mad 'cause my mama left us in the house
She was grown but granny thought she was showin out 
Know you sayin damn they ain't shit to be mad to
My momma told me well that she did what she had to
But see I ain't like that she was datin them bad dudes
So everytime she went out I gave her an attitude
Yeah I was straight throwin a tantrum
Try to mess up her plans I was hopin she canceled
But ain't nobody told her what she could and she can't do
Yeah ma I was a handful so yeah
I cried and I cried and I tried to show her my side
But she wasn't hearin her kid took the key to the crib
Out the door she wavin bye bye
She had me thinking that my tears meant nothin'
Years later found out it means something
You see all those nights mama left me alone
I had to learn how to stand on my own (2 feet)

(chorus)
Don't cry don't cry don't cry it'll be alright
You only get one chance to live yo life
Up and down homie enjoy yo ride
And don't cry don't cry don't cry it'll be alright
You only get one chance to live yo life
Up and down homie enjoy yo ride (don't cry because its okay)

(Verse 2)
So now I'm grown up rap performer
Give thanks to the mirror where I practiced so much
Thanks to my grandma after so much
Sacrifice I feel so loved
And thanks to my auntie ann 'cause I be damned
If I ever said can't when I probly can
To my brother my blood my right hand man
Won't hesitate to put my life in yo hands
And this is to my young sis, 2 'cause nothing could stop you
Roy hand and troy p I ain't forgot you
My uncle joe and serita even my pops to
If I'm on top then we on top too
Chris and be you know that I got you
Will and ill see you know that I got you
The whole 6-4 you know that I got you
Black get yo hustle on I can't knock you
See-l slim and k be 
Niggas in the hood that failed to pay me
I still got love for you niggas don't know why
So I know the meaning of when mama said don't cry

MIMS,"I wanna be a little bit more like, like laid back
See, y'all do is cool but me homie, I'm calmer
Like what surround her neck? I charmed her
Me I milked the cow, I'm a farmer

Her guards up but I removed the armor
You just seem to be the part of the problem
Introducin' me, the solution
I rocked it just like I'm from Houston

No, not the ball playa, more like the mall playa
Soon as I touch down, I shut down the store playa
Look, I'm already on playa
See, I'm like the stars in the sky early morn' playa

So just listen to the song
So we could end all back and forth like Ping Pong
She is my queen that makes me King Kong
I'm the leader of the jungle dog
Ain't nothin' left to say but, hey I'm the bong

Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC
She's all meant to me like the wrist and the bracelet
And I ain't need no one of she, she's beggin' me to chase it
Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC

Lets just say that we slid off
Gallardo spider so we can take the lid off
She just made that jump like Cris Cross
Right in the passenger side you pissed off

Ain't my fault I just handle my biz
You can't handle your wiz, so it is
What it's gonna be? I'm in the sun sittin' under palm trees
Lookin' life big

I won't hate, I'll just tell her how it is
If I show you how I live, you would think I was hidin'
And mic is my Trident, I'm Poseidon
And she is my Afro deity, stop lyin'

You not as fly as I'm
And some say I'm the flyest plane on the runway
Some day I would be the one day called king
And till that time your girlfriend can call me

Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC
She's all meant to me like the wrist and the bracelet
And I ain't need no one of she, she's beggin' me to chase it
So don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC

I didn't come here to brag
No amount of money could match with my swag
You know I got wrapped in the bag
Livin' in the past
And I'm the future do, all washed up like the Guadalupe

Your own home team won't root for you
And that's 'coz they look for me
So truthfully as truly yours

No, it?s me

I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm

Call me Superman, Superman
Hold up, wait
Look up in the sky

Call me Superman, Superman
Call me Mr. Fly, keep the S on my chest
Call me Superman, Superman

Hold up, wait
Look up in the sky
Call me Superman, Superman
No, no, no it?s me

So everytime I see 'em and dey tell me dat'z their song
Dey say I'm da bomb
Dey luv da way da charm hangin from da neck
And compliments da arm which compliments da ear den comes da gear
So when I hit da room da shortyz stop and stare

I said,
Shorty she know the game
She said she love the chase
Im trying hard to bag her, but she love the wait
Never half, she rather give in wholes
Please part'on my French, but she give me good blow
In return I give her dough
When she see me give n go
Other dealers give me out,
But for me she gives me mo'
Cause its never stepped or cut up or chopped down
But to get it is a risk,
I can't get locked down
Since the hit so good, I'm left fieding for a fix

Forgive me for my sins

Caught up by the way of drugs
But,
Some don't get it
It's so addictive
This relationship, so vindictive
First I love it, then I hate it when it's gone
Can't settle for no dirt
I need it in its purest form
To perform
I'm searching for my hustla,
And in return
Shawty I can be your customer

Look,
I can't let this addiction get the best of me (oh noo)

What's next? 12 steps

Chasing sunshine trying to put the leather away
When your wheel of fortune is just a letter away
And the chick you been with, you trying to let her away
For that Vanna White chick
Load the tall van with white chicks
Hit the hotel
Hit the light switch
While I was out trying to spend a night with
I was the one she was trying to spend her life with
I could've sworn the money wouldn't change my motto
But why want a little when you can have a lotto
Why sip the glass when you can have the bottle
We live for the now but what about tomorrow?

[Chorus]
I got sunshine on my face but I'm not happy
(i am so senseless I lost all senses I'm telling you that)
I'm not happy I got my eyes so closed so I can see you
(i got nothing)
If I don't have you

Blinded by the fame I can hardly see her face
She blinded by the love she can hardly see mistakes
But there were mistakes which we cant replace
But visualize the place maybe you can relate
For her I give my arm hoping she amputates
But still it aint enough
Its way to late but I'm like wait
She like she did she said she tired of waiting
Its already been years and theres been tears shed
I was gone til November than I show on that lear jet
Like yeah I'm rich man I really don't care
Throw a little money in the air
Blinded by the cars I was blinded by the ice
Millionaire lens I was blinded by the light
One look at her face and I was remind by the life
That I used to live that she used to light

All we do is argue
All we do is fight
I'm just tryin to get it back to which shit is too nice
But it will never be that she said
And you can never be that prepared as long as your aware
She don't know how to stop the hurt
So for now I'm just a tear
And since I was a jerk she wish I would disappear
But that's what got us here and that's whats gotta go
You reap what you sew
So I'ma let her know

Ohhhh, 
Can anybody hear me, 
Cause I've been down, that road, so long. 
I'm trying to clean up my ways
Some times I feel like I can't
When I repent all my sins
Then I just do it again

I never wanted to be a regular nigga
No funds, chased by crack hittas
So I poured my soul out, like liquor
But I guess ya'll niggas didn't get the point, like scissors
I told cats I went to church and got saved
Old heads looking, like 'NO', do not say
Called my old hoes, told them I'm gone stop pimping
They looking at me like, you mine as well stop living
Trying to rid the demons from my system
But da game won't let me, it's steady pulling me in
But I thank you, since you kept a nigga breathing, eating, sleeping
Been up another week, another weekend
Days, hours, minutes, seconds
Feeling like I could, never pay you back 4 this blessing
So when a nigga pray, I don't pray for wealth
I pray for my family, I pray for health
If anything, I just pray we get closer
To the point, you become my main focus
Focus on, every word I say, I hope you soak this

It often angers you

I do it all for you, my feelings are true from the very depth of my heart

Hey girl you know you're so damn fine.

And no you shouldn't change for me 
You should change for you, wherever change may be 
A thorn is never pretty as the flower 
But the prettiest flower seems to have the most thorns 
We as stubborn as a bull with both horns 
All you got to say is I do, and maybe we can go on 
And no this ain't no song 
If loving you is right, then there ain't no wrong 
Therefore we can't grow long 
Like a man with no arms I just can't hold on 
Knowing that you ain't mine officially 
I've got nothing but love like evidently-d

I be on that cool shit she be on that bull shit
She says that I love her but don't love her like my music
Why do you think I do this to keep you in that new shit
Keep yo hands inside of the ride when its moving

And I said I know it well
I know it well 

This feeling that I'm going through
You got me caught up and I'm so confused
And everything I thought that we had was true
But now I'm seeing a whole different side of you
You got me going up and down and round and round
I'm going up and down and round round
Going up and down and round and round
And round and round we go

Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna move

Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna move

I don't understand how I can have so many haters
Knowing I'm their father like my name is Darth Vader
I can get you hemmed up while I'm being tailored
Then I slide off to the side like a faker
Homey I'm the president, governor, and mayor
I control everything like a dictator
Get yo fans marked up
Turn em into vapor
If you got a problem get you swallowed like a chaser
Model on my arm no homey I don't have to pay her
All I have to do is tell her where I want to take her
Catch us out in Italy
Then we in Jamaica
Caught up in the ratcher
Like ya need a baker
When I roll up on you niggas like a skater
Move if you wanna when you see that red laser
No matter how you move bet that infra red will chase ya
Then I keep it moving
Homey see you later
Mims!

Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna move

I'm trying to keep it cool
If you wanna you can move
Trying to have a lil fun maybe move a couple numbers
But when you moving numbers all the haters start to wonder
Then they talk behind yo back and they breath they speaking under
Man I'm hot like the sun in the middle of the summer
Strike down in a flash nigga you can call me thunder
Chicks call me Phil Drummond cause I give em different strokes
Ba-ba-ba-ba beat it up like a drummer
They can call it one hit wonder but I guess that means I'm one of
Light a match
Play with fire
That just means you goin' get burned up
In the river where you turn up
But they can see I'm on the come up
But it's our turn now
If you want it take it from us
I don't need no goons by me
If you want it come an try me
We can do dis broad day in the middle of the lobby
Niggas say that they the shit
When they barely just the potty
When they problems turn to probably and they probably turn to sorry
Tell 'em

Has he gone poor, said he's on tour
Do he really be shuttin' down all stores
Where's the next one 'cause we want more

Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Where do we start time apart, so many years so much heart
So many tears but still I couldn't cry them
Knew I was hurt but all I do is hide them
Wish you was here to see the places I've been,
I knew you would be proud to see the cars that im driven,
The home that I live in, I know that you listen'
But if you were here, I wonder would it be different?
What would it be like if I could add a few years
To the times she wasn't here to experience so you could see life
Man that would be like, changing the ending of a book that we like
But that ain't the story that I wish you would rewrite
Gotta keep going until they give me the green light
Livin' it up but still somethin' don't seem right,
Be gone in a physical but lifted my dreams like
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)

Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye
Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Even though it's a dream to me,
It still seems to be what I perceive to be perfect scenery
What if your lost could come back at a cost
But they told you the price would be whatever your fortune is
Would you spend it in a minute, for a minute,
For a second just to ask one question about how life is in heaven
I would give it all back, to the point of no return
Just to feel one hug, or to hear one word
But it's the same what we learn what to value
But we still mall when there's no one around you
But mama I miss you, one day ill be with you
As long as I live you know you lifted my men too
Ill never forget you, you know that I love you
You know that I am the that I am because of you
Before I leave, you see, imma believe that you ain't in the flesh
You will come in my dreams
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)

Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye
Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Last night I had a dream and it felt so right
You held me in your arms and it felt so tight
And it felt so real, why would I wake up
I even day dream now, I don't wanna stay up
So you can take me to a place where I can go
And let my mind draw the picture that I control
Cause I'm dreamin', yes im dreamin'
If you catch me asleep just leave me

Every night (every night) and every day (every day)

Min. Kai Brown,"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed alone
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall it reminds me
That it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again and even if I'm there
They'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking
Through and through then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you, and even if my house falls
Down now, I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

La bocca schiuderai

Il mio nome dirai

Ecco guarda son qui
Mi chino su di te

Non cederò perchè 
È quasi dolce sai

Io restavo a guardarli cercando il coraggio per imitarli
Poi sconfitta tornavo a giocar con la mente i suoi tarli
E la sera al telefono tu mi chiedevi perché non parli

Si vestono di nuovi colori
E le giovani donne in quel mese vivono nuovi amori

Ma non una parola chiarì i miei pensieri

""Io non volevo, mi scusi, non volevo
Io non volevo, mi scusi, non volevo""
 
Mi sembra di capire che il trauma l'hai superato
A distanza di pochi mesi vedo che
Che con la scusa di prendermi e tirarmi su
Sento il calore d'una mano che
Sta lentamente scendendo lungo il seno
E mentre seguiti a scendere mi guardi
Mi guardi e stupidamente poi mi dici
""Io non volevo, mi scusi, non volevo""
 
Dolcemente tu lo fai
Anche se io non vorrei
Ma senza di te
Io mi perderei
Mi perderei
 
Quel gesto (lei si muove già)
Che fai (lei si muove già)
Voltata (e di spalle poi)
Di spalle (lei si appoggia a lui)
Vestita (col suo vestito che)
Di nudo (leggero sfiora il suo corpo)
Leggera (e si sbottona un po')
Leggera (e si sbottona un po')
 
Mi piace (lui si perde)
Baciarti (suoi seni palpitanti)
Sentirmi (e nelle)
Toccare (profonde oscurità del suo corpo)
Le mani tue sopra la mia pelle (si danno)
Mi danno (sente un brivido lei)
Un brivido (sente un dolce brivido lei)
Un brivido (un brivido lei)
Un brivido (ardon di febbre gli occhi suoi)
Un brivido (mentre in vento li accarezzerà)

La vita non mi desse altro che te 
Non avrei nulla contro

Se vuoi, sbarrando I limiti
Non senza inibizioni che sciolgo ormai

Ah, io e te, come siamo andati d'accordo
Non so più
Noi due specchi in contro riflessi, ma lontani
In un gioco di intermittenze e di vuoti strani
Sospesi in aria allo stesso piano
Come due palloni di gas con uno spillo in mezzo
E tenuti in volo da un vento costante e lento
Che ad un primo cambio di verso li scoppi così
Da un lato o dall'altro (eh, la miseria 
Ma così non si può discutere senza gridare?)
 
Io non vorrei che tu
Gettassi ancora idee
Con fiumi di parole
Per noi
 
Io non direi che sia
Difficile così com'è
Ma lo sarebbe, certo
Se fossi qui
 
Ah, io e te
Ma che tempo abbiamo lasciato non so più
Noi, due oasi in un deserto di allegrie
Con di tanto in tanto miraggi di poesie
 
Presi dal vento allo stesso modo
Con la sabbia che dalle dune ci viene incontro
Ed all'acqua limpida e chiara rapisce il posto
Noi, un gusto perso nel tempo
Un odore che poi con l'aria se ne va
 
Eh, vabbè, ma allora è un vizio",Specchi Fiflessi,1998

And the kiss from her lips set my heart aglow
And I know from Heaven, From Heaven above
Came my, my true love
 
Darling, I love you, I'll always be true; my prayers
They were answered and the Lord sent me you 
With love and devotion that I never knew
Until the Lord above sent me you
And I thank the Heaven

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2005
Mina,"A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces 
An airline ticket to romantic places 
And still my heart has wings 
These foolish things remind me of you 

A tinkling piano in the next apartment 
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant 
A fairground's painted swings 
These foolish things remind me of you 

You came, you saw, you conquered me 
When you did that to me 
I knew somehow this had to be 

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer 
A telephone that rings but who's to answer? 
Oh, how the ghost of you clings 
These foolish things remind me of you 

The smile of Turner and the scent of roses 
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes 
The song that Crosby sings 
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2005

Questa stanza non ha più pareti 
Ma alberi, alberi infiniti

Quando tu sei qui vicino a me

Che restiamo qui, abbandonati 
Come se, se non ci fosse più 
Niente, più niente al mondo

Mi sembra un organo 
Che vibra per te e per me 
Su nell'immensità del cielo 
Per te e per me, non c'è

Mina,"A tutti gli zeri del mondo 
Il mio personale pensiero 
Piccoli eroi maltrattati
Lasciati soli in un angolo oscuro 
Mentre vanno cercando una strada 
Una luce, un riparo, una guida 
Ecco che si ritrovano sempre 
Fra le grinfie dell'ultimo giuda 

Sono gli ultimi in fondo alla lista 
Sono lì e non li vede nessuno 
Sono loro gli zeri del mondo 
Stessi occhi, lo stesso profumo 

E se fossi anche tu come loro 
Facessi parte anche tu di quel coro 
Rischieresti magari una volta 
Che la sola speranza non basta 

Ecco tutti gli zeri del mondo 
Sono loro che chiudono il cerchio 
Di un destino fin troppo scontato 
Che ti stampa indelebile
Che ti stampa indelebile, un marchio 
Chi tradisce è la solita gente 
Che ti lancia un'occhiata e stranisce 
Quando in fine hai raggiunto il tuo culmine 
Alle spalle crudele colpisce

Ho giurato di amarvi un po' tutti 
Se soltanto riusciste a capire 
Ma qualcuno esce fuori dal gruppo 
E si lascia pian piano cadere 
Sono grato agli zeri del mondo 
Per la loro assoluta pazienza 
Perché vogliono, osano, credono 
Rispettando la loro coscienza",Tutti Gli Zeri del Mondo,2006

I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight

I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

Mina,"E non so perché quello che ti voglio dire
Poi lo scrivo dentro una canzone.
Non so neanche se l'ascolterai
O resterà soltanto un'altra fragile illusione.
Se le parole fossero una musica,
Potrei suonare ore ed ore, ancora ore e dirti tutto di me.

Ma quando poi ti vedo c'è qualcosa che mi blocca.
E non riesco a dire neanche 'Come stai?'
Come stai? Bene, con quei pantaloni neri.
Come stai? Bene, oggi.

Come non vorrei cadere in quei discorsi
Già sentiti mille volte e rovinare tutto.
Come vorrei poter parlare senza preoccuparmi,
Senza quella sensazione che non mi fa dire
Che mi piaci per davvero, anche se non te l'ho detto.

Perché è squallido provarci
Solo per portarti a letto.
E non me ne frega niente
Se dovrò aspettare ancora,
Per parlarti finalmente,
Dirti solo una parola.

Ma dolce più che posso,
Come il mare, come il sesso,
Finalmente mi presento.

E così, anche questa notte è già finita
E non so ancora dentro come sei.
Non so neanche se ti rivedrò
O resterà soltanto un'altra inutile occasione.
E domani poi ti rivedo ancora.
E mi piaci per davvero neanche se non te l'ho detto.

Perché è squallido provarci
Solo per portarti a letto.
E non me ne frega niente
Se non è successo ancora.
Aspetterò quand'è il momento.
Non sarà una volta sola.
Ma spero più che posso
Che non sia soltanto sesso
Questa volta lo pretendo,
Preferisco stare qui da solo,
Che con una finta compagnia.

E se davvero prenderò il volo,
Aspetterò l'amore e amore sia,
E non so se sarai tu davvero,
O forse sei solo un'illusione.
Però stasera mi rilasso, penso a te
E scrivo una canzone.
Dolce più che posso,
Come il mare, come il sesso.
Questa volta lo pretendo,
Perché oggi sono io,
Oggi sono io.",Oggi Sono Io,2006

Io sto seduta qui, che non ho fretta

Direbbe lei cretina ma lui che gran coglione

Oh, quante bugie mi hai detto, dove ti ho trovato
In quale maledetto giorno t'ho incontrato
Lo sai che se ti guardo adesso non mi piaci 
Ridammi le mie chiavi, dimentica i miei baci 
Non voglio più nemmeno toccare le coperte 
Dove ti sei sdraiato, dove ti senti forte

Minako Honda,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found;
Was blind, but now I see.

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fear relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
We have already come.
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far,
And grace will lead us home.

Bright shining as the sun.

Than when we've first begun.",Amazing Grace,2008

Mind Games,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes

I look inside myself
And see my heart is black
I see my red door
And it's painted into black

No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing
Happening to you

I see people turn their heads
And quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens anyway

And I want it into black

Into the setting sun

Mind in a Box,"And I will never see the truth,
This is not a matter of my youth.
I do not need anybody else,
Bonds would put my mind into cells.

And I will never know I was wrong,
Never listen to those truly strong.
I do not fear anything that's not me,
Ignorance is the ultimate key.

But I wouldn't want to live like this forever.
But change myself? never, never!
The very thought sends shivers down my spine.
I'm sure everything, everything will be fine.

I am the one who cries out at night,
For somebody to change my very core.
Not sure why I live in endless fright,
Doomed to love only myself forevermore.

I am the one who has no real friends,
Shallow people flocking to my banner.
Always trying to make easy amends,
Cherishing my own overbearing manner.

Life - always fragile.
I will never change.
Love - always fleeting.
I will never change.

Life - always fragile.
I will never change.
Love - always fleeting.
I will never change.

But I wouldn't want to live like this forever.
Maybe I really was too clever.
But I wouldn't want to end like that.
I would die lonely and incredibly sad.

I will never drag myself out of this,
The shadows of my past bogging me down.
Feeling lost in turmoil and crisis,
My face forever set in an endless frown.

I have been hurt beyond mental repair,
Thence destined to suffer eternal damnation.
No one can be there for me to care,
But without I will never find salvation.

Lust - always empty.
But I will never change.
Death - always tempting.
But I will never change.

Lust - always empty.
But I will never change.
Death - always tempting.
But I will never change.

Everything is about control.
I must never slip, nor ever fall.
Anything is possible for me.
I must never doubt, and finally be free.

And finally be free.",Change,2004

I'm walking.

I don't know for how long,
Maybe I was really wrong.

I'm walking.

I'm sad, so terribly sad.
I'm grieving about the things I had.
I'm sad, so terribly sad.
I simply can't see the road ahead.

Don't care where it will end,
My pain a powerful torrent.

Mind in a Box,"I can see myself tucked in and fast asleep
Looking all peaceful but in my dreams I weep
From far up I'm looking down upon myself
And I wonder who it is that's lying there

I feel like in a world all beside myself
Afraid I won't wake up with no one there to care

I know someone used to watch me in my sleep
But some things seem just impossible to keep
I fight hard to bring it back into my mind
But to no use, it all seems to be a blank

I wonder what it was that had me defined
But one thing I know, I have myself to thank

I feel like I have amnesia
But I know it's myself I've lost
I wonder what's happened so far
And what might have been the cost

I'm not sure I want to know
Any of the things I've done
I don't know yet where to go
But I'll accept my past is gone

I feel like I have amnesia
And I've missed the heavenly host
I'm surprised I've come this far
Living without what I need most

I don't think I can go back
To the things that were before
Though I'm now always wearing black
I don't bemoan my life of yore

I wake up and feel like I should be at home
But I do not know this, it's not where I belong
My head is dazed and my mind is all confused
And I'm not quite sure that I'm really there

But the mirror shows me looking out, bemused
Into a blank place that could be anywhere

I feel like I have been left out in the cold
And it hurts to know that this is all my fault
I leave this place to find familiar ground
But the whole world seems to have been rearranged

Now my former self is nowhere to be found
And I know that it's myself that's changed

I feel like I have amnesia
But I know it's myself I've lost
I wonder what's happened so far
And what might have been the cost

I'm not sure I want to know
Any of the things I've done
I don't know yet where to go

Mind in a Box,"I have never seen this coming
I have never climbed so high
I have never thought this could
Be the crossroads of my life

I have never seen the choices
I have never soared the sky
I have always thought
I am living just to stay alive

I let myself fall at night
To be carried by the sound
I let it all just happen
Without restraint or bound

I was afloat in the night
And it was the only route
I could not hear my thinking
The din was drowning it all out

I went further and further
The music swallowed me whole
I had to push more and more
To know how deep I could fall

I felt my grip slip away
And my time was running out
There would be but one instant
For me to vanquish my doubt

How long since I slept?
How long since I ate?
How long since I felt?
How long since I cared?

I have never heard the voices
They have never made me cry
I have never thought this would
Be the crossroads of my life

I have never seen the choices
I have never soared the sky
I have always thought I am
Living just to stay alive

I have never seen this coming
I have never climbed so high
I have never thought this could
Be the crossroads of my life

How long since I slept?
How long since I ate?
How long since I felt?
How long since I cared?

I have never heard the voices
They have never made me cry
I have never thought this would
Be the crossroads of my life

I have never seen the choices
I have never soared the sky
I have always thought I am
Living just to stay alive

I have never seen this coming
I have never climbed so high
I have never thought this could
Be the crossroads of my life

I have never seen this coming
I have never climbed so high
I have never thought this could
Be the crossroads of my life

Mind in a Box,"You float in a million lights
But the one you seek is not there
You fight in a million fights
But it's yourself you cannot bear

You think you are a leader
But you turn everyone away
You think you are a preacher
But you can't turn night into day

Well there is something inside of me
And I know that it's growing
Well the thing that will forever be
And I feel its shadow calling

It is the fear that drives you mad
It is the fear that makes you blind
It is the fear that keeps you sad
It is the fear that kills your mind

You think you can make things grow
But in truth you are like a desert
You think it's not your ego
And that others make you hurt

You have learned how to deceive
And yourself is all you can hear
You think you really believe
But deep down you are only fear

There is something inside of me
That makes me run against the wall
The thing my eyes don't want to see
That will obliterate my soul

It is the fear that eats you up
It is the fear that makes you cry
It is the fear that takes you down
It is the fear that will not die

It is the fear that eats you up
It is the fear that makes you cry
It is the fear that takes you down
It is the fear that will not die

Everyone's afraid but that's no excuse
Everyone's afraid but that's no excuse
Everyone's afraid but that's no excuse
Everyone's afraid but that's no excuse
Everyone's afraid
