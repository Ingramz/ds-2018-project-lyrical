Geoff Keezer,"The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, ""Now, listen, Jack
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top""
The buzzard told the monkey, ""You're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free""
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
""Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie""
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top",Straighten up and Fly Right,1995
Geoff Keezer,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1998
Geoff Keezer,"Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which 
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a 
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears 
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva.
Jai Guru Deva.
Jai Guru Deva.
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world",Across the Universe,2000
Geoff Keezer,"It's a God-awful small affair 
To the girl with the mousy hair 
But her mummy is yelling ""No"" 
And her daddy has told her to go 

But her friend is nowhere to be seen 
Now she walks through her sunken dream 
To the seat with the clearest view 
And she's hooked to the silver screen 

But the film is a saddening bore 
For she's lived it ten times or more 
She could spit in the eyes of fools 
As they ask her to focus on 

Sailors fighting in the dance hall 
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go 
It's the freakiest show 
Take a look at the Lawman 
Beating up the wrong guy 
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know 
He's in the best selling show 
Is there life on Mars? 

It's on America's tortured brow 
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow 
Now the workers have struck for fame 
'Cause Lennon's on sale again 
See the mice in their million hordes 
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads 
Rule Britannia is out of bounds 
To my mother, my dog, and clowns 
But the film is a saddening bore 
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more 
It's about to be writ again 
As I ask you to focus on 

Sailors fighting in the dance hall 
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go 
It's the freakiest show 
Take a look at the Lawman 
Beating up the wrong guy 
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know 
He's in the best selling show 
Is there life on Mars?",Life on Mars?,2000
Geoff Keezer,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise",Blackbird,2002
Geoff Keezer Trio,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

It's phony it's plain to see
How happy I would be
If you believed in me",It's Only a Paper Moon,1992
Geoff Kidwell,"Something always brings me back to you.
It never takes too long.
No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone.

You hold me without touch.
You keep me without chains.
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

[Chorus]
Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
But you're on to me and all over me.

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
When I thought that I was strong.
But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.

[Chorus]

I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that you're everything I think I need here on the ground.
But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go.
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down.",Gravity,2009
