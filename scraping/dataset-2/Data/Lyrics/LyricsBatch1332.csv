Bobby Caldwell,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known
You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
I found my love at last",At Last,1995
Bobby Caldwell,"Though you don't call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I want to tell you baby
The changes I've been going through
Missing you
Listen you
'Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free
I'm gonna swallow my pride
I'm gonna beg you to (please baby please) see me
I'm gonna walk by meself
Just to prove that my love is true
Oh, for you baby
'Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Living for you my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
In my plea, I've got to make you see
That our love is dying
Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must explain
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp on your step
Until I get through to you
I've got to change your view baby
'Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do",Until You Come Back to Me,1995
Bobby Caldwell,"Everyday, there's something new honey, to keep me loving you
And with every passing minute, so much joy wrapped up in it
Oh! heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love
And now, I've got a song to sing, 
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
And you gave me reason for living 
And oh, you taught me the meaning of giving
 
Oh, oh! heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love
To find a love like yours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me what happiness is in so many ways
I look in the mirror and I'm glad 
To see laughter in the eyes where tears used 
To be
 
What you've given me I could never return
'Cause there's so much girl I've yet to learn
And I want to show my appreciation, cause when I found you
I found a new inspiration
 
Oh, oh! heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love",Your Precious Love,1995
Bobby Caldwell,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way,1996
Bobby Caldwell,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1996
Bobby Caldwell,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
",Street of Dreams,1996
Bobby Caldwell,"I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

What you won't do, to do for love
You tried everything but you don't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love what I would not do

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
But I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

But then I only want the best, it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you

What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything but you won't give up
In my world, only you make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do",What You Won't Do for Love,1996
Bobby Caldwell,"If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby, my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy

If you are serious
Don't play with my heart
It makes me furious

But if you want me to love you
Then, baby, I will, honey, I will
You know that I will tell it like it is

Don't be ashamed let your
Conscience be your guide
But I know deep, down inside of me
I believe that you love me
Forget your foolish pride

Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby, go on and live, tell it like it is

Tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Honey, my time is too expensive

So, won't you tell it like it is?
Tell it to my heart
Don't you hold back, baby
Nice time to start

You've got to shoot it
From the hip, dear
You've got to tell it to me straight

",Tell It Like It Is,1997
Bobby Caldwell,"I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me

Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
Honey, what would life be?

Don't ever leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me

Each time we make love
I find complete love

Bobby Caldwell,"How long
How long have you been away
Oh, how long
I can't find the words to say

I've kept your picture on my shelf
Only there to remind myself
I have always cared for you
Do you still love me

Oh, my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me

Oh my love
Will I ever make you see
Oh, that somehow
You are still a part of me

Maybe we can compromise
' Cause our love just can't be disguised
I have always cared for you
Do you still love me",My Flame,1998
Bobby Caldwell,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?

Let me hold you
In my arms
Darling tonight

Let me love you honey
Keep you warm 
Holding you tight
Come to me
Come to me

Bobby Caldwell,"I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life - I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see - I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let her go
",I've Got the World on a String,1999
Bobby Caldwell,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,1999
Bobby Caldwell,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1999
Bobby Caldwell,"I wonder as I wander, out under the sky
How Jesus the savior, did come for die
For poor ornery people like you and like I
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky

When Mary birthed Jesus, t'was in a cow´stall
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
And high from Gods heaven a starlight did fall
And the promise of ages, it then did recall

If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing
A star in the sky or a bird on the wing
Or all of Gods angels in heaven to sing
He surely could've had it, 'cause he was the king

I wonder as I wander, out under the sky
I wonder as I wander

I wonder as I wander, out under the sky

Bobby Caldwell,"Enchanted by the summer sky
And the moonlight
Does a mating dance of love
There in your eyes
The ocean sings it's summer song
In that moment
The touching feels so right
It can't be wrong, my darlin'
To enjoy some tropic bliss
Here in my arms, my darlin'
There's a wind-swept island kiss
To get it on, my darlin'
'Cause tonight was made for two
Becoming one

It's the same with me and you (feeling the same)
Sharing love is all we can do
'Cause we feel (we can feel) the passion

Pull the fire in our hearts
We can't subdue

Seize the moment
'Cause there's nowhere else on Earth
I'd rather be, my darlin'

And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Bobby Cladwell,"If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby, my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy

If you are serious
Don't play with my heart
It makes me furious

But if you want me to love you
Then, baby, I will, honey, I will
You know that I will tell it like it is

Don't be ashamed let your
Conscience be your guide
But I know deep, down inside of me
I believe that you love me
Forget your foolish pride

Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby, go on and live, tell it like it is

Tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Honey, my time is too expensive

So, won't you tell it like it is?
Tell it to my heart
Don't you hold back, baby
Nice time to start

You've got to shoot it
From the hip, dear
You've got to tell it to me straight

Bobby Clancy,"As I roved out on a May morning
On a May morning right early
I met my love upon the way
Oh, Lord but she was early

[Chorus]
And she sang lilt-a-doodle, lilt-a-doodle, lilt-a-doodle-dee,-
And she hi-di-lan-di-dee, and she hi-di-lan-di-dee and she lan- day

Her boots were black and her stockings white
And her buckles shone like silver
She had a dark and a rolling eye
And her ear-rings tipped her shoulder

[Chorus]

""What age are you my bonny wee lass
What age are you my honey?""
Right modestly she answered me
""I'll be seventeen on Sunday""

[Chorus]

""Where do you live my bonny wee lass
Where do you live my honey?""
""In a wee house up on the top of the hill
And I live there with my mammy""

[Chorus]

""If I went to the house on the top of the hill
When the moon was shining clearly
Would you arise and let me in
And your mammy not to hear you?""

[Chorus]

I went to the house on the top of the hill
When the moon was shining clearly
She arose to let me in
But her mammy chanced to hear her

[Chorus]

She caught her by the hair of the head
And down to the room she brought her
And with the butt of a hazel twig
She was the well-beat daughter

[Chorus]

""Will you marry me now my soldier lad
Will you marry me now or never?
Will you marry me now my soldier lad
For you see I'm done forever""

[Chorus]

""I can't marry you my bonny wee lass
I can't marry you my honey
For I have got a wife at home
And how could I disown her?""

[Chorus]

A pint at night is my delight
And a gallon in the morning
The old women are my heart break
But the young ones is my darling

[Chorus]",As I Roved Out,1998
Bobby Clancy,"[Chorus]
I'll tell me Ma when I go home, 
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair, they stole my comb 
But that's all right till I get home
 
She is handsome, she is pretty, she is the belle of Belfast City
She is a-courtin' one, two, three, please won't you tell me who is she?
Albert Mooney says he loves her, all the boys are fightin' for her
They knock on the door, they ring on the bell, say ""Oh my true love are you well?""
Out she comes as white as snow, rings on her fingers, bells on her toes
Oul Johnny Murray says she'll die if she doesn't get the fellow with the rovin' eye

[Chorus]

Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high and the snow come tumblin' from the sky
She's as nice as apple pie and she'll get her own lad bye and bye
When she gets a lad of her own she won't tell her Ma when she gets home
Let them all come as they will, it's Albert Mooney she loves still

Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on a brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman
A dude's virgin
Verses lettin' a perilous nigga
With no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a bitch
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed
But don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga
Not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford
And yup it's probably easy when a nigga is on board

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now

Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art

There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control
Bobby Creek

I'm on the Patron
In the end I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear
I'm gone
So she hear me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone
Cause the D-J playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
I can up and cock the hammer
For any nigga wherevera
But I came here to get on goose and Tropicana
Get loose put some more of my juice
In your caboose
Sippin' everything from white grain
To deuce juice
With nothin' to gain
But my grace and loose tooths
Eminem came Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place
The name is Snoop too
???
My drinks is ten around
I can make her spin around
If she keep her dinner down
Simmer down
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your ?
Come tickle my gumdrops

I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Get yo ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie
We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl
That will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up

Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

Obie Trice!

One slug
Couldn't snuff young cause
Goodness gracious
Haters stay on these nuts
Just like a hood rat chick who was curious
Serious
Full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the cool blue back
With a new rag
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch
True that I had a few
Obie rollin' with brews
Annually knockin' the boots
It's on manual
The way I knock 'em outta they shoes
Talk a little shit
Then they anus'll ooze
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang
Who
It's Shady
You know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you
In the mansion
With a magnum
With a night pass to the matinee
Obie
Came to party
You better ask somebody

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me

Got you boiled like whoa
One night with me
She wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like no
Let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through
And tap that hole
Make it lose control
All the girls know
That I hit it right at night
I'm a pro
I only come round to get sexual
And she flexible
And I'm sexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that murk that work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine

Bobby Creek - you know what I'm saying
The ice in the watch
Reflects the light to her
The money quite green
And the ice like blue
The swag might kill her
So I say goodnight to her
She don't want me to leave
I can see right through her
So we dip out
Burn one trip back
Get low like Caribbean
Limbo then go
Out like light
Baby girl get right
Head so slow my hat don't fit right
We cruise in the car
Or we could take flight
The middle of the night
Make your body ache like
Mike Vick against the Eagles
Call myself a king
Cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care
Listen baby it's a fact
That
If you drop back
I'm a quarterback sack that
We can go deep
And I can shark attack that

And your hat at?

Bobby Creekwater, today's host
Today's narrator, yeah
(We do this shit every year around this time)
Today's what-the-fuck-ever you wanna call it
But I need y'all to sit back, and listen
Listen man (fuck what you write man, just go get 'em)

An executive mindframe, fuck tryin' to rap
Niggaz represent a corner, I refined the map
Artesian water, this is flow untapped
And rep for 'em like Mike on playoff night; that's if the payoff right
The dream team, Bobby Creek, Em, 50 and them
We run the city like Diddy and them
The opposition we just pityin' them, it's no chance
Put you niggaz in the Special Olympics is no dance
I'm nice like a meal twice, nigga no grams
Get them bitches out they pants, I did it with no hands!
See, one thing's for sure I'm pure uncut
Baby you can either stay down or get gunned up
Mr. Night Life, I can give you niggaz sun up
I just get an order, let my niggaz pick the gun up
That's when I bone ya, nigga wake yo' punk ass up
This is ammonia, fuck your face up
Bitches won't even telephone ya
I can space age pimpin', a pocket full of stone ya
Ya dig? Take the world over that's the gig
Sell enough units have Paul and Jimmy dancin' the jig
Roll the Maserati through the city, me and Riggs
Bumpin' Obie Trice, shoot a bird at the pigs
Ever since a nigga got rich
Life is still a bitch but she a high class bitch
I just wanna fuck with me a high class bitch
Nigga pitch that on some eyeglass shit
See I classic, enough to get the mics back right
And I'm a fan of record sales, I don't like that hype
I'm here to end it

[Chorus]
Oh Lord that nigga mean, ain't he?
Yea, goddamn that nigga clean, ain't he?
Yea, see he a greedy baby
But some people tend to call him the return of Shady
There he is - goddamn that nigga clean, ain't he?
Yea, oh Lord that nigga mean, ain't he?
Yea, see he a greedy baby
But some people tend to call him the return of Shady
Bobby Creek, Bobby Creek...

Yea, yeah
Nice like Mike right, you niggaz soft as night lights
Diamond's a tall order I'm just tryin to get the hype right
I'm throwed off, so hard, so soft, sold out
Bought the Coupe a color of nice weather and rolled out
I can't hold out, hot like a fish fried
Who the fuck is this guy? The ruler on the disc I
Hit you in your suit coolers, I'm in the Coupe cooler
Than pigskin men base runners and hoop shooters
A loose screw ban money like the legendary Roots crew
This is just the shit that I am used to
Oh nah, I don't bust a chopper but I used to
Now I put the word out - I'm sure you niggaz heard 'bout
Young boss sold money, old school new paint
Ball knowin' you can't, give a fuck what you think
Member of the mighty Shady Records, nigga you ain't
Think you fuckin' with me then double whatever you drink
You can't fathom what the bitch throwin' at him
Couple niggaz hatin' on him but the fans waitin' on him
Like a, PlayStation 3, money for your advance
My vacation fee, ain't no use in hatin' me nigga
And don't shit-talk pimp, I'd rather flush
Anyone with big enough nuts to come and fuck with us
I bust but keep in mind, pressure bust pipes
And you niggaz wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
What the fuck? (yeah)

[Chorus]",There He Is,2006
Bobby Creekwater,"Shady, we're back!

Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that ""Renegade"" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radi—
O, and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big—ba—big—big bay—ba—baby

So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin' the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

Shady (Stat Quo!) we're back!

This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed
My kids would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him ""suck my dick""
Take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin', where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the ""Detox"" LP
Feet don't fail me
Niggas got me bent like cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?
A towns own, Aftermath, Shady!

Shady!(Bobby Creek!) we're back!

Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't write yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'til I show I
Go out on a limb with Em 'cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin' through the track nigga

Shady! (Ca$his!)

I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the Shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in the Midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Prozac, D's and E-Pills, it's a wrap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back nigga

Bobby Creekwater,"Niggas didn't kill me
Now a niggas gon' get
Peel my cap back
I'm never at home
I'm somewhere
With my shaft restin' on a ho's tongue
Sippin' Don Perignon
While she's sippin' up them newborns
Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on a brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman
A dude's virgin
Verses lettin' a perilous nigga
With no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a bitch
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed
But don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga
Not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford
And yup it's probably easy when a nigga is on board

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now

Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part

And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus

You've just got to see me through another day

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again

de las luces que a lo lejos
van marcando mi retorno.

Son las mismas que alumbraron
con sus palidos reflejos
hondas horas de dolor.

Y aunque no quise el regreso
siempre se vuelve
al primer amor.

La vieja calle
donde me cobijo
tuya es su vida
tuyo es su querer.

Bajo el burlon
mirar de las estrellas
que con indiferencia
hoy me ven volver.

platearon mi sien.

errante en las sombras
te busca y te nombra.

a un dulce recuerdo
que lloro otra vez.

Tengo miedo del encuentro
con el pasado que vuelve
a enfrentarse con mi vida.

Tengo miedo de las noches
que pobladas de recuerdos
encadenen mi sonar.

Pero el viajero que huye
tarde o temprano
detiene su andar.

Y aunque el olvido
que todo destruye
haya matado mi vieja ilusion,

guardo escondida
una esperanza humilde
que es toda la fortuna
de mi corazon.

So alone, so without you
How I wish, my heart with me

My memories alone
Why must I re-dream, re-live

I pray that someday

Our love will see the light' til then
In thick dark silence I beg my heart to replace
All through and oh so long and sleepless night

Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin

They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey with his chocolate bar
Ford and his Lizzie kept the laughers busy
That's how folk are

They laughed at me wantin’ you
Said it would be, ""Hello, goodbye""
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

Yeah, they all said we'd never get together
Baby, let's take a bow
For, ho, ho, ho
Who's got the last laugh?

Ha, ha, ha
Who belongs to that laugh?
He, he, he
Who’s got the last laugh?

Ho, ho, ho
Ha, ha, ha
Hee, hee, hee
Ho, ho, ho

",They All Laughed,1964
Bobby Darin,"The world is full of beautiful things
Butterfly wings, fairy tale kings
And each new day undoubtedly brings
Still more beautiful things

The world abounds with many delights
Magical sights, fanciful flights
And those who dream on beautiful nights
Dream of beautiful things

Beautiful days for sunshine lazin'
Beautiful skies and shores
Beautiful days when I can gaze
In beautiful eyes like yours

You wonder why the nightingale sings
Lovers have wings, people wear rings
The world is full of beautiful things
Beautiful people, too
Beautiful people like you

Beautiful days of sun kissed showers
Beautiful sea kissed breeze
Beautiful nights of moon kissed hours
Beautiful dreams like these

Our lives tick by like pendulum swings
Delicate things, butterfly wings

Bobby Darin,"If I could talk to the animals, just imagine it
Chattin' with a chimp in chimpanzee
Imagine talking to a tiger, chatting with a cheetah
What a neat achievement it would be

If we could talk to the animals, learn all their languages
I could take an animal degree
I'd study elephant and eagle, buffalo and beagle
Alligator, guinea pig, and flea

I would converse in polar bear and python
And I would curse in fluent kangaroo
If people ask me, ""Can you speak rhinoceros?""
I'd say, ""Of course, can't you?""

If I conferred with our furry friends, man to animal
Think of the amazing repartee
If I could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals
And they could talk to me

If I consulted with quadrupeds
Think what fun we'd have asking over crocodiles for tea
Or maybe lunch with two or three lions, walruses and sea lions
What a lovely place the world would be

If I spoke slang to orangutans
The advantages why any fool on earth could plainly see
Discussing Eastern art and dramas with intellectual llamas
That's a big step forward you'll agree

I'd learn to speak in antelope and turtle
And my Pekingese would be extremely good
If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus
I'd say, ""Why not a [unverified] and I would""

If I could parlay with pachyderms
It's a fairy tale worthy of Hans Anderson and Grimm
A man who walks with the animals and talks with the animals
Grunts and squeaks and squawks with the animals
And they could talk to him

Let me hear 'em talk

I'd study every creature's language
So I could speak to all of them on site
If friends said, ""Can he talk in crab or maybe pelican?""
You'd say, ""I canny can't and you'd be right""

And if you just stop and think of it ain't no doubt of it
I'm gonna win a place in history
If I could walk with the animals talk with the animals
Grunt, squeak, squawk with the animals
And they could squeak and squawk and speak and talk to me",Talk to the Animals,1967
Bobby Darin,"I was sittin' by the bank on a hollow stump
When I thought I heard me a bullfrog jump
Turned around and sure enough there
He sat
He said excuse me, buddy, but I've been
Readin' your news
And I'm sorry to say that I'm a
Little confused
You bein' human, well you'd know where
It's at.

He said I read where this old world's
Gonna fold
And all on account of a think called gold
And that's somethin' hard for us frogs
To understand
Now you're lookin' at me like I'm
Kinda funny
But where I live we don't have no money
So we want to be hip to the happ'nin's
Here on land.

Now I thought I was stoned so I
Started walkin'
I mean whoever heard of a bullfrog talkin'
But then I realized I hadn't been grazin'
In no grain
So I figured I'd tell him just what I thought
'bout how gold was sold and how gold
Was bought
And he'd understand our world when
I explained.

I said it all started a long time ago
When the people first learned to reap
And sow
They got all the things they needed right
Out of the earth
Like how many leaves and how many trees
Would it take to cover up the anatomies
And that's how you figured how much a suit
Of clothes was worth.

Well then man he learned how to milk a cow
And how to till the soil with a stone
Blade plow
And he kept so busy he never had time to
Do you harm
Then he'd take his produce and all that milk
And go into town and trade them for silk
So his woman she'd look sharp down at
The farm.

Well the bullfrog let out a belly croak
Like I'd told him some kind of a joke
And he said I think you're jivin' me my man
(what me?)
I said I know it sounds kinda mystifyin'
But the truth of the matter is I ain't lyin'
I mean I ain't talkin' no bullfrog,
You understand?

He said now don't get upset I'm not
Agin' you
You just go ahead, go ahead and continue
And I'll be quiet and try to understand
He said I know about trees and leaves
And plants
And milk and silk and the farmer's
Romance
But what's this thing the call supply
And demand?

I said well I grow cotton and you grow corn
And you find your dungarees are all worn
And me well I got to have somethin' to eat
You see? So I make you some brand
New threads
And now you bake me some fresh
Corn bread
Pretty soon we'll have shops across
The street.

Well this didn't work, or so we've been told
And at that time they didn't know
About gold
So they all agreed they'd measure their
Goods in salt
Well that idea had an early endin'
'cause they were eatin' more than they
Were spendin'
And besides, whoever heard of keepin'
Salt in a vault.

Well folks said gold was the thing to use
To pay for stuff like from ships to shoes
But it weighed too much and it looked too
Good to spend
So round about sixteen hundred and ninety
Somebody started usin' foldin' money
And that's the tale, my friend, from end
To end.

Well I thought it was a damn
Good explanation
I mean a real attempt at communication
And I only had me schoolin' up until the
Time I was ten
But the bullfrog right before he
Hopped away
Well I could have sworn I heard him say
Your world is still in the tadpole stage,
My friend.




",Bullfrog,1968
Bobby Darin,"I cannot make it, girl, through the day
Ah babe, but I can see the wind
I cannot seem to make my way
Ah babe, but I can see the wind.

Float in smoke, let it father me
Ah babe, but I can see the wind
What man is doin' doesn't bother me
Ah babe, 'cause I can see the wind.

I do not seem to hear myself
Ah babe, but I can see the wind

",I Can See the Wind,1968
Bobby Darin,"There was a white mouse consultation
Down at the county fair
All the church mice, field mice and not
So nice mice
Everybody gathered there
You see the muckidy muck he was
Speakin', tellin' them where it was at
He said hear, hear there ain't nothin' to fear
Except a three eyed Siamese cat
And the crowd was stunned
See, no single mouse had ever seen one
He said don't be scared
We're prepared.

Then he held up a great big picture
So every mouse could see
What a three eyed Siamese cat looked like
The face of the enemy
And the crowd let out such a shudder
As they lined up file and rank
Starin' at a twenty foot picture frame
Surroundin' a twenty foot blank
Just empty space
But every single mouse
Swore he saw a face
He said don't be scared
We're prepared

Then the muckidy much started screamin'
Yellin' till his voice gave out
He said now that you've seen what the
Cat looks like
Gonna tell you what he's all about
He said he don't eat cheese on Friday
And he goes around lickin' his paws
He's awful mean and he loves to keep clean
And believes in changin' laws
And the crowd went wild
And every mouse began to fear for his child
Don't scared
We're prepared.

Now two times two is forty-five
The muckidy muck explained
And the flat side of the moon is green
And the farmer don't need no rain
And the night is light and might is right
And Supermouse is on our side
And the three eyed Siamese cat's a plague
From which nobody can hide
And the mice all cringed
The whiskers of that cat would soon
Be singed
Don't be scared
We're prepared.

Then the muckidy muck started singin'
Through his great paternal grin
And the church mice, field mice
All the patriotic mice
Everybody chimed right in
They sang this land is mice land
Mice country tis of thee
Well my father took it from the beaver rat
Nobody's gonna take it from me
And the mice all cheered
The sound that they were makin' sure
Was weird
Don't' be scared
We're prepared.

Then the muckidy muck said line up here
Everybody give a buck
To fight the three eyed Siamese cat
Takes money
And a little bit of luck
We've got a million of our best young mice
To go out and volunteer
To give up what they're livin' for
To make the cat disappear
Let's give 'em a hand
Yay
We don't want that cat invadin' our land
No way
We're not scared
We're prepared.

Then a mighty strange thing happened
Guess you could call it fate
You see, a gust of wind blew the picture
Frame down
And it landed on the muckidy muck's head
And the mice they all went crazy
For the first time they saw the lie
It was all a hoax on just simple folks
And the muckidy muck must die
And die he did
The members of his staff they just fled
They were scared
Hah
Just not prepared.

All my tired has gone away 
Got my money and my honey 
And we're out on the town to play 
Sunday morning my head is bad 
But it's worth it, all the times I had

Too young to know
How hard the fall could be
I never thought I'd try again

The gambler out in me

You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'

As snowflakes drifted into her tenement room
Her baby little fingers grew numb

Still clutchin' her poor frozen shears

And watered with all her young tears

In heavenly gardens and bowers
And instea-a-ad of a halo she'll wear 'round her head

I wanna kiss and tell the world, I fell in love tonight

'Cause I got to have you
Got to get through to you, baby
That you’re mine, mine, mine

I have reached the breaking point, the point of no return
It’s very clear to see, a fool like me will never ever learn
I have reached the breaking point, I hear the drums of doom
I’m gonna flip my wig in one great big atomic boom

That fills my heart full of dreams
All at once comes the urge primeval
And I come apart at the seams

Oh, here I go again, the same old song and dance
I’ve had my share of tea and sympathy but no romance
I’ve reached my breaking point, it’s much too late to stop
It’s either shoes and rice or lose the dice and blow my top

'Cause I got to have you
Got to get through to you, baby

You know she would rouse up, wake all a dem cows up
And walk 'em down to her Daddy's mine

I wasn't nervous ya until the service
That they held for Clementine

With your harpoon, your trusty line
If she shows now, yo, there she blows now

      For he wants to see us drowned 
      They never understood him 
      So they put him in the ground. 

      Now some had stood for hours 
      And some sat on the grass 
      Listening to their radios 
      For where the train had passed 
      And a crowd will get impatient 
      As the clock hands turn around 
      They never understood him 
      So they put him in the ground. 

      They handed out some candles 
      To the somber weary crowd 
      And told us not to light them 
      Till our eyes beheld the shroud 
      Not even at that moment 
      Could there be tranquility

      And the family left the site 
      The ropes and walls and hedges

      Who made a prayerful sound 
      They never understood him 
      So they put him in the ground. 

      Some people say the eighth of June 
      But the morning of the ninth 
      The workmen gently lowered him 
      By the beam of three work lights 
      Easy, take it easy 
      Set him down real slow 
      He'd been on some rougher trips 
      But he couldn't tell them so 
      They never understood him 
      So they put him in the ground. 

      Now no man has the answers 
      And he was just a man 
      And yet I can't help feelin' 
      That he knew a better plan 
      A shorter road to justice 
      On the trip that's freedom bound 
      But they never understood him 
      So they put him in the ground.

Bobby Darin,"When I was young, I set my heart upon a red balloon.
I knew of nothing that was nicer than a red balloon.
I tried to hold tightly to the string,
But still I saw it fly away 

Now I am grown, and find my heart is in another's hands,
And all the love I had to give is in his care.
Can our love stay alive until another Spring?
Will he hold the string, or let it go
Too soon, too soon, like a red balloon?",Red Balloon,1998

Bobby Darin,"Eighteen yellow roses came today
 Eighteen yellow roses in a pretty bouquet
 When the boy came to the door
 I didn't know what to say
 But eighteen yellow roses came today
 I opened up the card to see what it said
 I couldn't believe my eyes
 When I had read
 Though you belong to another I love you anyway
 Yes eighteen yellow roses came today
 I never doubted your love for a minute
 I always thought that you would be true
 But now this box and the flowers in it
 I guess there's nothin' left for me to do
 But ask to meet the boy that's done this thing
 And find out if he's got plans to buy you a ring

 But a father's love will never fade away
 Will never fade away",18 Yellow Roses,2003

After three or four dances
Ah, you can just bet she'll play hard to get

I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.

This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it

About my dirty habits, I got to have it, the super-glow
Deuce Bigelow - Male Gigolo
Gold hands crush Coke cans and Michelobs
Style is Nino, black Benzito, Valentino
Nine needles - voice; evil steelo
Hit, like the bull, more pull than Magneto
Crush kilos with my bare hand, reload the Eagle
Nine dirty strikes, leaped up off all you people
Burn therapy, chemo, seap hoes
See you through the peephole - in the crime lab
Countin Ginos, cut-tin dime slabs
Then he bagged up Chino, rushed through the crowd with a hee-ho
Slapshots, jackpots, and pe-nnals
Throw graffiti on the wall, throwin up Reemo
Gambino three dice, headcrack Cee-Lo
In ya earhole, let the snare roll go low
Lower than low, lower than zero

With high-heel shoes and tattoos on side titties
Shorties swallow up the apple cider
Ra' doin a buck forty in the yellow Spyder
With the black interior, my mack superior
to your theory of gats, up in the cafeteria
I used to cut class and bang lunch tables
With four finger weaves and long chunky gold cables
Now I'm known to smack drum machines, carry +Guillotines+
Watch my bullets scream (""Pheeewwwwww!"") and hit the target
You can't trace the path of air for Richard Starlett

Floss gems across the globe with my nine Sourceman
At a speed that excedes your convertible Benz
From a distance you glimpse, supernocular lens
Stay hotter than a ex-con dodgin the pens
Killa Squadron, known to start a popular trend
And the emblem, symbolize the wisdom
certifies the platinum, magnifies the stardom
Shots bust at random, wake you out your boredom
Kings of our kindom, reppin from our hoodlums
Gotta whip them problems, 'cause yo we step on toes
Bangin heads knockin teeth loose, welcome to the pros
Flash quiz, do that nigga handle his biz?
I spin a song like Michael and Diana in the Wiz
The rough shit, I bust it for the republic
Government, you ain't lovin it, whatchu fuckin wit?
Manifesto, light it like a techno club
Outside I don't expect no love
Man this grip, make the fans flip, don't chance it
Cop the goods, while my hundred hoods run rampid

Hundred spoke Daytonas, wish we all could be California
Smokin bank in the corners in a black six-deuce
Hittin switches, dippin, switchin on that ackrite juice
Act like you, wan' try and take my D's
Watch how fast these slugs in this thang gon' leave
Watch how many holes in ya body it leaves
Watch how much pints of blood you bleed
May the fake thugs retreat, pop up barkin the heat
Caravanin nine-to-ten cars deep
Down the 'shaw where Knights is known to breakin laws
And if a bitch is ridin with me she's takin it off
Now get off ya job, if not bitch I'm layin you off

Bouncin off this deuce-deuces, fat like Polo gooses
Eighteen-inch woofers movin studio acoustics
Rim tri-star, chrome on my side-bar
Don't hate crab 'cause I caught ya bitch eye par
Platinum grill, re-enforced solid steel
Superstar engine, force of an eighteen wheel
That'll crash through brick walls, smash intersections
Move through ya city escorted with police protection
Heated polished seats with back massages
You gotta know how to roll in more like Kenny Rogers
Tinted glass, PS2 plus Dreamcast
Smoke screens, blindin high blasts
GPS satellite navigation
Automatic lock doors drop jackers to the station
You got beef you get fed to Doc Doom
Goon, you can't fuck with Wu Killa Bee Clan platoon
I might get Holocaust to come and cough on you
My nigga Crisis might love to let one off on you
Or Rugged Monk rolls up another blunt
The great Digi goes and lures out another cunt
'cause I be Rollin, Rollin, Rollin on them twenty-twos
Ain't got no money or love for you funny fools

Stick dick to hoodrats, make gangsta hits
I baptize my sticks, ice skate on seventeens
On the phone with five-oh, don't you love them D's?
While they spin, you freeze in ya souped up paint clean
Fifties, amps, six by nines and thangs
Comin down the block, let my sub straight bang

Jah is the light into my dark, he cut and tear on my path
They fight without a cause tryin to make my life so hard
The king of kings and the lord of lords, give it all rewards

I'm so solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now

So don't you mix me up with your dirty games, your only tryin to tarnish my name
Your only lookin for the innocent to blame, when your the ones who issue the guns down the lane
You only cause dysfunction and frame, but the right ones believe in the reign
Love is all I got to give and I'm not ashamed, lookin towards the future this lie can't tame

'Cause I'm so solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now",Solid as a Rock,2018
Bobby Digital Band,"Haha, dead to you

Yo, yo, yo,
When I was young I slept with a battery on my tongue
So when I spit the impact will have a sting of a stun gun
At full blast, rock your cradle, fatal razor blades graze you
That split you open, stitch you back with a staple
A football head, I put your head, in a brook or four
Your momma wouldn't look at yall,
Go from the Panama canal, Alabama gal
Got me laid up, with my nuts like kapow!
B.O.B boys fast as Bruce Leroy,
Beat the rap galactics, blow panics off his axis
My glock is plastic, my dick is like magic
Stretch off then pow, your like Mr. Fantastic

[Chorus]
Stop its a booby trap
Would you rather have a digi or a Scooby Snack
Digi snack yeah, while we living in a booby trap

When it comes to this mic like the mice you get ate
Like the ginger bread man trying to cross the lake
Or the winchester pour my whites on Mr. Poindexter
Tell him bring back the black mac strapped with two extra 
Clips whizzing at you, words inside the apple
Pot holes in the street, it pops the d-axle
Shrivel your heart to a raisin shorty start gaizin'
Yeah he got stupid and dunce, once he start blazin' blunts
Beef he get drowned in hunts, your flame get toast
Your best bet to punt, 
I lounge like a hungry jog-walk into agua
Trying to catch a fish that multiply like them agua
Pocket fed you Jabba the hut, clean gallops up
Through the force of my steel, but you cant count the caliber
Digi, digi, digi, all inside your city 
Microphone on the roam, like Capone and Frank Nitti

[Chorus: x2]

I don't have a taste for blood or fresh skin
My mind, like Professor X from the X-men
One line cause MC's to wipe their albums down
Devils only come amongst you if you allow them now
Due to trade they infiltrate with persuasion
Their desire to rob and steal and make slaves of all
Living luxury, destructibly, conductibly, a prop of nature
Privately and publicly, man so stupid 
When confronted with something he don't understand he shoot it
The whole worlds polluted,
My urge gave birth to a universal change that
Just slides reflect the child born in the Bethlehem manger
Devil trying to steal me of my intellect,
Rob me of my culture, like they white washing sculptures
Like they snatching down my posters,
But its been caught through the eyes of Minolta

Bobby Digital Band,"Talkin bout drama
I met a young brother, how young about eight
He seemed intelligent and rather quite straight
I greeted him, and struck a conversation
To see if the youngster had some self-motivation
Peace brother, what's your name, and how ya be
He said I be soon coming off the currency
I said gettin paid, he said yeah like my man's brother
Who has a condo he shares with his baby's mother
He said a condo beats my apartment
With no lights and no gas and much backed up rent
No hot water or heat, and invaded by plenty rats
That'll eat up the average alleycat
He said yeeahhhh boyyyeee, that's poverty
I said word, I know and it bothers me
'cause we are the victims, of a situation
How wicked man, separated
a nation and got us cold-killin off one another
(Word-word, to the mother)
It's getting hot, how hot, hotter than July
'cause the murder and crime rate is rising very high
For example, in my neighborhood, it's so hot
I'm often woke up, from the alarming sound of a shot
So I'm thinking what, is my neighborhood a trap
Could this be the place marked X on the map?
Now I'm spotted like a target, in the shooting gallery
So I start to seek for a better salary
So I can escape from where, from this ghetto life area
Cause everyday you're getting scarier
*blam blam* and scarier and scarier
Causing mass hysteria, it's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not to be bold and disrespect the homeless
'cause I can see that they suffer from a long list
From not having shelter, and out on the street
without a job and days without a bite to eat
Yo I feel for those, but here's another side
about some more people that's living on the outside
Because of the fact that they chose the wrong way
And it took em on a trip for a long day
Got to the point you started stealing from your house
Stalking the rooms late at night like a mouse
Your family's upset and you've got to go
When it's, five, below and we're ex-pecting snow
And then you're on the train with a cup in your hand
Kicking dirt, and making it look like sand
Then after you run that game for a while
You start sucking up tokens from out the turnstile
Are you that desperate, just to get a hit
Is it so effective that you won't quit, and yo
Why do you come to me crying the blues?
About you can't get a job well go sell some street news
Then you can get straight and be real
But you'd rather rob and steal
And that's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not wonderama
But I'm talkin bout drama
Here what I'm sayin?
I'm not talkin bout your mama
Nahhhh, but I'm talkin bout drama

Days, days are turning to nights now
They said, they said I'd be OK
But when I hear those church bells ringing
I begin to pray for today might be my dying day

The great mind, surpass space and time
Seven plains of energy, interlace combine
Five conscious stages, stand up courageous
Change your plurality, seek mental clarity
Zip-lock off the chronic, kissed it, then I twist it
Build on today's mathematic ballistics
I walk with the utmost honorable respect
It's a quick locked secret, so Protect Ya Neck
This is full metal jacket, ain't about that gossip
Nope, you get your face all over the bicep
Go out the closet, you slimey sausage
Six degrees of luxury, with no deposit
They said a friend be sub blanked, a plane be sub tanked
A gat be sub shanked, look, I just hit jackpot
A hundred mil to the bank

It's been a long time coming
Days, days are turning to nights now
They said, they said I'd be OK
But when I hear those church bells ringing
I begin to pray for today might be my dying day

The continent splitter, the dominant figure
The mathematician who calculated God from nigga
The Zig Zag Zigga, who civilize the wigga
My vigorous attack on the track, slice a thousand giga
Bytes of information, in one line, how sometime
Use the sky for a blanket, then I bathe in sunshine
Nine conquer bonds and nine wives, nine lives
Nine grands sit on my side, we carry nine knives
Eighteen strikes from Low Hand, ain't no man
Can withstand the blow, from the Wu-Tang Clan
I answer many questions of life, without asking
Breath in the stench of death, without gasping
Fasting and praying, while you laughing and playing
I am fast in my mind, to attachment what we came in
And go through the river of life, I stay floating
Live a hundred twenty degrees without quoting

It's been a long time coming
Days, days are turning to nights now
They said, they said I'd be OK
But when I hear those church bells ringing
I begin to pray for today might be my dying day

I have no fascination with Satan, no relation to probation
I'm the sun sitting still, while you trapped in rotation
Every rebel's creation, every thought has been ovation
One demonstration, we civilized a whole entire nation
Attract a generation, who's built with elimination
Of wickedness and sickness, we striving for the bliss
We rising up our fists, five stage of consciousness
Keeping our promises, master our circumference

It's been a long time coming
Days, days are turning to nights now
They said, they said I'd be OK
But when I hear those church bells ringing
I begin to pray for today might be my dying day

Yeah, I'm back
Sometimes, you think you bout to lose it all
But it's actually, the point that you made it all
It seems like life is gonna pass me by
But now I'm reborn to a new chance, a new opportunity
A life has just begun
And if we having a good time, but wasting your time
Seven plains of energy must interlace and combine
And all praises due to the Most High

Three wheel and hundred spokes, while I'm blowing chronic smoke
Turning corner after corner, with my Southern Cal folk
But the underground in the city life, it ain't a playground
I'm loyal, dedicated, always ready to throw down
My morals, and my values, retire up on the richter
Speak this vivid, so you clearly get the picture
And description of a real one, standing in your mist
I don't just talk, I walk this Killa Cal shit
Footprints of a legend as a I paint the concrete

[RZA]
The greatest B-Boy of all time, started from small crimes
While others had big tops I was slingin' small dimes
Tryin' to make the come up, the blow used to numb up
A few G's a week, my clique used to sum up
Till my brother got locked up, my girl got knocked up
My closest homies each, got popped up and shot up
And cops flood the block, no way to eat
So I dropped a half a G on a rented SP
1200 Sampler, and a Yamaha Four-Track
The bass from the lab used to blow the fuckin' door back
While Ghost was doin' stick-ups, tryin' to make a vic' up
Waitin' outside for the Brinks truck to pick up
Nothing would work, so we're back to choppin' nicks up
Givin' grown ass women two vials for a dick suck
When I was stressed I would head to the rest
Then the pads on the SP-12 got pressed
Makin' beats for the streets, so the family could eat
In '93, Wu-Tang Clan dropped their first LP
We went platinum, yeah we flatten 'em
Pockets got fat and um, went and got Cap and 'em
Staten's on the map and um, Brooklyn Zoo is bombin' 'em
All around the world, Killa Bees start swarmin' 'em

Rock us or mock us, knock us or top us
Better sit back and watch us

Can't stop me man
No matter how hard, you better go hard
So hard, if you gonna try and stop me now
I be ruckus to rhythm like the blocks be wild
Bad enough I got the cops tryin' to lock me down
Can't nobody break my stride or shake my pride
Without a homicide, case and trial
It's a long time comin', long nines bustin'
Cradle to the grave I be on my grind hustlin'
Sometimes when I think about it, have my mind buggin'
The shit that I been through, things that I've seen
The chicks that I ran through, places I've been
I'm a victim of the very song I sing
That's how it is in the heart of it, most want no part of it
Some will soothe the pain through booze and narcotics
I'm a hold my head, stay true to where my heart is
Either you pay with your life, or you pay dues and homage

She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey

Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the milky way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone

Bobby Driscoll/Paul Collins,"Now, I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

My lute back, I re-up that new pack
My new hat, I threw that

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

I've tested I've already seen some bad news.
Do what's in ya nature don't let it break ya.
Plan to win if their raisin the stakes up.
Now you can take a few bumps and bruises.
I'm confident I'm tellin ya you will not lose this.
Life force is dwindilin you're barely alive.
Time to let go of the wheel and
Let your heart drive.

[Chorus]
Just let your heart drive
Just let your heart drive, c'mon c'mon
Just let your heart drive

Count on family, 'cause they come through.
Even when your in a spot with the odds against ya.
I'm no rookie I was taught to step up.
If I fall down gramps told me to get up.
My generation is prepared to face ya.
Life can be a struggle but you do what it takes ya.
You try to be clever but you're not that wise.
You'll never be a winner if you don't let your heart drive.

And I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see? I'm in love

I'd be a silly so-and-so

I'm sitting on the rainbow
I've got that string around my finger

As long as I hold the string
I'd be a crazy so-and-so

Bobby Forrester,"Hide your heart from sight,
Lock your dreams at night,
It could happen to you.
Don't count stars
Or you might stumble,
Someone drops a sigh
And down you tumble,
Keep an eye on spring,
Run when church bells ring.
It could happen to you 
All I did was wonder 
How your arms would be
And it happened to me",It Could Happen to You,1996
Bobby Forrester,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love,1996

I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do
I'm still in love with you

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

Going to tell you how much I love you
Though you think you already know
I remember I thought you looked like an angel
Wrapped in pink, so soft and warm
You've had me wrapped around your finger
Since the day you were born

You're beautiful baby, from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know
The road that will lead you home again
Go on, take on this old world but to me

When you were in trouble that crooked little smile
Could melt my heart of stone

I turned around and you've almost grown
Sometimes when you're asleep
I whisper I love you in the moonlight at your door

Bobby Gaylor,"Animals don't have a choice.
If they're not happy with their place in the world too bad.
They have to live the life they've been given.
Humans, on the other hand, don't have to.
We have a choice.
If you don't like your place in the world, you can get off anytime you want.
Suicide. That's right. 
You don't like the way your life's going,
You don't like the way you are in the world,
Anything around you, you can check out anytime you like.
Animals aren't allowed that thought
And believe me, if they were, they would use it.
There'd be a lot of dogs and cats, owned by assholes
That live in high-rises, diving out the windows.
Zebras if they even had remotely that thought
Would take a look at themselves and go, ""What the fuck!""
Black & white in a green & brown world this blows.
I'm just gonna jump in the river
I don't have a thumb to work a gun or hold a knife
Or even open a jar of pills.
I'm just gonna dive into the next lion's mouth.
Why even bother?""
Now, monkeys have the opposable thumb
So they could kinda do it the exact same way we do.
Now, there's a bunch of people that say,
""Oh, it's against the law"".
Well, it's only against the law if you do a crappy job and get caught.
Other people say, ""Oh, we should save them"".
Yeah, well you know what?
Not everybody wants to be saved.
Not everybody should be saved.
And who are we to force our will upon them?
I mean, isn't that one of the joys about being a human?
Freedom of choice?
Now, it's not all bad.
Now, I'm not saying ""Kill yourself"".
But if you're gonna be an idiot and do it anyway,
It's no sweat off of my back.
There's a lot of good that could come from it.
A little bit of bad thrown in.

Some of the things:
A job will open
An apartment will become available
There'll be more air for me
They say there's two girls for every guy - if you're a man, there'll be four chicks for me
There'll be more Ketel One vodka for me
There'll be one less idiot in line at the bank who gets up to the window without their fucking slips filled out
I won't ever have to go to the store to buy my favorite Salt & Vinegar Chips
And have the clerk point at you and say, ""They bought the last bag""
You won't help change the McDonald's sign to a Hundred Billion Served
You'll never get AIDS
You won't have to worry about calories ever
No more, ""Hey, does this make me look fat?""
There'll be one less polluting human
You won't have to recycle
There'll be one less car on the road
There'll be more Ring Dings for me
Fifty or so chickens' lives will be spared
Your fingers won't ever get red from eating pistachios
You won't be forced to visit your Grandparents on Sundays anymore
No more church
You'll be saying, ""Hey, World - Kiss My Ass!""
No more wet dreams about Supermodels
No more Barry Manilow
Not for a few years anyway
Wondering ""Am I a loser?"" will be a thing of the past
Say good-bye to crappy Xmas presents from Aunts and Uncles
You won't have to suffer through a Motley Crue reunion
Fuck flossing and brushing
You'll never lose sleep over a pregnancy scare
Adios, acne
Worrying whether you fit in or not won't be on your brain
See ya later, homework
You'll never have to sit through another movie brought to you by the creators of South Park
School's out forever
No more paying bills
You won't have to do chores

You won't be able to run over toads with the lawnmower though
You'll also miss McDonald's French Fries
Bugs Bunny
The amazing electrifying feeling that surges through your body when you kiss someone for the first time
You won't be able to watch the letterbox director's cut of Jaws
Candy
Living above ground
Pudding crust
You'll miss the rush of getting your first apartment
Getting to the point in your life where you can tell your parents to 
""Fuck off! I gotta make my own mistakes, you did""
You'll miss sex you'll miss thinking about it, looking for it, 
Sex by yourself, sex with a partner, sex with multiple partners
No more summer nights that seem to go on forever roller coasters
Naming your kid the name you always wanted
Making a difference in the world
You'll miss the experience and pleasure of Hallucinogenics
Watching your neighbor's wife change clothes with her blinds open
A lifetime of masturbating
Watching your favorite team sweep the series
Music, you will definitely miss music
Trying to sneak into your house drunk three hours past your curfew
You'll miss the blaze and glory of the 4th of July fireworks
The taste of Captain Crunch
If you're a boy, you'll miss the feeling the first time you reach up a girl's shirt
If you're a girl, the feeling the first time you reach down a boy's pants
You'll miss your favorite coat
Waffles with whipped cream and strawberries
Beating your friends at video games
You won't be around to see what shape and color the new marshmallow in Lucky Charms will be
You'll miss the feeling you get when reminiscing about your first love - thirty years after the fact
The joy of giving and receiving at Christmas

Getting stoned, reading Green Eggs & Ham, and eating like a horse that got loose in the grain bin

Bobby Goldsboro,"Buck was born on a beautiful morning
And I felt very proud
Lets just say its not every day
That you see me cry out loud

Hair like sunshine, a smile as warm
And the prettiest eyes you'll find
One day last spring my lady and I
Found out those eyes were blind

[Chorus]
Have a butterfly for me daddy
They sound so pretty to me
Tell me about the butterfly
And all the things you see

Well over there Buck lies a beautiful meadow
With the colors of gold and tan
With the smell of hay and the sound of crickets
Here Buck, take my hand

And I wish you could see that big oak tree
With its limbs reaching up to the sky
And a bed of flowers growing at its feet
And a big yellow butterfly

Save a butterfly for me daddy
Before they disappear
Save a butterfly for me daddy
And on his cheek was a tiny tear

So we packed up our bags our hopes and our dreams
And we all went to town that day
I sneaked off to the hospital chapel
I got down on my knees and I prayed

Save a butterfly for my boy lord
I sure need nothing for me
Except an angel of joy to touch him
The way that he's touched me

Now there are things in this universe
That we just don't understand
And through an open window came a butterfly
To land on Buck's small hand

The doctor's face was strangely white
As if it just couldn't be
But the light was in my boys face
Daddy he said, I can see

Save a butterfly for us Bucky
We're all so blind it seems
For we've not seen the magic
In the power of a little boy's dreams",Butterfly for Bucky,

Strumming his guitar though it's upside-down 
Shooting at a bear he'll make you think it's really there

I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen",Your Song,1971
Bobby Goldsboro,"The road is long
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Who knows where
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

So on we go
His welfare is my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with gladness
And love for one another

It's a long, long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there
Why not share
And the load doesn't weigh me down at all

He ain't heavy, he's my brother","He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother",1971
Bobby Goldsboro,"It was a hot afternoon
Last day of June
And the sun was a demon
The clouds were afraid
One ten in the shade
And the pavement was steaming

I told Billy Ray
In his red Chevrolet
I needed time for some thinking
I was just walking by
When I looked in her eye
And I swore it was winking

She was thirty one and I was seventeen
I knew nothing about love, she knew everything
When I sat down beside her on the front porch swing
And wondered what the coming night would bring

The sun closed her eyes
As it climbed in the sky
And it started to swelter
The sweat trickled down the front of her gown
I thought it would melt her

She threw back her hair
Like I wasn't there
She sipped on a julep
Her shoulders were bare
And I tried not to stare
When I looked at her two lips

And when she looked at me
I heard her softly say
I know you're young
You don't know what to do or say
But stay with me until the sun has gone away
And I will chase the boy in you away

And then she smiled then we talked for a while
Then we walked for a mile to the sea
We sat on the sand, and the boy took her hand
But I saw the sun rise as a man

Ten years have gone by
Since I looked in her eye
But the memory lingers
I got back in my mind
To the very first time
And feel the touch of her fingers

It was a hot afternoon
Last day of June
And the sun was a demon
The clouds were afraid
One ten in the shade
And the pavement was steaming",Summer (The First Time),1973

Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

But friend it hasn't been too long 
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad, 
The first day that she planted it
Was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran out 
To brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited, 
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart, 
Kinda dumb and kinda smart 
And I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late

That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you and I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad 
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me 
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly 
And caught her cryin' needlessly
In the middle of a day
And it was in the early spring 
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away

And honey, I miss you and I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could

One day while I was not at home 
While she was there and all alone

And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage 
Where honey lived and honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead 
And cries down on the flower bed
That honey loved

How do you tell him his daddy's goin' away?
Do I tell him that I reached the autumn of my life

And the clouds would all blow away?

I dunno what went wrong I woke and you were gone

Of sunny days,
And Willie Mays,

Dream on, little broomstick cowboy,
Dream while you can
Of big green frogs,
And puppy dogs,
And castles in the sand

For, all too soon you'll awaken
Your toys will all be gone
Your broomstick horse will ride away,
To find another home
And you'll have grown into a man,
With cowboys of your own
And then you'll have to go to war,
To try and save your home
And then you'll have to learn to hate
You'll have to learn to kill
It's always been that way, my son
I guess it always will

No broomstick gun they'll hand you
No longer you'll pretend
You'll call some man your enemy
You used to call him 'friend'
And when the rockets thunder,
You'll hear your brothers cry
And through it all you'll wonder

Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me,1990
Bobby Gordon,"Don't you hear my heart whisper thru your window, Emaline?
It's a lovely night, Emaline, to meander with me,
Have you told your friends, 
Have you told your people, Emaline?
Hurry up and write them a line 
'Bout a weddin' to be, 
In the church there's an old bell ringer,
Just waitin' for the time when I place a ring around your finger, 
makin' you mine,
All I do is pray for that Sunday mornin' sun to shine,
When I promenade down the line

Bobby Gordon,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

I could be a ruler of kings
And if you were mine
I could do such wonderful things

Stop where you are
Light up my lover's way
And every star above you

Would obey, say
If you were mine
I would live for your love alone
To kneel at your shrine
I would give up all that I own

Even my life
I'd trade it all for you
And think I was lucky too

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end

Blacker than midnight, teeth lak flags of truce
Blackest man in de whole of Saint Louis
Blacker de berry, sweeter am de juice

About a crap game, he knows a pow'ful lot
But when work time comes, he's on de dot
Gwine to ask him for a cold ten spot
What it takes to git it, he's cert'nly got

A black headed gal makes a freight train jump the track
But a long tall gal makes a preacher ball the jack

Lawd, a blonde headed woman makes a good man leave the town
I said, ""Blonde headed woman makes a good man leave the town
But a red headed woman makes a boy slap his papa down""

Oh, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I said, ""Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
If my blues don't get you, my jazzing must""

From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart

Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed

Just a jack knife has Macheath dear

Fancy white gloves has Macheath dear
So there's never, never a trace of red

On the sidewalk, one Sunday morning
Lies a body, oozin' life
Someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone perhaps, per chance be Mack the Knife

From a tugboat, on the river going slow
A cement bag is dropping down 
You know that cement is for the weight dear
You can make a large bet Macheath's in town

After drawing out all the bread from his stash
Now Macheath spends like a sailor
Do you suppose this guy, he did something rash

They did this song nice, Lady Ella too
They all sang it, with so much feeling
That Old Blue Eyes, he ain't gonna add nothing new

But with this big, fat band, jumping behind me
Swinging hard, Jack, I know I can't lose
When I tell you, all about Mack the Knife babe
It's an offer, you can never refuse

We got Patrick Williams, Bill Miller playing that piano
And this wonderful, great big band, bringing up the rear

They make the greatest sounds, you're ever gonna hear

Bobby Hackett,"There's a story told of a little Japanese
Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low
The moon and I
Know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back
Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

Bobby Hackett,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""

Gee but I'd give the world to see

There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1997

Remain to love until they droop and die

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss",But Not for Me,2000
Bobby Hackett,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You,2000
Bobby Hackett,"I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same never be the same again
 
I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same

Once love was king but kings can be wrong

Bobby Hackett,"Deep night, stars in the sky above
Moonlight, lighting our place of love
Night winds seem to have gone to rest
Two eyes, brightly with love are gleaming
Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own
Vow that you'll love me always, be mine alone

Deep night, whispering trees above
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer
Deep night, deep in the arms of love

Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own
Vow that you'll love me always, and be mine alone

Deep night, whispering trees above
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer
Deep night, deep in the arms of love",Deep Night,2000
Bobby Hackett,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,2000
Bobby Hackett,"The farce was ended,
The curtains drawn,
And I at least pretended
That love was dead and gone.

But now, from nowhere,
You come to me as before
To take my heart,
And break my heart once more.

Get out of town
Before it's too late, my love.
Get out of town,
Be good to Mr. please!

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees?

Just disappear,
I care for you much too much,
And when you are near,
Close to me dear,
We touch too much!

The thrill when we meet
Is so bitter-sweet
That, darling, it's getting me down;
So on your mark,
Get set,
Get out of town!",Get Out of Town,2000
Bobby Hackett,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,2000
Bobby Hackett,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You,2000
Bobby Hackett,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo,2000
Bobby Hackett,"April showers, overhead offer me a chance
To protect her from the rain and cultivate romance
It's an opportunity, something to enjoy
Helter, skelter fly for shelter I'm a lucky boy
 
Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
On the pane and we're alone
A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon
A lovely peaceful afternoon 
No one can see us
Rain It's so cozy in the rain
There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain
 
Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
On the pane and we're alone
A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon
A lovely peaceful afternoon 
No one can see us
Rain It's so cozy in the rain
There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain

Bobby Hackett,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,2000
Bobby Hackett,"Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
",Sleep,2000
