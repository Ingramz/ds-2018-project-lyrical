Al Casey,"Here we are
Out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Here we are
In the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone
From the Frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember
The nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father didn't like you at all
Do you remember
The reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest
And get a bit of rest

Well, here we are
Just about the same
Foggy little fella
Drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight",Two Sleepy People,2000
Al Casey,"I'd work for you, I'd even slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you (whatever that is)
And if that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd gladly move the earth for you
To prove my love, dear, and its worth for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do (gotta do)
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you, darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?
(You want me to rob a bank? Well I won't do it)

I'd sigh for you, yes, I'd even cry for you, yes
I'd tear the stars down from the skies for you
If that isn't love, well skip it, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

Listen baby
I'd even sigh for you, I'm 'bout ready to cry for you
I'd tear the stars down from the skies for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do, baby, yes
Until the real thing comes along
(Here's the real thing, baby)",Until the Real Thing Comes Along,2000
Al Casey,"I love my man
I'm a liar if I say I don't
I love my man
I'm a liar if I say I don't
But I'll quit my man
I'm a liar if I say I won't

I've been your slave, baby
Ever since I've been your babe
I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your babe
But before I'll be your dog
I'll see you in your grave

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Squawked about my supper then he put me outdoors
Had the nerve to lay a matchbox on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long ways to go

I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curled
I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curled
But my mother, she gave me something
It's going to carry me through this world

Some men like me 'cause I'm happy
Some 'cause I'm snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I've got money

Some say me Billie
Baby, you're built for speed
Now, if you put that all together
Makes me everything a good man needs",Billie's Blues,2001
Al Casey,"Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Since everyone spread the story 
With his own little personal touch
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me

Al Casey,"Gee, how I miss
Your tender kiss,
And the wonderful things we would do.

Now I run my hands
Through silvery strands,
You left me blue turning gray over you.

You used to be
So good to me,
That's when I was a novelty.

Now, you've new friends in view,
You've found someone new,
And left me blue turning gray over you.",Blue Turning Grey Over You,2002
Al Casey,"Everybody loves my baby
but my baby don't love nobody but me
nobody but me
Yes
everybody wants my baby
but my baby don't want nobody but me
that's plain to see!

I'm his sweet Judy
and he is my loving man!
No time to do his duty
loves me like no other can!

Everybody loves my baby
but my baby don't love nobody but me
nobody but me
Everybody wants my baby
but my baby don't want nobody but me
that's plain to see!

Now when my baby kisses me
upon my rosy cheeks -
I just let those kisses be
don't wash my face for weeks!

Everybody loves my baby...",Everybody Loves My Baby,2002
Al Casey,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body & Soul,2012
Al Casey,"Gather round me buddies
Hold your glasses high
And drink to a fool, a crazy fool who told his baby goodbye

Too late he found out he loves her
So much he wants to die
But drink to a fool, a crazy fool who told his baby goodbye

He needs her, he needs her so
He wonders why he let her go-oo-oo

She's found a new love, buddy
He's a lucky guy
So drink to the fool, 'cause I'm that fool who told his baby goodbye

He needs her, he needs her so
He wonders why he let her go-oo-oo

She's found a new love, buddy
He's a lucky guy
So drink to the fool, 'cause I'm that fool who told my baby goodbye
My baby goodbye
Who told my baby, who told my baby...",The Fool,1995
Al Casey,"The night was black, rain fallin' down
Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around
Traced her footsteps down to the shore
'Fraid she's gone forever more

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
""I took your baby from you away""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep
""Come join me, baby, in my endless sleep""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea 
That's why my baby has gone from me

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
""I took your baby from you away""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep
""Come join me, baby, in my endless sleep""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear
There in the breakers I saw her near
Reached for my darlin', held her to me
Stole her away from the angry sea

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
""You took your baby from me away""
My heart cried out ""she's mine to keep""
I saved my baby from an endless sleep

Endless sleep, endless sleep
Endless sleep, endless sleep",Endless Sleep,2001
Al Casey,"If I told you baby I’m not all by myself
Yeah if I told you baby I’m not all by myself
You might write me off the list
And put me right back on the shelf

I was out downtown until two or three
Started asking those questions of me
But if I told you baby, you’d know it all by myself
You might write me off the list 
And put me right back on the shelf

Well I drank a little gin and had a lot of fun
Met a little blonde and now it’s way past one
But if I told you baby I’m not all by myself
You might write me off the list
And put me right back on the shelf

If I told you baby I’m not all by myself
Yeah if I told you baby I’m not all by myself
You might write me off the list
And put me right back on the shelf

We bopped and we bopped and I was a little snowed
And we went to her house and we bopped a little more
But if I told you baby you’d know it all by myself
You might write me off the list
And put me right back on the shelf

I don’t wanna lose you baby so let me tell you this;
Didn’t even give that blonde a little kiss
I’m gonna tell you baby so you won’t leave me all by myself
You might write me off the list
And put me right back on the shelf

Yeah
Uh huh
Wanna tell you little baby
So I won’t know it all by myself",If I Told You (Wouldn't Know It All by Myself),2001
Al Casey,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment

Al Casey,"Melancholy serenade every time I hear it played
Right out of space your haunting face appears

There were other serenades broken promises we made
Why must I pay day after day with tears

Alone in my room I watch the ghost of you
Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear

Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear",Melancholy Serenade,2007
Al Casey,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2007

Al Casey,"I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to feel low-down
I gotta right to hang around
Down around the river

A certain gal in this old town
Keeps draggin' my poor (old) heart around
All I see for me is misery

I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan and sigh
I gotta right to sit and cry

Mop mop! A guy named Jungle Joe
Was a drummer man in a Zulu band
That made swing history

Mop mop! One day the king said ""Gate!
Why Gate, you old reprobate
I commission you, find a riff that's new
Or your wig belongs to me.""

Joe's knees started knockin'
So scared he was stiff
'Til he noticed the tribe was rockin'
As his knees beat out this mellow riff

Mop mop! From the tropic's heat
Mop mop! Came this jungle beat
Though old Joe is gone, his jive lives on
And it still is making history.

Savoy--it wins you with a glance

(Irving Caesar/Vincent Youmans) 

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear; 
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

Penso che non ci si annoia per caso,
Per casa tutto così ordinato nel caso
In cui qualcuno venisse
Solitamente parli di strane personcine mai viste,
Vorrei il tuo tempo per riempirlo con te al centro
Altro non vorrei che averti nel mio tempo,
Senza di te il vento il decadimento
Che sei unico mio punto di riferimento,
Vorrei il tuo tempo,
Vorresti fosse che giorno?
Io so cosa non vuoi o chi vorresti che sia,
Chi terresti con te per più di un giorno
E chi sta andando via se non sta con chi stai,
Con chi stai andando via
Andrai comunque
Andrai come se n'è andato chiunque
Per come sei potresti andare ovunque.
Vorrei che fosse un altro giorno e un'altra ora,
Altro non vorrei che rivederti ancora.

Vorrei fermare il tempo adesso io
Vorrei prima che sia domani,
Vorrei perderti e ritrovarti ancora
Vorrei che tutto fosse come te. (come te, come te)

Vorrei il tuo tempo e stare sempre in movimento
Roteando girando intorno al centro (concentro)
Concentro il tempo che resta poi osservandoti che sei unico mio punto di riferimento (vorrei)
Vorrei che tu fossi al volante di ogni singolo mezzo
Che mi causa anche il minimo spostamento
Ogni commento,
Ogni consiglio andato è un fuoco spento
E ogni istante lo passo guidando attento (mi sento)
Mi sento a metà strada e non penso che sia il momento
Nell'istante in cui rallento mi decocentro e perdo orientamento,
Da parte mia questo non sembra un andamento (com'è)
Com'è che in te non sento il cambiamento,
Vorrei il tuo tempo, vorrei il tuo tempo
Vorrei il mio nome scritto in maiuscolo ovunque sul tuo pavimento
Vorrei che fosse un altro giorno, un'altra ora
Altro non vorrei che rivederti ancora. (ancora, ancora, ancora..)

Vorrei fermare il tempo adesso io
Vorrei prima che sia domani,
Vorrei perderti e ritrovarti ancora
Vorrei che tutto fosse come te
Averti nel mio tempo,
Io vorrei che fosse già domani,
Vorrei vederti ritornare ancora,
Vorrei che tutto fosse come te.

Vorresti, vorresti fosse che giorno
Forse non cambio in nulla almeno guardati intorno
Intorno a noi terra che scotta non so ci credo,
Sarà il sole che entra in casa ma io per noi stravedo
Per quel che t'interessi il tempo avanza (e non fai)
E non fai altro che cercare una qualsiasi distanza
Vorrei il tuo tempo per dargli importanza
Vorrei che fosse il giorno più adatto per non sentir la tua mancanza
Vorresti, vorresti fosse che giorno,
Vorresti fosse un giorno in partenza e non di ritorno
Più in alto di qui c'è soltanto dell'altro,

I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""

Al Cohn,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away

I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

Follow it over the hill and stream.

Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

I look down hear the sound of the things you said today

Al Fish,"Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in

News guy wept and told us
Earth she was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Well, I knew he wasn't lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
I saw boys and toys, electric irons, TVs
My brain felt like a warehouse it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there

And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
Christ, I never thought I'd need so many people

Girl my age went off her head
She hit some tiny children
And if the black hadn't pulled her off
Then I think I know she would have killed them

I saw a soldier with a broken arm
Staring to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer well he threw up at the sight of that

I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
I don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your ace, the way that you talk
Well, I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
Five years, my brain hurts a lot
We got five years, that's all we've got

Five years, that's all we've got

When we`re knocking at the door

About hate and death and war? 
`cuz when we stop and look around us 
There is nothing that we need

That is parting in its greed

Has all been meant for you I`m looking for someone to change my life 
I`m looking for a miracle in my life 
But if you could see what it`s done to me 
To lose the love I knew 
That safely leads me through... 

Between the silence of the mountains and the crashing of the sea 
There lies a land I once lived in 
And she`s waiting there for me 
But in the grey of the morning

And the road that I must choose

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim 'My God, how great Thou art'

When my life is almost gone

Was blind, but now I see.
 
'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear,
And Grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.
 
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come.
'Tis Grace hath brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home.
 
The Lord has promised good to me.
His Word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.
 
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun.

Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town

How can a loser ever win?

Al Haig,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots And Moonbeams,1965

Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo

Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day

Sleep tight, my love, goodnight my love

Al Haig,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1967

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,2001

Al Haig Trio,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots And Moonbeams,1965
Al Haig Trio,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair

We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Al Hall,"A little man walked up and down,
He found an eating place in town,
He read the menu through and through,
To see what fifteen cents could do.

One meatball, one meatball,
He could afford but one meatball.

He told the waiter near at hand,
The simple dinner he had planned.
The guests were startled, one and all,
To hear that waiter loudly call, ""What,

""One meatball, one meatball?
Hey, this here gent wants one meatball.""

The little man felt ill at ease,
Said, ""Some bread, sir, if you please.""
The waiter hollered down the hall,
""You gets no bread with one meatball.

""One meatball, one meatball,
Well, you gets no bread with one meatball.""

The little man felt very bad,
One meatball was all he had,
And in his dreams he hears that call,

Al Hall,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide

It's a lovely night, Emaline, to meander with me,
Have you told your friends, 
Have you told your people, Emaline?

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Nothing much

A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

You are mine alone.

Al Heath,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day, twelve O'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong, again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again and only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will while yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive

The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,
Al Hirt,"Hon don't you hear that trombone moan?, Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, But Royal Garden Blues.

Al Hirt,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1995
Al Hirt,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Sun was shinin' fine,
The lady love of old Bill Bailey
Was hangin' clothes on the line
In her back yard,
And weepin' hard.
She married a B&O brakeman
That took and throwed her down,
Bellerin' like a prune-fed calf
With a big gang hanging round
And to that crowd,
She hollered loud:

Won't you come home?

I'll pay the rent,

I threw you out,
With nothing but a fine-tooth comb?
I know I'm to blame,
Well, ain't that a shame

In an automobile,

I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin

Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore 
Then suddenly I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi

A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Don't keep bringin up the past
I've loved you forever

Some people win
Some people loose
Some always cryin' the blues, yea
Some people win
Some people lose
Some always being misused yea

I've loved you forever(ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Don't keep bringing up the past(aah aah aah)

As you may understand
We've been lovin each other a long time
Something like this will just break up EVERYTHING
We,ve held on to so long(aah aah aah)

I'm gonna do the things for you
But girl what is a man to do?
Just leave the past alone(ooh ooh ooh)

I don't want to live in the past
Leave the past behind(ooh ooh ooh)

Baby please don't do that
Seems like every time we think got things together
The past just comes along and tears it apart

Don't bring it up
Don't bring it up
Don't keep bringin up the past
No gi-i-irl
I've loved you
I've loved you forever",Something in the Past,2007

"Al Jackson, Jr.","The sun is gone away
It is dark in the day
No kids are laughing
And none are playing

No flowers have grown
Since the month of May
That's how it's been
Since you've gone again

One you left without a reason
Two without a pleasing
Three with a terrible pain
Four you're gone again

Picture a winter
Without any snow
Look up at the sky
There's no star that glow

Picture a river
With nowhere to flow
That's how it's been, honey
Since you've gone again

One without a reason
Two without a pleasing
Three with a terrible pain
Four you're gone again

I walked in the forest
Didn't see no trees
Go to sleep at night
With a cold wind of breeze

I ain't got no friends
I got cold enemies
That's how it's been
Honey, since you've gone again

Gone, gone again, gone, gone again
Gone mama, gone again, yes, you are
Where can I find you? I need you, darling

Where can I get to you? I want you, mama baby
I love you, darling, I need you, oh gone again
Come back to me, baby",Gone Again,2012
"Al Jackson, Jr.","I've got dreams, dreams to remember
I've got dreams, dreams to remember 

Honey, I saw you there last night 
Another man's arms holding you tight 
Nobody knows what I feel inside 
All I know, I walked away and cried 

I've got dreams
Dreams to remember
Listen to me
(I've got dreams) rough dreams (dreams to remember)

I know you said he was just a friend
But I saw him kiss you again and again
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me 
Why did he hold you so tenderly? 

I've got dreams
Dreams to remember
Listen, honey
(I've got dreams) rough dreams (dreams to remember)

I still want you to stay
I still love you anyway
I don't want you to ever leave 
Girl, you just satisfy me, ooh-wee  

I know you said he was just a friend
But I saw you kiss him again and again
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me 
Why did he hold you so tenderly? 

I've got dreams
Dreams to remember
Listen to me, mama
(I've got dreams) bad dreams, rough dreams, oh (dreams to remember) 
Don't make me suffer, don't let me
