Douglas Miller,"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
 
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
 
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
 
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone",Help Me Make It Through the Night,2000
Douglas Neslund,"I'm gonna sign my name to full confession
It seems the woman I loved last night
Belongs to another man

They'd like to take you home
They'd like to purr and tease you
But I'm a passionate man
And I couldn't leave her alone

'Cause you are damned if you do
Damned if you don't
Damned if you will
Damned if you won't

Sometimes they look so good
But don't you let 'em deceive you
'Cause then you find out that they got
Some kind of a venomous mind

And the thing that's worse
Is that it all seems worth it
I'm still a passionate man
And she wouldn't leave me alone

If you think that being a stud is easy
Well, now don't ask me, boys
I wouldn't know, I'm a little slow

And you are damned if you do
And damned if you don't
You're damned if you will
And you are damned if you won't

If you think that being a stud is easy
Well, now don't ask me, boys
I wouldn't know, I'm a little slow

Gonna sign my name to full confession

Douglas Neslund,"My tape recorder,
It must be lyin'
'Cause this I just can't believe.
I hear a voice that's cryin',
That's not me.

The wheel goes round.
I hear a sound.
It's comin' out all wrong.
And I swear to you I never wrote that song.

I been livin' in my own shell so long:
The only place I ever feel at home.

And oh, that music,
I hate those lyrics.
It stayed inside me so long.
And I swear to you I never wrote that song.

But pardon me,
I'm not lookin' for sympathy,
Not sympathy.
I'm just thinking out loud.

It goes nowhere pointlessly.
Silence please.

Douglas Neslund,"By day I'm a workin' man,
Layin' bricks or layin' pipe.
I don't stand out in a crowd;
Just look like one of the guys.
Little do they know,
When I'm alone in bed at night,
I become the King of the Silver Screen.

I stare at the ceiling there;
I know where I belong.
I two step with Fred Astaire or
Fighting old King Kong.
I can be any hero at all;
Zorro or Don Juan.
I know I'm the King of the Silver Screen.

Hollywood movies keep flashin' across my mind.
I could've been Valentino if I was born in another time.

I might be solving a case or swinging from a tree.
Share a joke with Crosby and Hope;
We're such good friends, you see.
Even dazzle the Academy with my versatility.
'Cause I'm the King of the Silver Screen.

Hollywood movies keep flashin' across my mind.
I could've been Errol Flynn
If I was born in another time.

I could've been a star.
I could've been a star.
I could've played that part.
But Hollywood movies keep flashin' before my eyes.
I could've been Greta Garbo
If I was born in another time.

I wake the very next day
Go on back to work.
I'm just a face in a crowd;
Another average jerk.
And all the guys on the building site look at me flirt.
Because I'm the Queen of the Silver.

Yes, I'm the Queen of the Silver Screen.
I admit it to all my fellow workers.
I don't care any more. I'm tired of closets.
I'm gonna eat my makeup for lunch today.
Just stop hittin' me again. All right guys?
I'm going to Hollywood to be a starlet.
I know I'm 240 pounds and play center
For the Detroit Lions.
I don't care any more.
I like makeup and dresses and Hollywood.
I'll make somebody a great little wife.

Douglas Neslund,"I find myself running in circles
Lost and half insane
And I need a cure sometimes

Douglas Neslund,"If I should find myself in blackest night,
And fear is stabbin' me all over,
A tiny prayer cracks the dark with light,
And I here sounds behind my wall.
Inside, a still small voice, it calls and calls.
Then like a thunder bolt it falls and falls:
My God!

When life becomes more real than children's games,
Or we've become too old to play them,
We'll grow old gracefully,
We'll hide our shame.
But there's that voice behind the wall.
And like my conscience, it is still and small.
Each word is mercy, protects us all:
My God!

""Et in lux perpetuo""
""Deu domine""
""Et in pax aeternus""
""Deu domine""

I was a boy, when tempted, fell sometimes,
And fell so low, no one could see me,
Save for the eyes of Him that sees my crime.
When sheep, like me, have drifted lost,
All frightened children who are tempest tossed,
Down flies His wrath like an albatross:
My God!",My God,2015

Watching it fade with the dawn
Wanting her back with me, warm in the moonlight
Knowing that moment was gone
Out of mind, out of sight,
Till the moon rose tonight
All at once, I felt a chill
In a spill of moonlight, she was there
Though we both held very still
There was something pulling in the air
When she whispered through the dark
I tried hard to hold my ground
I believed I had a choice
Till the music in her voice
Turned my whole world around
I would like to understand
But the stars and I begin to blur
If she never touched my hand
Then what filled me with the feel of her?

In between us stood a wall
In a flash it fell apart
Is it possible she heard
Every last unspoken word
Racing out of my heart?
She never turned to me, but suddenly
We had so much to share!
I never took her in my arms, but she was there
Oh, she was there!
No, I never pulled her in
Still her tenderness was everywhere
Oh, she slipped beneath my skin
Just as if she'd always been right there

Tell me, why I should stay?
'Cause I don't wanna waste another moment

Oh, no, everything is alright
Breathe, everything little piece of me

So you end up watching chances fade

Douglas Wood,"She said 
Thanks but I'm broken 
I guess 
You must have misspoken 
What a laugh 
I've never been chosen by anyone 

She was barely a teen 
Hanging out in between 
Just a part of the scene 
With mercurial smile 
And incurable style 
She was only a dream 
How's that 
He didn't know a thing about 
Making love to the kind of girl you read about 

He said 
I'm bound to be broken 
My Daddy bet 
That I'd amount to nothing 
He won't let anybody show him anything 

He was a troubled child 
Had been down for a while 
Always kept to himself 
No she couldn't defend 
He only wanted a friend 
Now he's made something else 
It's so sad no one saw it coming 
The paper said that he hit the ground running 

Oh yeah 
I know I'm not broken 
A little cracked 
But still I'm not broken 
I want to laugh but I think that I'm choking on reality 

When the 
World is turning for you 
Don't turn on me 
Who are you here to repair 
Well I don't know what you mean 
You could never resist 
Glorifying despair 
Well now it's coming to you and I don't really care 

Well I'm not 
The kind to insist 
You couldn't have missed 
We must co exist 
So please listen to me 
There is no such thing as human debris 

Oh yeah 
I know I'm not broken 
A little cracked 
But dad I'm not so nothing 
I want to laugh 
I'm not joking 

I'm unbroken 
Oh yeah I said I'm unbroken 
I said I'm unbroken 
A little cracked it's just a token 
I'm really not broken 
What a guess I'm unbroken",Broken,2004

But I couldn't stand the thought of it
Anything other than the first cople pages
I just couldn't dig it
Someone once told me when looking for answers
""Don't look in corners just in the spaces
Keep it simple, keep up hope""
Sixteen was hopeful
Not enough time here, to be bidding it goodbye

The light from behind me is spotted and shapeless
And that fits me fine
What's fark in their faces looks dark for the future

The further along the closer you are
To finding if the dreams are real
And when they aren't what you do then
I'm not tired of it, so I think I'll stay

Around and around, the refrain
rings the same each time it's heard
Entertain the notion, that the only thing I hear
Is the crack of a smile, in a face that ain't so sincere

When measuring out your quality
It is only as deep as your modesty

As your insides fall to pieces
Shattered by the silent treatment
Things are only fragile till they break
Feigning your humility
It only serves to weaken the
Most common observations that you make
Drown me out in conversation
Surf a wave of provocation
Wash away my interest in your wake

I think you can, reach a place
where the impetus is pure
You'll understand, a disgrace
is the thing that makes us feel..

When we made promises
And there was a day
When we kept them

We ruled the world
From the throne you made
Promises -- we were young and free
Promises -- how it ought to be
Promises -- but somewhere it changed
Promises -- nothing remains the same
Now when we were tight
You made such promises
The world was alright
And we believed them
But now it's through
And your stock is down
Put out the fuse
The sparks are on the ground
Promises -- we were young and free
Promises -- how it ought to be
Promises -- but somewhere it changed
Promises -- nothing remains the same
Hurrah for yesterday
Long live yesterday
Drink a toast
To yesterday
We got the most
Out of yesterday
We were like one
We were like one

Promises -- but somewhere it changed
Promises -- nothing remains the same
Hurrah for yesterday
Long live yesterday

Wanna tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
When it comes to lovin'
Oh she steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six
You could say she's got it all

Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doing all the things
Doing all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bone
But you give it all you got
Weighing in at nineteen stone

CHORUS:
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman

Oh honey you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one to turn
Only one to turn me on
All through the night time
And right around the clock
To my surprise
Rosie never stops

And now to switch to how you can just come back and explain
That you've changed and maybe we could rearrange
And make things the same but I know your aim is one: Just a game
I knew that you were sorry and this time you really meant it
And that you pray to got that the commitment, but I reset it
I mean, do you truly understand how much a family means to me
And how a family must stand and that a woman must be strong enough
Stay long enough, see through wrongs enough to correct her man
And like girl we got to have this plan 
We can built this foundations on the run, and not on same

Always be no odds, stay away from the mad make gods
Read the message among the stars, put these fancy cars
I'm going to stay focus on the goal, 
And that's to be a soldier in a war gone cold

In my life, there's been heartbreak and pain, (heartbreak and pain)
I don't know, If I can face it again (face it again)
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far (traveled so far)

Down Low,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

I'll never forget, the love, hugs, smiles and tears
And the strength to help me conquer my fears

[SPM]
I'll never forget, the day we met
I was on Gravestone, trying to find a address
You told me that your wife, had just lost your baby
I never met a man, so hate free
Lately, I've been drunk as fuck
I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone
Screw took it harder, than anyone thought
It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart
South Park from the start, all of a sudden
The whole nation, all bout the Screw Shop on Cullen
November 16th, I sat and cried
Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating
are stands for realer than real, and never hating
E forever lasting, effect never corrupt
W for the world, cause that's what he screwed up

Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it

If nobody else, could feel my pain
It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

Make them pay

You're never ready
That's why they call it?
The Rush

Tell me, are you there?
Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer
See, I've prayed for peace and love
Like so many of us do
Then I prayed to find someone like you
Up in the morning
Fell out of my bed
Worn out, I couldn't sleep
Thoughts of you filled my head
How could it be?
This is scaring me

Seems every time I try
To rest my heart is when
The rush is back again
Maybe this time I'll
Make it work somehow
Guess I'm gonna find out now

I get a rush
And it's love for sure
What else can it be
Something beckons me
And I go back for more
Ooo such a rush
Can't pass love by
What else can I do
Something tells me to
Give it one more try

I'm not gonna die if love passes me by
It goes and comes around, I know
So maybe the next time I'll be one of the few
Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do
I will carry on wading through every day till love needs me
Waiting for the rush to come and find me
I still remember when love was an angel send
It will be back again

I can't remember when, I can't remember how
It's very different now
It's not a fantasy, it's very real to me
True to the touch

And pass me back a bottle of Chateau Noir""

Cause the fans keep multiplyin
So as long as rhymes stay rugged, and beats stay tight

Surroundin the issue, to make it official

See, we came to claim a zone in rap
Not on the map, and watch people adapt
To hintin to us and label it our sound
But who will be the one to wear the MC crown
The race is on, it's up for grabs
Civil rights, some will bite, some will kill and take cabs
Take it from me, I used to drive one
Had to quit the night I caught a live one
But now I travel at my own pace
Like to feel the bass up around my waist
Just like a seat belt, kinda keepin me strapped in

Step to her, get the digits, and my day is complete

Or hawkin too hard like you just got back from the joint

Not so long ago it was til the end
We played outside in the pouring rain
On our way up the road we started over again

You're livin our dream oh you on top
My mind is achin,' Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens livin life by the drop

Up and down the road in our worn down shoes
Talkin about good things and singin the blues
You went your way and I stayed behind
We both knew it was just a matter of time

Doyle Lawson,"There's a little mountain church in my thoughts of yesterday
Where friends and family gathered for the Lord
Where an ol' fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow  way
For what few coins, the congregation could afford

Dressed in all our Sunday best, we sat on pews of solid oak
And I remember how our voices filled the air
How mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there

Looking back now that little mountain church house
Has become my life's cornerstone
It was there, in that little mountain church house
I first heard the words, I based my life upon

At the all day, Sunday singing, with dinner on the  ground
Many were the souls that were revived
While the bothers and the sisters who've gone on to Gloryland
Slept in  peace in the maple grove nearby

Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver,"She came to me said she knew me
Said she'd known me a long time
And she talked of being in love
With every mountain she had climbed

And she talked of trails she'd walked up
Far above the timberline
From that night on I knew I'd write songs
For Carolina in the pines.

There's a full moon on the fourteenth
First quarter twenty-first
And a full moon in the last week
Brings a fullness to the earth.

There's no guess work in the clockwork
Of the world's heart or mine
There are nights I only feel right
With Carolina in the pines.

As the frost grows on the windows
The wood stove smokes and glows
As the fire glows we can warm our souls
Makin' rainbows in the coals.

And we talk of trails we walk up
Far above the timberline
There are nights I only feel right
With Carolina in the pines.

But now it's over, it's so over

Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver,"Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.


I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.


""Let not your heart be troubled,"" His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears;
Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.


I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.


Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm free,

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

She turned on the fire alarm

Coming to Sweden now causin' a hysteria
Takes a long time to travel the globe, so why be shy?
Why be humble? I just came straight out the jungle
You can't compete with me 'cause you know I got the rhythm

I did it before and I'll do it again, so listen watcha say
Yeah hear my point of view
Not everyone can do this
In fact only a few sophisticated, hardcreated
That's who I am, and you knowI've been waiting
So start pumping make some noise

The Mandika tribe, the Hausa tribe
The Fulani tribe, the Gooya tribe, the Zulu tribe
Mi no live in a house mi live in a tree

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'

I'm calling on the big guys from the pyramid top
To join the bits and pieces of our Fatherland Africa
'Cause without boundaries we can move the mountains
Drop your personal individual ambitions
Chase the devil off and purify our Fatherland

Afrikan people, crawl from your vultures
Stand affirm 'cause you are the aura of the mankind
You are the dreams, you are the hope, you are the future
You are the past, you are the grandfather of civilization
That is why A N see wants old dogs to sit

The impossible just takes a little longer
Out of this world and inta another world
The earth is spinning round and there's so much to discover
The African man seems to be everywhere
If there are people in the world
Who knows that right is never wrong
Stop the fire burning in my home Africa

Martin Luther King, Mandela you had a dream
Self evidence and a quality for men
Africa for me and Africa far you de Klerk
It doesn't really matter whether a cat is black or white
What really matter is to catch the mouse
I'd rather do it in an African way
Hello Africa tell me you you're doin'

Mmm, jumping on the mike, it 'cause me a rockin' up affection
When I'm holdin' me a mike, it 'cause me awesome affections
What you say to me, me a fun and me warm
Spend some me a time on the Tresittia dime
Don't you try to follow me you ought to realize what me are
What me a really want, me not fly
No I am just coolin', come on now just set it off

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'

I have been mourning, I have been grieving
I have been crying, no more tears in my eyes
There's a hottie, hottie wind blowing south to north
Following my head, drying all my plants
If there's a mercy in the clouds
You know right is never wrong

Move the sadist off my back
And stop the fire burning in my home Africa
Here comes the news from the mighty Lord
Transqualation is about to come to Earth
Right, rapping is digging down river, north to south
To let milk and honey flow side to side

My name is Alban, mi is a dentist, mi DJ here, mi DJ there
Mi have a shop on Slojdgatan, Alphabet St. is da name

Man your life is Chuck E. Cheese, mine is a pizzeria

How many pies I done flipped? I lost count
How many guys I done gave shit? I lost count
Holding but I can't ignore cheating
Any day your life could be the hot topic at that board meeting

They discussing who'll stretch you for your trees
For your thievery, you living, you breathing for no fucking reason
That's how it is when you make a man
That's why your man's gotta learn to make himself then you shake his hand

Man, I'm into catching heavy clams
And when Dezzy can us when it comes to dumping I got heavy hands
Ain't gonna be right for your picking jet
This is ours, the square is where we eat, this our kitchenette

Ain't nothing sweet living in this ghetto
(Ain't nothing sweet about it)
Been there, done that, running in the streets
(Running wild)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

Trying to make the most of my hustle
(I gotta hustle)
Been there, done that, so I can live out all my dreams
(Live out my dreams)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

I let my temper hit the floor
I be staring through the mirror as I serenade my halls
I'm fond of the juices that marinate they drawers
My shorty, she bank a carrot with the four 'cause

If you take us out, the streets will evolve
Some niggaz they live to eat, some niggaz eat to survive
And my conscience keep disturbing me, fucking with my energy
Niggaz that I thought was friends, really the enemy

Dear Lord, please grant me the serenity
To accept the things that I cannot change
Locked up for eight years and ain't join no gangs
Been converted to true nigga, I'm as real as they come

And any moment I have you staring the barrel of my gun
Put my dick up in the streets but I'm married to the slums
Put the chips up in the ante and tally up the sum
I'm having fun, hitting the fiends in the allies with some jums

Ain't nothing sweet living in this ghetto
(Ain't nothing sweet about it)
Been there, done that, running in the streets
(I'm running young, wild and free)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

Trying to make the most of my hustle
(I'm trying to make the most of my hustle)
Been there, done that, so I can live out all my dreams
(Live out my dreams, live out my dreams)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

Alright, yeah but in choosing life, you got choices
(Oh yeah)
The jungle is full of everything
It's the mother and the father of creation
(Ain't nothing sweet about it)
But listen up, you have to choose something for yourself
Do something for yourself, make something of yourself

That's what time it is
(Don't let go)
Go strong, be strong, stand for something in life
(All my young soldiers)
Yeah, concrete jungle, I can feel it, I can smell it
(Sometimes it gets hard)
Jim Jones is spitting truth, the power
(Don't let 'em pull your car over)
Now and forever more
Making life the way it should be

Ain't nothing sweet about it
Make me want to scream and shout it
But I know I got to hold on and just roll on

Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975 never thought I'd make it this far
Still battling in this racial war
Trying to find solutions to the situation I'm facing
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing
Letting my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge
Like dropping books lets stop the crooks
From robbing you of your brains and such using welfare as a crutch

Hope that when I'm gone y'all remember this

We don't understand
Why poor people keep struggling
But you don't lend a helping hand

Matthew 5:5 say,
The meek shall inherit the earth
We wanna be down that way
But you been tripping since the day of you're birth

Who said that to kill is a sin
Then started every single war
That you're people been in?
Who said that water
Is a precious commodity
Then dropped a big old black oil slick
In the deep blue sea?

Who told me, Mr. Man
That working round the clock
Would buy me a big house in the 'hood
With cigarette ads on every block

Who told me Mr. Man
That I got a right to moan?
How 'bout this big ol' hole in the ozone?

What's wrong with the world today
Things just got to get better
Dear Mr. Man, we don't understand
Maybe we should write a letter

Listen, ain't no sense in voting
Same song with a different name
Might not be in the back of the bus
But it sho' feel just the same
Ain't nothin' fair about welfare
Ain't no assistance in AIDS
Ain't nothing affirmative about you're actions

Dr. Cornel West,"I used to think I hated this place
Couldn't wait to tell the president straight to his face
But lately I changed, nowadays I embrace it all
Beautiful ideals and amazing flaws
Got to care enough to give a testament
'Bout the deeply depressing mess we're in
It's home so we better make the best of it
I wanna make this country what it says it is
Still dream in the vividest living colour
No matter how many times my love been smothered
Who's ever above us won't just let us suffer
All of this struggling got to amount to something
This is a letter to my countrymen
Especially those my age and younger than
We're up against an ugly trend
Everybody's hustling don't nobody touch their friends
No group singing and dancing
No anthem nobody holds hands, and
Instead they give a hand held
And make you shoulder life's burden by your damn self
One thing that can't be debated
Power never changed on it's own you got to make it
That's why community is so sacred
That's the symbol that we make when we raise fists

[Chorus: x2]
Sooner or later

We don't really like to talk about the race thing
The whole grandparents used to own slaves thing
Pat ourselves on the back in February
Looking at pictures of Abe Lincoln and the great King
But the real picture's much more embarrassing
We're still not even close to really sharing things
The situation of oppressed people
Shows what we feel it means to be a human being
What does it mean to be American?
I think the struggle to free is our inheritance
And if we say it how it really is
We know our lily skin still give us privilege
Advantages given to the few
That are built into the roots of our biggest institutions
That's the truth in life we got to choose
Do I fight in the movement or think I'm entitled to it
This is not a practice life
This is the big game we got to attack it right
Each one of us is headed for the grave
This old crooked world won't be saved by the passive type
This is a letter to my countrymen
Not from a Democrat or a Republican
But one among you that's why you call me brother
Ain't scared to tell you we're in trouble 'cause I love you

[Chorus: x2]

They tell me I'm a dreamer, they ridicule
They feel defeated, old, bitter, and cynical
Excuse me but I see it from a different view
I still believe in what a driven few could really do
I know that the masses want to sleep
And they would just rather hear me rapping to the beat
But I want to pass this planet to my son
A little better than it was when they handed it to me
So I wrote a letter to my countrymen
I'll be happy if it only reaches one of them
Reporting live A-L-I, your brother
Mourning in America, dreaming in colour

My dear Brother Ali,
I think you know deep down in your soul that
Something, something just ain't right.
You don't want to be just well adjusted to injustice
And well adapted to indifference. You want to be
A person with integrity who leaves a mark on the world.
People can say when you go that you left the world
Just a little better than you found it. I understand. I want
To be like that too.",Letter to My Countrymen,2012

That got you through the cloudy days,
When the stars ain't shinin' bright,
You feel like you've lost you're way,
When those candle lights of home,
Burn so very far away,
Well you got to let your soul shine,

It's better than moonshine,

Gonna make it on my own.

Make him feel so alone.

Blowin' through my achin' bones,

It's better than moonshine,
Damn sure better than rain.
Yeah now people don't mind,

Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness,
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul.
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this.
And when your world seems cold, you got to let your spirit take control.

It's better than sunshine,
It's better than moonshine,
Damn sure better than rain.

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash, they did the monster mash

Dr. Demento,"While I was walkin' down the beach one bright and sunny day
I saw a great big wooden box a-floatin' in the bay
I pulled it in and opened it up and much to my surprise
Oh, I discovered a (Boom-ba-boom), right before my eyes
Oh, I discovered a (Boom-ba-boom), right before my eyes

I picked it up and ran to town as happy as a king
I took it to a guy I knew who'd buy most anything
But this is what he hollered at me as I walked in his shop
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), before I call a cop""
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), before I call a cop""

I turned around and got right out, a-runnin' for my life
And then I took it home with me to give it to my wife

I wandered all around the town until I chanced to meet
A hobo who was lookin' for a handout on the street
He said he'd take most any old thing, he was a desperate man
But when I showed him the (Boom-ba-boom), he turned around and ran
Oh, when I showed him the (Boom-ba-boom), he turned around and ran

I wandered on for many years a victim of my fate
Until one day I came upon St. Peter at the gate
And when I tried to take it inside he told me where to go
Get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and take it down below
Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and take it down below

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

Dr. Dog,"When I was young, yeah I was young one time, we’ve all been young.
But, this one time when I was young my buddy gave me a tape. And it freaked me out.
I didn’t know what to do. It was like TNT. I was in my brother’s room.

And another time, different house, different song,
different friend, different band, he had real long hair,
pulled the record out, put the needle on and freaked me out.
I’d never done drugs. I barely brushed my teeth.
But I was on the floor all glassy eyed fucked up beyond belief.

Who’da known, who’da known, who’da known, who’da known
That it would be rock and roll
That would terrify and eat me
That would haunt me so completely

Yeah you were there, summer-time, young love, halcyon days, elysian fields,
Marlboro reds, white car, blue eyes, cd in, cd in, cd in, a cd in a car stereo and it freaked me out.
What he said about love. You were right there, I don’t know where I was.

How much do I owe my uncle? I suspect it’s more than I can pay.
He gave us a tascam, some maxells, a shure 57 and a stereo delay and we freaked me out.

I'm sure to get ejected
But for Christmas I can seem to summon

Because what is there to hate?
I mean it's really so subjective!

I hate puppy dogs and kittens, 
I hate flowers in the Spring!

Apartment 223 with body parts under my bed 
cut your abdomen out stab your fuckin leather coat
I chant while candles burn with robes on 
You will learn 
Christian no Hebrew on the the balcony I see you 
The devils coffin with corpse of course 
In a mental state earthquake
Schitzophrenic eatin' Campbells soup 
Takin a piss urinalysis test 
I hope you wear a fuckin bullet proof vest
Just purchased the charter arms .38
Then you entered the confetti hell gate 
On the pee(?) floor bloody towels on sculptures
Machine gun suitcases, for all you niggaz with 2 faces
Mass murder, should have been in San Quentin
I'm doin'life to ten, when I come home you goddamn 
right I'm goin back again
Fuck the drinks on the table
While you sleep I take pictures of bullets in your navel
Open your face and pour milk in your forehead 
Count the bodies, that's four dead
Look behind your fuckin' back
With the drill bit in your ass crack, EXTREME PRESSURE
Teach you a lesson 
Fuck your confession of evil I march with black sheep on the Sunset streets  
With hoods like Dracula
I walk in back of ya 
Draggin you stomach parts to McDonalds 
Drink Absolut bottles and bottles, while you tryin' 
to fuck with the most exotic models

As you see the sign, beware of animals 
A fuckin wild habitat
My living room is the wilderness with spots on 
my carpet
practicing my gun targets 
Virtual reality is a rough end to yor career 
set you on fire in a leather chair 
Using charcoal to broil 
Rap you jealous eyeballs in aluminum foil
Wearin' Masses(masks) on the telephone talkin to 
your black asses, with stocking caps I reach
I'm takin'your ass in a rented van to Venice Beach
In a cardboard box 
Beatin' down your knees with a bag of Master locks
Police can't hear you with a dead body tied near you
It's hot, I 'm drinkin' soda with a tech-9 sprayin'
your fan belt motor
Stop the bullshit, blast you hands of the hood
I pull quick 
Video tape you in a puddle of blood with razors in 
your dick
With an extra clip I move your torso
Spit on you hips 
With Mac-11 vice grips, surgery is major
With my sneakers stompin' on your pager
With my cup of Maxwell coffee, I like niggas whose
bossy
Fuck the critics I press your back 
Steam burn through your straight leg jeans 
Soakin your bones out in the washing machine, with
tide soap in the laundromat you witness the killing
Your man got scared called Riverdale with a baseball
hat, took a cab to Hawthorne 
I know where he's goin' 
You can't hide in an empty apartment with a matress
and no protection, with a New York psycho
Bombshells in the Hollywood section
I'm pressin bells and bells and bells till you fuckin 
let me in 

[Chorus]

Follow you on tour like a haunted nightmare
Kickin' in your intestines like Rick Flair
Standin' by the Mobil gas station with a flamethrower
and a fuckin lawnmower, throwin big lighters at your fuel tank
I smash your face in the elestric window, piss on 
your fenders
With my ubbrella up like the Avengers
Plead guily in court bring glocks through security
x-reays going for the worlds record
Shut the fuck up about music, I'm playin' checkers 
with blood Polo shirts
Lookin' at the fireworks 
on the dirty ass terrace
Bones in 'fridgerators spring water and lettuce
Fuck it if your jealous 
Gather crackers with flowers around 'em
Keep you eyes around 'em 
Buck dishes, dial your ambulance I'm on a mission 
Open up your shin guards in tinfoil
Warmin' my bread and Saurkraut while your legs boil 
Ketchup and Mustard, Fuck voodoo
Paint on my face lookin off my roof like Shaka Zulu
Surroundin you area for the biggest mass hysteria
Muhammed don't (he mad?)
While you motherfuckers eat pork I taste real humans

Dr. Dooom,"Yo, I bought that album man, it's wack man
I'm tellin you, I don't like it
I'ma be honest man
Honest?
I'm dead up, I'm serious
Serious?
I don't feel it man, the drums are too weak
I don't feel the snares
Coulda used a different type of sample
You're wack man, yeah..

Yo, that kid is wack, his father's wack
His group is wack, that's word word black
I'm detrimental, I hop up on this instrumental
Smack your face with mitts, a pile of grease filled with grits
Burn you like Teddy Pendergrass, tap you on that ass
I'm Big Jim, shut your mouth, call me Jimmy Steel
Don't freestyle, Chemical Bank, y'all keep it real
On Lollapalooza, their butts packed with German Lugers
On tour dates, stashin mad work in milk crates
Rock groups get smacked, speakers dropped, on they back
Some damage I'm raw, kid the blood is on your kneecaps
Let's get scuffed up, your castle more than roughed up
Pockets with royalties, you gets, no loyalties
That's word bill, sell your house's mortgage off the hill
I'm for real necks, payin crackers for my Ampex
Yeah!

It's the brother feelin fly (brothers feelin fly)

You got commercial records, no monies in your wack pockets
You get jerked, my Master-charge-Card's doin work
Eight thousand grills, all these Franklin heads, big head bills
You go 'head wrap balogna sandwich in yo' backpack
School kids up no joke on record labels, y'all still broke
Don't flex at me, who's this kid, standin next to me
I got versatile sawed-off shotgun WIC checks with me
Suckers I'm android, no time to feel paranoid
Blow out your face, pull your skull back, now give me space
My wig is ready, disguised, ridin on the subway
Baldhead on 42nd Street, down on Broadway
With Tony Lou, out of prison, my crew from Rahway
That's word Lou, I'm in New York, I'm here to see you
Cut back your weak tracks, and vomit on your vinyl wax
I'm here, like gladiator, air-conditioned central
You smokin embalmin fluid, elephants are mental
I got dreams to wear your parts off your cash machine
That's in the window me with bags, in the Wells Fargo
Changin your incite, I'm high class, with appetite
You no comp, for roast pigs, I delete
Your style is neckbone, my cab rides by your street
Yeah!

I twist the bums out the project, elevator lights is out
Y'all wanna step to Phi B, big like the Boulder family
Holdin your ear, like you handicapped, you can't hear
Touch up your young style delivery, don't appeal
Follow through, instructions easy for your rap crew
That's word, that kid you rapped, sound like BooBoo
Stinky feet, with razor bumps, tryin to rap on beat
I cut your fog lamp down like meat, cut, by the pound
Heather B, step to me, with your thin sound
Twist your knobs, your engineer, mixed like Baskin-Rob's
You on the charts, with just enough to Pop Tarts
Publishin checks you signed off, you gets no respect
You gets to lease the Benz, cryin loud with your WIC check
No sale retail, deposit all direct sales
Yeah! Check it

Jacky you keep them rollers in your hair
With that plastic on your head huh?
Man, hey Keith who did your jheri curls man? They look good
I seen y'all this morning on Cops man

They had y'all pictures, all your profiles and everything
Y'all should stay low... Gene called
He need five dollars

Ultimate focus behind your neck kid
We flex with tecs on your lyrical index
Stop the masses, rotate the fastest
Afro jheri curl world, get ignited

Reinvited on your Main Sources like the enforcers
Submachines spray your Liberace pianoes
Freestyle ambulances, bring out your new dancers
While why'all can't rap, we took your Ampex

We have protective custody
Got your face disgustin me - with animal like instincts
I left a dead gorilla in a skating rink
Penetrate your Gap jeans with Black & Decker machines

Alternate your skullies, catch dead rats in Saran Wrap
Put used diapers on your windshield wipers
Make you eat your own feces, sell you {?}lindrum elyses{?}
Pull out your colon, leave your gland swollen

Uncircumcised between your mom's thighs
That's right, with a face like Michael Myers
I clip the ears off your bodyguards with bloody pliers
Bound to eat a German shepherd in the Mojabe desert

While y'all talk gangster, I push body parts in shopping carts
Leave wigs on streets on Melrose so coroners can smell those
Arms for three days, with three legs in the backseat
Y'all get the back heat - with the police department

Scared to look in my apartment
Three weeks ago I dumped a bag of legs with beer kegs
Went to Rouse and bought a six-pack and some eggs
Seen my face in the paper with a beard, went home and shaved

Took out your bodies in the pickup truck, back to the grave
Drinkin' Yoohoo's and donuts, y'all punks think I'm so nuts
Walkin' in hospital rooms like the black Dr. Dooom
Push you in the wheelchair, out the window

Down the steps like Ironside, you run and hide
Handicapped with no maps, I'm after you, throw gas at you

Projects call the cops

The FBI got our fingerprints, heavy big weights
We move to alternate states (the projects call the cops)
The FBI got our fingerprints, heavy big weights
We move to alternate states (the projects call the cops)
The FBI got our fingerprints, heavy big weights
We move to alternate states (the projects call the cops)

A bag of penises with twenty butt plugs
Persian rugs, with dead bodies on it
Call Columbo, who done it solve it, and I'll revolve it

And hold it, to the wolves, to the hawks, to the dogs
Vagina with bugs rubs cubs, getting fellatio
Way {?} fo' sho, positive why die live
Comatose tomato juice and cherry hose and toast

Santa Anna, Barbara at the Barberry coast, most
Chicks licks black holes, village exposed
Wastin my children on her clothes
Some went up her nose, suppose

I penetrated your neck with a Bic pen
With a belt around my waist like book me
Don't ask my neighbors, bodies dead, 69 flavors
Behavior's, smokin glass with coleslaw hangin out your ass

Take a blast, I'm travellin fast, past
A nymphomaniac, diggin up corpse, I'm a necrophiliac
Gettin my chick back, hittin up smack
Had that head bobbin, joggin, cyclin, recycling

Conniving, arrive in hearse drivin it's even
Seven heads ten horns believe in, evil demon
Ask {?} Steven, retreatin, you're beaten, eaten
Dead puss, sardine can smell from here to Hell

Blowin a harmonica, yo in Santa Monica in a Honda

Number one MC in the world, a.k.a. Dr. Dooom
Straight out of solitary
I got the block locked down
Transfer me to conquer in the Pelican Bay
You don't want to step in my cell
I eat your ass for real
Even veterans go out with tight pants and lipstick

Most rappers flex up, they vexed up, they actin hard
Attendin Catholic school at mom's house, they soft as lard
They roll in packs, carryin yo-yo's, and balls and jacks
That kid you peeped it, his boys wearin Victoria's Secret
Mean mugs get crushed up, your bra's showin, pickin dust up
You light your trees up, I'm just the man to skin yo' knees up
Walk behind you, tuck your stomach in, I redesign you
Urgent emergency, your girl is cryin, they can't find you
I move with bowling ball bags, you try to ask for Zig-Zags
You got your panties on with wigs on, why'all playin tag
Walkin in tough kid, your girdle's showin, watch your doo-rag
G-strings get touched, watch your skid marks like Starsky and Hutch
why'all scope erections, while rappers run to different sections
I ride in limos pull your thongs in, from here to Wisconsin
Droppin this A-bomb make, tough MC's, put on Avon
Eject your wigs in Hunts Point, your pumps in truckers rigs

	I'm the man of the hour
	Watchin girls takin a shower
I run rap, tell MC's to watch their back

Rappers with panty-liners, rent cars, with no recliners
I get ill, serve the best MC's with Massengil
While crowds chill, take your haltertops, down to Big Bill
Right on your mic stand, your flower shorts, you've been hurt
Male with a dildo, your ass is low, call policemen
Three million rappers on labels, sportin skirts release men
I teach men, pull my pants down, piss on each men
Frustrate the rectums on the night flight, I cruise on East and
look at your contracts, while Vaseline, smears your buttcrack
I counteract tracks, while you ate rhymes smokin crack
Skinny kid two pounds, with phony legs, bustin two rounds
That man is slinky, jacks off, and rappers host his Twinkie
Underarm smell, keep the mics warm, why'all shirts is stinky
Panties look great on you with wedding rings around your pinkie
Now stop BS then cut your weight down, you'd be like Vester
Facin your whole crew, with cardinals on like Uncle Fester
Lo-lo-lo-Lopez, your moms call me Frankie Sanchez
On deck with penis out, pine tar like Tony Perez
Big battin average, send your girlfriend out, tossin salad
I run rap, tell MC's to watch their back

Chorus
[Dr. Dooom]
Rappers get maxi-pads and O.B., their time of the month
No time for phone calls from tough guys, why'all puff them blunts
Some serious stretch marks, cock-diesel MC's end up pregnant
Nine months in time stuck, you rhyme, grabbin inmates jock
Sportin your white dress, with Timberlands, you try to impress
Petrol with bulletproof vest, your man is havin incest
Knock up your celldon, your big group, they roll with Alvin
Drag queen on Front Street, program, all your SP-12 beats
why'all roll up dust, smokin PCP, I come with big heat
why'all run why'all knowledge down, send your Rolex down to Big Pete
Lipstick is smeared on, your Pele shirt, get your fear on
Hard rappers with stockings and tunafish, smell like Starkist
I call him Miss, rappers tampons, I bought it for Christmas
I call you Anna make you sniff balls, back to Atlanta
Change all your grammar and have you call home, bleedin to Grandma
I run rap, tell MC's to watch their back

Now it's time to hurt your feelings as I upsets music industry fan
Hey yo my man, look at my hand, they look human right?
You think I'm a monster, ill circus clown
Not a specimen, don't look at me funny when I come around
A&R been tryin to figure me out for years
Tryin to re-duplicate me but they can't so they hate me
While white boys run the head of black music with a Japanese assistant
What does a Chinese kid know about the rap game? That's a shame
As I see and watch on BET
There's a million uncreative rappers tryin to be me
I'm startin to feel like Jimi Hendrix
When they covered the story who started rock
Magazines put blankets over my interviews
They don't want to see me on channel 7 news, tellin the truth
Off the project roof, they always have secret spies with eyes
Watchin me recordin my album, send in producers with wack tracks
And DAT's, messin up my whole format
Can you imagine somethin on the kneeboard with Con-Funk-Shun?
With an alternative hippie kid from the record label watchin your back
Talkin about, ""Mariah Carey's funky,""
Makin the average group buckdance like a barrel full of monkies
While I break out to shoppin mall he's makin a quick phone call
About my sound is too new and different
I need to be regular like Dru Hill and a little more ill

I don't want to meet Insane Clown Posse and collaborate
I'm tryin to innovate and think quick at a fast rate
Why you mad cause I'm original - you can't do the material
When I sit back and watch you act big
Spend your budget on your video
I'm in one of my three luxury apartments eatin Raisin Bran cereal
While you front low, I take my bike ride down to Wells Fargo
How long is it gon' take, nine-hundred-thousand in clear
Takin with a clear, I don't need a Benz this year
Took care of my paperwork
Takin United Taxi out to Vegas
While the average R&B group is doin a promo concert
Ignorin your phone calls from broke labels
Who try to put out underground MC's
Tryin to get me to rap on a wack jazz track for one G
How dare you try to insult me?
I got 40 grand for three minutes to write a song with Prodigy
Other crews don't get budget, got the nerve to call me
Welcome to the business, stand as a witness
Work on your stomach, do physical fitness
I ain't playin, all this African stuff all look the same
I don't need a Joey Neckbone puttin his artwork on my CD
Drawin Apple Jacks and Honeycomb with me sittin on the throne
No I'm takin a regular picture by the hotel St. Bonaventure
Besides I do wear a coat in the winter

Why don't you wear it?! Put on some wings like a PARROT

Why are you hypin up a normal female group with fat cellulite
That sound wack? Most of why'all goin out like Uncle Tom's
Like Louis Armstrong
Wearin a tattoo and goin onstage like Tracy Chapman
I cancelled a big tour cause I was prepared
Why'all on the road with per diem money and why'all scared
While why'all walk and look hard
Your manager got his name all over your Versatile card
And plus this video treatment sucks
The fish lens effects, the lens to the camera only cost a hundred bucks
Look at the director, tryin to tell me what to do
I done this before, 14 degrees freezin cold
Doin _Poppa Large_ with a cage on my head, that's dead
Don't get your imagination too messed up
I'm wearin a Yankee hat and a Starter I'm not dressin up
How you gonna tell me what to wear?!
I don't need mascara and a stylist
Save that for a big rock group like Pantera
Experience, Next Plateau, Mercury, Wild Pitch, EMI, Capitol, DreamWorks
Never got dropped
Put my lyrics away and stopped
Too many people with hands in my projects
Havin fantasies of me bein Superman you bein stupid man
I'm like Prince, you might see me once every five years
At the record company
While most of why'all live at the label
Beggin for your rent and car notes to be paid
Under the table, doin routine dances for advances

Harass you to move
Leaving poisoned rat cole slaw around your toilet stool 
While you scream fuck you

In a station wagon with hot beans
Taking a coffee break back in the house
Giving your Chihuahuas
Ex-lax with a hot bowl of Quaker State
Leaving the front room
Dropping bombs on your fur coat with a box, ka-boom
Watching the Mets putting shit on your TV sets
In the shower
You won't be able to watch a program with remote controls
For seventy hours check out your sore ribs
The screen is gritty
Everybody's starting to look green on Rap City
Take your receipt, give your wallet with nine hundred bucks
To a retarded kid in a wheel-chair
Coming up the street
Walking up the main avenue
I'm passing you 
With a leather coat that looks similar to yours
Fuck you
You looking at me
I'm a start walking behind you
Act like I'm pantomiming you
Talking to police men
Chewing a arm
And joined by a black and white squad car
With binoculars watching you very far

Your Rolex gone, my project's on your airplane flights
First time you check out, baggage claim will throw your neck out

Cut off your bodyguards, fast start with razor scars
Come grab the sub machines, Joe step to seminars
Niggas with diamonds, armed crack heads, clock y'all rhymin
Take your girl's necklace, stare at the cops, lookin' reckless

Ass on the corner, think you safe workin' at warner brothers?
Polygram building heard some shots, they want me to chill then
Security ran, Russell Simmons saw me in a black van
I ran the tight intersection, and caught a big erection

Spinnin' on 3rd, lexington, through the fuckin' red
I'm in manhattan, naked wigs, on my fuckin' head
Streets full of traffic, drive on sidewalks, that's my habits

[Chorus]
Mental case, mental case
(Man, he be likin' campbell's soup, apple jacks
double XL diapers)
Mental case, mental case
(Chocolate milk, porno films
Flintstone tablets}
Mental case, mental case
(Roscoe waffles and make them extra soft oh-kay?)
(Roscoe waffles... and make them extra soft dude!)

[Dr. dooom]
Your style is bitch kid, you fucked up, sound like a woman
I'm not impressed when you sport mics and touch your breast
You trans vest with small flows, you can't, proper digest
You open mic stands, you catch one, with sperm in your hand

I leave you thinkin' in your hotels, with pussy stinkin'
Massengil thrills flow through new york, to Hollywood hills
Your male flow, I'm wipin' ass cracks like mop-n-glo
Mc's get inserts, thrash style selectin' bad words

Move with your silk suits, I stomp your mics with combat boots
Make up your rap that's feeble, small you think it's major
I pull your rectum out, erase your girl, off my pager
International feedback, I make you twist your knee back

I got your crew on camcorders, tryin' to rhyme in teaback's
Garter belts on dj's, sportin' tryin' to spin on felts
I see that rugged kid comin' through, gimme that screwface
He's wearin' girdles, your back-up man, sportin' pink lace

... hey man you better watch your back up in here man
They rapin little boys!

[Chorus]

[Dr. dooom]
I stop your intro, move your mic at your birthday party
Your group set up, takin' turns, y'all shut the fuck up
Walk, grab your nuts, leave the kangol's and scratch your butts
Stage shows get messed up, you're hardcore, zippin your dress up

Move on your projects, new shit, that's how I do shit
Word up g, y'all niggas sound puss, lick my pee-pee veteran nasty
Don't even try to fuckin' ask me, fax you my phone number
I beat you down with steel cans and wood lumber

Open your face up, dress you with makeup
Have your bitch-made, makin' cool-aid with your ass out
In a glass house, where convicts wear big dicks
Strong niggas, got your assholes in the mix
You need protection for that tight infection

Chewin alligator meat live cow steak
Sittin on old newspapers by the kitchen sink
You think I'm off limits driving a 74 dodge Plymouth
Up the street with human feet colored apple-green
With spots eatin blueberry pop tarts
With the eighth body in my trunk my elbow bleeds with lumps
Walkin from the sanitation dump with rotten skulls
On my waterbed with miller beer kegs
Blood in my cabinet, ears in my closet
Watchin the raptors play the houston rockets
With your arms in the freezer I grab a icicle
Puttin fingerprints on my bicycle
Walkin up to have a drink at the club ?there is? three Irish chicks
Lookin at me like I'm sick
Walkin by chin-chins I stole the keys from ya friends
Lookin out ya madrion hotel window like Elvis Presley
Coming down the elevator
Good evening mister excuse me pardon me with body parts
And credit cards walkin down sunset boulevard past the red light
I threw a rat with mayonnaise at ya head lights
Four blonde girls screamed and put on their hi-beams
I fake like I'm ?vomiting smoking sick? threw acid on their stomachs
And drove of with a wig down la brea listen to a tape by slayer
Parked in a parking lot behind burger king
Eatin a raw pack of chicken wings
With blood on my fingers I blast a CD by the staple singers
The cops told me to turn it down,
They like my shoes from buster brown
I went up the block an bought some incense
For the wrong smells in the air conditioner vents
Hey kid need twenty cents havin a cook-out with my neighbor
How ya like the meat flavor mmmm

In veins impedes the brain hijackin planes
Pull a kotex out of Louis Lane
Explain the sky rain
Cadillacs and dead bitches consort with witches
Twenty-five sistas pussies with blisters we burn'em in rivers
Saviors of pimps and concubines
Have you ever asked yourself will you fuck Marilyn Manson
Or become Charlie Manson death wish
Or become Charles Bronson

You motherfuckers oughta let me go and finish this motherfuckin album
Dr. Dooom..
Name of this track is called ""I Don't Want the Motherfuckin Chorus""
Whatever all the arrangements are we gon' go through
Fuck all the laws..

What the fuck was in your mind when you rapped on that track?
Who possessed you to do that? Who programmed - that shit sound wack
Unplug your mic
You motherfuckers rap under a bunch of fuckin hype
Programmed by the company, makin somethin cheap
Vocals sound like a nigga with no dough and a promo;
makin asses out of yourselves, tryin to rap solo
Suck my dick when you see me; avoid because you want to be me
why'all niggaz write like slouches puffin blunts on studio couches
What's up you fuckin amateur?
Your engineer'll cue in your bullshit cadence
That shit sounds simple; look at this nigga rhymin to hisself
Wack as fuck, smell like shit for one buck
Big crews don't want it -- why'all get it worse
Which one of why'all motherfuckers is waitin for the mic first?
I hope your bitch is in the audience
Your wife too, that's your fanbase -- plus your DJ's in the place
I'm about to boo you, let it be fair; when you come off-stage
ninety percent of the people that came on your guest list
ain't gon' be there
A big dissapointment when I rub your asshole with a verbal ointment
Rappers actin hard, nervous in the dressin room
with a security guard
Groupies standin round with they fuckin face frowned
Lookin like fuckin Homey the Clown
Put that Spring Water down man, you ain't sweatin
You motherfuckers did a ten minute weak show and you jettin;
your fans are mad - your performance was garbage bag
Look at these videotapes
Walkin back and forth grabbin your nuts like the Planet of the Apes
Supervise it, criticize it, why'all don't realize it
where the real guys at
Who's administrating your budget when you takin 
that high picture for Right On with your ballroom light on
You know the night is kind of special like Lowenbrau
when I escort you to your car, you breakout bastards
Leave the premises and reminisce on your rookie season after you first started
You try to work hard and you never paid no dues like Cold Crush and Afrika Bambaata
You wack nigga, tryin to act large in the video in Nevada
You fuckin pink maggot; I'll take your mic, you can't have it
You niggaz be runnin around with ears open like fuckin bunny rabbits

That's right, Dr. Dooom
All you motherfuckers around the world sittin in studios with your boys
Hypin your shit up
Motherfuckers don't want to tell you that your shit is wack
because they all yes men
Sittin around, carryin your roadie cases
Bein your fuckin cheerleaders
I'ma tell you straight, look in the fuckin mirror, you wack
That shit don't sound right, your mixdown ain't right
Your vocals are too low.. your fuckin cadence is off

And they act like they livin' lavish

Two-thousand extreme with space chandeliers
I mean rugs, I mean just everything all over the carpet
With updated nineteen seventy-five music playing
I'm pulling all your programs
That's right, all you materialistic robots prepare

Yo, I seen ya girl last night, flat butt is wack, skinny hips
Bald head, weave with the ashy lips
Wig in the back seat with pay-less shoes on her feet
Dirty Jeans with mildew spots in the washing machine

Roommates with no place, babies crying, pissy pampers
Roaches and flies, funky panties hanging out the hamper
Three big head boys but one's got to go to school
Her youngest daughter hair braided, lookin' like a fool

Empty refrigerator, family chew up now an laters
No TV, just me there and I'm the MC
No gas, electric work, the house smell make my head hurt
Spots on the carpet, station wagon at the supermarket
With stamps on deck, with beads around this girl's neck
I crack a forty ounce, watch the ants, mouses bounces

Yeah, yeah

I bring the ruckus straight from the side line

I bring the ruckus straight from the side line

Daisy Dukes with stretch marks, her hair back in a bun
Cookin' pork and beans, some stale franks in the sun
Kids ain't listenin', Little Danny's got a hard head
Bugs are crawlin', cables all smell like pee in the bed

Old clothes ain't clean, the bathroom scent is all toes
Athlete's feet, no door mats with water off the street
Spraying the fungus, the living room is humongous
School lunch on the floor, baby vomit atomic

Raviolis with an old bowl of guacamole, Cap'n Crunch
No milk, chase it with some fruit punch
Dish washing liquid, cups of grease
I ain't tryin' to get whipped straightening combs

I think hair is all over the sink, tampons in the garbage can
The house is hot, rent no fan
Air condition is doomed with blunt smoke is in the room
Fix all your nose snot rags, pouring Cheerios

No toilet tissue, baby, wipe your mom left a missile
Acting fly I scoped a monkey with my human eye
Dead up I'm serious, the Meatloaf ain't got me curious
Dry turkey wings on the couch, the cat ate everything
You think you livin', tryin' to dress up like Robin Givens

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I bring the ruckus straight from the side line
The year two-thousand
I bring the ruckus straight from the side line
The year two-thousand

I bring the ruckus straight from the side line
The year two-thousand
I bring the ruckus straight from the side line
The year two-thousand

No bills are paid, just cabinets packed full with Kool-aid
Wonder Bread I throw back, just missed over ya head
Sardines with old shrimp, tuna fish is ludicrous
Idaho potatoes, a bag full of spoilt tomatoes

Neighbors borrow, send the kids over, need sugar
Little Tonika's at the door her face full of boogers
Colt forty-five on the table, a six pack of Miller
Fake Barbecues, honeys walkin' around like gorillas

Stretch marks in action, stomach bumps look like mumps
Popeye's chicken on the stove with the puppy lickin'
Everybody watching black and white tube tonight
No color intentions, plastic bag, hair extensions
I grab a record from Rick, play the Fifth Dimensions

Girl we been through a lot
Every season i used to bug you out on the couch
For different reasons, you thought i was crazy
Catchin a greyhound bus down south
Collectin lightning bugs and bring a dead mouse in the house
Holdin a fortune with a jar of termites
I used to blast the delphonics in a glowing room with black lights
Colt 45 had me sportin a wig like billy dee
I was a melle mel fan, always bumpin run-d.m.c.
We stuck together when one of my parakeets died
You broke down and cried, for the love of animals
I used to always cut the legs off a roach
See if he'll stay there on a piece of tissue
And give him a piece of toast
That morning, he would wake up and be gone
What, the insect had a ambulance?
As a little boy eatin ice cream in the cold project apartment
I used to see rats dance, my aunt used to lay down the poison
And say, ""why'all makin too much noise and..""

Havin em in my billy the kid pants
Allergic to chocolate, chewin oreo's and i couldn't stop it
I remember the days when king vitamin was in the supermarket
cool-aid was syrupy, my mom used to make it real slurpy
Don't believe in santa claus
They had a dope peacoat filled with mothballs
Lint everywhere, with utz chips livin deboinairre
Fly girls with onion rings on the staircase
I had pro keds with lee suits
Always used to stare in your face
Take you on the roof, check out my pigeon coop
Dressed up like dracula

Seem like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stab a track, strangle the beat - Restless, no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grimm
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)

Deep Cover on the incognito tip
Killing motherfuckers if I have to, peeling caps too
Cause you niggas know I'm coming at you
I guess that's part of the game; but I feel for the nigga
Who think he just gonna come and change thangs
With the swiftness, so get it right with the quickness
And let me handle my business, yo
I'm on a mission and my mission won't stop
Until I get the nigga maxing at the top
(I hope you get his ass 'fore he drop)
Kingpin kicking back while his workers slang his rocks
Coming up like a fat rat
Big money, big cars, big bodyguards on his back
So it's difficult to get him
(But I got the hook up with somebody
Who knows how to get in contact with him)
Hit him like this and like that
Let em know that I'm looking for a big fat dope sack
With ends to spend, so let's rush it
If you want to handle it tonight, we'll discuss it
On a nigga's time, and a nigga's place
Take my strap just in case one of his boys recognize my face
Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker
But I gives a fuck; cause I'm going Deep Cover

Yeah, and you don't stop
(Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop)
Yeah, and you don't stop
(Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop)

Creep with me, as I crawl through the hood
Maniac, lunatic, call me Snoop Eastwood
Kicking dust as I bust, fuck peace
And, the motherfuckin punk police
You already know I gives a fuck about a cop
So why in the fuck would you think that it would stop?
Plot, yeah, that's what we's about to do
Take yo' ass on a mission with the boys in blue
Dre (what up Snoop?) Yo, I got the feeling
Tonight's the night like Betty Wright, and I'm chilling
Killing, feeling, no remorse, yeah
So lets go straight to the motherfucking source
And see what we can find
Crooked-ass cops that be getting niggas a gang of time
And now they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me
.. and make my pockets bigger
They want to meet with me tonight at seven o'clock (so what's up nigga?)
What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a uzi, and my motherfuckin twenty-two
So if you wanna blast, nigga we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em then we struck 'em, so fuck 'em!
(""I can feel it!"")

Yeah, and you don't stop
(Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop)
Yeah, and you don't stop
(Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop)

Six-fo'-five was the time on the clock
When me and my homey belled in the parking lot
The scene looked strange and it felt like a set up
(Better not be, cause if it is they getting lit up!)
Oh - here they come from the back in they 'llacs
I'm checking for the Gats they strap, so what's up, black?
(Chill, let's hear the deal
If it ain't up to what you feel then grab your steel)
Right, so, what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with?
Hope you ain't wanting none of my grip
Cause you can save that shit (guess what they told me?)
""We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homey
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush
Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us.""
Hmmm, let me think about it
Turned my back and grabbed my gat
And guess what I told him before I shot it:

I'm letting my Gat pop - cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop!""",Deep Cover,1992

Gots the Dana's on your hooptie and your fly ass bitch
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that hoe
If she proper, I'ma pop her the hole hopper

Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy
Had he not known about the city I'm from
Long Beach, tic tac, grab your gat, watch your back
Here I come, stompin' in my khaki suit
BG from the hood can fuck Eastwood
God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up
On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling
But did you raise up all this nuts?
'Cause Dr. Drizzay's about to rizzip shit up

Chiggie check, microphone check one,
Chiggie check, microphone check two,
Chiggie check, microphone check three

You tuned to the sounds of the D-are-E,
Now check me out, it's back to the old school

So RBX kick this shit

Seven execution style murders
I have no remorse cause I'm the fucking murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped
One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse
Snap! Adapt to this but you need no adapter
This is just the first chapter
In a book from a crook
You get caught slipping yo' ass gots to die
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure?
Trigger? Happy RBX to cap ya
Pop pop and I can't wait to bust a pound
Pop pop my hollow points smacks the clown
'Cause what I said split his head
And now they got me running from the feds
But I refuse to go alive
It's kill or be killed, that's how real niggas survive
I'm high powered!

Yeah!

Hung in a 2 man cell wit my homie Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I'm only 18, so I'm a young buck
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in they chest
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Ugh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs
Getting a rep as a young hog
It ain't nothing like the street life
Betta be strapped wit yo shank, 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots ta do my time

Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility

Now, I'm holding a dove, sitting on swoll
27 years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thing to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G.
The little homies from the hood wit grip
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set-trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what ya want to do
Didn't know we had a 22
Straight sitting behind his back
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I use to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (for what)
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread

Lil' ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility

Something for the real OG's to get wit
Some facts, made our made, now you want to run and play
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamia, gaming them for my homie
No need to be uncalm if you pack right
And learning just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo'
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo'
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip

When I rack up, so all you motherfuckers just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift then forget Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stocking
I'm knocking em out the box 'n'
Knocking em out their sock 'n'
'Cause Robin is rocking
Breaking em down to the slab
Taking em down on their ass
Now what you wanna do? Ya wanna battle, huh?
See ya watch and creak without a motherfucking paddle
Rattle that brain, I'm not that same ol' plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothing more than a grain
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull then pull it!
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and what the fuck
Do what I must and what I must is bust
The bubble or choose some trouble, forty-due's
So stick to my Luger, Lady of Rage is coming through

(Some cool shit, some cool shit)

I fears no one, I makes em cool off like a polar cap
Lynching as I hits, misses the rolling back?
Pushing packs to make a profit
Diggy dope stuck on the topic so stop and gimme my pops, kid
I'm living large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to broke art so the faggots
This young black kid, I'm mercenary, merciless
Murdering mega some niggas so who's first to diss
They say I'm bad so you'll find none worst than this
Chewing motherfuckers up like a Hershey Kiss
Put to sleep, ripping the lyrics I'm leaving
Rough wind flex too complex, wrecks, then I'm peace
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half niggas
Ya quick to talk shit I whip your ass nigga
So watch me blast, nigga, cause I'm the last nigga
Ya wanna fuck wit, so up your cash, nigga
I make stagger, ob' skills and jimmy ragged
Home in and drag her, sit wit ya girl and watch me tag her
Pulling steel like a stunt
Sold like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment up a track on crack
And I'm strapped witta semi-toll milli-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks em off, I breaks em off cheap
Deadly as Jason on Friday The 13th

Back in the days, niggas they use to scrap
But now in '92, niggas they pull they strap
'Cause, umm, police them come wicked and dem shoot
Niggas, so niggas retaliate and start to loot
Execute, boom, stomping black soldier
Here to teach and mould ya
The ennerator, dominator, narrator RB to the motherfucking X
Flex wicked styl-e, bomping be found into greed by a
Maniac with a gat
See nowadays niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
Bop, bop, bop now I'm on Death Row
Fuck it, niggas going wild, every night they shoot
It's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Teflon vest for your chest
Anytime ya step into my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to ya face, no hate, you getting smoked like wood

Number 1 song after number 1 song

I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at

Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit

But truck-tracks, rhymes all day, breaking off niggaz proper,
did dirt, did West cause I clown coppers (yeah).
Do hip-hop, rap, compose 'em most, I couldn't see me,

Serving all (saps), hitting sevens on the (simps),

I flipped the scrip a long time ago, on the five-o,
when I had to scope with this new way to make my cash flow (uhm).
Yes indeedy, I wasn't greedy, got my niggaz out the gutter,
now they're rolling with the Sam Sneezy.
Hip hop fanatic causing static in the industry,
these whack creators, I call 'em imitators (ah yeah).
Been trying to see me, but see I'm unexplainetory,
with the fame and glory, that's why I gotta tell my story.
With no disguise, a lot of niggaz despise,
because I'm on an uprise, so I think you better recognize.

Sam: (Dre)
Well I'm back in the mix with a bottle of hennessy,
so fire up a blunt let's have an end of the sanity.
Crazy shot outs giving pounds to all my niggaz,
hitting all the hookers by the dozen, cause they dig us (trick).
Fuck what you've heard, recognize what you be seeing,
it's time to earn truth to the game human being.
I'm that little bass nigga trying to get mine, fuck a nine,
cause I'll incline with the mastermind.
I got my crew in my corner so I can't loose,
cause I'm paying mad douze in this record biz, I don't snooze.
And suckers be popping at those idiotic egosytible type of flimflam,
I can't be faded Sam-am.
Playing with the hustlers never dealing with the knucklehead bollers,
cause boys play with toys and scholars play with dollars.
I'm a mack of my own right, plus my game is tight,
baby get it right, I ain't the one, so take flight.
Bitches give my mad rep, nothing but the brazen off tempo,
thinking they can get my loot, I never trip to knock the boots.
I gotta be wise, when time to dip between the thies,
all eyes on the price, so I think you better recognize.

I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die

They wonder where me bailing and don't really understand
The reason why me take me law in me own hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
Me gun goes click, me gun goes bang
Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach
Them riot in they Lakers and don't really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricade us like Beirut
Me don't show no love cause it's us against them
Them never ever love me cause it's sport to break the,
And kill at my own risk if I may
Delay to spray with my AK and put it to rest

Yes we have. There have been riots, rioting, well I don't wanna say
Rioting but there's been looting downtown, but right now Bree, what I want
To show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street

How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do?
What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

What they told us today, in other words,
You're still a slave. No matter how
Much money you got, you still ain't shit

Sitting in my living room calm and collected
Feeling that gotta get mine perspective
'Cause I just heard broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row, is bailing
Laugh now but cry much later
Ya see when niggas get together they get mad cuz they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They find that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the Ese's thumpin, nigga it's time ta rob and mob
(And break the white man off somthing lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love them so they can't love me)
Yo straight putting down getting my scoot on
Let's jump in off in Compton so I gots ta get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or something
Got a VCR
In the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop

There has been videotape and you can see of the, aah, some of the crowd
Throwing things at the officers
And swinging at them as well. Like there was a young woman there.
You see she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand

How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do?
What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die

One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
187 time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints so a 9 I throw away
Or get prints so my Uzi witta spray
POP POP POP another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like Pop, pop, fizz.
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't no dead do', I'm high off the indo
Creeping with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on that donut
And cracker so now he best to back up
I guess I gots ta pack up, filling the clip up, I zip up-
Town, the motherfucking cops are all around
Helicopters flying
These motherfuckers trying
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no's the poor black refuse to go

This is now covers a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these
Fires have been, aah, ignited. I mean, from here to the, aah, to the south
End of South Central is a long way

Break em off something
Break em off something

The outcome of this is destruction so the more fall
Niggas don't give a fuck so them bust and before
Niggas backing up three black shows
No justice so they copied ya right
And here I am again, me, turn the other cheek, me
Be too many wigs got me 9 to my tights
So me bust, flick cause he don't give a fuck
And me don't give a fucking of my problems

Dr. Dre,"Yo man I don't think they heard you
Why don't you tell 'em what ya name is

My name is eazy yeah this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore yo I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
Suckaz stayin' with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is eazy or just call me e
But it doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin'
I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I could get ill
But I'm like that and that's an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who trys to cope
If the rhyme I'm dispayin'
And the beat that's playin'
Yo you could try all day
And you still won't match up with the ruthless p.o.w.
'Cause eazy's doin it compton style
That's the city and you say you could get some
Yo it's eazy-er said than dunn.

Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

Now it's easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model or a Dr. Seuss yo I'm a gangsta
And I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trama
With the E-a-z-why-e comma now that's drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
I'm comin' off hard in the third demention
With the glare
But you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like your there
With the e on the gangsta tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
'Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer
Dope MC employer on ruthless and that's my label
To get the money, the women, and co bust the fat cable's
Boy, master rhymers of toys
I mean straight while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gonna diss me if ya don't even know me

Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound
And next time I'm peelin ya cap
To let ya know where I'm comin' from
Eazy said it and it shall be dunn

Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

Radio jams are the part of the cycle
Eazy-er said than dunn yeah that's the title
Rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know
(M.C. ren: but would if she's lucky)
Eazy come eazy go
Don't ask to battle me home boy what's that
You want to battle me boy ya better be strapped
'Cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin'
Now that's what I'm sayin'
Sevy thought that I was born in '73
Now everybody want's to know the a-g-e
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only fifteen
The fellaz would annoy me
The ladyz would adore me
And what was I to do
I wishin' nothin' lady's do
'Cause the ladyz I luv 'em
Nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real eazy cause others be fakin'
Tryin' to game fame off the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some

Dr. Dre,"[DJ: This is radio K-EAZY-E. Hi, this is Greg Mac. Mac Attack
And we're gonna go to the phones right now and find out what's
goin' on. Hello, who is this ?]
[Guy1: Yo, what's up ? This is Lorenzo Patterson]
[DJ: Yo man, where you callin' from ?]
[Guy1: I'm callin' from Compton and I want to hear Eazy E's new record]
[DJ: What's it called man ?]
[Guy1: Yo, it's called ""Radio""]
[DJ: We got it, you called the right station. And here it is...]

Eazy E rockin' non stop on the radio
with the funky fresh hip hop in stereo
Release some rhymes that you will find demandin' 
with Dre's beats that are so outstandin'
I'm gettin' busy if you know what I mean
Always settin' me a mark in the hip hop scene
On the radio the greatest of all times
like Mohammed Ali cause I punch rhymes
So tune your station, and clear all the static
and tell the truth: you didn't know that I had it 
in me, to be easy about the situation
So just kick it and listen to the station
playin' my music, it's hard to lose it
It's constantly on request cause you choose it
I'm Eazy E, my rap is strong
[and your radio's def when my record's on _ LL Cool J]

[You want to know why...because...]
I'm on the...

[Dr.Dre: Yeah, ruthless radio is in effect, Dr.Dre and Yella boy is in

calls. So give'em a call and ask'em how they're doin']

Hello, this is Eazy E. What's your name ?
[Girl1: Hi, this is Joyce. 
I'd like to know if I can have your phone number?]
Yes, it's 9-7-6...
[click]

Now I want to turn up my box, and make much noise
and rock the party and shock all the be	-boys
Take on my radio from phono to tuner
I wouldn't have did it, later but sooner 
Now I move my antenna to the center
then grab a hold of the handle and (??)
then bust a rhyme, you know I won't quit it
Am I lyin', Ren ? [MC Ren: Man, you know you're witty]
Your request is clear, that you're givin'
Without Eazy E you wouldn't be livin' 
with me on a top 10, or a mix show
So hit your power button, and let's go
on vacation, with your station
that's playin' live in every location
Blowin' out ya speaker
it won't get weaker
I'll keep rockin' till I hit the peek
And your station is dope E-A-Z-why
It's on the air, but you axe why
I took out the cursin', and took rehearsin'
I feel dry, you know that I'm thirstin'
to get busy; I don't quit it
and once you hear my cut, I know you're gonna get it
Then bust a rhyme, while you're clappin' your hands
It's Eazy E on the air [rockin' without a band]
  
[chorus]

[DJ: You're on the radio, on K-EAZY-E, with Greg Mac. Don't forget to
join us this friday night live, we'll be jammin' it uptown with my

Can't make it out but, hey, stay eazy, and stay it on K-EAZY-E...
with more...radio]

Now disc jockeys are playin' me in rotation
hittin' number one spots across the nation
I'm on the charts, you can go list'em
but now listen, I'm on your system
AM or FM, I'm in power
You hear my music once every hour
So listen up to the rhyme and percussion
but do this with no discussion
Eazy's easin' fans I'm pleasin'
Why, I'm on top yo, I got reason
With no profanity, but what can I say
Yo Dre [Dr.Dre: What up ?] Do it your way
On the radio you get more looser
Take my word you're a dope producer
We combine to put out hits
but jealous people, they just have fits
cause we get airplay, but we're not through
Dre, am I serious ? [Dr.Dre: Cold word] Well thank you ! 
People that hear me, they know what I'm sayin'
On the air, I don't be playin'
Just gettin' my point across to the public
Rhymin' on the radio, that's my subject
I can play [rock], but I prefer [hip hop]
It's Eazy E on your radio non stop !

[MC Ren: Yo, this is MC Ren, can you comprehend ? We're for bite just

Well, clap ya hands then-come on
Clap ya hands everybody
Clap ya hands, come on, come on
Put ya hands together and clap 'em
Now can y'all say Eazy
Come on, say it

EAZ-Y
Everybody come on,
EAZ-Y

People from everywhere gather around
Checkin' out the sound that Eazy is throwin' down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin' a way with dope style
Yo Eazy, what ya gotta say

A miracle of modern creation
Eazy E's on the set
Hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal
Otherwise known as a villain
Because I'm ruthless
When I spot a sucker, I kill 'em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

EAZ-Y

Yeah 'cause this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that it's done, I know ya pleased
At how the E just dose it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me 'n' my B-O-Y-Z
From the H-double-O-D
N.W.A., down with me
Strong 'n' I'm ragin'
Turn the page 'n'
See I'm not a son of a gun
I'm a gauge 'n'
Nothin' can avoid this shot 'cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckers on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

EAZ-Y

Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it
Another example of how Eazy does it

I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return

Hello, Dre, this is Patricia. My husband's out of town 
and I was wondering, do you make house calls?

Ridin' in my car alone not doin' anything
Stopped the answering service because I knew my phone would ring 
Heard it ring once so I picked it up and said hello
It's Dr. Dre, baby, not your average gigolo

Cuz I make house calls, it's Dr. Dre the maniac
House calls, the human aphrodisiac
I love those house calls to the girls that's all alone
House calls, when your husband's not at home

It's a quarter after two, I said I'd show around three
Her husband's out of town and she would like some surgery
Stopped at the stores so I could get a little wine
but all they had was Thunderbird 1979
So I left the store, got in my car, drove to her house and then
knocked on the door and heard this sexy voice that said come in
Opened the door to see what I got from this house call
Tall, dark and lovely, 5 ft 8 in a camisole

Now my name is Dre, 6 ft tall with wavy hair
The one that comes around when your man just doesn't care
So if ya feelin' sexy late at night and you're all alone
just think about the doctor, pick up the telephone

Welcome to the aftermath
Like we always do about this time
Welcome to the aftermath

The aftermath, a second growth
The period immediately following an unusual event
This is brought to you by the makers of funky music
Coming directly to you from The Soul Kitchen
So let's get deep, you ask how deep is deep?
Can I ask you how deep would you like to get?
The aftermath brings to you some of the best
Hip-Hop and R&B on the planet

We're comin', we're comin', we're comin'
We're comin', we're comin', we're comin'
We're comin', we're comin', we're comin'
We're here

Watch yourself, peep the blow up
From state-to-state we're touchin' home
No matter what sign you throw up
Wait, we're on some other while you're still slippin'
Bringin' you all bangin' speakers for sparks fly out the car system

Off the tops, snatchin' props and the proper the tops we touch
We're hard to knock, we got it locked
From every angle of music, the different sound view
R&B, Rap, whatever flavor, kid, it's all new
So say we bring it with the East and the West

The final results, the aftermath touchin' every coast
So when the bar blows then the DJ spins
And we don't set trip, we set trends
Love to the artists, in fact they be the smartest
If they business is tight

'cause keep it real means moving the cash markets
And constantly buildin' and stop destroying
Everything that we touch
And leave somethin' for our children

Whatever it takes to get ya paid, yea-yea-yeah
Keep on doin' it, keep on doin' it, keep on doin' it
And whatever it is that gets ya free, yea-yea-yeah
(Gets ya free, yeah)
Keep on doin' it, keep on doin' it, hey, keep on doin' it

Whatever it takes to get ya paid, yea-yea-yeah
(Whatever it is)
Keep on doin' it, ya gotta keep doin' it, keep on, keep on, yeah
And whatever it is that gets ya free, yea-yea-yeah
(Whatever it is that gets ya free, yeah)

Yo, I got straps - we got straps...
A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth talk that hard
Bullshit - 'cause it's all they worth...

So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G...
Since way back I've been collecting my fee
With the 48-tracks and the M - I - C
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea
It's worth eight, but I only paid five point three
Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo
It's how I ride - cartel style
Full, stacked to the max now
A million-dollar smile, people wonder how

With more chips than Frito Lay
Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nuthin' fly

Keep it true
'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos
My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads
I'ma keep buildin'... make it killing
Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat
But we're both black so I don't want to lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if...
I'm livin' on another level that why'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet...

[Chorus:]  

This is for the millionaires
Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin'
Honeys start to stare
'Cause game is money and money is game
And broke brothers make the forty five flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around
Like my twenty-inch rims...
Moolah why'all
Platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce
Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause...
I been there...
And done that...
Been there, done that...

Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens,
Lean mean money-makin-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace

And its all war
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballies (that's right, uh)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program worldwide
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say

From Oakland to Sactown

Better get it while the gettin' is good
Get it while you can, man
And stop hatin' me, fuckin' with my shit cause I got more hustle than you
Get yours, get yours baby

I'm seeing millions, niggas don't understand
Know what? I'm makin' moves, puttin' cash behind plans
To blow up, will he style like this
Everyday I parlay, sip Henne and Tanqueray
Stay in the mix like Alezay
V.I.P., my shit parked valet
On the prowl again to get hunnies familiar with the smile again
Some try to assault Dre, its still cavi
I'm eatin' steak while they struggle to break the slave mentality
I givin' livin' definition long as my hearts tickin'
I fought and made the world listen
Whatever fly Dr. Dre invented
Turn on the box and let my son watch these studio clowns on 60 inches
I push a rover, shit platinum before the sessions over
Rap master with the Houston heat holder
These players best to get they shit in check
Cause when I get my hustle on ain't no playin' with a full deck

[Chorus: x2]
Lord please, murder my enemies (Yeah)
Burn em at a thousand degrees
And lord please let me make mo cheese
Cause I ain't quite ready to leave (No)

Buck the whole world
Meant that, gotta stay strapped
Cause 99.9 a niggas, carry they gats
Super fist fightin' shit might come down to dyin'
When the time comes down for the tryin' I got nine
Reasons why niggas shouldn't step in my face
With the nonsense, cause I'm always heated and you can taste this
Audi little something out the seams a my trousers
With no hesitation I got a team to come clown ya
I down ya, so let your people know what they face
With the type of individual that'll bomb a sub-station
Kaboom! and everybody dies outside
There ain't no escapin' the Reaper so don't try
Go ahead, close ya eyes, who the next to step?
Face down, hit, bleedin' on the steps a death
Check yo self, you just been invaded by true soldiers

But these are the things real players do
Talkin' shit is real things that the haters do
I'm namin' you
Shit's thick, its time to run for shelter
I kept the word, things could happen to marks like it was helter skelter
Dear diary, I'm runnin' outta pages
Fadin', in and out, takin' purple hazes
The dazes, Revelations in the last stages
Red sky's institute, the silent horns playin
I'm prayin' with tears in my eyes
Cause I'm tryin' to make it into eternal peace without dyin'
But they eyein' my bank account with beams on my rover
The killa failed to launch his attack (the game is over)

Journey with me
Into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer
Since I came out the nut sack
I'm in a murderous mind-state
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck buck, Lights out
Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggas get hauled off

*Barrel one
Touches your motherfuckin' flesh
*Barrel two
Shoots your fucking heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to wreck mine
Fool its your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head
Like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitating I ain't hesitating
To put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver
Its like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag
And your frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller
Than this grave yard filler
Cap peeler
Cause I'm a natural born killa

Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma
Cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker

It feels like I'm busting a nut
When I open you up
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
Cause I'm giving dirt naps
Coming with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse
Perhaps, you never sleep
Cause every time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfucking nose
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days
Let me count the ways ^in a fucked up maze^
I never ever ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre
Like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how your living
I'm the unforgiving
Psycho driving
Murderer
Its authentic
Don't panic
I can't stand it
God Damn it
Schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit em with a brick

Now they stiff and cold
And they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain

Headache

Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes

Predicting platnum in less then a day
So for that we toast amongst us while y'all lackin' hope

Seeing my dreams come true stayin' humble in the eyes of others
Politician with the wisest brothers
It's Nature one of the greatest peep how I play this
Straight from the Bridge one of your kids favorites
From now 'till the day that I'm stiff, fowl flagerant pay the rent
Always stay swift, stuck in my ways type shovanistic
Since a youth I had a thing for big jewels
Flooded rings and older bitches, holding my riches
In lump sums for trust funds fully recoved thugs lust to bust guns
While niggas get drunk beat wifes and cuss sons
A slow process called life, let's show progress

Don Cortes, white rags cherry bently
Cop shines from Italy speak money language fluently
Never fuck with the nastiest flashiest
Bought a house as big as Scarface to show my happiness
Rackin' the 6 0's for those that want to get personal to home
Cock the heavy metal rollin' with my stones
Prominent with flashy garments, spread a mill small bills
Bring a smile to an ice grill
Popular, loved throughout the industry
If they sue light a philly cause the judge has gotta Free Willy
Salute with chill Remy gently escort four ladies an arm
The four caesars at the club Pentleys condo sweets I'm fancy

Spend doe that I never thought I'd hold before
Now if you just wanna front, you know my styles tight
Niggas never should of plugged up the motherfuckin' mic
Sippin' Tangeray 60 inch screen when we hang with Dre
I just flew in from Queens no bag and plan to stay
In the heat park this Royals Royce up in the beat
Seeing topless bitches rollerblading in the street

While I lounge in a jacuzzi sky cliff blue got the whole crew
Nas, AZ, Nature, Foxy there too, how we do?
Hit trees Cristal bottles, breeze tropical spread love till we wobble
It's time to give let the kids live comfortable
Anybody pumpin' between the East and West: fuck you
Make moves political hit this revenue
Set examples respect every individual

Parked in row ten, her and that slow ho Gwen
Shoulda known she was a bitch that we both could'a boned
To post it alone, the ass had us both in the zone
But you know the rules, both been schooled by older dudes
I know the jewels no time for them thoughts, too much to lose
Just trying to vibe until them hoes role with the ride
Where's your joy and pride, you know little Des got your eyes

In the cut drop CLK, the top's up
Left the mall bought Little Amal the toy truck
Your boy's what, three-years-old now correct
He and my daughter age neck-and-neck, they future's set
Trees got me wet, in the background's an old cassette
Fly Stephanie Mills shit
What's the deal with, all this shit I'm hearing up top
You got arrested, shot a fair one with a cop
That ain't ya stee', you usually low key when o.t
I'm only going off of what some weak bitch told me

That's some ill shit, hear that bitch go with her clique

Yo Dunn, I'll hit you right back cause the static is thick

We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do
Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, then you through
We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do
Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, we got you

We just hit the crib-o, I'm curled up on this pillow
I'm still low, heard the ill news, these niggas killed Mo
The shit touched me, tryna chill just lit a Dutchie
From a while back, same foul cats who tried to bust me
Caught em sleeping in Spanish Harlem with some Puerto Ricans
Up in Washington Heights right off the Deacon
Feel awful speaking, for some reason feel the phone's tapped
Alone with gats left with a vest to watch my own back

Keep your eyes open, stay wide, shit is mind blowing
Look for any sign showin one-time is knowing
About the dynasty, shit is not minor leagues no more
Cats bleed in this cold war
Son we took an oath, then this life took us both
We rich now, milk the whole cow, split the growth
Now I'm on the car doing, headlights on
Fluid in the windsheild wipes gone this light storm
That's forming in the sky, you coming home tomorrow
Will you drive or will you fly - hold up, my other side

Yo son some other cats tried to ruin our plans
Sending two decoy bitches with pictures of you and your man
Asking your whereabouts, I gave em no leads
For all the nigga know them hoes fuck with police

No shit I'm clicking over, I'mma tell Sos quick
Son, them outta state bitches tryna get us both hit
That was Nate, he hit me last night late while in my ho's stomach
Said it's no hundred, we FBI's most wanted
So play the low; change your clothes, pack your bags
Watch what you say on this phone, get home fast

We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do
Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, then you through
We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do

Forever, my lyrics is rough and energetic
Them cats is blazin? I don't get it, they cosmetic
If shorty wanna step up? I'll twist his neck up

That quick, yo' whole ghost town is burnin down (Woooof!)
What I spit, manipulates whole clicks
Make em conversate on how real niggaz ride my dick

Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to blackstreet
The homies got rb, collab' creations
Bump like acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies blackstreet and teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it

Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spins the verbs
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way

So holla, we all hustle for dollar dollars 
From Sac to Houston, New Orleans to D.C.

Get in where you fit in, and never get your ghetto pass revoked

Some of us hustle in the streets 
Twenty deep in Club Nikki's so you know we gots to mingle 
Off a pocket full of singles, huh 
And it's all bueno, musical mafia like Frank Sinatra

Dr. Dre,"It's fuckin ackrite
Question is can I get some? Know what I'm saying?
Ack-rite, bitch
When I see you in the spot, you just act right, you know what I'm saying?
When I yank you by the fuckin' arm
Don't be looking at a nigga crazy
Just give up the digits and be the fuck out, you know what I'm saying?
Let me break it down for y'all

It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
Have fun and get blunted on a Sunday afternoon
My nigga Babe got room, grab the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate faded boom, flossin hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clowning whores
Around the full good-to-go girls
Like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151 that gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Uh drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm fuckin' faded
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin' hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No""
Grab the bitch's hand, ""I'm Hittman""
Bling! Gold chain gleam
""You're very eligible for my summer league team""
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit flame on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Witcho' lips swoll, and give a nig' some ackrite

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)

Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? Ayo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the hush, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tip-in
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice

Everyday it's the same thing, L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still player hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas ringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn they car around
Rollin the window down (em: hey can we talk it out?)
(Nah get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck tryin to job hunt
Niggas got AK's, niggas is way crazier
Than Dre was back in his n.w.a. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your life reversed
Always trying to play rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga want to stay in family mode

Late nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and every light
Put you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got rugers and m-14's with enough
Ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin'
Ain't no, warm welcomings, my eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
Bang bang! bang bang!
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
Bang bang! bang bang!

Now tell me, what the fuck is this man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the klan
Can't even stand, in front of your building and chill
Without yielding, twelve-year-old children that kill
Blood spilling, thugs be illin, unnecessary slugs
Filling the sky, usually drilling the one
That wasn't willing to die, yes sir in the killing field
I got my, life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder, these niggaz got the nerve to
Question me, bout the colors that I got on?
Now see that red dot on your knot
Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A soldier of fortune, I'm the wrong nigga to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on
My hit list, peep this
I cock back, you bow down
Bust round, bloody the ground, retaliation sounds like this

Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of 'em
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-A
Where niggas die everyday over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll wit' my shit off safety - for niggas that been hatin' me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin' gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G
Started from that S.O.B., D.R.E
Like Dub-C I'm rich rollin', pistol holdin'
Pockets swoll nigga, that's how I'm rollin'
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
I'm hittin' switches, makin' bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick everytime I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin' The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases

Dedicated to all of those with big ego's

Passin' by with uzis - and who you aimin' at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin' that
Rat-tat-tat-tat {*automatic gunfire and screaming*}
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You got to recognize Hitman is a enterprise
Cali pride, born to ride and South Centralized
The Henny got me energized - smoke the guys
Tryin' to focus on mines - poke they eyes out
I'm L.A.'s loc'est - hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get
Hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin' HARD, Hitman and Dre
You playin' games, I suggest you know the rules
We puttin' guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos
Pop coochie 'til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck wit' crews

Make sure he got a good car girl,

You knew he already had a family
But you fucked him anyway
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
You went and got pregnant, didn't you bitch, didn't you?
The ol' 'keep a nigga baby'
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
""Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here, 'cause that nigga ain't shit""
How 'bout being a woman, and tellin' the kid the truth
That yo' momma, you was a hoe

Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop

When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs

With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches

What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath

Cryin', pourin' out my heart, pourin' out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, somethin' we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguin tellin' the truth
He had talent too, I had plans on watchin' him grow
Don't know what hurts more - seein' him leave, or watchin him go

Listen

If you wonder why (why I live my life)
The way that I do ('cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (don't worry, don't worry worry)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper

You'se a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play 'em like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face
To straight breakin down and showin' all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit' you

Don't get caught up in the hood

If you don't know why
You gotta find out the reason why
