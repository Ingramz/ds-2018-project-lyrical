Suzi Stern,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,2000
Suzi Weber,"There's a yellow rose in Texas
I'm going home to see
Though other men have held her
Her heart belongs to me.

You've traveled down some dusty roads
And slept out in the rain
But this yellow rose is always here when you come home again

She knows I've done some hard time
You've stumbled and you fell
I just kept your pride from dying

You saved my soul from hell
She's a diamond of the desert
She's a golden flower of spring
She's the yellow rose in Texas
She can make a man a king

There's a yellow rose in Texas
She knows the dues I've paid
And I'm going home to tell her
I wish I never strayed

You couldn't see beyond yourself
Your pain and wounded pride
But now you know the truth is in the way you feel inside

She knows I've done some hard time
You've stumbled and you fell
I just kept your pride from dying

You saved my soul from hell
She's a diamond of the desert
She's a golden flower of spring
She's the yellow rose in Texas
She can make a man a king

Yes the yellow rose of Texas
Can make a man a king.",The Yellow Rose of Texas,2004
Suzie Benson,"( Michael )
You always said I'd never know how much I loved you
Until it was too late to make you stay
I know it looked as though I took our love for granted
That doesn't mean I wasn't feeling all the things
I meant to say


( Suzie )
And who was I always asking so much of you
To make you prove your love time after time
Until I found myself living my life without you
How could I have been so foolish, how could
I be so blind


CHORUS
( Michael&Suzie )
From now on I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow
I don't want to wait until our time has come and gone
I'm gonna hold you now more than ever
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you, from now on


We both know it's true, when we're open to each other
There's a love we'll never find with someone else
And if we give it half a chance we'll be starting over
So let me make your heart believe what I've been
promising myself


[CHORUS]


[BRIDGE]
Baby, there'll be no distance between us
Oh, this time I know we're gonna make it
together where we belong

Suzie Katayama,"It feels so good outside
I think I'll stay here
And if you want to die
I think I'll care
Same kind of gateway
Without time
The rocks are tumbling

I don't want to say
It happened to me
I am going away
I think I'll care

Blame me all you want

I thought I'd made a friend
Why do you leave now
Is this what you've planned

Wait your turn
It's a long time
Before you'll breathe
Stay underwater and tell me are you free

I cannot complain
The pain will stay here for today
It seems to stay
I cannot complain
The pain will stay

I want to be there for you
You can't seem to take this ride
I want to be there for you now

I see your red side when you always bleed

She thinks she's in Spain. 

She isn't in love, 
She's merely insane.

Or some rare disease, 

Or too much to eat 
Or maybe it's fleas.

One minute's past
But I've got this moment
To make it all last
I'm standing before you

Everything I never thought that I could be

You can move mountains with dreams
The higher you climb
The better it gets
Cause you will see things

They used to haunt me, but now they're not here
There's no looking back, my future is clear
No giving up

The better it gets
Cause you will see things

I want to ride Old Paint goin' at a run
I want to feel the wind in my face
A thousand miles from all the city lights
Goin' a cowhand's pace
I want to pillow my head near the sleeping herd
While the moon shines down from above
I want to strum my guitar and yodelay-hee-hoo
Oh that's the life that I love 

(Yodeling) 

I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
I want to learn to rope and to ride
I want to ride o'er the plains and the deserts

I want to hear the coyotes howlin'
While the sun sinks in the West
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
That's the life I love the best

Suzy Bogguss,"While I was out a-ridin'
The graveyard shift midnight till dawn
The moon was as bright as a reading light
For a letter from an old friend back home

(chorus)
she asked me
Why does he ride for his money?
Why does he rope for short pay?
he ain't gettin' nowhere
And he's losin' his share
Oh, he must've gone crazy out there


He said last night I ran into Jenny
They married and have a good life
Oh, you sure missed the track when you never came back
She made the perfect professional's wife

Never seen a hawk on the wing
Never seen the spring at the Great Divide

And tore off the stamp for Black Jim
then billy rode up to relieve me

Will you take it like a man?

Sometimes I think that you are only running scared
Afraid to let me know the way you really care
And I could never prove your heart is safe with me
All that I can do is ask you to believe.
If I give my love to you like a woman can,
Will you take it like a man?

And ridden off into the sunset
This hip shooting cowboy steps up and says
""Reach for the sky""

I could tell he was fast, I could tell he was smart
I could tell he was looking for trouble
He was fixing to take his best shot
At my bullet proof heart

I'm under the gun, I'm under attack
The sights are lined up, the hammer is back
I'm under the gun and it's going down to the wire

I'm under the gun, he's aiming to win
He's thinking he might get under my skin
If he hits me with his fire, I'm under the gun

Just when I thought I had gotten away
With all of the hearts I had stolen
He looks in my eyes and says
""Crimes of the heart do not pay""

It was too late to talk, it was too late to run
It was too late to hold up this showdown
It was already all said and done
I was under the gun

I'm under the gun, I'm under attack
The sights are lined up, the hammer is back
I'm under the gun and it's going down to the wire

I'm under the gun, he's aiming to win
He's thinking he might get under my skin
If he hits me with his fire, oh, I'm under the gun

I'm under the gun, I'm under attack
The sights are lined up, the hammer is back
I'm under the gun and it's going down to the wire
I'm under the gun

And I told her, he was downtown in the can

She said, ""I come down here to get my man""

I guess, he thought he get away

American car
Carrying a dream and a 
Road map
Deep in my American heart
But where's those mountain
Majesties
Where's those waves of grain
Billboards from sea to shining sea
Man it ain't the same

They got Mount Rushmore on a cup
Everybody needs one of those
For a dollar more more they'll fill it up
You can drink out of Lincoln's nose
They got the Hard Rock t-shirts,
They got Elvis,too
And sooner or later, mark my words
You know they're gonna get you

I've been searchin' for the promised land
But it's just another neon, come on
Roadside stand
Little tin toys that fall apart
That's all they got here
I come all this way to find my heart
All I get is souvenirs

Thought you believed in me
I thought we had a love that's

And watch my brother trading baseball cards
My Daddy pulling weeds, mother callin me
I was hiding in the leaves

From the top of the family tree
A hundred branches growing 'round me
Way up there in the family tree

When I was seventeen, I left that town
My life was right on track, I never once looked back
I was so sure that I was glory bound
I gave it all I had and when it all went bad
Got a phone call from my dad

Only the last time I was in your shoes
Now it's looking like it's my turn to be lonely

I said it before and I'll say it again

I Don't need moonlight and roses
I don't want you to stand here and tell me lies
I know what you're feeling, I think I know why
Please don't let this love go by

It's so hard to think in the long run
And it's so easy to stand back and drift apart
There's nothing you'd ask me that I wouldn't try
Please don't let this love go by

Don't let this love go by
Don't you feed another flame
And let the first one die
You might believe you can take it in your stride
But these things go bad every time

I feel a whole lot of heartache and bad times
Comin' on like a fast train for you and me
There's a change in your voice, a stranger in your eyes
Please don't let this love go by

Don't let this love go by
Don't you feed another flame

At an all-night small-town convenience store
When he walked in and locked the door behind him.
She ducked down behind the counter
He said ""Get up, I know you're down there
I got a gun.  Just hold on, I'll find it.""
He fumbled through  the pockets of his faded denim jacket
Handed her a note and said, ""You'd better do exactly what it says...""
And she read:

""Nobody love, and nobody gets hurt.""
She looked at him with a nervous grin
She pointed to that word
He said ""What the hell? I can't spell

She said ""Yeah,
But that ain't what you said.""

She said ""I don't think you want to do this
Sounds to me like there's more to it.""
He said ""Spare your views on my abusive childhood.
Cause the last time I saw my old man
Was in a photograph in our garbage can
He never gave a damn, so tell me why I should.

You ain't gonna save me with your mindless psychobabble

Suzy Bogguss,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Into the darkness

Look, you're livin' a dream and I can't even wake
I know you want the life that they all desire
Wanna rise till you can't imagine climbin' higher
But that ladder can't stand when it catches fire
And when it stops, you'll be shocked, like electric wires
It's cool to like fairy tales
Until you try to live inside of 'em, that's where we fail

Man, who woulda thought that obituaries sell?
Look, you're livin' in a dream

If the highest joy is found in created things
Instead of something greater but I gotta make a claim, it's fantasy

With it's real treasure, real pearls
Those who try to gain the world only lose souls
And chasin' fools gold only gets ya fools gold
Well, welcome to the good life with it's real joy
Let it's old life seems like a killjoy
It's ironic that the life giver was killed, boy
He rose and He chose me, you know we feel surreal void
We were made to be connected to the life giver
To build our life around Him, with His life in us
But our pride likes to rise, them lies get us
They separate us from the good, we despise scripture

???The Vice-President???s gone mad!???
???Where???? ???Downtown.??? ???When???? ???Last night???

???Well, there???s nothin??? we can do about it,??? said the neighbor
???It???s just somethin??? we???re gonna have to forget???
???Yes, I guess so,??? said Ma
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet

I reached up, touched my shirt
And the neighbor said, ???Are those clothes yours????
I said, ???Some of ???em, not all of ???em???
He said, ???Ya always help out around here with the chores????
I said, ???Sometime, not all the time???
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Just as Papa yelled outside
???Mama wants you t??? come back in the house and bring them clothes???
Well, I just do what I???m told
So, I did it, of course
I went back in the house and Mama met me
And then I shut all the doors",Clothes Line Saga,2001

I'd gladly sacrifice

You'll have a change of heart
If it takes forever boy then

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!

Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.

What a break! For Heaven's sake!

We took a holiday with all our friends
It was a time to relax and let your worries behind
Exactly seven weeks or something crossed my mind
It was the shine of the time we never forget
One morning our parents kicked us out of our beds
We told them it was stupid, don't play the fool
But the answer was short you gotta go to school

G's running up and down and everybody know
Rappin', rockin', poppin' in the street-kid-show
Miker G rocks the house and you know what I'm saying
Now when he's on the mic there will be no delaying
So you better run to see him in your neighborhood
He's rappin', rockin' all the way to Hollywood
Hey, check it out, these are the words we say
Yo, scream with us: we need a holiday

We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday

I wanna holiday, I screamed a lot
Your only thing, school's the only thing I've got
Sven's parents told me I better go
'Cause Sven's hangin' on the street in the street-kid show
In the bar Rox what happened to you?
I told him it's my life and I know what I'm doin'
I saw the school I thought I'd never stay
Give me seven weeks again, I need my holiday

Well, this is my partner with the number one jam
Famous in the Boogie Bronx and Amsterdam
He's the fastest rapper, yo, his name is Miker G
His rap is stronger than the sucker MC's
Well, let me show you what my man can do
Rappin', rockin', poppin' and the boogaloo too
But anyway, no more delay
Just listen to the beat-box he will play

My name is MC Sven, and also deejay
I didn't like the schools, So I took another way
You like the Miker G, I use my voice
And soon I bought a big Rolls Royce

That's right, my name is Miker G
I use the holiday with the M.I.C
On the street was a party bigger than Hollywood
I grew up in this world, started in the neighborhood

I can rap more raps than a superman can
So I'm the guy on your radio
Also rockin' to the rhythm in stere-ereo

And you don't stop that body rock

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Of paradise, where roses grew

Paradise to live

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

When the unknown slowly undresses her breasts

Leads her body for me to claim

As she kneels naked under the moon

The whispers from her lips and her screams
Invite me to her ecstatic flame, over and over again

It has been snowing ever since
The plague of cold harvests the land

Remains of the man lay on the glacial ground
The monuments of ice curve upon us
Leading our way to the bitter end

And if we had only known
That it would last forever
We would have forgiven ourselves
And let the snow bury us together

Out of this gloomy light

I'll wait there forevermore
The light holds us forever more
Still one second I wouldn't give away
Cold winter nights, I cry on your grave
Why won't you come?
Why won't you come?

As she is dying in the snow
The moonlight silently glows
Her tears flow down her cheek
When snow falls from the trees

Singing songs for the damned

Descending winters for all lands
All hope is gone in his hands
Out from the north into the south
Winter turned his frozen mouth

Slaying the oceans and darkening the sun

Swallow the Sun,"Sinking in the depths of her warm caress
But the dagger I hide won't shed forgiveness
Her secret is revealed or am I wrong
Though her flesh is weak, my hand is strong

There slow days and endless nights
I've learned her ways
There open wounds and bleeding scars
Led me to her burning trails

I've been watching her silent sleep
Catching names through her sleep

The truth that lurks behind those eyes
When she grabs her pillow tight
So stay with me awhile and enjoy the fire
The flames that blaze in my eyes
Are your jury and your last trial

I've been watching her silent sleep
Catching names through her sleep

The vipers dance around her neck
When she slowly turns her cheek
It's getting late to leave this all

The burning touch of her innocence
And her eyes so pure

I could love her but I can't forgive her
So it slowly slides inside her",Forgive Her...,2005
Swallow the Sun,"I remember her
Dark flowing hair
Eyes like deep blue waters
And her skin so fair

I remember her
How she used to sing
Melodies so full of sorrow
Dreams in the making

She was so fragile

Lying on my arms, not breathing
I can still hear the echo of her voice
And now as I hear them coming
I take her to our last dance

I remember her
Delicate beauty
Her eyes so wise and knowing
When she looked at me

She was so fragile

Lying on my arms, not breathing
I can still hear the echo of her voice
And now as I hear them coming
I take her to our last dance

The red haze fading
My vision regaining
And on my arms I see her lifeless body

Realizing what I've done
Anguish grips my heart
I close her eyes for the last time and she'll sing no more

Through the emerald steps and lavender air
The statues praise the beauty of hers
Flowers bloom around her marble breasts

Silver drops of the open night sky
Light this ruined garden
The vines hanging on pillars and walls
Gather the light over the water

Cold serenity lies within these secret halls
Embracing me in her essence
The air so calm and still, and her voice
Leading me deeper, deeper inside

Through the water and floating leaves
I'm following her soft call
Into the throne of her fertile loins

In the flame she was moving slow
Whispering passionate words
As she breathed frost
Out of her warm, wet mouth
She felt like the ghost of Laura Palmer",Ghost of Laura Palmer,2005
Swallow the Sun,"Falling from my life deep to the sea
Drowning from living to the depths of me
Like the water that burns in my lungs
And the light that slowly fades above me
I'm bleeding rivers and they carried me to the sea
Crushing in this pressure, turning to stone

Roots rip my flesh and fill my skull
As worms dance around my drowning body
Feasting for the one that has gone
But I'm arriving, closing the door, ocean floor

Seven steps from my cradle
Closer to the end with every breath
What is this hell that was made for living?
I am arriving

The giant has grown too big inside me
Mountains of black stone, a volcano of dirt
When it went wrong? Why am I here now?
But not for long

Climbing up from this nest of nothingness
My faithful steps behind me
Marking my trail with circles, a path for you all
We've been ripped out from the womb
Through blood and pain into this life, and we cry
Ripped out, given, but made to be taken away

I've been hiding this giant for too long
And it's grown like a parasite inside me
Under this shadow I've been walking
Now it's taken over me, and she
The pure girl, leave me before it's too late
Or I will cut your wings

For I can't control this that burns
It flows inside, through my every vein
It fills my fingers and burns my throat
Chains my heart again
Insane pain

I throw myself into this stream
And let it take me down, underground
Here I end, from here I begin
The line is broken like my fragile body

Flesh rots before the giant's eyes
As he awakes from his silent rest
Rips open my chest, steps out from this crest
Don't take over me please, leave this lonely man,
Please leave.",The Giant,2005
Swallow the Sun,"The velvet fog came after the sun wept her last rays
Shedding her tears for the night,
The night she will never see
The all-seeing eye, the dead light of luna
Watched as the gloom gently close the flowers
But the ones I laid upon her
Stayed open to mourn my loss

The night air never hurt so deep
As it whispered praises of despair
To keep in this lonely heart

These fingers cut the wet flesh
Bleeding red rivers through my face
On my weak knees I wpt, but death stayed there
Until I lost her to gloom, beauty and despair

Please open your eyes
Please don't fade away
I won't let you leave me
I'll follow you through it all
Wherever it will lead me
I will follow

Deeper into the pain
Further away, for her
I step down to where tears remain
Over the frozen rivers
Through the land of the dead
Forever lost and bound in woe
Of my ropes of sorrow I wouldn't let go
They hanged me to this place I fell
Alone and blind I travel in my hell

Swallow the Sun,"It came with the nightfall
The dark that swallowed the stars
One by one it painted them black
And brought horror to our hearts

It came down in the shape of rain
A wall of black waters
Spreading the end to the earth below
And I ran and left them all

Away from those dying voices
I escape the eye of the doom
The triumph of fear and ending lives
And I left them all and ran
Until I reached the shore

The waves greeted me with majestic mourn
To the sea I shed my last hope
And the ocean carried me away

The sound of ending world was fading
Until I only heard my heart in despair
Closed my eyes and fell into a sleep
Relieving dream of the distant sun

""Awake"" whispered the sea
And my tearful eyes were open
The crystal night sky shone like water
The roof of eternity, ballet of million stars

From the hope of a hunter's bow

Rip your arrows out
And make them cut deeper
Crush my mouth, for it still sings praises to you
Run the blood out from my throat
For I'm still yours

When the curtains fall
And silence the pain""

We saw the golden boy bleed love
Onto the sand like rain
While we were injecting colours
Into our open veins
And deep beneath the water
The dead black silence crawled

Far away across the ocean
The golden boy's beneath the sea
The golden boy swallowed by the sea

And love is sometimes violent
And violence has no constraint
And I can see inside you
Yes I can feel what you think
And with this knife of silver
I will release your soul
And throw it out into the ocean

Nine million miles in a straight line
In a place just like this
In a ship on the water

Like Cool J does (My tattoo!)
You see me standin' outside of your buildin'
Screamin', ""Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children!"" (Hey, wait!)
I look at my life in a new light, fuck it
Give me two mics, I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You'll probably hear me rap half-hearted 
'Cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryna get my porno career started (hell yeah)

Want a deal? Study these five chapters
Lesson one, throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson two, face 'em and dis 'em (what up dog?)
Don't give em a demo, kidnap 'em (I want you to come with me)
And make 'em come to your basement and listen (you're gonna fuckin' check this out)
Lesson three, get a job at a label, switch demos with Canibus 
And put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
Lesson four, know you heard this before
""Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!""
Don't act like a fan, you want to get signed?
Get the whitest A and R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson five, get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't givin' you shit bitch, don't even bother askin' me (get away from me)
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin' like Master P (uh)
Got a blow job from Paula Jones, and stuck it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones (ow!)
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah (It's all about me)
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea (You're a dick)
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin' Aaliyah (what? Oh my God!)

So if I hurt your self-esteem 
And you get dissed too bad (Yo why you diss me?)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had (A big dick!)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

Blood drippin' from it, rippin' your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh 
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with 'Agent Orange'
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (here!)
The demon is here, steamin' this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out, scream in his ear 
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
""Yeah I don't think this guy is well"" I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail

I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin'
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nut-sack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Christopher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beatin' your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleedin' in jeans (Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathin' machines
Flashin' back to being shot and repeatin' the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke

You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

Huh, the kind of girl that works in Harvey Nicks yeah,
Is the kind of girl that?s got fucking barely rounda bags (?),
And I don?t mean bags bags, I mean like shopping bags, serious.
I never liked Dry Your Eyes anyways,
The only person that liked it was my mum,
You know what I mean,
cos man had flippin overalls on,
the pretty bird behind the tills takin the piss outta man,
even giving man no help.

{CHORUS x2 ? Mike Skinner}
When I drop in Harvey Nicks,
to shop in Harvey Nicks
If I don?t look hardly slick,
or appear hardly fit,
the cashier don?t hardly trip,
the lady hardly flits,
unless im wearing barmy shit,
or garments that are the shit.

{Verse 1 ? Teddy Mitchell}
The last time we was in here, we just lined with despair.
The pretty bird behind the till was flipping thru Marie Claire
Flicking the end of her hair, fidgeting, all nervous,
Had us thinking ?where the fuck is the customer service?!?
Must have been the flippin shabby overalls we?re wearing,
And the batch of Classics that were on the verge of tearing.
Cos Aunty?s front room needed redecorating,
So we painted it light blue to make it look more radiant.
But today that aint the case (na mate!)
It?s Lionel Scott cardigans, that us man were dreamt in
The pretty bird behind the till?s grin is so blatant,
And suckin man?s bottom, cos she must think we got the papers.
So from this day forth, we must always recall,
Never ever to come back in here in overalls,
Cos pretty birds behind tills, they don?t like to smile and talk,
To brehs bowling down in fucking overalls.

{CHORUS}

{Verse 2 ? Tony Mitchell}
It?s as if she?s never seen our mugs in here before,
Cos as soon as we was about to make a move, she released the door,
Pointing her finger at her assistant to attend to both of our needs,
Chucking an opener on the counter, strutting towards Teddy and me.
Now its all a guided tour through the Lacoste new seasons,
Compliments on our retirements, mixing offering us greetings (?).
Not to mention the welcome ? and the private seating,
That they usually use for the service twats,
With the request to them to bring the teas in.
But the other day, that weren?t the case.. na mate
It was her on the fone to the security guard,
To follow us for no damn reason.
Lookin down at our watch, giving us the cold shoulder treatment.
Asking us if we could hurry up cos they were closing early that evening.
So from that day forth, we have always remembered,
Never ever to wear overalls, its just absurd.
Cos overall, all over, overalls don?t work
Cos now that we?re in London its got the bird flicking up her skirt.

{CHORUS x2}

{Verse 3 ? Sway}
When I shop at Harvey Nicks,
Everyone thinks I?m a star,
Cos I wear my rented blazer,
And I step out my rented car.
A little girl with a pen ran up to me and said ?I know who you are?
But when I gave her my autograph she said ?mum is this how u spell lemar??
When I shop at Harvey Nicks,
The security give me grief,
They must think I?m a thief, cos I don?t sound like The Streets.
Even when I?m just trying it on, they think I?m trying it on.
I said ?why would I steal from you? I?m loaded?
Then they called the police ? ?there?s a guy with a gun!?
Despite this, I like shopping here,
Cos it?s a lot quicker than eBay
I bumped into this Labour MP who was looking for a pair of CK,
I said ?Hi, I?m Sway, and I hope you?re having a nice day?
Then I slapped him in his face and said ?what type of party doesn?t have a DJ??
I remember the first time I came here,
I was shoplifting and got nabbed,
In the shop lift I got grabbed,
?Hey you! Excuse me, open your bag!?
I got put in a pair of handcuffs,
All for a pair of cufflinks,
I said ?please sir, don?t send me to prison, if its anything like Butlins?

{CHORUS x2}

{Mike Skinner}
It don?t mean anything anyway man,
Harvey Nicks is shiiiit!
I?m all about Selfridges,
Seriously Selfridges man,
Harvey Nicks is the kind of place Ted Mayern goes,
Don?t wanna shop in the same shop as him,
Cos that cunt looks like a fucking clown!

Eye for an eye if he keeps on stealing ill start releasing weak LPs then,
So I walks into this internet caf',
Has any body seen Kazaa,

Olu did the trimry and I done the hairdo
And everything I wear's new

Sprayed a little versace dreamer on me too

But life ain't always been fine like baby blue
Cuz when u do UK rap your number two
Cuz the USA ain't giving us space to break true

Gotta keep the punters happy, to tango it takes two

I'm trying to reach the top I see the top is quite high
Steady on my grind, tryin to get my face up in the source
So I keep by faith up in the boss
Up in the bright white sky

Getting calls from these record label bosses like hi
Head up in inside their offices
And listen to their promises
But no-one's made me offers yet that I could not deny

And I been making profits of this my mix tapes raw
Life ain't always been pretty like nah
On the north side of the city where its gritty like pie
We did what we had to done to get by
Hoping not get caught up in no silly drive-by
Little derek wrote lyrics while the others got high
And he ended up in HMV instead of HMP
Cuz street life could only end one way

Knowin real fame
That's what I used to dream about
That everyone would know my name
And they would scream it out
Knowing my song words and sing along too
And I would walk down the street and hear blue, blue, blue

My video's rotating
So I got these execs debating
About whether I'm taking
And these RnB guys is asking the same thing
Calling up my phone, wondering whether I'm dating

I turn my passion to career how could I lose out?
Quit my nine to five so I don't have to sell shoes now
My CDs are moving
That's the route that I'm choosing
So I got to make it through, through, through

Analyse the planets and wonder if I could shine too

Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger.
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it.
They say sleep is the cause of death,
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs I'm N/A reading.
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next.

When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.
They watching me! They watch me sleep!

Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality,
And daydream about losing my sanity.
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow.
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed.
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat.
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep.
See, all the dreams I'm fonder,
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I Mr hard worker,
In my nightmares I Mr can't turn up,
And I missed my chance worst luck,
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah, and I walked from ish,
thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress

When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.

Looking in the mirror and I feel like I'm famous
I got that glimmer in my eye like I ain't afraid of danger
Today could be the day that everything changes
I'm trying to move up to the hills where idols become neighbors
One moment , your whole world rearranges
You feeling like you graduating Oxford or Cambridge
Forever roll the dice and have it looking like Vegas
You win some you loose some, but only winners take risks

I started getting calls I've been waiting on for ages
Phone starts popping and I'm gossiping with strangers
And I know... I'm out getting wasted
All of these flashing lights popping out in places
Always forgetting names, especially with neighbors
Ah ha what's your name again
My house, lights out
Wake up in the tea, saying touch me I'm famous
Hey stranger, where you been? Long time no see
Time to level up
I'm in the game, play to win
Another round on me

Huh, the kind of girl that works in Harvey Nicks yeah,
Is the kind of girl that?s got fucking barely rounda bags (?),
And I don?t mean bags bags, I mean like shopping bags, serious.
I never liked Dry Your Eyes anyways,
The only person that liked it was my mum,
You know what I mean,
cos man had flippin overalls on,
the pretty bird behind the tills takin the piss outta man,
even giving man no help.

{CHORUS x2 ? Mike Skinner}
When I drop in Harvey Nicks,
to shop in Harvey Nicks
If I don?t look hardly slick,
or appear hardly fit,
the cashier don?t hardly trip,
the lady hardly flits,
unless im wearing barmy shit,
or garments that are the shit.

{Verse 1 ? Teddy Mitchell}
The last time we was in here, we just lined with despair.
The pretty bird behind the till was flipping thru Marie Claire
Flicking the end of her hair, fidgeting, all nervous,
Had us thinking ?where the fuck is the customer service?!?
Must have been the flippin shabby overalls we?re wearing,
And the batch of Classics that were on the verge of tearing.
Cos Aunty?s front room needed redecorating,
So we painted it light blue to make it look more radiant.
But today that aint the case (na mate!)
It?s Lionel Scott cardigans, that us man were dreamt in
The pretty bird behind the till?s grin is so blatant,
And suckin man?s bottom, cos she must think we got the papers.
So from this day forth, we must always recall,
Never ever to come back in here in overalls,
Cos pretty birds behind tills, they don?t like to smile and talk,
To brehs bowling down in fucking overalls.

{CHORUS}

{Verse 2 ? Tony Mitchell}
It?s as if she?s never seen our mugs in here before,
Cos as soon as we was about to make a move, she released the door,
Pointing her finger at her assistant to attend to both of our needs,
Chucking an opener on the counter, strutting towards Teddy and me.
Now its all a guided tour through the Lacoste new seasons,
Compliments on our retirements, mixing offering us greetings (?).
Not to mention the welcome ? and the private seating,
That they usually use for the service twats,
With the request to them to bring the teas in.
But the other day, that weren?t the case.. na mate
It was her on the fone to the security guard,
To follow us for no damn reason.
Lookin down at our watch, giving us the cold shoulder treatment.
Asking us if we could hurry up cos they were closing early that evening.
So from that day forth, we have always remembered,
Never ever to wear overalls, its just absurd.
Cos overall, all over, overalls don?t work
Cos now that we?re in London its got the bird flicking up her skirt.

{CHORUS x2}

{Verse 3 ? Sway}
When I shop at Harvey Nicks,
Everyone thinks I?m a star,
Cos I wear my rented blazer,
And I step out my rented car.
A little girl with a pen ran up to me and said ?I know who you are?
But when I gave her my autograph she said ?mum is this how u spell lemar??
When I shop at Harvey Nicks,
The security give me grief,
They must think I?m a thief, cos I don?t sound like The Streets.
Even when I?m just trying it on, they think I?m trying it on.
I said ?why would I steal from you? I?m loaded?
Then they called the police ? ?there?s a guy with a gun!?
Despite this, I like shopping here,
Cos it?s a lot quicker than eBay
I bumped into this Labour MP who was looking for a pair of CK,
I said ?Hi, I?m Sway, and I hope you?re having a nice day?
Then I slapped him in his face and said ?what type of party doesn?t have a DJ??
I remember the first time I came here,
I was shoplifting and got nabbed,
In the shop lift I got grabbed,
?Hey you! Excuse me, open your bag!?
I got put in a pair of handcuffs,
All for a pair of cufflinks,
I said ?please sir, don?t send me to prison, if its anything like Butlins?

{CHORUS x2}

{Mike Skinner}
It don?t mean anything anyway man,
Harvey Nicks is shiiiit!
I?m all about Selfridges,
Seriously Selfridges man,
Harvey Nicks is the kind of place Ted Mayern goes,
Don?t wanna shop in the same shop as him,
Cos that cunt looks like a fucking clown!

I self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters, shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that can't be compared
to any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwake, causes vessels to circulate
like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father, and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
and watch another C-Cypher pullin my peeps to the curb
Heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combine, over the frontline
The ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, holdin it down

Yeah; I leave scientists mentally scarred -- triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
And they deserve ruin like ancient Rome; I span the universe
and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
When we die hard, to build the monument to honor us with
humungous effect in the world we could have conquered it

Sway & King Tech,"I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
22 years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 years younger than my mama
But I really got beatings cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one’s a girl, let’s name her pam
Same father as the first but you don’t give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won’t down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma’s gettin' married in the house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother queen’s risin' a chapter
Deja vu, tell you what I’m gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my god

When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand poppa doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn’t bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I’m clocking pop’s liver
But you can never say that his life is through
5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
Never been senile, that’s where you’re wrong
But give the man a taste and he’s gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don’t wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he’s taking over
I said pop maybe when you’re older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good god, almighty
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of wayback, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the r-uh-o-y, how did you and I meet?
In front of big lou’s, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes in any weather
My grandmom pam holds the family together
My uncle doc’s the greatest better yet the latest
If we’re talking about a car, uncle sterling got the latest
I strive to be live ’cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my aunt joyce
So pete rock hit me, nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that’s word is bond
I’m not playin
Everybody, just coolin
This song we dedicate

Climped out of a nice house, 
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down

Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a Withe cast on your leg

Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway & Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle!

Yo, I'm a nuclear warhead
Right now you're provokin my detonation
Never test me without proper authorization
My lack of patience has cause me to get mad
And explode right in front of your face like a airbag
Your rhyme is fake, your brain is child's play to manipulate
I create lyrics too intricate to imitate
Movin at a velocity
That'll break your stop-watch if you're clockin me
My concrete jungle is like Jumanji
But iller than what you seen in the cinema
A five foot eight nigga wit more horsepower than twelve cylinders
My brain consists of twin pentium chips
That's double the clock speeds of a 5-86
And nuttin about my physical matrix is basic
I kick flavor beyond what your tongue is capable of tastin
You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes
It's like explainin color to a man that was born blind
One of a kind, I got divine chromosomes in me
My sperm'll scramble the eggs in a women's ovaries
'cause I'm as original as it gets
And I can't respect, niggas that copy like double-decks
I get vexed, when crab punks bite my style
'cause I'm sellin a thousand records per day, per square mile
Breakin the laws of phsyics, wit metaphors and lyrics
Speakin to dead poets by conjuring up they spirits
From Shakespeare to Edgar Allen
Yo, the whole Dead Poets Society couldn't mess around wit the talent
Much less understand it

lose they balance when I kick the planet

Screamin', ""Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children!"" (Hey, wait!)

Give me two mics, I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You'll probably hear me rap half-hearted

I'm just tryna get my porno career started (hell yeah)

Lesson two, face 'em and dis 'em (what up dog?)
Don't give em a demo, kidnap 'em (I want you to come with me)
And make 'em come to your basement and listen (you're gonna fuckin' check this out)
Lesson three, get a job at a label, switch demos with Canibus 
And put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
Lesson four, know you heard this before
""Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!""
Don't act like a fan, you want to get signed?
Get the whitest A and R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson five, get a hook-up at Jive

Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh 
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with 'Agent Orange'
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (here!)

Just your nut-sack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that

Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Christopher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease

And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleedin' in jeans (Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathin' machines
Flashin' back to being shot and repeatin' the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke

Sway & King Tech,"It's been a long time  I shouldn't have left you 
Without a strong rhyme to step to 
Think of how many weak shows you slept through 
Time's up  I'm sorry I kept you 
Thinking of this  you keep repeating you miss 
The rhymes from the microphone soloist 
And you sit by the radio  hand on the dial  soon 
As you hear it  pump up the volume 
Dance wit the speaker 'til you hear it blow  
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go 
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control 
Your body to dance (You got it) soul, 
Detects the tempo like a red alert 
Reaches your reflex, so let it work 
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit 
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit 
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go 
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago 
It can be done but only I can do it 
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it 
I start to think and then I sink 
Into the paper like I was ink 
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines, 
I escape when I finish the rhyme 
I got soul
 
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul 

Picture a mic, the stage is empty 
A beat like this might tempt me 
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain 
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train 
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this 
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss 
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it) 
Rakim will begin when you make the mix 
I'll experiment like a scientist 
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list 
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold 
You want it next? then you gotta have soul 
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore 
Take the mic, make the people respond for 
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be 
If you want to get on after me 
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme 
Forget it and don't waste your time 
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it 
This is how it should be done 
This style is identical to none 
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me 
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me 
I drip steam like a microphone fiend 
Eager to MC is my theme 
I get hype when I hear a drum roll 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came 
To teach those who can't say my name 
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller 
Rakim gets stronger as I get older 
Constant elevation causes expansion 
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion 
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it 
Then on the radio the R's requested 
You listen to it, the concept might break you 
'Cause almost anyone can relate to 
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles 
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles 
Or should I just let him melt? 
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt 
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got 
Get off the mic before I get too hot 
I want to see which posse can dance the best 
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh 
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound, 
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound, 
Even other states come right and exact, 
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at 
Since you came here, you have to show and prove 
And do that dance until it don't move 
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release, 
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace 

You got it",I Know You Got Soul,1999

With knick knack paddywack so I won't lack
Oh my style is def, and as deadly as crack

While I'm slayin' must explain, a sucker is the lame
Battle in the trenches where the funky be playin'
Cause with a partner like E Double don't come a dime a dozen
A kin not blood related, but you can call us cousins
Cause as we climb the charts, better known as statistics
Brothers on my jock while I'm kickin' ballistics
Droppin' hits like I'm Housin', You Gots Ta Chill, and more
The proof is in the pudding (yo check the Billboard)
People round town talkin' this and that
Of how we sound like the R, and our music was wack
Dropped the album Strictly Business and you thought we was bold
Thirty days later, the LP went gold
So what you sayin'
So what you sayin'

Now party people it's time for the exquisite
No knock knock who that over there or who is it
It's the E-R-I-C-K, yes the Boy Wonder
No fouls no bleeps no bloops or no blunders
So hot, so you can say I'm blazin'
Or Luther Vandross says, yo I am
""So amazing, and I've been waiting""
For a sucker to attack yo me the E-Double
Cuz me and PMD is like the funky fresh couple

I fight fire with fire, that's why most retired
And when we needed a piss boy, you was hired
Cause you was Memorex, for that style that we was bringin'
In an all out battle, P comes out swingin'
Cause I'm just that type of brother that's out to get mines
And if the odds against me, I still drop lines
and get mines on time that's why most resign
Sit in my LazyBoy chair, relax my head and recline
Sip a Pepsi or Coke, with a twist of lime
Or crack a forty-oh, and then I go for mine

Sway & King Tech,"Intro
All the ugly people be quiet!
But before we get this party started right
Hey Cash! [Tell the people what you're the king of]
Verse 1
Just clap your hands, just make your hands clap
To Marvelous the mic marvel, dictator of rap
Get on the dancefloor, let me see what you got
'cause the sound we're throwin' down it makes you want to rock, ha
Hurby Luv supplying the beat
They make my rhymes sound fresher to the highest peak
A-check it out, check it out, get down
A wild style form of rap, my dazzling sound
The style I'm reciting, just reciting my style
The double words, words double but I call it wild
So girl just keep grabbing, keep grabbing my tip
Long as the money's flowin' everything is legit
'cause my rhyme is on time, on time is my rhyme
Already on top, ain't no need to climb
And to the bone, he shocked the record down to the bone
Call him Cash Cash Money but his name is Jerome
The green-eyed brother, brother with the green eyes
He shakes your booty, boom shaker from 9 to 5
So listen to this tune, don't knock it till you try it
People, ugly ugly people, will you please be quiet
Verse 2
This is a hard rocker that will rock your house
Turn up your radio and stereo and check it out
It's crazy wild and illy, bang boomin' your butt
My name is Marvin call me Marv the wacky Marvelous nut
The raving rhyme roller, rock roller that rolls
Gettin' laid, stayin' paid so you know that I'm cool
The stunning smashing super, super serious sound
The devastating death defying dictator who's down
The mighty hard rocker who's rocking your butt
And everybody check him out, Cash Money's on the cut
Verse 3
Boy, I'm rough and I'm tough, never pullin' your bluff
I'll turn a hard rock heckler to a cream puff
Got rhymes and rhymes, gettin' better with time
Hit so many def lines you have to rewind
Play it back, listen, observe my rap
'cause my lyrics are strong, and it's like that
In Philly down the way, hard rockin' alone
Marvelous and Cash Money, Marv and Jerome
We make your party hearty and say [La-di-da-di]
Verse 4
Bass boomin', bass boomin' but I'm not done yet
Gonna make it real funky on your def cassette
My mic is sweatin' with steam, when I hear the crowd scream
People, ugly ugly people is the name and the theme
I'm the microphone master, money makin' man
And I got more rock than Bon Jovi's band
Cash constantly controls, corresponds the mix
He's my homey, he's my DJ, he's my sidekick
So as you listen to this tune, don't knock it till you try it
People, ugly ugly people, will you please be quiet

Sweatshop Union,"Did you want the house, the dog, the white picket fence
The wife with three kids that helped your life make sense
The friends, petty trends, the mercedes benz
Keep the picture on the wall but its all just pretend
I thought I had it all figured out
But time's an empty hole and it becomes filled with doubt
Born a man, hopin to become the boy
Lived a life, only to be destroyed
From birth to death, the baby's first steps
Didn't affect the purest state that we have left
Best to start slow though pressure becomes past
The innocence is lost and ignorance grows vast
It all happens so fast when you're facin to the wind
You better count the chips before its time to cash em in
'Cause by then you'll realize that you've lost your drive
While workin a 9 to 5 until you turn 95
Sick and tired, know why its time to quench the fire
While speakin of how you felt you can call yourself retired
The live wire is dead, left quiet as kept
It's the birth, the death, the old man's last breath

(The old man said...this is how it all began)
It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
Immersed in a search tryin' to quench our thirst
If I only learn one thing, its the truth hurts
It would all make sense livin' life in reverse
It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
Immersed in a search tryin' to quench our thirst
And if I only know one thing, its the truth hurts
It would all make sense livin' life in reverse

I am but a reoccurring cycle of light
Bound to this physical vessel until I reach the afterlife
And I might escape as my soul is undressed
I'll fall through all the answers that I saw this time press
Wait and find a different person staring in the mirror
Left to pull my life together from the pieces of a stranger's dream
A vague haze of past days last breath, sun sets, same story, new day, next scene
It's just bickering energy trading places
More like repeating different names and changing faces
The soul's eternal but the body soon wasted
Walk into the new light as the past is slowly faded
I'm falling from earth, return through rebirth
Carry body, open wings, a freedom far from all the hurt
So when my cycle's complete, I'll return to innocence
With nothing else to guide me but the traces of my inner sense

It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
Immersed in a search tryin to quench our thirst
If I only learn one thing, its the truth hurts
It would all make sense livin life in reverse
It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
Immersed in a search tryin to quench our thirst
And if I only learn one thing, its the truth hurts

Terror ridden homes that's prone to welfare
Compare to the lush comforts of elsewhere

And honour my insight, as long as my pen writes
Invite the whole world to be free, reality not just based on TV

Reward the illusion through the view of the blind

?While the prove? that design?, in all due time

But if we sew these seeds, sew these trees
Gonna blossom all these leaves, and deep cedar roots
And as we carefully plan, to live and care for the land
In all, we share what we can, and you can eat the fruit
And when they tell us our lies, undercover disguises
We sever the ties and never be confused
And when we have to decide, to rise and gather the tribes
No matter the price, we will speak the truth

With billions of parts working as a massive machine
The goal, keep the masses passive between
Self, cash, limousines and other fabulous things
But, we gotta wake up and notice it's a load of shit
It's all about ownership of your soul and who's controllin' it
It's not about the gold you get, not about the clothes you're in
It's not about oil, but we're killing each other over it
Like a Doberman, chomping on a cat
It's a new world order, and they're bombin on Iraq
And it's so fucking heartless, the whole country's starved
And yet they've been targeted as a threat regardless

Trust a Bush? That's like saying trust Sadam
But for real, I mean you gotta love the fam
Ask his dad the ex-prez how many drugs he ran
So trust us, the shit's about to flood the land
Cause government hands can no longer plug the dam
So fuck the news, fuck the critics, fuck their views
And if you sit and let it happen then fuck you too
It's up to you, I can't tell you what to do
But touch the truth, and don't just judge the few

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1999

A prelude to a kiss

Now there only pictures in my head
That's why my green is feeling grey
Sometimes even frogs have rainy days

Remember when the stage caved in
While you were rocking out
Who'd of thought your smorkus board
Would be hard to live without

If we could do it all again
Just another chance to entertain
Would anybody watch or even care
Or did something break we cant repair

Your canon ball tragetory
It always gave me hope
They may have been unbearable but
I still loved your jokes

Is there more I could've said
Now there only pictures in my head

I didn't do it I've been framed aah wacka wacka

Repent it shall I never until the day I dee
But the lowlands of Holland has twined my love and me.

My love lies in the salt sea and I am on the side
It's enough to break a young thing's heart what lately was a bride.
But lately was a bonny bride with pleasure in her e'e.
But the lowlands of Holland has twined my love and me.

My love he built a bonny ship and set her on the sea
With seven score good mariners to bear her company.
But there's three score of them is sunk and three score dead at sea
And the lowlands of Holland has twined my love and me.

My love has built another ship and set her on the main
And nane but twenty mariners all for to bring her hame.
But the weary wind began to rise, the sea began to roll
And my love then and his bonny ship turned withershins about.

Then shall neither quiff come on my head nor comb come in my hair
And shall neither coal nor candlelight shine in my bower mair.
And neither will I marry until the day I dee
For I never had a love but one and he's drowned in the sea.

""Oh hold your tongue my daughter dear, be still and be content.
There's men enough in Galloway; you need not sore lament.""
Oh there's men enough in Galloway, alas there's none for me
For I never had a love but one and he's drowned in the sea",Lowlands of Holland,2004

You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)

If that's what you want
Taste forbidden pleasures
Whatever you want

You can fly away to the end of the end of the world
But where does it get you to?
'Cause just when you least expect it
Just what you least expect

Tom Tom returns, but only to learn
There was truth in the words he'd ignored
Sweet young wife found a new kind of life
And a strong man's heart was torn
Will he always hear that call
Tom Tom turn around, don't ever let me down

Tom Tom's alone in a world of his own
When he hears a new voice call
""Be my man, I'll do all that I can""
Is this what he's been waiting for
Will he turn and answer her call

Livin' each day as if time was slippin' away
Oh, they were just sixteen

The line that ran between
Julie and Johnnie now you've made it

But life goes on, you know it ain't easy
You've just gotta be strong
If you're one of the sixteens
And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy
You know you'll never go wrong
'Cause you're all part of the sixteens

Suzie and Davey got to make the big time
Maybe they can put it all together
In a show that lasts forever
Oh they would walk the strip at nights
And dream they saw their name in lights
On Desolation boulevard
They'll light the faded light
Suzie and Davey you can make it

But life goes on, you know it ain't easy
You've just gotta be strong
If you're one of the sixteens
And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy

When Bobby and Billy thought
That sixty eight was out of date
They took the flowers from their hair
And tried to make us all aware
Too bad, too late
So they lived from day to day
And tried to do it all their way
But sixty-eight was sixty-eight
No matter what they say
Bobby and Billy maybe you'll make it one day

But they're unkind
A mirror of you
Lies that I can see in your eyes
Tell me you're longing
Tell me you're longing, to touch my heart

I've been a fool and now I'm on my own
I never meant to hurt you
Still hear the sound of your crying

Chorus

Another woman in my arms again
To help me tame the fire
And you're still crying

Chorus
You could've given me a heart attack
Shot me down in flames

I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be

The love you took from me

No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

The way life used to be

The love you took from me

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes

You took a walk, left me high and dry
You disappeared, never said goodbye
We had a love that was meant to last
How could our love slip away so fast
Here goes a fool that can't live without you

It's lonely out there
Away from you
It's lonely out there
Since we've been through
Lonely, just like thunderous spaces
Lonely, without your sweet embraces
Lonely out there
Lonely

When did it end
When did it start
When did I know
I'd lost your heart

You took a walk, left me high and dry
You disappeared, never said goodbye
We had a love that was meant to last
How could our love slip away so fast
Here goes a fool that can't live without you

Lonely without your sweet embraces

Roll a ""L"" and burn a incent
It's like magic when I invent
This shit that I present
Yo turn my levels up a izinch
And drop the trebble down the pizinch
And let the bass commence
To relax your nerves
It's like a paintin with no color it's-why I attach the words
My mind the brush, my life the canvas, the world, the easel
Combines a perfect picture for people
My words is colorful like autumn
The way they fall on the track like leaves when I record em'
There's nothin like it when I write
And I don't print, I invent it and predict it like a psychic
Pull down the shades on the windows of your soul
And gaze into your mind and watch the wisdom unfold
I was taught when your vision's impaired
The wisdom is there
A message from Big Homey couldn't-have sent it no clear
I know the flow is like hypnotic
And tightest tip when I drop it with no particular topic
Type shit that can't be bitten so stop it
Type shit that can't be re-written on copy
By kinko, kodak, fuji films
Kin-folk know that groovy hymns
Spit by him'll put the gospel to you
Catch some little higher learning from a sermon once I drop it to you
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
The flow is like hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
(Memphis Bleek)
So roll a ""L"" and light a incent
It's like magic when I event
This shit that I present
It's not a secret when I speak it
I know that hatin' isn't physical but dawg I could peep it
It's like a preacher preachin' his scripts or psychic readin' a palm
Lines give me what I write in-this song
The book is now open so let the story be told
I enter through your mind and exit the back of your soul
That could push you to some insight
A shine like a headlight
Pickeny diamond watch me get right
I'm that nice
Words is a cure that help me heal up a heart
Words can become that evil game that help me get what I want..uh
You start where you end, you end where you start
I am the light of the situation I overshine dark
Give you the pen, the book, the word, the truth, the sight, the mind
I put it down, you call it a rhyme, I call it a sign
I predict the unpredictable
Heaven is invisible, but hell isn't physical
Let me stop with the spiritual.. whoa
Let me spit at you, show you how to move with no vehicle
Come through your speakers
Into/enter your ear, end up in paragraphs
Tellin' your man of what you hear
'cause, spit it I often roll it tighter than chronic
Styles versatile meanwhile it's hypnotic
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
(Jay-Z)
Pass the dutchie if you was ill
Take one to the grizzill
Tell me what you fizzill
It's like a complicated puzzle unravelin', mind travelin', with no particular flight patterin
Speak the language of the lizand
Desert feeds worm, worm feeds falcon, falcon feeds man ..uh
Only the strong survive, so if you along for the ride strap your boots and leave your thongs inside..uh
We experience turbulence in urban environments daily, rarely it's aqcuired
We riot like Israelis
Why am I here that question overwhelms me
I am a gangsta, Dr. Melfi couldn't help me
I am a thinker, my mind fixes all that L's/ills me the perfect elixir
I trust mines will never fail me
I let my speech unfold, I reach deep inside the seed of my soul and I got it
Hypnotic...hypnotic....

I've thought about us two
I could buy myself a lifetime
Just to spend on you

And maybe you could care for someone
Just like me
Maybe you're in need of somone
Just like me

Now I told you how I hold you
In my highest esteem
I hope you don't disapprove of me
If I'm not what I seem
As a matter fot fact
I've been holding back
The way I really feel
'Cause I've been afraid
Of what you might say
If my heart had been revealed

And maybe you could care for someone
Just like me
Maybe you're in need of somone
Just like me

Well, I'm no Knight in shining armor
I'm No prince charming, I agree
But what lack in might and valor
I'll make up in honesty

So, here I go
I will try to show
How much for you I care
But the value that I place in you
Is far beyond compare
You mean more to me
Than the eye can see
But your heart can understand
That I'm talkin of the kind of love
To a woman from a man

And maybe you could care for someone
Just like me
Maybe you're in need of somone
Just like me
Maybe deep inside you're feelin'
Just like me
And maybe you could marry someone
Just like me",Just Like Me,2002

So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you boy, you'll never get rid of me

Honey honey, touch me baby, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, hold me baby, a-ha, honey honey
You look like a movie star (look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are (I wonder just who you are)
And honey, to say the least, you're a doggone beast
So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high

I don?t know how I rate to run another day

I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1998
Sweet Jazz Trio,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1998
Sweet Jazz Trio,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby

Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Good day sunshine,

No! Oh my God, oh my God
Wait a minute, let me tell you something
You little run over crustation
Let me tell you one thing before you walk out the door
You took my money
You took my heart, you took my love, you took my body
But when you touched my money you took too much
Never will you grace these doors again
Get out, and take that dog with you
It's over for me
Oh my God, what have I said?
don't go, no, come back
Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!
It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over
It's over, it's over, it's over for me

I'm that type of guy you daddy won't let go out, cause he thinks I sell drugs
I'm that type of guy that will save ya
I'm that type that will call you later
Won't be around to give you that time

Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper
That I can do
Gotta keep my baby girl laced up in the latest and the fliest suits
Never one for none, lets get cake up, hold it down, that's all you gotta do
Then I walk up in the place, with a pocket full of money, my brother like, I outta do
Stepping out with the finest suits, look at me now

If you move she could start tripping
I'm that type that will let you go
I'm that type that will let you know
That everywhere I go, I can find a pretty hoe
But there ain't too many know how to get that dough
That's the type of girl I want around me
Even though I'm a with her, make a man feel free
Roll with the fellas, even hold my cheese
Look like something you would see on TV
She don't mind climbing up that ladder
Similar to the words, it don?t matter
But this time they wanna see us together
Look at us now

And that's just what I'm attracted to
And I'd rather go all the way

Love her long time, till the break of day
I don't plan to ever let her leave my bed
Till she sees the color purple like Annie Mae
Now she wants to start holding on me, like whatever she's smoking on
I'll be long gone before you can say, ""look at me now""

What's happening...
Check it out 
It's critical; the situation is pitiful 
Bear in mind you gotta find somethin' spiritual 
We never gain 'cause we blame it on the system 
You oughta listen, whether Muslim or Christian 
Or any other type religion or creed 
'Cause what we need is less greed 
We can't continue to kill ourselves 
We gotta build and expand our wealth 
So one more time, I'll design a rhyme divine 
To educate and elevate your mind 
Nowadays we gotta fight to live 
Human means we got a right to live 
Without the homicide, without the genocide 
Don't tell me ""let it slide.""
I'm feelin' ghettofied 
So be a soldier of truth 
Protect the lives of our youth

What's happening...
In the land of the free, home of the brave 
Too many of us reach such early graves 
They tell us to behave, but they don't know 
About the neighborhood drug flow 
They don't know about the drama, or about the guns 
I ask how many politicians steal our funds 
And how many officers will turn up corrupt 
The governments don't care; they pass the buck 
I'm growin' tired of the trickery 
And the misery; it's makin me kinda sick, you see 
But now I meditate, so I can get it straight 
My thoughts penetrate, so I control my fate 
So be advised by the wise and conscious one 
We take the easy way out, too often, son 
We better get some kind of work ethic 
Realize it, and correct it

From New York to L.A., dead children lay 
Victims of an unfair society 
But for those who are blessed 
We must correct this mess, or disappear into nothingness 
We're living in the age of doom 
How many teachers reach all the kids in the classroom? 
The beast is stalking us, but there's no stopping us 
As long as we maintain the strength within us 
'Cause we're winners, descendants of the kings 
They try to hinder us from doin' our thing 
So get the money, but spend it wisely 
I get ill when the beats hypnotize me 
Realize that the key 
Is for each to master his own destiny 
Deal with reality, and keep a tight focus 
'Cause there's a lot we got to cope with

Try decide, this love is made
Loving you can set me free
I'm hooked on you can't you see
Hearts on fire
Higher, higher
Nobody else can make me feel the way that you do

Could it be that this time love has taken all control
Your the one who's touch I need, the one I need to hold
Could it be that this time love has taken all control
I'm hooked on you, your the one I need to hold
What can I do, its over you",Hooked on You,1994
Sweet Sensation,"No, I can't believe that it's true 
After all we've been through 
You say that there's somebody new 
Hey, what did you feel when we kissed 
Tell me, was there something that I missed 
Never thought it would end up like this 
 
So goodbye, baby say goodbye 
I know it won't be easy 
'Cause you need me 
A victim of love
A victim of love

And I don't know what I'm to do 
Chorus 
They say all is fair in love 
But sometimes enough is enough 
Losing at love is so rough 
Hey, they said you were my friend 
That true love is without an end 
Tell me, do broken hearts ever mend 

This is the last time 
I'll never hurt again 

So goodbye, baby say goodbye 
I know it won't be easy 
'Cause you need me 
A victim of love
A victim of love

Say goodbye bye boy 

So goodbye, baby say goodbye 
I know it won't be easy 
'Cause you need me 
A victim of love
A victim of love

Victim of love 
Stop 

Better say goodbye 
Say goodbye 
I'll never hurt again 
Whoa, a victim of love 
I don't know what to do 

Goodbye, baby say goodbye 
I know it won't be easy 
'Cause you need me 
I was a victim of love 
And I'll never hurt again 
Victim of love 

I thought that you and I were different 
The way you made me feel 
In your arms, the sweet words you whisper 
Seem to be so real 
But now it's time to turn and walk away 
Sometimes dreams come true 
But not for me my love 
But maybe for you 

Goodbye",Victim of Love,1994
Sweet Sensation,"Take it while it's hot 
Take it while it's hot, give it all you got 
Take it while it's hot 

I've always dreamed this was the way that it could be 
Just like a fantasy, your hear along with me 
So now it seems we've slipped into reality 
And it's plain to see this is our destiny 
Feelings I try to hold seem to take control 
I lie awake, my body shakes with just one thought of you 
The door is open wide so won't you come inside 
And do those special things that lovers do 

[Chorus]
Take it while it's hot, I think the time is right 
Take it while it's hot, I want your love tonight 
Give it all you got, don't let this feeling end 
Take it while it's hot, cause it may not come again 

Sometimes I'm shy but now I think that you should know 
The deeper that we go, the more my feelings show 
Time passes by just like good things come and go 
So light the candles babe, and I'll make a wish and blow 
I love the way you groove, I'm gonna make this move 
It's time to live, I want to give you what your waiting for 
The lights are pink and low, I think we're good to go 
We're wasting time and I can't wait no more 

[Chorus x 3]",Take It While It's Hot,1994

In the sky away,
You're more lucky than me.

Chased darkness out of view
Left your desperate spell on me

Pour yourself all over me
And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees

I wanna love you forever
And this is all I'm asking of you

Is that so much for you to do
'Cause from the moment that I saw your face
And felt the fire of your sweet embrace
I swear I knew
I wanna love you forever

My mind fails to understand
What my heart tells me to do
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you
And that would do
I've always been taught to win
And I never thought I'd fail
Be at the mercy of a man,
I've never been
Now I only want to be right where you are

And felt the fire of your sweet embrace

I wanna love you forever

Let's take this now before it's gone
Like yesterday
'Cause when I'm with you there's nowhere else
That I would ever wanna be no
I'm breathing for the next second I can feel you
Loving me, I'm gonna Love

I wanna love you forever
And this is all I'm asking of you
