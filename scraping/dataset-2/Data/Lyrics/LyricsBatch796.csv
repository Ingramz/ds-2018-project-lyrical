Of Mice & Men,"The silence brings a panic
It fills the empty space
To feed this paranoia
Trapped in a mental cage
The rough and jagged edges
That line this feeble state
Prevent my hands from gripping
Oh, how they shake

Uh, this is a warzone
This is a warzone

A hurricane of anger
The howling winds of rage
An ocean of confusion
The storm inside of me
Slowly losing control
Desperate for a glimpse of hope

This is a warzone

The seconds feel like hours
The minutes pass like days
Begin to count down from ten
And don't forget to

Breathe in tranquility
Breathe in serenity
Breathe in a sense of relief
Before it escapes
Before it escapes
Before it escapes

This is a warzone (this is a warzone)

From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

They were scared down in their holes

I'm so excited
All my sad days will soon be over
I know you can do it, because you did it before
And I'm happy when I'm with you
I guess it's a lot to ask of you
To change everything that's bad
You know I have to laugh at this feeling

There's one thing I hesitate to add 
What if it turns out bad?
We'll be living together
Will we be spending too much time together?

I'm gonna find out just how close we really are
And if having you around is better than being alone
If I had to bet whether this works or not I'm certain
That it will but still I can't forget this feeling",This Feeling (Dereks Theme),1997
Of Montreal,"Tim, wish you were born a girl
So I could've been your boyfriend
I know it's not possible now
I just never met a girl I like half as much as you

And we could lay around in bed, stay there all day
Or at least until the afternoon
And I could make you spaghetti with tomato sauce
With just a touch of oregano and a parsley stem

And then when you got sick
I could take the day off work
I could've made you chicken soup
And we could watch soap operas
Oh, those TV dramas
I could catch your cold
And you could take care of me

If I could've met you at school, or met you at work
It would have changed everything
Those years of losing, confusion and insecurity
They would have been shared
They would have been easier

I went to a rock show to see mick jagger.

Am I going nuts or is it just you, mommy?
Am I plain gone or is it the world?

And who will never be satisfied

Who no longer bears resemblance
To that soft spoken flower

Tends to dull a man's wit

Saving a nice old man and his wife

At a clock factory

So he could fire that scoundrel William Moss
Who always puts him down
When Megan Blanchard is around

He told himself last year
That when springtime was here
He would suddenly appear at Meg's door
He'd rent a mariachi band and respectfully demand
His dear Meg to take his hand
And to be his forever more
But of course he didn't dare
And pretended not to care
About the insult or the loss
When he found out she'd married William Moss

Jacques Lamure goes to see a show
Every other Friday night
He likes the westerns best
He'd rather be a sheriff with a gold star on his chest
Than that weird guy who never says a word
And when spoken to pretends he hadn't heard

He realized one day that he didn't have to stay
That he could move as far away as planes could fly
He chuckled as he mused
About the people who had rused him
And how shocked and confused that they would be
When he says goodbye and never turns around
Never returns to that miserable town

Then as weeks passed he soon did find
This move had greatly improved his state of mind",Jacques Lamure,1999

Of Montreal,"Nickee Coco woke up early one Tuesday morning 
And decided to go for a walk in the tomato field behind her house. 
As she was walking along she saw a magnificently tall invisible tree 
And decided to climb up on it. 
She found the foliage covered branches 
So comfortable that she fell fast asleep. 
She was still asleep when nightfall came 
And her mother became frantic with worry. 
She ran from house to house asking everyone she saw 
If they had seen Nickee or knew where she was. 
Soon the whole town was aware of Nickee's disappearance 
And they immediately started the search.

And so the search began
Everybody was looking for Nickee Coco
They looked on rooftops and in trees in the park
Mr. Temboley even shouted down the well
""Nickee Coco if you are down there give a yell""
But he didn't hear a yell
And so the search went on

Everybody was still looking for Nickee Coco
They asked the stuttering organ grinder in the square
Who said ""No no no no
I hav-hav-haven't heard a thi-thing
But the second that I-I-I d-d-do I'll gi-gi-give a ring
Oh-oh-oh the poor poor poor little thing""

All the while Nickee was curled up fast asleep
Very peaceful in her invisible tree
Eating mangos in a dream
And so the search went on

All the while Nickee was curled up fast asleep
No longer peaceful in her invisible tree
Being chased by antelopes in a dream
And so the search went on

They're wondering if they'll ever find Nickee Coco
Nickee's mother asked Miss Colvendom in tears
""Margaret tell me what on earth I've done
To deserve losing my sweet beloved one?
What could I have possibly done?""

Many weeks passed 
And though some people were beginning to lose hope 
They all kept searching and never did Nickee leave their thoughts. 
One day an owl happened to fly past Nickee 
Still sleeping soundly up in the invisible tree 
And rushed back to tell the townspeople. 
After an owl translator was called in 
And the owl's wonderful message was understood 
The whole town joyously followed the owl back to the invisible tree 
Where little Nickee was still fast asleep. 
They all cheered when they saw her 
And Nickee finally awoke as they lifted her above their heads 
And marched victoriously back into town where they had a huge party 
In honor of her return and sang this song

Their mouths agape exposing fangs of fire. run children run

The three legged hyena cicadas migrated to the small northern sea port village called Durschfuch. The horrible insects congregated above the Durschfuch elementary school and would spend an indecent amount of time circling the playground. The citizens of the village were very alarmed by these new visitors, but since they were a God fearing community and were not allowed to bring any harm to any of God's creations, they had to pretend to ignore the large grotesque arthropods and continue on with their lives as if there weren't any menacing predators swooping over their offspring. In time the hyena cicadas became hungry and this in when the real terror ensued. As I stated earlier, the adults of the village, thought the best course of action was to pretend the insects didn't exist and continued to send the children out to the playground for recess. Every day the same thing occurred; the children would stand apprehensively at the threshold of the front gate until the teachers ordered them outside to ""play"", then the children would run terrified towards the shelter of the banyan trees that formed an oval around the perimeter of the school yard. There they would spend the duration of recess huddling together under the trees, shaking with fear. For the first few weeks the children managed each day to narrowly cheat death by hiding below the trees. Eventually the hyena cicadas became mad with hunger and resolved to become more aggressive in their attempt to eat the children. One of the more intelligent cicadas, who happened to be the most famished of all of them, had the idea that some of the flock should hide among the foliage of the banyan trees while the others swooped over the children as usual.

Of Montreal,"There was jello in the fingerprints detective dulllight discovered. 
It proved to be the most important finding in the case 
And where as detectives slocks and slovits 
Slobbered over smutty photographs 
Dulllight had a better lead to follow. 
He followed the ringing to the telephone where a voice asked 
""excuse me aren't you so and so?"" 
""oh so and so since you left I have been eating only sweets cause they remind me of you."" 

He felt this surely was a clue. 
So he climbed into the tub wearing his underwear and overcoat, 
Jumped aboard the model boat and followed the water down the drain. 
In his brain there are file cabinets 
And secretaries filing their nails downstairs 
(but I don't want to talk about that room downstairs). 
At this moment detective slocks and slovets 
Realize that since they had reported on the crime scene 
This morning each of them has aged over fifty years. 
Two butterflies land on their shoulders and harmonize softly in their ears 
""where did all the time go?"" 
""did you think that you'd stay young forever?"" 
""but at least you're still together""
The two detectives held hands in the moonlight. 
The butterflies flew away which prompted slovit's to say,""l miss them already"". 
Slocks removed a fountain pen from his breast pocket, 
Drove it deep into slovit's throat and began screeching 
""death to the parchment whale, the robot I am lasaile"". 
While in prison, slocks wrote one of the most revered exercises in free verse titled 
""the cause of gauze"". ""oh the cause of gauze, 
The manuels have fondled many memories from my lap though 
Each memory has its own lap and swimmers swim laps. 
Even swimmers have laps however and while in that 
Condition many require a delicate gauze. 
I desire only this in my decrepitude, 
That I will have one more opportunity 
To serve as a gauze to my fellow man 
And that in that state of gauze can somehow disturb 
The world less often with my prickly fingers.""

First heard the news of the slocks and slovets

Devoid of memories, nothing to record
Wishing the one that we adore

Into something real
I'm wide awake
And I can see

The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
Which crawled beneath my veins

And now I don't care
I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things

That I can touch I'm torn

나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때

뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어

So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
""Testing attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me

A-tiskit a-taskit,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit and that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over
Nobody listens to Techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
Hey, there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

La sua macchina è parcheggiata davanti al portone 
Con le quattro ruote tagliate 
Ha smesso di pagare l'affitto e vado a vedere cosa sta succedendo 
Malboro mi apre e l'appartamento lindo e perfetto che gli ho consegnato qualche mese fa 
È già una discarica
Lui dorme sul divano 

Attorno, cicche dappertutto, stanze buie anche se sono le tre del pomeriggio 
Ha lo sguardo perso 
Bofonchia qualche scusa, 
Ma appena alzo il tono della voce diventa aggressivo 
Preannuncio lo sfratto 
E gli faccio notare che sta distruggendo la casa 
È uno stato evidentemente confusionale 
E mi domando come potrò giustificare la situazione 
Alla proprietaria 
Questo tizio non credo abbia molte possibilità di pagare
Nè ora nè in futuro 
E sfogo la mia frustrazione 
Cercando di svegliarlo dall'esaurito torpore in cui è caduto 
Forse esagero con le parole e lui si avvicina con fare minaccioso
In quello stato non pare un gran pericolo 
E gli dò una spinta per allontanarlo con discreta sufficenza

Provo a scappare in cucina

Mentre guardo atterrito i coltelli sul lavandino

Di una benestante signora di quasi ottant'anni

E cerco di trovare una via di fuga 
Caccio un lamento con tutta la forza che mi resta

Mentre,terrorizzato, raggiungo il più rapidamente possibile la porta di casa 
E torno a rifugiarmi in ufficio 

Mi guardo riflesso nel vetro del bagno 
Sembro un pugile suonato
Mi tremano le gambe 
E l'umiliazione brucia ancora di più di quanto incassato sino ad ora 

Com'è possibile 
Che io sia finito a fare da scudo umano ai risparmi della classe media 
Non me lo so spiegare 

Di una cosa sono sicuro 
Lo slogan, ""La casa è un diritto, l'affitto non si paga""

In quel giardino troneggia un enorme sequoia che avrà trecento anni
Una vera sequoia vicino a Puianello
Appena posso mi intrufolo nel territorio altrui per giocare a guardie e ladri
Coi marmocchi ben vestiti oltre la siepe
Che a cinque anni puoi ancora mescolare
Senza dare troppa noia
I nipoti contadini con i figli del dottore

Oggi i signorini stanno facendo andare a vuoto l'altalena
Ma io non me ne accorgo
Un'altalena con seduta in legno massello rigoroso
Arrivo di corsa e sento un urlo
""Attento!"" Attento a cosa?
Schtung

Piombo al suolo a peso morto e l'omicida 
Il più grande tra I giovinetti democristi 
Va a chiamare preoccupato chi ne fa le veci
Lanora mi raccatta su di peso e mi trascina su di peso 
Già svenuto nella casa del dottore
Che sta giocando a carte nella sua magnifica tenuta fuori porta 
Non si alza nemmeno dalla sedia
E davanti a quel disastro consiglia saggiamente di portarmi all'ospedale
Dove mi rifaranno alla carlona il sopracciglio
Per poi velocemente rispedirmi al cortile da cui sono arrivato

È rimasto quell'immenso e botanico mistero
La sequoia è là in Via Chiesa
Proprio a pochi passi dalla vecchia Villa Rossi
Dove nel '44 stava il comando di quelli che torturavano i ribelli venuti giù dalle montagne
Ed è rimasta quella vecchia ma meno eterna cicatrice
Quando la guardo allo specchio e nelle fotografie di me bambino
Penso che sia una bella cosa
Una lieta meraviglia
Che ancora non c'abbia toccato
Né guerra, né miseria",Sequoia,2012
Offlagadiscopax,"Johan parcheggiò la bicicletta contro il parapetto 
Ed entrò nella roulotte in braghe corte 
Perché fuori nevicava l'universo nonostante fosse giugno 
Batteva i denti irrigidito mentre I suoi due nuovi amici 
Rimasero stupiti dalla visita a sorpresa 
Gli offrirono un the caldo domandandogli perché in quella discesa 
Durante la bufera il ghiaccio e la paura non si fosse ben coperto 
L'olandese in bicicletta rispose col suo accento gutturale 
Parole incomprensibili e finito lo spavento si riaffacciò alla strada 
Mentre altri sventurati su due ruote scendevano prudenti 
Quei tornanti in mezzo alla tormenta protetti dal Moncler 
Lui restò ancora un poco a godersi il tepore improvvisato 
E dopo un paio di bestemmie protestanti tornò in sella al suo cavallo 
Verso la valle che incombeva

Eppure un quarto d'ora prima Johan era solo lassù in cima 
Staccò tutti lungo il Gavia pedalando su un viscido sterrato 
Mentre intorno era come se l'inverno in Val Camonica non fosse mai finito 
Raggiunse quel passo a quota siderale mentre i fiocchi sulla testa 
Evaporavano al contatto della pelle incandescente 
E arrivato fino a lì continuò a far finta che il freddo non ci fosse 
Tirò dritto come se Bormio stesse nei dintorni e non quaranta chilometri più in basso
In quella roulotte ci finì con un principio di assideramento tre minuti dopo 
Che a scender dopo tutto quello sforzo sudato e bagnatissimo 
A cinque gradi sotto zero indossando solamente una maglia ciclamino 
Ci vuole del coraggio e una certa dose d'impazienza

Ci arrivò da stoccafisso a Bormio l'olandese Van der Velde 
Quasi morto e con quarantasette minuti di ritardo
Ma di quel traguardo si ricordano certo più di lui che dell'altro tulipano 
Che giunse primo in quella tappa disgraziata o dell'americano 
Che vinse poi il Giro d'Italia la cui cima Coppi era un pi' troppo congelata
Quel metro di neve sulle Lepontine Retiche 
Affrontato con una bicicletta al posto della slitta 
Vale quanto l'alpinismo estremo senza bombole d'ossigeno 
Tra le inviolate vette del Pamir",Tulipani,2012

Se murió una flor y cambió de color (yeh-ieh)
Tú eras mi diabla, yo te daba calor
Fumando pa' olvidarte, pa' matar el dolor
Y a veces quiero morirme, pero nadie ha muerto de amor

Tú dices que tú me odias, pero tú no me va' olvidar
Sabes que tus piernas, yo te las pongo a temblar
Yo te devoraba, y tú empezaba' a gritar

Si se mueren, en la muerte traicionan, 
te aman, se van y te odian
Y en la muerte es como la personas que te dejan sola después que te lloran
Hablando con la luna, como un lobo buscando a su loba
Buscando al demonio que te está devorando en su alcoba

Hablándote mal de mí
Como si yo ya me morí
Dile a ese infeliz que te la coma como yo te la comí
Y que te haga mojarte como yo te hice venirte
Tú dijiste que encima 'e mi cuerpo tú más, tú querías morirte, yeh

Sólo yo he podido llegarle
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban
No decías nada, nada, no, no

Yo sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer
Tú crees que es fácil mirarte a la cara y que me diga':
""Ya no, no te conozco"", ""hoy 'ta to' bien""

When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy
They start freaking everyway you turn
You can't start walking cause your feet got burned

Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt

Gotta find me a future move out of my way,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine,
People do you hear me, just give me the sign,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

I'm a man with a one track mind,
So much to do in one life time (people do you hear me)
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all,
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all,

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1995

Oh Land,"Who would've known that I could conquer your heart
by reflecting in someone else.
And who would've thought that I could
comfort your heart, when I can't recognize myself.
I know how she speaks and how she moves
when she doesn't know what to say
Cause her emotions carry her away.
I watch it from my rooftop, every night.
And when I go to sleep she holds my head in her arms
And she makes sure that nothing will tear us apart
And then I steal a lock of her hair, and open up my eyes

I will follow you, you will be my main direction
I study you until I get your
Everything you do is a gem in my collection
I follow you until I get your perfection

Who would've known that after hunting you down
She would leave all the bones for me.
And who would've thought that she could leave someone like you
She left a part of herself.
You know how I speak, how I try to imitate
the way she lays her head on your shoulder
And you got nothing more to say
down to every detail I won't miss a day
Cause I know all her lines, her favorite things
And how her restless mind keeps her up in the night until the light
Will come and stand here try to catch her eyes

I will follow you, you will be my main direction
I study you until I get your
Everything you do is a gem in my collection
I follow you until I get your perfection

Every step I follow you in the wrong direction
I study you until I will get your perfection
Everything you do is put into my collection
I follow you until I will get your perfection

Who would've known that I could conquer your heart
And who would've thought that I could comfort your heart

I will follow you, you will be my main direction
I study you until I get your
Everything you do is a gem in my collection
I follow you until I get your perfection

Story is mine, live it
I'll jump for your life
Imma 2 steps from the stairs up to my baby
Gonna toss out all the doubt
'Cause I am ready
I'm a little late, ???cause lately I've been aching
And I know that I've been all around
But you've got me all now

Caught up in the little things
To distract from what
We're all wondering, wondering, wondering
Why are we here in the first place
Tiny little cars down there
It's a long fall
We're all wondering, wondering, wondering
What will be there to protect us

Caught up in the little things
I didn't sleep much! And did I do enough?
To distract from what
Will a hurricane sweep us? Into the dark blue cloud above
We are all wondering, wondering, wondering
And am I able to be a wife and a friend and a rebel
Why are we here in the first place
Settle down and live in a fable. Peter Pan lost at the pool table
Tiny little cars down there
Am I looking for trouble? Seeing stars in the Hubble?
It's a long fall
We are all wondering, wondering, wondering
I'm forever so blind in this puzzle
What will be there to protect us

It's the little things, little things, little things",Little Things,2014
Oh Land,"You know I feel like I'm just a circuit
But there's no use without the part
And all the ticking sounds around you
That's the beating of my heart
All the wires feed me dreams I thought I never had

It's my world today
I don't have to stay
Break from the machine
Not that far away
I don't have to stay
Break from the machine

A little fire sparks would fall
And your electric rivers' flowing
There's no way around the storm

I don't have to stay
Break from the machine
Not that far away

Indestructible tiny blossoms
Keep them coming
They're coming, they're coming

In between, so undefined

Oh No,"[Kazi] 
I'm down with all the illest  ain't no crabs all around me 
So put your head together  you still couldn't find me 
Where I be and how I live is ill 

[Madlib] 
Hey yo  niggas always talkin' bout there shit is real 
""I gotta flex with a Lex in my video"" 
That's what half of these rappers be thinking in every city, yo 

[Kazi] 
Yeah, you want to fight don't ya, you want to bite don't ya? 
The involvement of a new coast is here 
To take your soul, rearrange it with flows 
You're unknown, come across our line, you get blown 
Too many bids, ain't no puttin' together 
Restorin' your body parts, leaving the rest for whatever 

[Madlib] 
You talking bout you want to freestyle, you want to flow 
But your flow be like oil and water, it don't mix 
And you don't even know you're waiting for your rhyme fix 
But my mind sticks, my rhyme hits, your mind gets 
Amputated, 'cause your style ain't even Hip Hop related 

[Kazi] 
This be the Kazi, my niggas call me Kaz 
How does it feel to be mixed up and lost? 
First of all, you shouldn't have bit the next rapper 
Now your mind's confused, you lose, talkin' bout you paid dues 

[Madlib] 
Slay crews, when you ain't even at phase two 
Talking about take two? You only get one take 
Yo, my boys just run fakes, run ya out of my estates 
Plus they just might take ya papes, plus you won't remember no plates 
So don't have no mistakes, steppin' over this way 

[Kazi] 
Second to last, but not least, hey yo, Kazi's here to rip it 
I'll take MC's, tie 'em up, and then split 
It's like this, yo I'm up on some bliz 
Total techniques for the hip hop kids 

[Madlib] 
Yo we puttin' the lid on ya, if you're wack you're a goner 
Cause we on a war path, droppin' math 'cause we only want to 
Keep this hip hop real, innovatin' new styles 
Takin' out wack MC's by the piles, for real 

Episode #2: God's Gift 

I have no strings to hold me down
Beware of the Tupperware 
It's the limited edition, prime series hum via tell a sport brain 
Who came complete with all terrain capabilities 
Track trail blazing a path of traveling freely 
Beyond the vanity of border impedance hindering 
Progress intending to enhance those plagued with 
Recessive styles, relying on primal rage 
Disengaged pushing trivial, unimportant material 
Virtually there, but still visually impaired 
Point of views defusing the output of ya outlook 
Confusing ya confidence, 'cause you dwell on surface knowledge 
Dig deeper into my speech or the only way you'll learn 
Is to have a translator explain my rhymes in layman's terms 
We now have confirmation, pure order has swarmed 
Like locusts consuming all vegetation 
Into waste land fills fresh water wells seeping 
Poisonous corrosion as a business proposition 
Exposing flesh in nuclear explosions 
Forming glowing boils at the point of contact of deforming 
The surviving population as mass rotations 
Resulting from advanced hip hop experimentation's 
On the island of Madlib Monroe 
CDP pouring beats down your throat that dissolve your vital organs 


Episode #3: Declaime 

I'm cool with who I be, Lyric slanger from CDP 
Got shit locked up like slaves out at sea 
Ya lost to the way I come across at all costs, I must get mine 
Suck up all the sun rays and then outshine 
Till I blind all eye sights all over the planet 
When I rhyme right, I out stand it 
Cool with my ways, so chilled that most can't stand it 
y'all knows me, the rhyme wise who stays high 
With forty's in my lap bust that old school boom bap 
All over this map, for I be that down ass, South Cali poet, 
Ya know it to be The D-E-see-L-A-I-M-E, 
Doing my thing in this ring 
Knockin' niggas down with what I bring 
Crazy chaos your way off 
So swing ya partners are around 
Do the hump to my sound 
Fuck it, all panties down to ya ankles 
Bending back ass over microphone entangles 
Strangles all ya got chokes like chronic smoke 
I'll take a toke and pass it to all my niggas, 
to all my niggas, take two and pass 


Episode #4: Medaphoar and Oh No 

[Chorus: Medaphoar] 
Everyday it's like a level in this game that we live 
Gotta struggle to survive, that's why some MC's get blitzed 
Situations got your mind in control, that's how you roll 
But don't step to M-E-D, because your rhymes will be fold 

[Medaphoar] 
Straight in all black on the attack be Medaphoar so freeze back 
So rappin' imitators get peeled back when I'm in combat 
I got them rhymes to make ya shake the spot when Medaphoar's near 

My rhyme's been set to blow up different spots so MC's stand clear 
I fear no MC's alive because my dangerous rhyme 
Survives battles worldwide, until my cities recognize 
For every rhyme that's built to self destruct three seconds after the buck 
Niggas better duck, or take that risk to get stuck 
It's this do or die mentality that keeps ya mouth frying 
Sippin on the E&J and smoking blunts stuffed with Hawaiian Chronic 
For my homey Shack in SB, rhymes on the shiesty 
Niggas on the run when Medaphoar is on the gun 
MC's out to get me from all of the battles I won 
Med, comin from the west, so represents where I'm from 
Lyrically I got your block locked when I drop this hip hop 
Fresh out the west to twist you up because the rhyme don't stop 

[Chorus]

[Oh No]
In this game, I ain't trying to see that wack rhyme bacteria 
That's some next shit, material starts external 
But also interior when y'all frauds claim imperial 
Breaking down your inferior while you listen to your superior 
Some niggas know me as ""Oh No"" 
But in reverse in ya in the middle, I'm ""on ya ho"" 
So slow your roll because I fold emcees like rheumatism 
Syndrome and break 'em down like compression when I be up in 'em 
I skip more MC's than scratch compilations CD's 
To have your speech in verbal poetical lyrical oddities 
The heart's cold to make hell freeze, slash hot like a flame 
I spread like dead grass up in the hills so run for your ass 
I'm known as assassin from the west livin' it up 
Kaliwild shakin up the best, messing 'em up 
This nigga's known as metaphor and I be the disrupt 
Vocally tearing you up from the ground up 
 

Episode #5: Wild Child 

[Chorus: Wild Child]
When you bust that rhythmic freestyle flow to be that abstract 
You bust back flips, lyrically you'll get asked that 
Is y'all crew rally all that when you bump that 
Track by Lootpack, ya like ""They off the hook, cat"" 

[Wild Child] 
Focus, Wild Child representative of hip hop, top 10 niggas get mopped 10 times 
My rhymes will transform into 30 thin lines 'cause I feep I'm 
The responsible obstacle 
For you non-freestyling MC's kickin' lots of bull 
I rock shit till the Eucalyptus 
Flaunt it like, haunt ya mic to the point ya mic tells you, 
""You can't rip this"" I'll get it exited and, get the crowd hyped and 
Slap you up with my right hand and 
Find out you're a little white man with a slight tan 
Wild Child'll take ya ass out like lightning 
Fresh in the flesh, steadily enlightening this mic 
The fact that you lack the respect, got the mad knack of incompetence 
Step to Jack and get smacked to lower your whole lack of confidence 
Ya bro's out there know you have no composure 
You unnoticibly slide to the back of thee 
Open mic session with ya little wack faculty 
Thirty minutes, prior to getting there, claiming you had the knack to be 
The dopest MC, that was the most inactively 
Statement you ever said to Jack, you see 
The day you took hip hop into ya hands was an act of lunacy 
So, if ya feel me, yo if ya feel me, party people say it 
""La La La La"", come on, come on, come on, come on... 
my people say ""La La La La"" 

[Chorus]",Episodes,1999
Oh No,"Hahah...
Yeah, bounce...

(Turn around) do it...
Yeah, yeah, come on...
Do it!

Yeah, uh, dear loved one
I keep looking at your picture and that can get a nigga so twisted
I'm hearing sounds of your singing girl, listen
Thinking of ways that I can try to stay and kick it
I can't help myself, my nigga's like:
""Oh you pussy with, you shouldn't get, tied up from that one trip""
But shit happens, as soon as she start macking (macking)
And I ain't even the type to start acting
So true, I look into and see my queen that be
That's life or eternity, I'll take it to the ecstasy
Without the buzz, 'cause that might be the death for me
And I'm tryna to show you some new scenery
Yo hold up, I got another girl but it ain't working like it's supposed to
I'm thinking of going postal (uh)
I need some space to think, like gimme coastal
Define allah, brothers can't come (??)
So let me tell you something
You think you know me a little but it ain't really nothing
Sex, talk, now who's bluffing?
I pull your card like I pull a towel when I be fucking
I send this out to any girl that really ain't fronting
Move with it, cause...

This is for you.. (Yeah)
Do it.. Come on.. (Yeah)
Do it.. Come on.. (Yeah)

Yo, it's been ten months since I last wrote you
And shit ain't the same, I'm still in the game, remember my name?
I'm chilling like I got too much stress on my brain
Thinking about you when we chilled in the rain
Intoxified by your eyes, I'm not one to kiss
But your lips keep on calling me and that's bliss (bliss)
The way you move, the way you walk, the way you twist (twist)
The way you roll, the way you talk, the way you suck (hmm)
What you thinking?
I'm tryna kick it for the weak and hear the bad creeping
Yo who's that creeping? (Over there!)
It must be oh no with that soul freakin (over there!)
It must be oh no in the back sneaking (uh-huh)
I'm unordinary, you so cute, the way you talk
Is like your slang got that ghetto vocabulary
We spontaneous, ain't hurting no intendinary
You need to move with it like we in the military
Move with it, cause...

This is for you.. Come on...
Do it! Yeah...",I Can't Help Myself,2004
Oh No,"Now my road has turned to tracks,
Stones to pebbles, see them roll away.
My wandering troubles need not break my back,
Mmm, sorrow is the price I pay.
I sing my sorrows to the morning; I speak them to the night.
You best believe I? ll keep singing until I make my wrongs so right.
Devil said, a pity for your troubles to take your tired old soul?
So you know you got to go.
Hurry, to catch the morning.
You got to hurry on now,
In the night.
I would heed my sorrow.
And it knows, won? t be long now?

Now with blind hands, I crawl this lonely place,
As my dry tears fall and roll away.
I can? t see troubles as they dance behind my back,
Ooo, sorrow is my soul to slay.
He stole my sorrows from the morning; he ripped them from the night.
And you best believe I? ll keep singing to make my wrongs so right.
Devil took a pity of my troubles; he holds my tired old soul

Oh No,"Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

Oh No,"[Wild Child]
My new years resolution: persist to end all wack MC confusion
To break MC's in half, there rhymes be like illusion
My conclusion, Lootpack's the group that cause Likwit Fusion
Brothers mic check 1 but can't get with 2's and
I take levels of the treble, embrace the bass
And grab a hold of the steel and come face to face
Silly mortals, coming through portals yabbin' at the lip
Even if their ass was Asian, they still couldn't flip
Some old lyrical, my spiritual rhymes be physical
Kickin' metaphorical, my style's historical
It's better for a cool brother to say he saw me in an article
I hear wack rumors, but yo, it's hard to cool Wild Child down
I don't clown, I just come forth kicking that Lootpack sound
I give props with my Likwit Crew MC's I rock with
I unlock styles like locksmith

Chorus:

Never am I weededed
""I don't have to smoke...""
Yeah, weededed
Every time you say a freestyle, you must be weededed
I never needed it
""I don't have to smoke a blunt to get pepped up""

[Wild Child]
First off, Lootpack set it off to wreck ya band
The only smoke you ever see Wild Child get be second hand
I've ignored non-freestylin' MC's, they get me bored
My exhibit shows I'm the rhythmic dyslexic lord
Wild Child, known to most people as Cracker Jack
Your style got no flav like licorice that be black
I'm offending when I start bending men
Coming forth with 100% adrenaline
It's not my fault when I come with hip hop from my heart

Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist

Locking lips like they all wasted, tangled hips like it's a spaceship

Where the darkness fills the space and they can feel themselves erasing

Da seh ich einen Rastamann
Ick steh da so am Straßenrand (zu Fuß)
Und halt den Daumen raus aus meiner Hand, yo!
Ick halt ma an der Straße an und frag „Ey, Mann, wo lang?""
Ick will (ja?), zum chillen, (alles klar) ins Freiheiheitsgefühl
Ick bin (wo?) schon drin (achso) uffem Weg direkt dahin
Na fein, da steig ick ein, da komm ick mit 'n kleenet Stück
Setz dich rein, dreh wat ein, lehn dich zurück auf diesem Trip
Und wohin fahren wa?
Aus der Fata Morgana
Durch jedes Panaroma ins Nirvana und davor zum Dalai Lama

Einmal um den Globus
2 oder 3 oder 5 mal um die Welt
Und wenn einer auf Klo muss
Dann gibt's 'n Klo im Bus
Kein Grund dass man anhält

Denn das Leben ist wie eine große Autobahn
Lass uns nicht lange überlegen, sondern los fahren
Wohin is egal und wo lang werden wa sehen
Es wird immer weiter gehen

Wir düsten durch Wüsten
Steppten durch Felder
Checkten die Wälder
Endeckten Buchten
Versteckt in tiefen Schluchten
Und bei den Pyramiden
Da wären wa fast geblieben
Wir ham uns umentschieden
Und stiegen in Täler in Korea
Und besuchten die Hebräer
Und in Alabama killten wir den Kilometerzähler
Als wa in Taiwan waren
Wollten wir inn Sudan fahren
Doch hatten wir kein Plan man
So kamen wir nach Japan
Mit Ruder-fest in Budapest, man, det war echt der hammer
Alle rauchen Blunts mit Gras aus Kingston und Zigarren aus Havanna
So völlig high
Durch die Mongolei
Surfen auf Hawaii
In Shanghai gabs Stress mit Polizei
Das war voll krass, wa?
Und dann in Madagaskar
War 'n Freak aus Alaska
Der macht die beste Pasta, Basta!

Denn das Leben ist wie eine große Autobahn
Lass uns nicht lange überlegen, sondern los fahren
Wohin is egal und wo lang werd'n wa sehen
Es wird immer weiter gehen

Das Leben ist wie eine große Autobahn
Lass uns nicht lange überlegen, sondern los fahren
Wohin is egal und wo lang werd'n wa sehen
Es wird immer weiter gehen

Sämtliche Länder erobert
Mit allen Völkern gechillt
Jedes Wesen bewundert
Genug Input gefüllt
Und was wolln wa jetz noch machen?
Hm, lass ma überlegen
Ick fang ma an zu hämmern
Und ick fang an zu sägen
Bock zu zerlegen, abwägen und neu zusammenkleben
""Ey, wat baun wir überhaupt hier?""
Ich würd sagen 'n U-Boot
Auf jeden!
Luke schließen abtauchen
In den tiefsten Ecken der Meeresbecken
Wo unentdeckte Welten sich bis heute noch verstecken
Wir erforschen alle Winkel der Länder und der Meere
Was wäre da noch übrig? Na is doch klar die Atmosphäre
Also baun wa wieder
Schrauben wa wieder
Wiegen und schmieden Platinen
Kabelsalat, programmieren Maschinen
Und starten auf zu Planeten
Mit Lichtgeschwindigkeits- Raketen
Segelten mit Kometen zu Intergalaktischen Feten
Wir treten ein in die nächste Dimension
Und es gibt keine Endstation denn wir bleiben in Bewegung

Denn das Leben ist wie eine große Autobahn
Lass uns nicht lange überlegen, sondern los fahren

The truth is that I know
I still confuse the past
With the present tense

Condensing what we had
To a single frame that sticks in my mind
As I try to move on
The same image comes back every time

They were yesterday's mistakes
And they were yesterday's mistakes
Yesterday's mistakes somewhere

Forgive my selfishness
I'd be grateful if you can
Forget my ingratitude
You think I'm twice the girl I am

You're and imposter you don't, don't, don't believe what you write 

You can't get used to the fact that you ain't a kid 
You like to think that you speak for them all 
You'd cut off your nose if you thought it would make you hip 
It drives you crazy you can't be a star (Oh ain't that tough)

That way you know you could never get hurt

This has happened before 
It's just pictures of you 
In darkness 

Pictures of you 
I'd been sleeping for hours, 
when you came to my house 
You'd been lost in a crowd, said you had to get out 
You were covered with tears and you said you were sad 
So you wanted to play 
Yes, you wanted to play 
Well you touched me and smiled, as you let yourself go 
Oh, but something was wrong, 'cause your touch was so cold 
Like you'd been in the ground and you asked if you could 
Stay 
And I said no! 
It's just pictures of you 
In darkness 

(Pictures of you) 
In that lovely white dress, oh your skin was so white 
With the moon in your eyes, on that cold winter night 
When your lips were so soft, that I though they would 
Melt, 
And the sound of your breath and the way that you felt 
And I said yes 
And I said yes 
It's just pictures of you with a knife in your hand 
With a rose in your teeth lying nude in the sand 
It's just pictures of you, standing high on a cliff 
With the wind in your hair, and a smile on your lips 
And your eyes were so wild, when you started to laugh 
Blending in with the wind, sounded just like a scream

They picked up guns and hammers

WIthout heat there's no fire 
Without fire there's no desire

Burning truth was on her face 
Even thought it was late at night 
Saw her once There's no mistake

Fresh tracks / On virgin snow 
Caught a saint / While he was sinning 
People scream / What do they know 
Turn it off and find religion 
Tune it out and find a cause 
Get it up and tell the world 
Don't stop, Don't ever pause 

Here in this place from all our dreams 
It doesn't seem to make us better now 
If it will get us through the night 
With all our conscience still intact 
It's just a fool's paradise . . . (etc.)

Two hearts / Bleed so much more

Why run / When you can crawl

Completely firm and so alluring, Like's he's lived a thousand times before

Hush babe everything's all right, Daddy's gonna stay with you tonight 
Now he's got you by the balls, he can sell you anything at all 
From morality to diamond rings to genocide to magazines 
From religion to cosmology to the end of a democracy

Always ready to follow 
Ever willing to swallow 
All the doctor's prescriptions

Gave me hell, called me a fool
Pointed his finger, at my face
Started to sweat all over the place

I'll think of you . . . (if I don't forget) 

Run away from the church--run away from guilt 
Runaway from (your) dream--everything you built 
Run into the light . . . 

CHORUS 

Run away from the office, from your old work shoes 
Run away from crime, and the big city blues 
Run away from money, and the jaws of death 
Run away from lawyers, and the government 
Run away from your friends, and your family too 
Run away from yourself, run away from you 
Run away from here . . .

Oingo Boingo,"Well I wish real hard when I close my eyes 
 If I could change the world--would I even try 
 If I found a reason to regain my pride 
 Oh if I try to believe--try to believe 
 
 [CHORUS] 
 It's so hard to find an answer 
 It's so hard to stand alone 
 It's so hard to find a feeling 
 That was buried long ago 
 It's so hard to trust another 
 When it's easier to hide 
 It's so hard to believe 
 Unless we try baby try 
 
 If I had a dream and it got away 
 If I found the words would I know what to say 
 If I had a chance to be someone else 
 Yeah if I try to believe, try to believe 
 
 [CHORUS] 
 
 If I found a door I've never been through 
 Would I have the courage to go in without you 
 (Try To Believe) 
 And if time runs short would I recognize 
 The things I couldn't see 
 If I try to believe--try to believe 
 
 If we listen to the voices that were silent for so long 
 If you thought they went away, well you couldn't be more wrong 
 If I tell you there is something that we've lost but can retrieve 
 If I tell you there is hope, if we try to believe 
 You remember there's a dream that we long since put aside 
 With the toys that we discarded 
 And the tears we never cried 
 We could have had it once again, if we try baby try",Try to Believe,1990

Oingo Boingo,"There's life underground...

I feel it all around,
I feel it in my bones,
My life is on the line,
When I'm away from home.
When I step out the door,
The jungle is alive...
I do not trust my ears,
I don't believe my eyes.
I will not fall in love,
I cannot risk the bet,
Cause hearts are fragile toys,
So easy to forget.

It's just another day,
There's murder in the air...
It drags me when I walk,
I smell it everywhere.
It's just another day,
Where people cling to light,
To drive away the fear,
That comes with every night...

It's just another-
It's just another day...
It's just another day,
It's just another day...
It's just another-
It's just another day...
It's just another day,

It's just another day,
When people wake from dreams,
With voices in their ears,
That will not go away...

I had a dream last night,
The world was set on fire.
And everywhere I ran,
There wasn't any water...
The temperature increased,
The sky was crimson red,
The clouds turned into smoke,
And everyone was dead.

But there's a smile on my face,
For everyone...
There's a golden coin,
That reflects the sun...
There's a lonely place,
That's always cold...
There's a place in the stars,
For when you get old.

Oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

It's just another-
It's just another day...
It's just another
It's just another day...
Oh...

There's razors in my bed,
That come out late at night.
They always disappear,
Before the morning light!
I'm dreaming again,
Of life underground...
It doesn't ever move,
It doesn't make a sound.

And just when I think
That things are in their place,
The heavens are secure,
The whole thing explodes in my face!

It's just another-
It's just another day...
It's just another day,
It's just another day...
It's just another-
It's just another day...
It's just another day,

I thought about the ghost that we left behind. 
With everyone around telling us what to do 
With deafening sound whisper ""I love you."" 
The fire in your eyes-- may it never go out. 
The sweetness of your tears make it feel like night. 
I see no escape from the roles we always play 
What do we have to prove on this judgement day 

You're missing the whole point-- you're not my little pet 
Don't throw away your life-- The games not over yet 
I do not own your soul--don't want you in a cage

I thought about us both and the lives we led. 
The pages on a book and pictures on a screen 
We shape ourselves like clay from someone else's dream. 
One second you are cast just like stones at my feet 
But I am not a king please don't worship me.

Oingo Boingo,"Johnny was bad, even as a child everybody could tell,
Everyone said, ""If you don't get straight
You'll surely go to hell.""

But Johnny didn't care,
He was an outlaw by the time that he was ten years old,
He didn't want to do what he was told
Just a prankster, juvenile gangster.

His teachers didn't understand,
They kicked him out of school at a tender early age,
Just because he didn't want to learn things
He had other interests
He liked to burn things!

The lady down the block,
She had a radio that Johnny wanted oh so bad,
So he took it the first chance he had.
Then he shot her in the leg,
And this is what she said
""Only a lad. You really can't blame him.""
""Only a lad. Society made him.""
""Only a lad. He's our responsibility.""
Oh, oh, oohh oh oh oh
""Only a lad. He really couldn't help it.""
""Only a lad. He didn't want to do it.""
""Only a lad. He's underprivileged and abused.""
Perhaps a little bit confused?

Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa

His parents gave up, they couldn't influence his attitude,
Nobody could help.
The little man had no gratitude.

And when he stole the car,
Nobody dreamed that he would try to take it so far.
He didn't mean to hit the poor man,
Who had to go and die.
It made the judge cry.

""Only a lad. He really couldn't help it.""
""Only a lad. He didn't want to do it.""
""Only a lad. He's underprivileged and abused.""
Perhaps a little bit confused?
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh

It's not his fault that he can't believe,
It's not his fault that he can't behave,
Society made him go astray.

Perhaps if we're nice he'll go away,
Perhaps he'll go away,
He'll go away

""Only a lad. You really can't blame him.""
""Only a lad. Society made him.""
""Only a lad. He's our responsibility.""

Hey there Johnny you really don't fool me,
You get away with murder,
And you think it's funny!
You don't give a damn if we live or if we die

Or maybe you just want a chance to let them know 
That you live and breathe and suffer 
And your back is in the corner and you've got nowhere to go 

Nothin' for nothin'--everything's right at your fingertips--for a price 
Who ever said that life on this planet would ever be paradise

If you throw your life, if you throw away your life . . .

If it does it's for the worse, seems it's just a modern curse

Everyone looks so asleep, will they die before they wake 

And, hey. . . Don't you know? We're just products of our time and Hey . . .

And I wouldn't even change it for a thousand flying pigs

And I wouldn't even change it for a herd of screaming kids 
And I like you just the way you are, I like you though you may not like me back 
I would dazzle you with brilliance, if I only had the knack 

'Cause I like you just the way you are, I like this life just the way it is 
And the castles all around me, have been melting now for years 
And it kills my brain to think of all the time I wasted here 
All the efforts, sweat, and broken hearts, the screaming and the tears 

And I'm dreaming again . . . Floating in a pool of mud 
Try to get back where I was and I don't really care 

Got a little talking to, by the mirror in my room, and I don't really care . . . 
Whispering voices from the dead, come from underneath my bed 
And I don't really care . . . 

I like my stupid life just the way it is 
And the chaos that surrounds me like a flock of screaming pigs 
And it hurts my brain to think of all the stupid things I've said 
And if I could change the future I would change the past instead 
And I'm dreaming again . . . and I'm dreaming again . . . 

Baby - sometimes I worry about you 
Sometimes you're so far away, tell me what to do 
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about you 
Sometimes I just can't believe everything you do 
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about you 
Every day I feel the same, don't you feel it too 
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me 
Seems I'm falling down a lot, in between the scenes 
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me 
Getting harder all the time, harder now to see 
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me 
Light another cigarette, have another dream 

It's the same thing every day, nothing ever seems to change and I . . . 

Do you really want to change? 
Testaments and growing pains. Tranquilizers for the soul. 
Nothing ventured, nothing gained - evolution's cruelest joke 
Why is everyone upset? I once knew but I forget. Something happened, 
Something strange, something it appears has changed

And then together we will raise our voices high... 
Our voices high... 
Our voices high. 

Hey, though at this moment I can't think of what we'd say 
I guess we really want to be just like them... 
Just want to be just like them... 
Just want to be just like them. 

Hey, I've really thought a thousand times about this day 
I've been expecting it in each and every way 
The possibilities preoccupy my mind 
And I'm so fortunate to be so very kind... 
So very kind... 
So very kind. 

What I really want is all those things that I can't have 
What I really want is to have you so bad 
I'm so jealous I can barely see straight from my head 
And it burns from the inside 'til I wish I was dead. 

Please, mama don't be angry with me. 
Please, papa don't be angry with me. 

And I'm so sick and tired of all those stupid things you say 
And this monkey sitting on my back won't go away 
And I'm standing here with my dick in my hand 
Waiting for an invitation to the promised land. 

Please, mother don't be angry with me. 
Please, father don't be angry with me. 

Hey, I've got a commentary without much to say 
And all those damn kids drive me crazy every day 
But all I ever think is something to complain... 
To complain... 
To complain. 

Hey, I really wish that they would all just go away 
'Cause all I really want to be just like them 
Just wanna be just like them... 

And I'm so sick and tired of all those stupid things you say 
And this monkey sitting on my back just won't go away 
And I'm standing here with my dick in my hand 
Waiting for an invitation to the promised land. 

Please, mother don't be angry with me.

She was a simple girl without much to say
So one day she upped and left her dreary home
And she left all her friends to wander all alone
And at first she was afraid, she was so far away
From her home but slowly she got to like it anyway

Oh Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come

Well in time she found 
That mountain that she had been taught
Her whole life, that she must avoid
And though at first it hurt, and no one could comfort her
She finally came to appreciate it
And she liked it, she liked it--oh wasn't she surprised
And though still alone, she grew so much inside

Oh Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come

And after a time, she became so sublime
She could look in people's eyes and read their minds
Though her hands would sometimes bleed and occasionally
She would long for her past and the memories they bring
She decided to return to her old home town
And her heart was burning with all the things she found

Oh Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Please come home

So Mary came back and at first no one recognized her face
And her friends were all a little bit afraid
When they heard what she had to say
They all slowly backed away
And her family took her aside and put their arms around her
They said:
Mary, won't you please come back to us now
There is still time to repent for all your sins
And Mary started to cry when she realized
That she'd never come home again in her life

Oh Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Please come home

Where the English language can't - penetrate and I 
Saw your mouth moving - just forget it and lie here with me 
Maybe we should just, climb under the sheets 
Where the words they don't get in the way

Is this the end of it - end of everything 
We were wondering, wonder

Has a message I - want you to hear 
Hope you're happy - found what you're looking for

While I stare at the wall
I ask myself over again...

How did I end up
In this little hell?
How - did it ever begin?

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helpless to turn back the clock
That ticks on
With its cruel shiny face
It laughs while it watches
My every disgrace - I was
Born a sap - all the
Nurses laughed when they
Saw me the first time
They giggled and they said
""This poor little monster'd be
Better off dead.""

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helplessly trapped in a body
I'm sure -
Should have never been mine.
I bet that my real one's
Doing just fine - and I
Don't belong here, I
Don't belong here - I
Should be quite rich
With a big shiny car
A house with twelve rooms
I deserve to go far.

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helplessly falling in love
But does love
Really last through the night?
To love - To honor -
To kick and to bite! and I
Don't belong here, I
Don't belong here
It's all a mistake
I was destined for greatness
A leader, a prophet -
They're just too blind to notice.

Where did this whole silly story begin?
It seems that my mind has gone -
Blank.
I think that I've messed up a chapter or two.
Perhaps it is best if I'm frank!

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess -

Helplessly lost like that
Poor chap who came
For an innocent dance.
He left with his brain smeared
All over his pants! cause he
Didn't belong here, he
Didn't belong here
He never should've left
That warm cage in a zoo!
His face was so ugly
What else could I do?
Can you - really blame me, I
Had to smash it.
He left me no choice,
He was just like the others.
I just had to kill him.
With my poor, dear, old
Mother.

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helplessly fucked in the ass
By a legion of forty ex-cons
That's what it feels like
When you walk all over me.
Don't belong here, I
Don't belong here
Your eyes burn right through me.
They fill me with fear.

Watching football, and drinking beer.

Baby said, what a cute little piggy you are 
When he took one look at her rocket tits 
He smiled real wide and said ""Baby, you're it"" 

Piggy said baby won't you come with me 
My little place is three steps away 
Piggy gonna take us both to paradise 
He said ""Come on little baby, won't you please be nice"" 

So Piggy and Baby sauntered into his crib 
Said, ""here it is baby, this is where I live"" 
Won't you take a load off, can I fix you a drink 
Baby turned real slowly and said, ""Piggy you stink"" 

Piggy said baby, do you have a smoke? 
Baby said no, she was tryin to quit 
Piggy was speechless for a couple of beats 
When his jaw dropped open and he said... ""shit"" 

Now Piggy and Baby had some swingin times 
And though piggy was stupid, 
Baby sure didn't mind 
Baby said, ""lets go straight to the stars"" 
And Piggy said 
""huh? .... whatever"" 

Baby and Piggy took a walk in the park 
It seems that Piggy was in kind of a fix 
He owed seven bills to a couple of sharks 
Who were gettin kind of itchy in their finger-tips 

So they figured it was best to clear out for a while 
Piggy had lots of friends, or so he would boast 
And his little piggy habit was kind of out of control 
So they packed up his Lincoln, and head for the coast 

Baby started smokin again on the way 
Piggy's little habit was making him sweat 
So they stopped off in Vegas for a couple of days 
To scam some cash up and make a few bets 

They went and shacked up in a place on the strip 
Piggy made some calls and Baby got sick 
Baby turned to Piggy with a desperate plea 
""c'mon Piggy, you know what we need"" 

But the problem, you see, was that they were broke as shit 
So Piggy asked Baby if she'd turn a few tricks 
She argued at first, but she finally agreed 
With a couple of shiners, she hit the street 

Now Piggy felt good, and piggy felt mean 
And Piggy was high on his self esteem 
So he pulled out his piece, in front of a cop 
But the cop said ""Fuck you"" and Piggy got popped

We can get down and dirty in our animal skins

And I stand with my thing hanging out in the wind
Where the water's sweet like honey
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, hey, now

I've been feeling a chill, from the East wind blue
Is it creeping up slow, have you felt it too?
Have you noticed the look, have you felt the feel?
Did it make you blush when the piggy squealed?

Have you heard what they say, did you read the news?
Said, the old man's coming home a singing the blues
Gonna whack your fanny, gonna tan your hide

Make your ears turn red and make you gonna cry
Now, well, how many children gonna lose their minds
How many crying girls will be left behind?
When the dead start walking and the full moon shines

When the dead start walking and the full moon shines
When the dead start walking and the full moon shines
When the dead start walking and the full moon shines
When the dead start walking, yeah

Now, everybody sing to the heavens above
And everybody dance to the sounds of love
Won't you clack your teeth, won't you smack your hands?
Won't you dig your little heads right out of the sand?

Won't you jiggle your butt, won't you wave your arms?
Won't you look like you just came off of the farm?
Won't you stop your fighting for a second or two?
Won't you help your neighbors, won't you do the do?

Won't you taste the sugar, won't you eat the cake?
Won't you get your ugly mug right out of my face?
Won't you tell your brothers and your sisters tonight
That you tasted the water and the water was right?

Won't you taste the sugar, won't you dance the dance?
Won't you wake up? Please and come on out of your trance
Everybody make believe that you disappear

For a second or two, gonna feel so queer
And you left behind all your rage and fear
And it made you feel like water

Street smart dawg and I can get it on planes
Dropped out of school when I bought my first thing
Eleven fucking grade and it was ninety-nine mane
Now several years later I'm that nigga in the tall (?)
Ima crush their feelings when I pull out the (?)
Now their feelings are all hurt, cause I'm rocking Prada shoes
On the block with Gucci Mane y'all niggas ain't hear the news
Neimen Marcus where I'm going shopping buying designer shoes
If you (?) the work boss dammit I'll fire you
But if your real street smart nigga I'll hire you
Young juice man goddammit I'm fly too

I'm a nigga from the hood can't read real good
But I can sell dope good I can sell weed good
Didn't listen to my mama or the goddamn preacher
On the low I got more money than the goddamn teacher
I'm a street smart nigga didn't read no books
Didn't take home economics but I sure can cook
Eighteen for a whole, nine-five for a half
Were good at English but great at math

For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow

That what we've had is still worthwhile
Don't you know that love's just like a thread
That keeps unraveling but then
It ties us back together in the end

In your eyes I can see my dream's reflections
In your eyes I found the answers to my questions
In your eyes I can see the reasons why our love's alive
In your eyes
We're drifting safely back to shore
And I think I've fin'lly learned to love you more

And she warns me that life changes
And that no one really knows
Whether time would make us strangers
Or whether time would make us grow
Even though the winds of time will change
In a world where nothing stays the same

Through it all our love will still remain

In your eyes I can see my dream's reflections
In your eyes I found the answers to my questions
In your eyes I can see the reasons why our love's alive

We're drifting safely back to shore
And I think I've fin'lly learned to love you more

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Oh girl lets crash a party 
El Dorado on the lawn 
Hey hey hey!
Let's burn holes in the carpet 
Take a shot at this linoleum tabletop 
Hey hey hey!
All night long
All night long 
Let's crash a party 
All night long 
Let's go 
All night long!",Crash the Party,2005
