Lil' Kim,"[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I got the magic stick

I hit the baddest chicks
Shorty don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you maaagic
(What? What?) Maaagic
I got the magic stick

[50 Cent]
I'm a freak to the core
Get a dose once, you goin' want some more
My tongue touch ya girl, ya toes bound to curl
This exclusive shit I don't share with the world

I have you up early in the mornin', moanin'
Back shot, proper or low can't stop us
Been a fiend for this since Rakim made hits
Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch

I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I skeet it up, straight beat it up..
... And I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n
I'm in the telly workin' up a sweat strokin'

Tonight's the night, you can fall in love
You can call your mama right now, tell her you met a thug
I pop a lot of shit cause I can back it up
My left stroke's the death stroke

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
I got the magic clit
I'm on fire, lick once, I get licked twice
I am the baddest chick
Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you maaagic
(What? What?) Maaagic, uh-huh uh-huh
I got the magic clit

[Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim not a whore
But I sex a nigga so good, he gotta tell his boys
When it, come to sex don't test my skills
'Cause my head game have you HEAD over heels

Give a nigga the chills, have him pay my bills
Buy matchin' Lambo's with the same color wheels
... And I ain't out shoppin' spendin' dudes see-notes
I'm in the crib givin' niggaz deep throat

Tonight Lil' Kim goin' have you in the zone
Girls, call ya crib, I'm answerin' the phone
Guys want to wife me and give me the ring
I'll do it anywhere, anyhow, I'm down for anything

Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps
This junk in my trunk ain't made for chumps
When Lil' Kim's around you don't need to lie
It's the ""Drugs"" baby, I'm makin' ya HIGH!!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] 
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice

Now put your face in it
I know you sprung off in your tongue, I know you tastin it

And the time is (one minute, six seconds)

Bum chicky, chicky bum

Bum chicky, chicky bum
Bum chicky, chicky bum

We 'bout to crush all competition
Ain't no chance for ya'll
Lil' Kim and Shanice, we 'bout to dance on ya'll
Like a flow in the club, it don't matter where you come from
USA to UK, shake ya bum bum
Sean Paul dime, keep my hair done all the time
Even got a manicurist in the booth while I rhyme
Initials on our jackets like Laverne and Sheryl
Kids rock my Queen Bee logo like a PowerPuff Girl
We stay on tour from summer to winter
And we rockin' public schools and daycare centers
Uh, united we stand, divided you fall
D flawless necklace look like a disco ball
Whoa, ya'll don't really want it with the whole Beehive
We goin' down in history, the illest gangstas alive
Put ya hands on your shoulders, push 'em up, push 'em up
If you feel it in your bones, shake it up, shake it up

[Chorus]

Now I know I ain't grown, but that don't stop me
From shakin' my anus
See I'm 'bout to blow, I'm soon to be famous
Now me and Lil' Kim on the same track is crazy
Matter fact you can call that amazing
Back to back, shakin' our bum bums
Picture us in the war, back to back shakin' off dumb-dums
In YO, that's where I come from
My talents official, act up, the hounds'll come get you
You can catch me on my toes in them D&G flip-flops
Hopin' outta mommy's new burgundy six drop
What, I can't stop what I do for real
It's like for ya'll I just got to prove my skills
Oh, I got a ring filled with all baguettes
Nails done, fresh Dobbie no barrettes
All I ask is that ya'll show respect
While I do my thing
And shake it up with the coolest Queen, uh
(Uh)

[Chorus]

Jack Be Nimble (Jack better be quick)
It's the Queen and the Princess (Jack ain't spit)
Like that news van 
(On NBC to) 
Sophisticated bad girls (Ya'll them mad girls)
Ya'll them birds everybody done had girls
While dudes sendin' me diamonds and pearl sweaters
(They little brothers send me sneakers and love letters)
Next to Bill Gates, I'm tryna be runner up
Like the elevator shaft, baby girl is comin' up
(It's the ill collaboration from the Brook to the Yonks)
No more franks for this ma, now it's lobster and conck
To my kids in the hood, this one's for you
(Grown folks and grandmas can shake they bum bum too)
So come on (Come on) Come on

Lil' Kim,"[Scratched]
Fuckin', fuckin'
Fuckin', fuckin'
Fuckin', fuckin'
Fuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy

[Verse"" 1 Lil' Kim]
Ms. White, that bitch with a thousand looks
Come through with a thousand crooks
I just know what it takes to get this money like Blow
Catch a body, get a face lift, disappear like Pablo
Ya'll niggas think I won't jump in the heap
Well let's dance, you lames are finished
I serve all ya'll cowards like a game of tennis
Act like you want some of this and I'll give you the business
You see the yellow and black, you know what it's about
Wrinkled assed niggas gets ironed, to straighten you out
I got thugs in the east, thugs in the south
That'll stick with the AIDS needle and piss in your mouth
I kept 'em on a leash and now it's time to let 'em out
Better pray to Jehovah, the game is over
Don't ever, ever, ever, ever underestimate
Lil' Kim the postergirl at 718
Ride outta town with my nigga, holdin' his weight
After it's cooked, chopped in eights the size of plates
You bitches ain't been through shit, you just minors
What you know about stuffin' half a bricks in your vagina
It's the dick licker, it's the baby sipper
Ain't a bitch alive can make a nigga cum quicker
Baby girl's pussy get wetter than a shower cap
Got my mans back like a Jansport napsack
And Queen Bee gon' bring you nothin' but heat
Homicide is lookin' for me for killin' these beats
You in the wrong department, this the upperclass section
You hoes is startin' to irritate me like a yeast infection
Good heavens, somebody get the Monostat 7
And hit me why don'tcha, hit me why don'tcha
The boss lady, I hold it down for my badies
Rappers better run and hide 'cause here comes the Beehive

[Verse 2: Reeks]
It's your boy, Money Cash, I get love in the streets
Breathin' dro colored Benz's with dutch colored seats
Lay in the crib on Tuesdays, duckin' the sweep
Nigga jump off, then get pumped off your feet
I'm like Rostein, low key and brilliant with numbers
I'm tryna blow sticky in Brazil with the Hummer
If you spittin' and I'm grippin' this tech
Then that's 32 shots, our throwback's like Mitchell and Ness
Man, I'm a project nigga, still piss on the steps
And keep the brim on my fitted a little twist to the left
I play the block, fifth in my sweats, reppin' my set
It's Rossie from the pharmacy, get it correct 

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
[scratched]
The Beehive
Fuckin', fuckin'
Fuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy
Fuckin' with the Tef-Teflon bitch
Beehive
Fuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy
Now putcha hands around your mouth and holler out
The Beehive

[Verse 3: Bunky S.A.]
Yo, it's Bunky S to the A, and my guns ain't warm
Beatin' niggas close to death with my house slippers on
You ain't a thug cocksucka, you a coward to front
Fuck your project, your building got flowers in front
Every chick I roll with, OZ in the cunt
I was OT in Mass, pushin' flower for months
Sprinklin' gun powder, oughta put a haze on my blunt
I spit a hundred and fifty bars when I'm blazin' 'em out
'Cause I can do that with razor blades stuck in my mouth
Forget a hotel, I'm fuckin' shorty right on the couch
Any rap shit I ever barked on, to hot to handle
And my rims bigger than lower Manhattan manholes
Listen up for 2003 tan rover
Stash box hold guns like Afgan soldiers
Wanna murda 16, well we the niggas you call
Queen Bee and Gotti Kids, muthafuck all ya'll

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Vee]
Uh, yo Vee The Kid, that's the name I earned in the streets
'Cause my bars so hot, it be burnin' the beats
Melt my pen, I have slugs meltin' your chin
When I throw you over the bridge, they helpin' you swim
And you better wear a metal hat when you rappin' on stage
Or have my bullets like e-mail, packin' your waves
Or snatch your face off like I'm Nicolas Cage
And it could be five of ya'll, puttin' eight in your grave
'Cause niggas think they hard, but they softer than bread
When them shells hit your throat, you be coughin' up lead
The next step is to off you, dead
I'ma cut your fuckin' head off and have Kim auction your head (Beehive)
See the kid don't rap for love, I rap for cheques
Even if I know you, I demand respect
And if I put you in the body bag, your man is next
The Advakid and Queen Bee gon' leave the game in a mess (Beehive)

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Goldie]
It's young Goldie, the Advakid, put you to rest
I ride around with two 38's tucked in my sweats
A pump in trunk and a nine under the seat
Enough ammo to blow the earth from under your feet (Beehive)
And we got cake for killas like Hyde and Jeckyl
Snippers put red dots on your face like freckles
Don't make me have to reach for the lead
You'll think the bullets was rain drops how they all hit your head
I'm that slim kid that they say is probably hot
She only with me 'cause of what she think I probably got
Am I gon' be with her for long, probably not
Unless you're cute and suck a dick like a lollipop
Niggas talk about guns and they just bust caps
Niggas talk aboit ki's whey they just flip packs
When it come to my money, suggest you gimmie that
'Cause you know bullets fly in pairs like Petey Pab
(Beehive)

[Chorus]

Now putcha hands around your mouth and holler out
The Beehive",Tha Beehive,2003
Lil' Kim,"Yo I just don't understand
Lately, it seems like I don't know
It just seems like it seems like
Everybody wants

My style, my life, my blood
My shoes, my clothes, my gear
My watch, my rings, my chain
My cars, my money, my home
My body, my sweat, my tears
My power, my fame, my strength
My shit, my this, my that
Bitches, please!

[Chorus]
If you don't stop;
Someone's gonna find yo' ass dead (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna poison your food (this is a warning)
Someone's puttin' tags on your toes (this is a warning)
Someone better pray for you (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna get yo' keys (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna open your door (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna creep in your house (this is a warning)
And put the } straight in your, mouth
This is a woman's, threat (this is a woman's)

Have you ever heard the story, about the M.A.F.I.A. tip
See Big Poppa was shot, a long long long long time ago
And when he was killed, he left me with the throne
And now it seems like, everyone wants my blood

[Chorus]

Don't stop, no no
You'll be sorry
Keep doin it, you'll see
You'll be cryin
I know, whatchu doin
'Cause I'm watchin
Hohhhhohhhohhhhohoohohohhhhohohhhhhhh

I introduce to you (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
The Queen Bee (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
She hold the crown in this game (Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?)
Ladies and Gentleman

It's the worlds famous, Lil' Kim, Queen Bee
I am who I am, you just can't change me
No matter what you do, you can't take the hood out me
People been around me for years, don't know shit about me
Dedicated, like Muslims makin' selat
People steady try to make me into somethin' I'm not
That's why I had to cut the grass, so I could see the snakes
Copped the house on the hill so I could see the lakes
What you thought? I'm a girl, couldn't make it alone
Time to turn the heat up and get back in the zone
One day my hairs orange, the next day it's green
The trendsetter's back on your TV screen

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)
Tryna change me (Tryna change me)

No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

About five feet even, kinda small in the waist
Rap's sex symbol, real pretty in the face
So what I got even bigger titties than the lakes
Still a sophisticated lady with millions in the safe
Switch up flows like I switch up my clothes
More than Wilt Chamberlain switched up his hoes
I'm a profectionist, gotta stay on my toes
Anything goes when you play with the pro's
I got everybody rappin' about jewelry and cars
Lil' Kim give you a platinum sixteen bars
I'm the real thing, ya'll kareokee stars
This is who I am

No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

I'd rather be dead and rich than broke and livin'
Without rap, I probably woulda been sellin' dope in prison
With some Vera Wang khakis and Nolteychucks
Suckin' the warden's dick in the back of the bus
But God made me what I am today
So I say things ya'll afraid to say
Just 'cause you got a head start that don't make you strongest
He who burns last, burns the longest
Fuck what they say about me
Fact is I'm the legacy of B.I.G.
The Queen of New York, let's get this straight
I'm about to be elected mayor of 718

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)

We put stitches in yo' motherf**kin dome like a league brawl

Take a journey to the realm of the truth when I bust this
It's the Duke and the Duchess
Leavin haters 'buked and on crutches
Niggaz you cannot touch this
It's a new collaboration of Thug Luv
between the Thug Queen and the Thug Lord
More power than a drug lord
Meant to be because we love each other the way we love war
Gotta rider bet hug yours, cause I'm full of ambition
and ammunition and a 50 like I smoked a sticky stack of hash
Ain't no missin on no critical condition
Murderin is the mission and we can bust a itchy atcha ass
Feel the flow when I drop it
Don't when to stop it, I'm goin pockets and layin bodies down
Feel adrenaline from me and Kim and them
We got it sewed from Brooklyn to Chi-Town
See the artillery, we don't fuck around with silly games, plenty
thangs
Nigga plus I got an illy aim, stick 'em up, steal his chain
Then I spill his brain, then I feel his pain
Some of the consequences when you dealin with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Queen, we gon' take over the world

For those who doubt this, the game is ours (we gon' run you up

But the billion jackpot's what I aim for
Get your hands in the air, put 'em up, keep 'em high
Don't want no problems - JUST GIMME WHAT I CAME FOR!
Pull up on your block, eight straight Hummers
Bout to have it locked, eight straight summers
Bank account hold eight straight numbers
Ain't no room for you whack newcomers
We the people's choice because we kick that
nasty ""Hardcore"" shit that you want to hear
Can't fuck with us, hands down we win best murder rap of the
year
Pounds to the misters, hugs for the miss
Bombs in the mail, sealed with a kiss
All my bitches pop that thing like this
All my niggaz wave that bling on the wrist
Some of the consequences when you dealin with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Duke, we gon' take over the world

Strapped while I roll on chrome
Lookin for the ones we at war with

Havin big dreams while we back up this work together

Even if we gotta slang dubs
Go to war because I love blood, with a Queen by my side
Whatchu know about Thug Luv?

Male groupies, girl groupies
They're all gon' side with us

The one point game I fucked around and hit a three
Swish, all fuckin' net
It's the fourth quarter you're pourin' down sweat

Rap's M.V.P. don't you ever forget
Since you came in this game are there any regrets?
And y'all, dukes are lame don't let 'em back in
What? You ain't heard? Keep at it again

Yo, it's cold at the camp but I'm in it till it's over
Notorious soldier thought I told ya
Niggas is pissin' me off right now
But like that dance, I'm a shake 'em off right now

Who's hot and who's not what's rap and what's not
Whatever nigga I take your spot and your spot
Move work from your block to your block
The neighborhood better keep they fuckin' door locked

Beanie told y'all but I got proof
I speak the truth, every time I step in the booth
Uh, pretty things is all that I mean
Better listen to the words that she sings

(What's the word?)
She at it again
(What's the word?)
She in it to win
(What's the word?)
She back and she's stayin'
(What's the word?)
The bitch ain't playin'

And now I could see why y'all all on me
You need a hot remix you could call on me
Niggas do dirty work the shit fall on me
But I could hold that weight and still bake that cake

We get it on in Brooklawn no lie
Bed Stuy holla back B.I. till I die
We get it on in Brooklawn no lie
Bed Stuy holla back B.I. till I die

Get money always but I ain't givin' up rap
Come on now, y'all should know me better than that
I mean, this is somethin' I'm a veteran at
Buy me out, you need more cheddar than that

Who's hot and who's not, what's rap and what's not
Whatever nigga I take your spot and your spot
Move work from your block to your block
The neighborhood better keep they fuckin' door locked

I'm the shit I'm the bread winner
Who's the bitch I'm the big spinner
I give 'em a taste they just want more
Word on the street is I'm who they waitin' for

(What's the word?)
She goin' for delf
(What's the word?)
She 'bout to reinvent herself
(What's the word?)
She reppin' the hood
(Yo what's the word?)
Yeah, the bitch look good

I'm the shit I'm the bread winner
Who's the bitch I'm the big spinner
I give 'em a taste they just want more
Word on the street is I'm who they waitin' for

(What's the word?)
She at it again
(What's the word?)
She in it to win
(What's the word?)
She back and she's stayin'

Lil' Kim,"[Lil Mo] 
Ladies I wrote me a manual
How to keep your man
These rules you must follow 
My 10 commandments (oo oo oo)
Let me break it down for you
Rule number 1 
Never give him someone to turn to at night
Rule number 2
Never bring your man around your crew
Rule number 3
Never call him first let him call you
Rule number 4
Never let him know your every move
Rule number 5
Never tell him about your past
How many other lovers you've had
How many other lovers went bad
Make no exceptions
If you want it to last

[Chorus:] 
Girl you got to understand him
If you want to keep your man whipped
Follow my 10 commandments
And he'll keep coming back for more
And more and more 

[Lil Mo] 
Rule number 6
Never mix business with pleasure
Rule number 7
Never move in unless he tell you
Rule number 8
Never tell your friends about your bedroom 
Rule number 9
Never let them know his shoe size
Rule number 10
Should have been rule number 1
'cause If you give in on the first night
Make sure you ride that thing
Scream his name
And he'll be yours for life
'cause you know your excited
(Cos you know your excited)
And you just can't fight it
And you wanna tell all your friends
But you've got to make sure loves intact
Because you want him to keep coming back 

[Chorus: x2] 

There's never no such thing as giving him to much
'cause if you want to wed with your man
You can never give enough
'cause you get excited
And wanna tell everybody
But you've got to make sure
Loves intact
Then it will help you bring him back

[Lil Kim] 
I've been in this thing for years
It made me an animal
Me and my girl
Mo wrote you'll a manual
Step by step booklet for you to keep
Your man in place 
And out the next girls' face
Rule number 1
Never give a dude money
Girl don't be a dummy
Let the homie stay bummy
'cause once he start,
He don't stop, 
That's it
And all he gonna do is spend it on the next chic
Rule number 2 
Before you give him some
It's your way
Shop in a new car
Now that what I call for play
Now don't get me wrong
Respect your man
But if dude gets out of line 
Then check your man
Rule number 3
Should have been rule number 1
Never go down
Till he licks you round
Your neck, your back, your puss and ass crack 
Rule number 4, 5 and 6
Very important lessons
Keep your man guessing
Never let him see you stressing
And if you love here's 7, 8, 9 and 10
Never ever ever mess with his friend
See if you follow these
You'll have mad red to breaka house on the beach
And mad trips to jaca
He'll be home at night cooking you a steaka
And he'll keep coming back for more
On the wake up 

[Chorus: x2] 

Understand If you want to keep your man
And you want to hold on to him
Keep your man whipped
Follow my 10 commandments
Ha
You got it
Ha
Keep coming back for more
Understand
Keep your man
My command
More and more and more
More and more and more",Ten Commandments,2003

Kiss his feet for freedom.

I ain't chillin til' I'm out parachutin'.
Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds.
Twenty five thousand a piece.
Fuck streets!
Tryin' to own the island.
Forget about wilin'.
Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'.
If I showed you where I lived you would think I was hidin'.

We blow brains out, we tear the club up, pull them things out

Far from gangstas, really hush puppies

(Niggas) Grab your dick if you love hip-hop
(Bitches) Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Gotcha, open off the words I say because
""This type of shit it happens everyday""

Now who smoke more blunts than a little bit?
What are you a idiot?
Listen to the lyrics I spit like M1's
Got mad guns up in the cabin
'Cause Cease ain't the one for the dibbin' and dabbin' shit
I make it happen, you got your ass caught
All you saw was fire, from the Honda Passport
Or the M.P., what if you see, then I miss ya
I blow up spots like little sisters
G'wan grit ya teeth, g'wan bite ya nails to the cuticles
Like Murray, my killings, be the most beautiful
Junior M.A.F.I.A. click, thick like Luke dancers
Niggas grab your gats, bitches take a glance at
The little one, pullin over in the Land Rover
Playin' Big Willie style with a chauffeur, yaknahmean?
Stack the green, read all between the lines
A nigga act up, makes the bastard hard to find

(How ya livin' Biggie Smalls?) I'm surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers even the sheisty individuals
Smokin' skunk and mad Phillies
Beatin' down Billy Badasses, cracks in stacks and masses
If robbery's a class, bet I pass it
Shit get drastic, I'm buryin' ya bastards
Big Poppa never softenin'
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offerin'
Leave the fucker coughin' up blood, and his pockets like rabbit ears
Covered the wife, Kleenex for the kid's tears
Versace wear, Moschino on my bitches
She whippin' my ride, countin' my one's, thinkin' I'm richest
Just the way players play, all day everyday
I don't know what else to say
I've been robbin' niggas since Run and them was singin' ""Here We Go""
Snatchin' ropes at the Roxie homeboy you didn't know my flow, 
Detrimental to your health
Usually roll for self, I have son ridin' shotgun
My mind's my nine, my pen's my Mac-10
My target, all you wack niggas who started rappin'
Junior M.A.F.I.A. steelo, niggas know the half
Caviar for breakfast, champagne bubble baths
Runnin' up in pretty bitches constantly
The Smalls bitch, who the fuck it was supposed to be?

I used to pack Macs in Cadillacs
Now I pimp gats in the Ac's, watch my niggas backs
Nines in the stores, glocks in the bags
Maxin' mini-markets, gettin' money with the Arabs
No question, confession, yes it's the lyrical
Bitches squeeze your tits, niggas grab your genitals
Proteins and minerals, excluse subliminals
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals
I kick the reali' with my peeps all day
325's roll by with the windows down halfway
D-K-N-Y, oh my, I'm jiggy
It's all about the Smalls and my fuckin'' nigga Biggie

Lil' Kim,"[T.I.]
As you see the O.G.s from Grand Hustle done laid it down again
T.I.P. shorty
Hey yo, this for all my homegirls like to see a baller do his thing
Get ya shit together come on
All the eight, nines, and dimes
I'd like to welcome y'all to the best time of ya life
Ya understand that
All the stones is real
And it's all chrome on the wheels, ya know
Anything less is uncivilized

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Pull up to the club, lift both doors up
Hopped out clean and yo ho chose us
Walked in the door, make the show hold up
Cause my neck and my bracelet is so froze up
The kind of stones bitches wanna see close up
So we don't approach them, they come and approach us
Roll the dro up then go post up
Look down with the west fixin' go sho' nuff
In the V.I.P. and all eyes on us
Hoes chill, poppin' pills blowin' dro no dust
What you say, got a man so what
I don't know him baby and he don't know her
I got a new Phantom and my own chauffeur
Ya think ya fixin' be thinkin' bout him, no sir
Probably prefer to tel ya man good night
Unless you don't wanna know what the good life look like

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
If you ain't gettin' money good night
I know what a broke nigga look like
When ya ridin' in ya wheels get ya shit together
Boy them diamonds ain't real, get ya shit together

[T.I.]
Now we can ball seven days, six nights
If that head and that pussy hit right
Hey, match ya panties with ya bras get ya shit together
Go get ya hair and nails done get ya shit together

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey, I'm off the scene with Louis the thirteenth
Chains swings to my jeans, and my T-shirt clean
In case you been researching, I'm the King
With a style as mean as the Earth seem
Chest on ice, and my wrist on gleam
30 karats in the ring, money ain't no thing
You think I'm playin' but I ain't joking
The dro king, if it ain't purple, I ain't smoking
Rubberband bank rolls, fifty thousand dollar cheddar knots
Try to shine, is you out your mind, boy you better not
I walk around with more money than you ever got
Shrewd attitude like I never had to sell a rock
Shorty I can get you in whatever spot
Backstage, front row, what I got to front for
I'm getting bored, don't even know what I stunt for
Got a lot of rides, what it hurt to cop one more

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
To all my hot girls, if you wanna come chill
Or roll on chrome wheels, let me tell you what it is
We fixin' throw a little party at the crib
Where the floors tricked out and the rooms like ill
The basement's cool, but the pools unreal
Where that millionaire lives, shit remains concealed
So pop a pill, put on your blindfold
I'm hitting the dance floor, and grab eighty-nine more
Let em' know we on the way where they been trying to go
I knew I had em' when they asked me ""What kind of diamonds are those""
Headed to the spot pouring double shots of XO
Play the ""Love Below"" and watch 'em undress slow
Flicks on the flat screen, make em' want to ""Get Low""
And spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole
When they kick it with the king, they don't wanna let go
So what you gonna tell a nigga, when he tell ya ""Let's Go""

I heard she goin' to jail, I heard she out on bail
She done fucked up now

Why she get her nosed fixed, why she got bigger tits
Man, get off my girl's shit

Everybody talkin', all these haters hawkin'
Paparazzi stalkin' takin' pictures while I'm walkin'
Damn, can't a bitch breathe, gimmie room please
I'm in the paper e'ry day if I piss or sneeze

I used to ride in a rental Lebaron
Now you can catch me in the SLR Mercedes McLaren
Gotta put the doors up, haters pick ya jaws up
I'm in the Trump International, thirty floors up

You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin'
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people if you feel me get this whole shit jumpin'

Used to talk about the way I wore my clothes
Now every chick look like Lil' Kim in they videos
Now don't come around here with that Wendy Williams shit
Get yo facts straight or shut up, bitch

I heard she mad rich, I heard she dead broke
I heard she sniffin' coke

Whores heated 'cause Momma back and hotter than before

I does what you can't, I'm everythin' that you ain't
I'm La Bella Don, the biggest bitch in the biz
So don't hate me, nigga, it is what it is

You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin'
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people if you feel me get this whole shit jumpin'

So don't believe e'rythin' you hear

I just keep climbing up the ladder, y'all never stop my swagger
All this petty chitter-chatter only make my packets fatter
Some peoples jobs just to talk about Lil' Kim
Let's face it, I'm a way of life for all of them

Tabloid magazines rate worst and best dressed
They got some nerve when the ones who do the ratings look a mess
Star Jones don't like me, she cheap and I like the best
Damn, it must feel good to Payless

You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin'
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people if you feel me get this whole shit jumpin'

You know niggaz hate to see another nigga eat
Quick to put another niggaz business in the street
I wish they'd shut the fuck up, damn good grief
You know your mouth's a cage for your tongue
If you just close your teeth

I heard she sniffin' coke

She's back, oh my God
You had a voodoo doll and everything, worthless bitch
You just knew, 'Don't let her come back Jesus
Please don't let her come back'

But she's back bitches
Haha, okay look, just, on the count of three
Stop focusing on her and think about you for a second
Now ain't that depressing, ain't it depressin'
See, that's why don't nobody talk about you

Ain't nothin' to talk about
Get yourself a hobby, bitch, learn how to make a quilt or sumin'
Ha, is it really that you hate you?
That's what it is ain't it, just punch yourself in the mouth then, bitch

And keep me two baby glocks, both of 'em loaded with a full clip
Still I gotta be on a mission for paper
But later on I'm a be hanging out with everybody
Never knew I should of been scared of the hottie
I got up with later on at the R. Kelly party
So I pull up the club in the Coupe
Look at how them jeans hugging the boots
Saw me ippy uppy icy as hell, f'rilla good smell
Have you ever seen a thug in a suit? Jacking bitches up
Socializing with everybody flirting with girls but got plans to go home
Till I felt the way you was backing up on the thing
Getting down on the floor I could see the top of the thong
She a (bad motherfucker) she could bass a deuce
A fine-ass Medusa make your dick turn to stone
Take a look at the thong, get in the zone, took a shot of Patron
And I was gone, she a (bad motherfucker)
Take a look at them hips, and how she licking them lips
Like she was licking ice cream
Balling with a bad bitch that ain't yours on the scene
Listening to some Al Green might (""make you do wrong"")

That's a girl that you shouldn't of fucked with
But she so seductive, got a nigga head gone
Now you know it ain't right, got a girl at home
But tonight she the type that'll (""make you do wrong"")
{This nigga that you shouldn't of fucked with}
{But he so seductive, had a bitch head gone}
{Now you know it ain't right, got a man at home}
{But tonight he the type that'll} (""make you do wrong"")

I got the champagne and popped the top
And then unlocked the lock, the Queen 'bout to get her bang on
I don't know what I'm a tell my dog
When he look up and realize that a bitch ain't came home
Shit, he about to be rocking it
Looking sweeter than chocolate, he got the smell of a Reese's
Break a fella to pieces, it's a hell of a thesis
Adjusting his body with telekinesis
Got on top and then he knocked me off, until he was soft
Got in the car and dropped him off
Trying to sink down as low as I can up in my seat
Cause I'm rolling in the Hummer and the top was off
My guy sleeping anyway and that's whats up
But I'm paranoid, driving fast as fuck
Thinking 'bout what I did, I try to sneak in the crib
Here come my man in the front, asking me what (""make you do wrong"")

[Chorus]

I don't know what you talking 'bout
Baby wont you go on back to sleep
I was at the police station, when you hanging in the club
Wit'cha boys getting drunk 20 deep it'll (""make you do wrong"")

If you got up with a ho
Should of told the bitch use another douche
If you was at the police station, should of smelled like heist
But you coming in smelling like puss what will (""make you do wrong"")

Well I couldn't resist
Cause she was thick as hell and so cute
Steady coming at me, she was throwing it all on me
And I couldn't leave, she had a big dookie shoot, it'll (""make you do wrong"")

Well I know what you talking about
So we can do it like this
I'm a go and ride, you can do what you do
Cause I done met another brother with some bomb-ass, it'll (""make you do wrong"")",Do Wrong,2005

I hear the snakes hiss, talkin' reckless
Thought I'd let it go, and I wouldn't stress it
Haters in the street - y'all worse than the press is
And they all wanna hang like the charm on my necklace
I guess things just ain't the same for gangsters
How a snitch nigga make a record called ""Wankstas""
Everything these haters do just to degrade ya
Only made me strong; I say thanks for the favor
Now the D.A. wanna give me time in the feds

The only way to reach him through phone calls and mail
Balloons stuffed with lah up in the cho-cha
Now my man in the can gettin' money and gettin' high
He used to keep my fly: he had the six, I had the five
So you know a chick gon' ride or die for her guy

At age sixteen I was movin' that work
Gettin' paid for drivin' state to state

Pull up with my nigga in the eighty four yacht
Man this hatin' don't stop
Real recognize real you studio gangsters kill me
I know my vets in the game got to feel me
Cause from the gate I down the door
Like Eddy Murphy I gave it to you raw
Two-piece bikini, Fendi mink draggin' on the floor
Kim been the first lady since I dropped Hard Core
A lot of these hoes livin' vicariously through me
Steada doin' them, they'd rather do me
Watchin' them is like a Broadway play
Sittin' next to the Queen 
Is the closest they'll ever get to Brooklyn
Why ya'll frontin' you know who the best be

Show me a man, who never sin yet, uh-uh

But instead they indicted me for my fuckin' music
This jealous motherfucker and this prosecutin' dyke bitch
Probably go home, listen to How Many Licks
Stay away from 5-0, that's that hiphop cop
These cheese eatin' rodents really got the game caught
You see when you on top, niggas want what you got
Even though they idolize you, they still criticize you

So don't preach to me bout singing , I, I am just a woman
You've got your feelings I got mine, I'm only human
And I gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on
I've gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on
I'm tryin' to go down as a gyal who know how to get it on

Hey get your mind off of mine and get to gettin' yours
Throw your bottles in the sky if you're gettin' yours

Play all day on the Siruis, radio
Satellite TV, who do it like me?
In designer outfits, while sellin' the tag
Yves Saint Laurent boots, Yves Saint Laurent bag
Keep the Pokeman in case a big bitch think I'm ass
Eatin' through her stomach like a gastric, bypass
Bitch you better buy a pass and you better have the cash
When you in my town you got to see me to buy a pass
Number one rule, think B.I.G.

Like an old album, you happen to come for us
You guys get dust off
It's the young boss, show you what the imp us for
Family and friends be the only ones missin' boy
Sayin' that you rich and all, tell me what'chu bitchin' for
Maybe cause I'm gettin' mine - well is you gettin' yours?

Have you duckin' on the shit, wanna let the burner spit
Get bucked bitch, give a fuck who you run and get

Bricks in the pipeline, sold in the nighttime
Take a lifetime to find a flow that's quite like mine
40 cal's and 45 glocks, I don't like nine
Mac-9 and automatic flatten niggaz lifeline
I'm already rich, use the rappin as a pastime
Grand Hustle bitch and I ain't settle for the last time
Other niggaz settle down cause I don't bag mine
You see me pull it I'ma blast, I don't flash mine
You niggaz livin' check to check but I don't cash mine
Deposit it and let it sit cause all the cash mine
Been goin easy on you rappers I'ma mash now

All these stu-di-o gangsters, year after year
With these gimiicks I can't take it they ain't real so they fakin it
How did they make it in this game for so long
I know what's right from what's wrong, I know what's soft from what's hard
I know a federal case, from a publicity charge
Man I FOUGHT tooth and NAIL to keep them PUNKS out of JAIL
But hoes wanna go to COURT 'til I pay them for they NAILS
Who you tryin to be? Man it couldn't be me
My man spent guap and bought me my Continental T
You spent your advance on your Continental T
I know you sick when you clean your RIMS you still see a Bee
And we see you a LIAR, tryin to DENY HER

And if I don't like you then I will pretend to
It's the ones that befriend you that TURN up against you
In the court of law and drop a DIME like Sprint do
Supposed to be tough huh? 'Til them boys touch ya
Chump muh'fuckers start confessin like Usher
I cut you off cause I knew I couldn't trust ya
Lame ass bustas, backwards-ass hustlers
You fake phony, you always was lil' homey
Big lil' son bab' boy like Jody

It be the SAME ones talkin 'bout the guns they sparkin
The dogs never bite but do a whole lotta barkin
A whole lotta growlin 'til the wolves start howlin
They pitbull shit, man them niggaz straight cowards
Got 'em scared to death, pissin in they trousers
Always was a bitch that's why I sent his ass flowers
Thanks to the Queen he can share 'em with his team
You can run top speed BUT YOU CAN'T DODGE THE BEAM

They wanna catch you slippin (you've been slippin, slippin)

Niggaz done, flipped the script and got on some sheist shit
Sellin they soul when love is priceless
They kicked me when I was down and stuck in a crisis
I kept it all in and now I'm 'bout to erupt
Man, FUCK the law the whole system's corrupt
A street grudge put me in front of a judge
But I stood there like what, the Bee don't budge
It's a foul game, no such thing as fair play
And real niggaz get railroaded everyday
Words misconstrued and used against you
Then you get screwed when it's time to sentence you
World cavin in, it's a shitty sitch-I-ation
A year and a day, three years probation
Public humiliation, poor representation
Guilty by association

You a target, and now they tryin to get in the pockets
Lawsuits, lawyers prosecute for profit
Meanwhile the media promotin the gossip
I had to say it, cause I'm that real with it
You shinin like a star, then you gotta deal with it
And dudes pick to take these groupies to bed
Better watch it 'fore they write a book about like Superhead
Fuck 'em and leave 'em then they after your paper
Put a hole in the condom and say that you raped her
See you can be a rapper, athlete or an actor
Believe me, these devils find a way to get at'cha
All it takes is some green and your face on the screen
Fuck it, just say I took one for the team

Now don't you know that they want to, catch you

In these streets you gotta sleep with one eye open
And watch for the snakes and the Jakes approachin
'Cause it could be the ones that you laugh and joke wit
The ones you smoke wit, and sold your coke wit
I set you up for the right piece of change
And have your brains on the dashboard of the Range
Too often, I seen a nigga layin in the coffin
All cause some shit was blown out of proportion
Everywhere you go you gotta move with caution
'Cause the rap game ain't much different than the crack game
It's the new hustle, gotta have brains and muscle
Get too much money and these haters wanna touch you
Now I can see why they all on me
Niggaz do dirty work, the shit fall on me
Not only do you gotta watch the boys in blue
But the niggaz in your crew you gotta watch them too

Every time you come out you got some more hot shit
Doing some more shit that bit as 'round the country go

Sexy ladies, goin' crazy, cause the beat's like whoa whoa whoa

[Lil' Kim]
Fresh out the federal building
To Bentley Coupes with the convertible ceilings
It's the black widow, call me Miss White
I done been through it all, shootouts and fistfights

Crooklyn bitch, you go wrong I get right
Back with a classic, now gimme six mics
Can't reach me on the phone, then send a bitch a kite
Man I do's it in heels or a pair of crisp Nikes

Stand behind Martin Luther King, but I'm more like Malcolm X
Guerillas beatin on they chest, get it right on Malcolm X
Just keep the peace, cause if cowards show me disrespect
My niggaz put his soul to rest and I don't wanna see you stressed

Champagne at my campaign, Kim for mayor
Told you I'm the same bitch from the escalator
And I ain't trippin off you rats and investigators
Get your envelopes, time to address the haters

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Me and my team, we tryin' to own casinos
So we can all cop dreams like Pacino's
Come through in the oh-six Benz-itos
The feds tryin' to shut us down like Nino

We keep it goin man, we keep it goin' man
Won't stop, can't gotta keep it goin' man
See I do it for the fans, they'll never understand
While they goin' off course, me I'm stickin' to the plan

Feel the movement, it's a whole new crew
Fuck Junior M.A.F.I.A., that chapter is through
Them faggots done did somethin' that they can't undo
Whoever ridin' with 'em they can get one too

Could a copped to a one to three do
Still took it to trial, even though I blew
Crooklyn style, that's how we do it
I'll gangsters and ain't got to prove it

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Now a party ain't a party 'til the Queen come through
You know where I go, man the team come too
Pull up in the Phantom or the V-1-2
Lil' Kim's that girl, even got her own shoe

In the club with my clique though, glass full of Crist-al
In the jail jumpsuit, still a bad bitch though
Rose from the ghetto it was hard from the get go
Then I showed the hood the world ain't just made for rich folk

Get ya little dance up, BK stand up
Straight to the dance floor, everybody hands up
Throw it up, get down, fellas hold your pants up
Ladies throw it right back, tell that nigga man up

You wanna sip Mo' on my living room flo'
Play Nintendo with Cease and Nino
Pick up my phone say ""Poppa not home""
Sex all night, mad head in the morn'
Spin my V, smoke all my weed
Tattoo on tittie saying ""B-I-G"". Now check it:
You wanna be my main squeeze, baby
Don'tcha? You want to give me what I need, baby
Won'tcha picture life as my wife? Just think
Full-length mink, fat X and O links
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that
Showed you the safe combinations and all that
Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
Shit got hot: you sent Feds to my spot
Took me to court, tried to take all I got
Another intricate plot, the bitch said I raped her
""Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?""
My Moschino ho, my Versace hottie
Come to find out you was fucking everybody
You knew about me, the fake ID
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C
Woe! Oh is me - that's what I get for trickin'
Pay my own bail, commence to ass-kickin'
Lick in the door, waving the .44
All you heard was ""Poppa don't hit me no more!""
Disrespect my clique, my shit's imperial
Fuck around and made her milk box material
You feel me? Sucking dick, running your lips
Cause of you, I'm on some real ""fuck-a-bitch"" shit

Niggas better grab a seat
Grab on your dick as this bitch gets deep
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch 6 feet
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound
Now I'm Billboard, now niggas press to hit it
Play me like a chicken, thinking I'm pressed to get it
Rather do the killing than the stick-up jukes
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm cumming down your throat
Then, you wanna be my main squeeze, nigga
Don'tcha? You wanna lick between my knees, nigga
Don'tcha want to see me whippin' your 3 down the Ave
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air
You get vexed and start swinging everywhere
Me shifty? Now you wanna pistol whip me
Pull out your 9 while I cock on mine
Yeah, what nigga? I ain't got time for this
So what, nigga? I'm not trying to hear that shit
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vittadini and Chanel 9 boots
Things that make up for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards saying ""I apologize""
Is you with me? How could you ever deceive me?
But payback's a bitch, motherfucker, believe me

That can't do for me

Fix your lips, put 'em together nicely and say
Say it along, say it along now, say

I seen him talking to his boy on the cellular phone
I looked at him and all he could say was

I keep my piece so sweet, yeah nice and warm
And all he could feel, was this love baby

About what they think, what they say

Call me anything they wanna name
I don't give a, I don't give a

I just wanna take him home
Take him to the house then turn him out
He ain't checkin' for you

I don't give a fuck
About what they think, what they say

Call me anything they wanna name

Four twenty four inch rims so heavy they hold the block down
Twenty four carrot necklace so heavy it hurt my neck
Three things you can't take away from me, money, power and respect
I got it and hold on to it you knew that I never let it go
You prostitute it but money I never let it ho
Speakin' of hoe's oh yes we meet em and we G' 'em dude
And we may see 'em but we wouldn't want to be 'em dude
I put my fist up, I got the power girl

I bounce into position like I am vinegar Kama Sutra
But money make me come, go and ask Luda'
And women cheat better than men we don't disturb them
My motto is ""what they don't know won't hurt them""
We just do it like you do, see the roles done switched

Cause you don't fuck us niggas we fuck you

stay posted up close with killers and cut throats
the thoroughest bitches who in they pussy stuff coke
as I cook and cut coke with the bakin' soda Arm and Hammer
palmin' hammers
think you crazy? nigga, my clique's bananas
takin' over with the Mafia
hittin' niggas for they bricks like Gracias
the cockiest, it's obvious, it's me, he, who?
confront frontin' niggas like ""You want it? well nigga, me too""

makin' guns after they made yours

let me warn ya, trip against my team you's a goner
infact it's drastic
a couple Million in the mattress
with a safe dick I say fuck taxes
rather endulge in duct tape pig tie tactics
crime pays

my destiny's vague, will I survive or blow trial?
lay shot up, Puff cryin' in denial
while my enemies smile, buried in style

Lil' Loo,"Elle savait ce qu’elle faisait.
Elle savait ce qu’il allait ce produire.
Ce soir était un soir ou la nuit lui appartenait.
Précieusement, charnue de désirs elle s’était glissée dans un bain chaud et impudique.
Avec précaution elle avait parfumé son corps de crème.
Elle savait que ce soir elle mettrait toutes ses valeurs dans le tiroir de sa mémoire.
Nez de clown, rouge.

Elle l’avait appelé.
Un café? Il avait répondu oui, il savait ce qu’il faisait.
Deux adultes. Deux adultes mais si enfantins, tellement seuls.
Personne ne saurait. Tuer le temps ensemble, ballon rouge.
Ils ne s’aimaient pas vraiment d’amour,
Ils aimaient être ensemble et partager des joies,
Des peines et soulager leurs désirs charnels.
Rien de plus, tristement.

Chez lui, un café, des paroles.
Des flots de paroles pour éviter tous regards.
Pour fuir des désirs, des envies. Un café.
Des secrets confiés, échangés. Banal.
Nez rouge, un soir fugace.

Puis il est l’heure de se séparer.
Lui offre un cadeau, elle sensible sens qu’une tension monte.
Il la raccompagne.
Et dans la voiture une phrase «j’ai envie de t’embrasser» déclenche un torrent de passion.
Trop longtemps retenu.
Pas de tapis rouge.

Avidement les lèvres se rencontrent, avidement des mains s’évadent.
Une chaleur se dégage.
Lui, plein de désir sous des mains câlines,
Elle, pleine de désirs sous des mains fouilleuse.
Plus rien ne les retient, la nuit les drape.
La nuit les couvre. Une jupe est remontée à la hâte.
Dans cette folie,
Une seule jambe de collant est enlevée
Pour offrir un sexe gonflé de désir une main glisse à l’intérieur,
Des cuisses chaudes de promesses.
Ballon rouge. Plus rien ne les arrête.

Le siège de la voiture se couche.
Puis lentement, délicieusement chacune des quatre mains déshabille l’autre.
Des baisers avides déchaînent deux corps demande.
Puis, les deux corps s’unissent, s’accouplent.
Tendrement, il pénètre en elle.
Tendrement il la pénètre.
Elle se cabre, l’invitant à rester, l’invitant à se donner.
Sans amour. Tout devient vivant.
Tout devient douleur.
De légers tressaillement envahissent les corps des deux amants.
Impudique dans leurs chairs, ils s’abandonne l’un dans l’autre.
Ils se donnent sans compter.
Ils prennent, ils donnent. Ils prennent.
Fulgurant de haine envers elle, elle joue à l’épanouie.
Le pastique du ballon rouge grince. 
Ballon rouge éclaté, tapis rouge enroulé, nez rouge de clown. 
C’est fini la tempête des sentiments charnels.
Chacun se rhabille mine de rien, mine de tout.
Pas un mot. Pas une promesse, pas un mot d’amour.
Que soulager des envies. La voiture démarre.
Tout est fini. Ne rien dire. 
Ballon rouge et vide grenier. 
Un au revoir, lancé à la hâte.

Demain elle reprendra un bain pour un amant lointain
Miroir ne triche pas, l’odeur qu’elle regarde pue.
Elle sait, le jeu est dégueulant de tristesse.
Une nouvelle histoire courte d’un jour,
Pour ne pas croire.
Mais dans un ventre trop lourd de secret,
Elle continuer son chemin vers une fin sans parole.
Mais ballon rouge va éclater",Tapis Rouge,2006

Feel free right now, going do what you want to do
Can't let nobody take it away, from you, from me, from we

And no time for negative vibes, cause I'm winning

Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror
No stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my mind right
I ain't gonna let you kill it

And I'm a still wear a smile if it raining
I got to enjoy myself regardless
I appreciate life, I'm so glad I got mine

I'm the most underrated, under-appreciated
Most sold to dated, fuck you rapper we GOT
See I don't drop every year to give you niggaz a shot
Now I might not get five mics or a double-XL (never)
But fuck it, you keep it, I'm a take the 100 mil'
And the Murciélago with the rim kitted Tahoe
The show stopper, when I ride all you hear is ""Bravo"" (bravo!)
And all you hear is, ""There he go""

When I was away look how I wrote to ya girl,
Wasn't I polite when I spoke to ya girl,
Tricked on you cop that coke for you girl,
I'd do anything but go broke for ya girl,
Since I'm a rapper I wrote a song for ya girl,
Since I'm a gun clapper I keep it warm for ya girl,
Lift some weights and keep it hard for ya girl,

No since, no reason, no rhyme,
Schizophrenia is hard to define,
Life's a mountain for you,I'm ready to climb,
Become the sun for you I shine,
Much more than all your other guys combined,
So you can tell them all to wait in line,
Cause a crime of passions still a crime,
Life ain't a movie girl you cant rewind,
But I play any role just to make you mine,
Even in the mirror you're one of a kind,
And I don't need nobody else to co-sign,

I keep it locked don't ever fear,
When it comes to my man I'm a be right here,
Keep it hustle when times are tough,
Never left me stranded it was all about us,
Kept coming home,
Kept running strong,
This love is meant to be life long,

Life is good when it's me and you together,
And when there's drama then I'm a do what ever,
Keep you warm in the stormy cold weather,
Leave you broken and lonely oh never,
Every work that I say is so clever,
When you feel it in your heart it gets you much wetter,
I am the original go getter,
I don't waste time fronting I go get her,
Stare at the devil and won't blink for ya girl,
Change the way that I think for ya girl,
Put it on paper waste the ink for ya girl,
Walk through the dessert without a drink for ya girl,
Central booking, rock pink for ya girl,
Step in quicksand and sink for ya girl,
Whatever the obstacle I'm a leap for ya girl,
End my life and go to sleep for ya girl,

c'mon  make it hot 
Ooh ooh (x2) 
Let me know  let me know 
What you want  what you want 
[Nicole Verse One] 
The curiosity  baby it's killing me 
Cause I can tell that you're interested  I 
Can sense that you're feeling me 
Your actions mean more to me  than 
Words you are too shy to say 
To my friends behind your back  baby 
Won't you say it to my face 
[Chorus] 
If you want to be with me 
And you got a thing for me 
Don't you walk away from me 
Don't you be afraid of me 
If you want to roll with me 
c'mon and roll with me 
[Nicole - Verse Two] 
Intensity, made me sweat a brother majorly, I 
Was sure it was you, you that was paging me 
All the seven days of the week 
But you got a case of butterflies, baby 
I wonder why 
Heard you say, ""I'm so fly"" (I'm so fly) 
Let's hook up on later tonight 
[Repeat CHORUS] 
[Nicole] 
If you really want me baby 
Let me know 
Let me know, what you want 
What you looking for baby, out the door 
Gotta go, gotta go 
[Lil' Mo - Rap] 
Yo I heard from a bird that you liked it hot 
Could we meet at the spot 
In the parking lot 
I got my mama's car so don't go slow 
It's 11:22, and at 12, I ghost, yo 
[Dent - Rap] 
Yo, slow it down lover, bout a half an ounce 
I got 38 minutes just to make you bounce 
So lets take a ride 
You and I 
don't you let me pass you by 
Here we go 
Let em know 
You don't even gotta watch 
[Lil' Mo - Rap] 
So whatcha say yo, you got the joes for me 
Caught a glimpse of my Benz, now you roll with me 
You want to lay up in my ride, and get fly with me 
In the drivers seat 
You want to shine with me 
[Dent - Rap] 
Damn right, I want to shine, if I can shine with you 
And you say you're getting yours, I gotta get mine too (uh huh) 
It sounds good coming from a lady looking like you (say what, playa) 
It's just the things we do 
[Nicole]

Gotta thing 
Don't you walk away 
Don't you walk away

[Lil Mo   Rap] 
Yo  what the deal son 
Pulling up to my crib 
If you ain't call before you came  yo you ain't gettin in 
Its just as simple as that 
So don't get left around 
You better get on  you came with 
And be gone before sundown because I'm comin out swinging 
Soon as I hear the bell ringing (ding)  you got five seconds to count 
(4 3 2) 
To get off my cement 
And uh wait for my place before I call Jake 
And have you locked up on your birthday 
And the keys thrown away 
[Nicole - Verse One] 
Boy I couldve sworn that I told you that 
All those other phone numbers in my pager don't mean jack to me 
So if you gonna start actin crazy 
Save it 
don't even try to play me for your own uncalled insecurities 
[Chorus] 
When all I ever do is give you my time (my time, my time) 
We be fightin over the stupidest little things (little thing, little 
things) 
The way you actin lately, its not right (not right, no no its not 
right) 
So if you're gonna be shady 
Then i can't be your lady 
No more 
[Nicole - Verse Two] 
Boy how many time I gotta tell you that 
When I'm on the road I can't answer my phone every single time it rings 
Next time you leave a message, stop 
Thinkin and screamin that I'm cheatin 
You know that's not my steez 
[Repeat Chorus] 
[Nicole - Verse Three] 
Baby what I do 
To make you feel this way 
I never thought you'd change 
Espically towards me 
you've been saying things, that's 
Makin me believe, you're so insecure 
And the reason is cause me

At ""The Players Club"" but I ain't pay though
Seen a trick flossin Lex-o, say hoe! Where yo' man at?
The hoe chaser, won'tcha put yo' name and number
On a piece of paper, so I can hit you later?
Got the work home and the pager
Knowin I was in hella good and fadin from the git-go
Seemed like a bomb hoe
Hit her up and came at her with the combo, it's on and crackin
Had the hoe laughin, talkin bout her cash in the stash
And her favorite types of fashion, askin
Me what type of shit I like - and how she might
Be the type to spend a grip on a nigga if he act right

[Emmage]
You're just like the air that I breathe
What you do is like a mystery, to me
These feelings I can't deny
Like a bridge crossing water, you carry me to the other side
(You're all that I want) you're all I want
(You're all that I need) ba-byyy
(You're all that I'm dreamin about babe) you're all indeed
(You're all that I want) baby, mmm
(You're all that I need) you're the only one I'm dreamin of
(You're all that I'm dreamin about babe) thinkin about, mmm
Two times, or three times, la-dy, gotta let you know
Just how I feel, let you know this feeling's real, yeahh
Don't you worry bout a damn thing
Cause I'm here to break your bedsprings
{cause you got it goin on}
Hear me out hear me out hear me out, girl

Awww yeah, spend some time with me

Aww yeah, oahahaoahaoahaoahaoahhh

[Lil' Mo]
I bails in, me and the close friend, she lookin fine
Holdin my nine, love is blind, so I stay sippin wine
Too young to think about dyin, spend my life tryin the finer things
Diamond cut rings, playin cards winnin with kings
Surrounded by dames, won't small claims recognize
The real players kick back and chill, you know the deal
Peep game, we came together but whatever's clever
No never Emmage forever

Cause you're all

Yes 
You have just entered 
The year 2000 
And they've just arrived 
Ready to take us outer space 
To another planet 
Where there's only one club 
And one disco, ooh 
And they want to show us how 
Heh heh, they boogie, uh

[Lil' Mo] 
Got a strange call from a girl 
In the midst of the night, uh huh 
She said you better call your man 
Cause he sleepin' right here tonight 
So I put on my coat 
And my hat and then put on my shoes, yeah yeah 
I said bitch don't you move 
Cause I'll be seeing you soon 
It only took me 

[Chorus: x2]
In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door 
In two minutes, I had her on the floor 
In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man 
Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram 

[Lil' Mo] 
Saw a few scratches on my car 
Just the other day, yeah yeah yeah 
Neighbor around my way 
Said she saw you drivin' away 
So I put two together 
And I found myself ready to go, whoa whoa 
Before she even knew it 
I was comin' down the road 
It only took me 

[Chorus: x2]

[Bridge: x2]
Be a hoe 
I'm kickin' you up out the door 
I hope you know 
Like Coolio, you gotta go 
Don't even think 
I'm gonna let you hang around

And you know what they want to show us 
Ooh, you know what they want to show us 
How they boogie (yo, yo, yo) 

[Lil' Mo] 
Yo, don't know what they told you, but 
They done told you wrong 
Bet I go back and tell 'em again 
And make sure you here it all 
Don't come up in my Millennium talkin' bout 
Girl, this my song 
If you don't know how to bounce to this 
Then try to play it off 
It's just like a movie, everybody want to see 
In the 2 G, how she dress like me 
They say ""Who's she?"", she's fly as can be 
Got a groupie, off a hoochie 
I got lucci, mad cheese in the bank 
And my crew be, straight flossin' wit' me

I take for granted that you just don't care,

[Ja Rule] 
I life I love my wife 
A bad time to prevail, it overwhelmed me 
I'm livin in hell but livin wealthy 
And know these hoes love me 

Because I'm a star 
I can't even cop a drink at the bar 
Get me some bottles of that Remi Mar-tin 
Let's get the party 
Cracking right here fuck V.I.P 

Now when my baby loves me 
Home wit tears in her eyes 
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin her lies 
She ain't surprise at me 

Just surprise at we 
Been together for this long 
And I can be 
The one to mistreat her 

Thought it last forever 
'Cause if I cry, you cry 
We cry together 

[Chorus] 

[Ja Rule] 
From, what I recall we was little niggas 
Cut, who gettin high, the hottest pictures 
Livin, life so free 
That we ain't fearin 

The, ills of the world 
In heat of drug dealin 
You and I then made a killin 
And tuck together 

I this land of forbidden treasure 
Love is the only evil seed that could sever 
A tied this close 
Not the love between us but your love for the dough 

You went O.T started makin M-O-N-E-Why 
All my good niggas gotta die 
But shit could last forever 
I wish (???) was pleasure 

'Cause when you die 
I cried, we cried together 

[Chorus] 

[Ja Rule] 
Wash away your tears (my love) 
You ain't gotta cry no more (my love) 
I'm putting on everything out (my love) 
And my pain it's my love 

And I want 
This world to smile for me 
Don't shed a tear 'cause the nigga died happily 
My momma warned me life was a muthafucka 

But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin 
And every night she just looked at me 
Tears in her eyes and they be saying shit like 
""I don't want me baby to die"" 

Brought so much pain into a life 
Gotta make it better 
'Cause when ma cried I cried 
We cried together

Oooooohhhh 
You cry, then I cry 
Then we cry 
When he cries 

I cry together, together 
When I cry, then you cry

Six-four switches, slam doors on 6's
Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass
I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels
I got money for a room it's just the fact that I'm trill
Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard
They have contests to guess which car I'ma pull out the yard
They know I, come for dolo and pull off with a broad
Spin away, spend a day tryin' to pull menage
Just mackin' this gorgeous sunlight hit the ice it's flawless
Run lights like I'm the king of New York, I'm lawless

I'm the truth til my fuckin' roof missin'

I'ma tell you 'bout L-O-V-E, know what I'm sayin'
You get around your crew, I'm just ""alright""

You treated me so different, see

Were tryna do something

Don't you need me?
To give you kisses
And to hold you tight
Don't you love me?
Don't you trust me?

That's what you said last night

So what you want to do baby?
Are you still showin' out? Are you actin' shady?
You can keep that boy, it's gravy baby
But I refuse to let you come around my way
And continue to play me baby

I was all you need
Or was you fakin' me?

I want you to love me like no other
If you feel you in a tired situation
Won't be the one that you're playin'

But you front in front of your crew
It's alright, I can play that too

Who said they caught you slippin'

Those were the same girls
That wanted to get wit'cha, hey

I guess I really thought they were really close to me
Tell them everything about you and me
From the sex to the night you wouldn't come home and
To the fights we had in our relationship
I guess they was using it for their gain
Cause they dogged you out and I would do the same
I kept 'em close and my enemies far away
I had it twisted cause I used to hear them say

I could do better than you
I could do better than you
That's what they used to say
Everyday, all day
They was plotting to take you away baby
But now I don't love 'em
I don't trust 'em, I don't see 'em
I don't need 'em
You're what I need, please believe me
I let go of my so-called friends
But I remember when they used to tell me

Who were constantly shady
Who hated all my men
Cause they wanted to be with them
They wanted to walk in my shoes
To see how he do me like he do
They talked about him then
They just wanted to be with him

All that I say
How many times?

Take a girl like me to get a guy like you to understand
How girls and guys sing
I'm not your average chic
Cause they can't do it like this
I've been sent to save your day
And things won't be the same

Baby they can't play you
Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman

Boy I told you once before
You ain't gotta look up in the sky
Cause the girl you need is right before your eyes
Your so sick of all these broads
Ain't got nothing to stand for
Cause with me you won't fall off no baby ooh

Baby they can't play you
Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman

Everyday, Everyday
I'll love you in a special way
They can't stay
Now that I'm here, I'm here

It's superwoman bout to save my day
Them co's I hooked and gave some play
Now I wouldn't even wave their way
I understand why them other chics behave that way
They see the icy S on your chest engraved in grey
Be hipped I might
You usually get my tips I'm tight
The only green I keep from you in kryptonite
When that blowing red suit hits your hips so right
It's like de de de de, de de de de de de damn
It's like I'm under your spell
If feelin you is a crime
They gon have to put me under the jail
You probably hear the details that I be in everything
From lairs to CL's to my share of the females but
You know I care for you (care for me)
And anytime this nigga's there for you (there for me)
These feelings I only share for you
This makes it a lil mo clear for you that

Baby they can't play you
Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman","Superwoman, Pt. 2",2001

Trying to make you disappear
Make ya pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
Ding-dong, the sound I'm waiting for
Your taxi's outside

Vroom!
Won't you please disappear?
Make yourself invisible
But leave the car here
The pink slips in my name
So the Benz has gotta stay
Why you stuttering and trying to explain?

Had it up to here
I made the choice today
See one of us will be leaving
Right now I ain't gonna say
You say you didn't go out
I know that was a lie
The neighbors said they saw you
Last night driving by

What's up with this girl?
Some supermarket clerk
Is visiting our house
Each day when I'm at work
I just can't believe you had the nerve
There'll be no more

No more kisses
We won't make it up
I'm tired of your shit

You'd see me close my eyes
Real tight I'd concentrate

No playing around, that's a rule of mine

Trying to ride for free

I'd blink your ass away from me

Lil' Mo,"Lying in my bed 
I hear the clock tick and think of you 
Caught up in circles 
Confusion is nothin' new 
Flashbacks, warm nights 
Almost left behind 
Suitcase of memories 
Time after time 

Sometimes, you'll picture me 
I'm walking too far ahead 
You're calling to me 
I can't hear what you've said 
Then you say go slow 
I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds 

[Chorus 1: x2]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me 
Time after time 
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting 
Time after time 

After my picture fades 
And darkness has turned to gray 
Watchin' through windows 
You're wondering if I'm okay 
Secrets stolen from deep inside (deep inside) 
The drum beats out of time 

[Chorus 1: x2]

You say go slow 
I fall behind,
The second hand unwinds

Don't go

Oh no, I have a party to attend
With some civilized people, and some more of my friends
I wish I could stick around
But I gotta take a trip back uptown, now
Layin' wit'chu, stayin wit'chu
Playin' wit'chu, is somethin' I ain't gone do
Now look here boo, there's so many freaks up in here
And I done already been there, so I don't really care
Now you can take that, take that
Bitch, I know you hate that, hate that
You can't do nothin' about it
You know damn well what I got back at the house
And I refuse to loose, trade in my shoes
Gimme the blues, hand my the booze
Strap on the fools, overabuse or misuse it
So I'm skatin' steady, datin' on the move to groove
I ain't got nothin' to prove in fact, I got too much to lose
Girl, you got a nigga way ? and way too cool
But I ain't leavin' here wit'chu, for real

Yo, this the single house
We gone disconnect the TV, leave the stereo and move the couch
Everybody get they groove on
I'm sweatin' like a rainy day, but I get my groove on
Dip baby dip, fall back a little bit while I hold the hips
Pass me the drink, while you hit this G-13
Pocket holler one time, fashion statement clean
Stacy Adams supe it up, baby girl boot it up
Almost dropped my glass when she lift that damn booty up
Dog walk to the cat walk
I'm ridin' that ass like Tony Hawk
There's somethin' about the way you blow my mind
Got me want to boogie all the time
Baby this is what I'm lovin'
Forget the last dance just to end up huggin', let's dance

Lil' momma got a gang of ass
Plus that mini-skirt make me think she fast
Passed by and asked if she'd like to dance
Spark a conversation to ignite the flash

Saw the proper full crew I'm leavin' with
You can act like the mack don't effect your type
Cause you know a nigga tryin' to have sex tonight
Ain't no secret, come freak with the real McCoy
Skip the guilt trip baby and just feel the joy
Make it rugged like you love it, never soft and sweet
Throw ya legs in the air and just start to beat
You can leave your thong on like it's all discrete
But it'll slide to the side when you fall asleep
Is you sho' that you can roll, dip, and smoke with me

And I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me, baby
And the house on the hill when you dropped like 80
On a down payment thinkin' damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey, I've been twice the lady

What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm?
When this cold world had a girl caught in the storm
And I except who you with when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip 'cause our love is strong

And when you hit the block I watch for 10-4's
And when my pop's was sleep you snuck in the back door
Baby boy, we've been down since junior high
So when life gets hot in July it's the world against you and I

Be ballin' tied together and never
Part from the heart knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy, put it on me

What would I be without you?

I know you're tired of bein' lonely
(Yes, I need you to hold me)
So baby girl put it on me
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)

Since we met it's been you and I
A tear for a tear baby, I won't cry
And you know that my heart don't lie
If you leave me lonely 'cause you not just my love you my homie

Who's gonna console me, my love?
I'm outta control hold me, my love 'cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin' to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world it'd be all yours

Baby
A thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
'Cause every thug needs a lady

Feelin' you baby 'cause them eyes ain't lyin'
Wash away all them tears there'll be no more cryin', baby
And you complete me and I would die if you ain't with me
So baby girl, put it on me c'mon

Why you actin surprised? You saw the bullshit
comin' fake hair, fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you, bound to fuck wit fake guys too
ain't nothin' hard about it why you lookin' sad? Shoulda though about it
Say you learned, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
gettin' freaky with the thug niggas up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom Perignon
Knowin I'm a cash getter still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me; plus you was smilin 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for tryin' to dick me
Missed me with that ""Buy me this, buy me that"" syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
gettin' mad 'cause I cursed and I scream I hate'cha
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me?

Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature (That's a nigga nature)
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
but that's a thug's nature

I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slingin dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, tounge-kissin', you was truly with it
Little ecstasy, Hennesey, mix with me
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin' to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin'' walls 'til them bastard drop
Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite
livin' life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!

Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?

I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
but that's a thug's nature

Haha, started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin' for creamin', bitches with big butts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin'' dead homies wishin phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart, and a real live nigga nature

Kissed the girls, made them cry

Though I love her, so I'm spendin like 70 bills
I bringin what she be on went, keep ya payroll big
Light a blunt, and just beg me to chill

Listen dogg, you don't understand the work

No doubt I love her, I'ma tell you the truth

But don't' get it fucked up, and get fucked up
Only thing sweet about P is his tooth
And she could sleep with another dude
She gon tell me where the safe at

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say

And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you

[Bridge: Lil' Mo]
You can fly away, no one has to know
Will you take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

[Sacario]
And the shop's there?

[Angie Martinez]
If they don't got em, they don't make em

([Sacario:] True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

Either you gon' ride out or you gon' spoil it
Either you gon' take a shit or get up off of the toilet
It's like (I want to know) if I be lyin to her
Or if I think these other birds finer than her, so
So when your man's on the road, he don't see you
I don't want the sex to be the only thing that keeps you
I give you my all, just holla at me if you want more
You tired of hearin 'bout me talkin 'bout a jump off
You my girl, my wiz, my life
Ma we can't go wrong ma, listen to the horns ma

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden (Lil' Mo)]
It's like (I want to know) if my career catches fire
Out of all the woman in the world, why her?
Hold up now you gettin mad at yourself
Just take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself
How many times I gotta tell ya, boo you all that I got
How many times I gotta tell ya, be secure in your spot
I understand so I can't knock it, but I'm your man stop it
Checkin my two-way, and goin through my pants pockets
It's no need, you my girl, my wiz, my life
Look ma you my heart, my all, my wife; and you pissed
'Cause you know other chicks would LOVE to smash your man
I tell 'em I'm aight, I take pride in that I'm your man
(My friends keep tellin me you ain't shit)
I done been through this before baby, same shit
Long as we know what we got, we can carry on boo
We can't go wrong ma, listen to the horns ma

Cause my last love he left me helplessly
Like a bird with out his wings I was just sitting around

Yes I was so afraid
Going through the same thing again baby
I hate it to fall in love cause I have been through so many things I can't name 
Same type, same thing, same game

Never move in unless he tell you
Rule number 8
Never tell your friends about your bedroom 
Rule number 9

And you wanna tell all your friends
But you've got to make sure loves intact
Because you want him to keep coming back

Rule number 2 
Before you give him some

Shop in a new car
Now that what I call for play
Now don't get me wrong
Respect your man

Till he licks you round
Your neck, your back, your puss and ass crack

Very important lessons
Keep your man guessing
Never let him see you stressing
And if you love here's 7, 8, 9 and 10
Never ever ever mess with his friend
See if you follow these
You'll have mad red to breaka house on the beach
And mad trips to jaca
He'll be home at night cooking you a steaka
And he'll keep coming back for more
On the wake up 

[Chorus: x2] 

Understand If you want to keep your man
And you want to hold on to him
Keep your man whipped

Lil' Mo,"Let's talk about love 
Let's talk about love 
Ooh love 

You can feel it, but you can't see it
You can't taste it, but you can hear it 
You can say it, if you don't mean it 
You can buy it, if you don't need it 
You talk so much about it, what is the meaning
It makes no sense, so what's the reason
Tell me why do we fall in love?

They say only fool's fall in love, but love was meant for all of us
So what we think we know we don't, cause you can never know enough
Do we think love is so material so physical, and sensual
Cause in the war it will destroy your soul, so one really knows 

It can make you laugh 
Make you cry
Make you tell the truth 
Make you tell a lie 
It could be your life 
Or it could be your death
Figure it out, it makes no sense

Tell me why do we fall in love?

We think love is perpetual, but the one who loves you will let you go
The pleasure that is imaginable, it will make you leave a happy home 
But all we take is love for serious, do we really know what it means to us
Cause if it wasn't for love we wouldn't be born, but no one really ever knows

Why it puts us together, it tears us apart
It can even mend it, or break your heart 
What we have for our self, what you say to your child 
But I still wonder why

You know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put to on a show to get patience
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect ya gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the starting lineup ain't playing right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like I'm gassing ya
But it took time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creeping and sneaking
Just to keep it from leaking
We so deep in our freaking
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey
A little bit uptight
Wondering why he coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be alright

I really want to be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (lone)

Already got a wife (got a wife)
Can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go

You ain't ever step out of line
Or get out a pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you telling the whole world I'm your new Allen Springer
At first you were something I denied
Something I would slide
Just do something in the ride
But shorty
There's something that you provide
Cause the entree ain't as good without something on the side

I really want to be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)

My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
Its gonna be a clip towards if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the carsely
You seen what happened with Mr. Big and R. Kelly

You know I get from you
Anytime this chick is there for you
Feelings I'm'ma share wit you
Which makes it a Lil Mo clear for you

Here's another one

[Fabolous]
You need to holla at somebody real such as myself
Won't nobody do as much as myself
And its so real ill hop out and get the dutches myself
For a pretty girl as such as yaself
'cause ima busy man I don't see too much for myself
And sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself
But I, make the time when I have to
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealing wit women
There's some who be willing and skimming
And dive in to relationships 'cause I got a million to swim in
They'll throw it to you faster than schilling and clemens
But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now
Some throw lawyers that you hoping they fetch thous
Others pass diseases that you can catch now
But in my minutes so lone I think about this crazy world
And.. I don't want to live in it alone
Come on

[Chorus: Lil Mo]
Ill give you all my love 
And you can always trust
My loyalty, honesty, and security (and i'll never)
Ill never leave (no, no, no)
Can none of these other chicks fuck wit me
So holla at somebody real (cause i)
'cause I'm so real

[Fabolous]
(real love) I'm searching for a real love like j blige in 92
but I pray I will find you
And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you
The fake may try to blind you
That's why I stay fly like I do
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to
First I need a girl that may die as my boo
Then I may try the I do's
But, I refuse to be trick
Or used by a chick 
Who gets amusement of kicks
Out of abusing my dick
When its real I'm all in it
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it
(no) before it didn't matter who
Now I look for some with a little attitude
I could chitter chatter to, good looking
But witty and compatible
Long hair wit a fatty too
And that'll do

[Chorus:]

[Lil Mo]
No I'm not trying to pressure you 
But my loves to incredible
For to waste
In front of your face
Then I give you something you can feel 
To let you know your hollering at somebody real

[Fabolous]
I need to holla at somebody real could that be you
The feelings that I feel could that be true
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away
That's til somebody real sways my way
Then I might spend some days always
On a Asia bay
Eating food made the Cajun way
And sippin ga lil saki
Blowing a lil brocoli
But this world is full of fluzi's
And bullshit usually
I pull I'm choosy
And on this joint and at this point
I know I need to holla at somebody real
For real

Dear Fab
I wrote this letter in confidence you will read it
I succeeded getting my college education completed
Smart girl, not conceited, but used to being treated any way
But anyway, your advice is needed
I'm twenty-two years old with a beautiful daughter
By a dead beat who wouldn't give a quarter to support her
My money was gettin' low, and my patience was getting shorter
Heard about his new girlfriend and all the shit he bought her
So I caught, fought her, heard she had restraining orders
I still grabbed her pony tail and held her under water
So right now I'm sorta locked up for manslaughter
Missing every minute I can't spend with my daughter

[Chorus]

Lo-so
I know you hold profession as a lyricist
But you probably never had depression as severe as this
Your music - it's like a session with a therapist
I asked the Lord to send me any blessin' if he's hearin' this
I'm stressin' somethin' serious, pressin' on delirious
A smart man always asks questions if he's curious
I believe in God, but I don't understand his plan
Why send a Spanish man way up to Afghanistan?
Hand this man a rifle, suit me up in camouflage
I salute the hand of Sarge; he is not a man in charge
I'm fightin' this war, don't know who I'm fightin' it for
Might be goin' AWOL any day, y'all

[Chorus]

Dear Fabolous
I'm such a fan, I don't have much demands
But I'm really hopin' that you will keep in touch with fans
'Cause see, I know you're probably busy kickin' 
With one of them pretty girls from on television shaking it
My vision ain't mistaken, I can see you wasn't faking
So I hope that you can help me with some good decision making
I've been thinkin' lot, so much I haven't slept in days
My mother and father about to go they separate ways
I'm a teen in the cross of a painful divorce
I love my mom, and she thinks I'm an angel, of course
I love my dad, too; I feel tangled and lost
Who's side should I be on?
Your friend, Deon

[Chorus]

Yeah, this song is dedicated to anyone who find they self in a place where they need some advice
You may not always find that person in the physical form, but there's someone you can trust in
Who listens when everybody's ears are shut, who sees when everybody's eyes are closed
Who speaks when everybody's voice is silent
Put your faith in god; the man will take you from there
Loso

(Mmm) People think it's easy out here 
You know, they see us in the fancy cars 
Fly clothes (oh yes they do) 
A little bling to wear, nahmean? 
Well, it's not easy 
You have all that, ain't got nobody to share it with 
(Oh no) Been tryin' to find somebody, it's crazy (oh no) 

[Keith] 
If I go to the club 
They just want to take me home 
Just tryin' to have a good time 
Just want to get my drink on 
If I go to the mall 
They come in the store 
I'm just tryin' to chill 
Said I'm just tryin' to chill 

[Lil' Mo (Keith)]
I don't know if they think 
This is the glamorous life (oh yes they do) 
They want to share the life with me (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
But what's a girl who gave all of her up in the lights (oh, lights) 
It won't lead to anything (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 

[Keith and Lil' Mo] 
I'll trade a million bucks 
For someone's love who don't come with a price 
I'll trade in all my cars 
For someone who will love me for life 

They can take away my platinum plaques 
That fame and fortune, don't mean a thing 
I'll trade a lifetime just to find someone 
Who will love me just for me 

[Lil' Mo] 
Gotta change my phone 
'cause they call my crib 
Just want some privacy 
Just tryin' to live 
If I'd have known 
It woulda been this way 
Woulda found a man a long time ago 

Don't get me wrong 
I'm still young and I'm not hating but 
It's not as easy as it seems (whoa oh) 
'cause I'm not out here looking for a hit and run 
I want someone who can love me for me

I know in love, sometimes you lose 
Sometimes it's just not right 
And sometimes you win 
But even then 
You gotta go through with it 
Gotta go through with it 

That's why I will, will find 
Someone to share the same thoughts as me 
I know they are there 
I know they're somewhere 
I'll do anything

Murder Inc shit
Backgound nigga,
Dave Bing shit

[Chorus]
Somebody goin die tonight,
Somebody goin die tonight,
Somebody's woman goin cry tonight
This is Murda, Murda
Somebodys going bleed tonight
One nigga's goin to eat tonight
Somebody's moves its feet tonight
This is Murda, Murda

Rather bring the best 16 when you fucking with Bing,
You could try smooth in between and you can scream
Sound while the crowd won't bounce to that
And you be fucking up the room,
Changing up mood
And that's rude
And my thugs want to eat your food
Drinking milk shake and after that shit in your face
And let your bitch know there been a car bomb from the git
Blow the day you blow Shaq make all his free throws
Let him throw a finger fucking fast or slow
Even put it in your ass if you tell me so
Toe to toe, you can lose your deal and your hoe
Now it's hard to pay your carton note and buy you some smoke
Seen your man is 'convensary' now, he starting to worry
He said stay away from Bing and 118
They really put it down, really put niggas in the ground
And your really love me if you only got a beat down

[Chorus]

Confidential, you need a whole lot of it
To bang with Bing in two bars, I can spoil your dream
Get mean, I could lead to things
Like me coming for you, in the middle of the night
With all black on, all you can see is the red light
The fo fo special got you hoping God bless you
Girl, won't forget you, once the bullets start the get you,
Games over soldier, don't you see the fucking Range Rover
With Bing in it, 10 more, 12th and 118 in it
I started rappin cause there's cream in it
But I still keep the crack, how for five or six fiends in it
A ring with the Bling Bling in it
And my brand new truck, bitches like the way I lean in it
Stop at the Stome, leave the keys in it
Gave you to leave with it, Bing will make you believe in it
You got a gut, put some trees in it

[Chorus]

Need a hard rock between your legs, I see the red spot
Thug knot, all it takes is one shot to make your head rock
Take you out your spot
While in the Woodstock, ask about Bing on the block
Fuck the cop, sell crack in blue top
Niggaz the size of dimes, ya'll cowards must be outta ya mind
Thinking that Dave Bing won't shine
This ain't the first time I cut head wrong with 1 9
Find the lactose slope, mix it in with the coke
Buy a quarter pound weed and let the clock choke
Stuck the nine out, Stuck it down the bitch nigga throat
When it was least expected made him get buck-nagged

[Chorus]",Somebody's Gonna Die Tonight,2000

Lil' Mokey,"There's so much drama in the NYC 
I'm trying to make this dollar but only got 15 
Where the grass don't grow and birds don't sing 
Where the police be hollering bout my crew 
Is that about this little life of mine you see, 
Have me sitting on 20's 'fore I turn 16. 
Wouldn't trade it in for anything 
And I got nothing but love

[Chorus:]
I got love for these streets and the street got love for me
Gotta keep it gangsta every day 
Can't change what's inside a me so baby can take me out 
The streets but can't take the streets outa me 
I'm gon' still be gangsta (Gangsta) 'cause the streets go right for me.

It's like everywhere I go, everywhere that I be, 
The streets biggin' me up from west to east
Down to the dirty-dirty and overseas they be showin' love to all my people, 
Throw it up we gon' always shine you see, 
Cause any time I needed you you was there for me. 
My heart my sole your why I sing and I got nothin' but love.

[Chorus]

In the morning when I cry, 
You are always on my mind 
When I go to bed at night, 
You will still be by my side you never let me down 
So I'll never let ya go this is dedicated to the streets
You got my heart (my heart)

Why you got to make this hard?
All the time so difficult
When I'm just trying to get you notice me
Since I can't hold you accountable
For the feelings that I feel
I'll hold you responsible
Cause I know that you can see

[Chorus:]
How many times?
I've got to say it
How many times?
The DJ gotta play it
How many letters would it take?
To make you understand
How many times?
Do I have to reason
With you, so you'll know that I mean it
All that I say
How many times?
Baby, how can I make you realize?

Requestin' songs on the love line
Dedicate 'em all to you
I know the DJ's probably tired of me by now
Since I can't hold you accountable
For the feelings that I feel
I'll hold you responsible

We gon' talk about these playas
We gon' also talk about this game

Is something everybody wants to know about
But who's the victim?
Is it the player?
The one bein' played?
Or simply this game?

Early in the morning, he waits by her door
But she's not there, 'cause she don't care

And it's a quarter after midnight

So she sleeps all alone

The feeling is gone, still we keep holding on
(To a love, that is just an illusion)
Get to the back of the line
Love will call you in time

On the kaleidoscope of love
People go 'round and 'round in circles
Falling in love and feeling pain
But it's the playa, not the game

See the parade of smiling faces
No masquerade can fade the shame
Too many tracks to hide the traces
But it's the player, not the game

It's not the game

I keep all my feelings in a dark and deep place
Never go there, 'cause it's so rare true love shows it's face
I stare out my window, when I can't sleep at night
Many voices, many choices, but I know when it's right

I made the choice today
See one of us will be leaving
Right now I ain't gonna say
You say you didn't go out
I know that was a lie
The neighbors said they saw you

What's up with this girl?
Some supermarket clerk
Is visiting our house
Each day when I'm at work
I just can't believe you had the nerve
There'll be no more

No more kisses
We won't make it up

If I had three wishes
You'd see me close my eyes
Real tight I'd concentrate

It's gon' be you 'cause it's my condo
The two of us can't be up in here
So one of us is gonna make it clear

There's no laying 'round, no free rides
No playing around, that's a rule of mine
But you were cheating 'round
Trying to ride for free
If it worked, I'd dream of genie
I'd blink your ass away from me

No more kisses
We won't make it up
I'm tired of your shit
I've had enough
If I had three wishes
You'd see me close my eyes
Real tight I'd concentrate
Like 1-2-3 and

Ta da
Trying to make you disappear
Make ya pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
Ding-dong, the sound I'm waiting for
The taxi's outside
And the driver's at the door

Vroom!
Won't you please disappear?
It's funny but that's what I wanna hear
The pink slips in my name
So the Benz has gotta stay
Why you stuttering and trying to explain?

Ta da
Trying to make you disappear
Make ya pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
The sound I'm waiting for
The taxi's outside
And the driver's at the door

Won't you please disappear?
Make yourself invisible
But leave the car here
The pink slips in my name
So the Benz has gotta stay
Why you stuttering and trying to explain?

Ta da
Trying to make you disappear
Make ya pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
Ding-dong, the sound I'm waiting for
The taxi's outside
And the driver's at the door

Vroom!
Won't you please disappear?
Make yourself invisible
But leave the car here
The pink slips in my name
So the Benz has gotta stay
Why you stuttering and trying to explain?

Lil' Mokey,"Lying in my bed 
I hear the clock tick and think of you 
Caught up in circles 
Confusion is nothin' new 
Flashbacks, warm nights 
Almost left behind 
Suitcase of memories 
Time after time 

Sometimes, you'll picture me 
I'm walking too far ahead 
You're calling to me 
I can't hear what you've said 
Then you say go slow 
I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds 

[Chorus 1: x2]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me 
Time after time 
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting 
Time after time 

After my picture fades 
And darkness has turned to gray 
Watchin' through windows 
You're wondering if I'm okay 
Secrets stolen from deep inside (deep inside) 
The drum beats out of time 

[Chorus 1: x2]

You say go slow 
I fall behind,
The second hand unwinds 

[Chorus 1: x4]

If you're lost, if you fall 
You can look, I'll be waiting",Time After Time,2001
Lil' Mokey,"Tupac and Lil' Mo, hmm, how gangsta is that?
Hehe, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

One two.. to a nigga nature, haha,
No need to cry now, go wipe your tears, be a woman
Why you actin surprised? You saw the bullshit
comin' fake hair, fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you, bound to fuck wit fake guys too
ain't nothin' hard about it why you lookin' sad? Shoulda though about it
Say you learned, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
gettin' freaky with the thug niggas up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom Perignon
Knowin I'm a cash getter still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me; plus you was smilin 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for tryin' to dick me
Missed me with that ""Buy me this, buy me that"" syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
gettin' mad 'cause I cursed and I scream I hate'cha
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me?

Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature (That's a nigga nature)
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
but that's a thug's nature

I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slingin dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, tounge-kissin', you was truly with it
Little ecstasy, Hennesey, mix with me
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin' to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin'' walls 'til them bastard drop
Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite
livin' life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!

Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature (That's a nigga nature)
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
but that's a thug's nature

Haha, started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin' for creamin', bitches with big butts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin'' dead homies wishin phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart, and a real live nigga nature

Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature (That's a nigga nature)
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
but that's a thug's nature  (Cause that's a nigga nature)

Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature (Hey, just be a nigga nature)
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
but that's a thug's nature  (Cause that's a nigga nature)

It ain't my fault
Hehe, Q.D., where you be? ahh
Don't blame me blame my momma, a nigga nature

Catch up with ya kind 'cause you ain't touchin' a dog
Imitation fake like Gucci suits niggas be wearin'
Nigga like me hit the room and all the bitches be starin'
I'm not fine I'm not cute, they just know I got some loot
Grippin' wood, lookin' good '24s make them choose
Nine times out of ten the bitches bad news
Hit the dick and start actin like a motherfuckin' fool
Clothes brand new from my T-shirt to my shoes
Pop a tag every day, that's what ghetto niggas do
Hustle hard, spread all the bread with my crew
When we in the club they be poppin' bottles too
We crunk and keep it hype and everybody know it's on
When my work hits the street watch how quick that shit be gone
I rap like I'm quick enough but catch 'em full of zones
When my work hits the street watch how quick that shit be gone, nigga

[Chorus]
Street niggas (keep your guns hit the traps
spend your bread on rims and ice, whatever them bitches like)
Street niggas (push it all hard or ball
sticky weed, whatever ya need, man we got it all)

spend your bread on rims and ice, whatever them bitches like)
Street niggas (push it all hard or ball
sticky weed, whatever ya need, man we got it all)

I'm just a street nigga I keep my heat under the seat
If a, bum run up hope he got his gun up
From sundown to sunup I keep it with me
And I end up be unloadin' on y'all when y'all hit me
It's a grand shame that you niggas come from it but can't walk through it
What is it? I thought you knew it
It was the streets nigga, my seat used to hit it when I didn't have no wheels to go get it
M J fuckin' G droppin' these bars with no regards for snitches and fake broads
You ain't hard from steroids, nigga you big fraud
I remember when them bullets was takin' your lunch card
I'm a real ghetto politician
and what I gotta give in to motherfuckers who willin to try to vision
When a nigga spittin', Quit all the whinin' and bitchin'
Baby sharp, look and listen, pay attention to what you been missin'
It's the

Yea come on
Street niggas, street niggas
We sittin' on leathers and we grippin' on wood (Streets is watchin')
We makin plenty bread and reppin' our hood (Streets is watchin')
Money over bitches, man it still all good (Streets is watchin')
We makin plenty bread and we reppin' our hood (Streets is watchin')

What can I say about these streets that I be walkin'?
Not too much 'cause where I from niggas ain't motherfuckin' talkin'
We'd rather listen and watch
Tryin' to flex and guard their clothes and Baume and Mercier watches
Tryin' to get my gloss on
I paid the 'cause' to be the boss on these corners where ballin' niggas floss on
Haters get tossed on, 5-0 get ? and out of towners get robbed
and drop that, can't nobody gonna stop that
See it was like this before me
So if you think it's time to change, nigga show me
Obviously you don't know me It's time that you learned
niggas that try to hold me on my grind, they get burned
I'm down from P.A., man, West side to the east, fool
(Aw come on Bun be, dude what about peace?)
Fuck peace, fool
You want some love, ask your momma or the lord
Bitch I'm down with pimps see, UGK be goin harder

Lil' Pep,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

She a fool been in school even walked across the stage
She say I love Webbie from his looks to his ways
The stilletos the jays depend on how the weather look
Flip flops slippers just to show off the pedicure
Flip flop niggas depend on how the cheddar look
She'll buy her own I don't think she 'll never look
In a man face standin' waitin for him to take care of her
She'll rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule

I N D E P E N D E N T do you know what that mean mane (x2)
She got her own house
She got her own car
Two jobs work hard you a bad broad
If you ain't on sit down
If you ain't on sit down

She a dumb dime keeper
Gutta like Keisha
Work that meat up
She a good freaker
She stay on her shit
She got her own shit
She don't never trip
All she want is that dick
She Bossy Flossy
Keep Them Hoes Off Me
Gutta lil' slang mane I love when she talkin'
A independent chick do you know what that mean
She cook she clean never smell like onion rings
22s on her whip oh she do it large
And she break a nigga off got a nigga spoil
She a bad lil' chick a fly lil' chick
Hit me on my phone she like to buy that dick
Got her stunna shades lookin' like something
Stallion hair long she a nice something
She like to go to the mall everyday for a outfit
Hair did nails did independent what she call that

I N D E P E N D E N T do you know what that mean mane (x2)
She got her own house
She got her own car
Two jobs work hard you a bad broad
If you ain't on sit down
If you ain't on sit down
If you ain't on sit down
If you ain't on sit down

She got her own house
Drive her own whip
Range Rover all white like her toe tips
She got a pretty smile
Smell real good
The only time she need mane for that good jugg
They buy the bar too
They superstars too
They be like you ain't got no money
Take you broke tell home
Baby Phat they on
They clothes match they phone
They be like yea! When they song come on
Leave the club kinda early cause they gotta go to work
I mess wit supervisors who got credit like Big Turk
So dusty feet please don't Bother Me
I got independent dimes on my mind who spoil me
Coogi hat Coogi fit so sick
Thats a gift from my independent chick yes sir
Try'na get to her gotta be yourself mane
Cause she got her own money
She don't need no help mane

I N D E P E N D E N T do you know what that mean mane (x2)

Lil' Phat,"Lil Boosie bad ass and I wanna know if you a do it again baby girl, you know what I'm talkin bout,
If you a press rewind if I ain't have shit, make a nigga wonder sometime fa real
(ohhh oooohh do it againnnn, do it againnn)

Now if I ain't have shit would she still love, a nigga hair all nappy underarms musty,
If I wasn't boosie bad ass would she still fuck me,
Tell the truth would me n you ever had an discussion,
Would you do it again, get away from all your friends,
Would you still be happy if I ain't have no bens sometimes I ask myself,
Would she forgive me for them other kids I had on her long night on the corner all the nights
I jumped on her, chill mama but mama just a little girl,
I'm seventeen he fifteen we having a little girl, she keep it guttah gotta give her dat,
She say she tired but if she tired tell me why she ain't leave yet,
Never had a job over a week I really spoiled her when we go eat she Beyonce and I'm Sean Carter,
If I worked at burger king and approached you smelling like onion rings would she do half the things she done to me

[Chorus]
If I couldn't give you the finer thangs,
The money and the whips and the diamond rings
Would you do it again
I wanna know, I wanna know
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know
And if I didn't have my baller status
And if you didn't have the seven ?
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know


If she brought me home to her mama,
She disagree with her decision,
Would you wild out if she threatened to put her child out,
Would she still go get them birds for me slang that syrup for me be at court extra early for me
(sometimes I ask myself) put her on her first plane,
Told her do her thang took her to emmitt five g's on a pinky ring,
If I wasn't Boosie boo would she ride for me,
Would she had laid down took that pain and have that child for me,
She kept it real from the start she ease my brain, was it the chain,
Was it the game, was it the name,
She stayed faithful that's why I love her through thick n thin,
Made visits n commissary when I hit that pin,
I had my homework she had her homework,
She went from drawers to thong work I'm a fool with it,
If I worked at mickey d's and hooked you up with a number three would you be nice and give your number to me

[Chorus]

With all the money I got and all the whips that I buy
If I ain't have nothing would you still be by my side,
If I ain't have this status no purple just reggie
If I ain't have no daddy I'd be diggin ?,
I'll still be selling off the store no fresh golds no fresh clothes no bad hoes
Sad hoes girl would you still be my hoe,
No Fendi no Prada no Gucci can't buy 
That would you still lay under me at night time in the projects,
No diamond chains from emmit a Honda no Bentley,
Would you still go low if I ain't have this image no sean john cologne no deodorant my odor strong,
Would I fuck these red bones if I ain't have my bread long,
Rewind my lifetime you prolly wouldn't have fuck me,
No showers on my grind you prolly wouldn't have suck'd me,
Just rewind my lifetime you prolly wouldn't have fuck'd me
No showers on my grind you prolly wouldn't have suck'd me

Lil' Ray,"Never had time for the celebration
Singing like a woman when you're six years old
Never got to dance at the graduation
Didn't want it, didn't need it
She was on the road

No letters from home
We just kept moving on 
We were all alone, together

Simple stops along the way 
No one knows the price we paid
For the dream, for the dream
The people came from everywhere
And they all wait for her
To sing the songs one more time

So many miles, so many places
The music pulling like an under tow
Leaving smiles on all their faces
They were living the songs she wrote

No stick ball in the street
No grass stains on the knees
We were all gypsies, together

And forever in my mind
This will always be
She was the world for me 
But I no longer weep for her
All that's left is the need for her
To sing the songs one more time

Just one more time",One More Time,1997
Lil' Razah,"I hear we livin' in the last days
Its revelation and you best get right with god
Or else is waitin', the world is comin' to an end
Everyday is a storm or a flood, tsunamis, this shit ain't the norm
We got Katrina and Rita minds keep collapsing
With the fires and mud slides, I'm like whats happenin'
Got the kids in the school gettin' raped and molested
Under-funded, unprotected no wonder they tested
And the lowest percentage rate, 
In my city damn near the lowest in the state
You can equate that to the state funds 
That ain't breakin' down right,
Rich districts get more and poor ones less, and it just don't sound right
So I'm fittin' to pound right on the doors of my city hall
And kick them doors down, they killin' my city yall
We need to get my people back to where they should be
And since nobody else is gonna do it its gonna have to be me

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
If it was up to me, 
No gun, no crack, or whore could of comin' in our community
If it was up to me,
You couldn't have no war between Tupac and B.I.G
If it was up to me, 
They couldn't lock up Shyne and they couldn't lock up Emcee
If it was up to me, 
You wouldn't have no aids and you wouldn't have no H.I.V

First of all the projects is fucked up
And it ain't just with the drugs, 
We got more problems than just the dealers and thugs
They using lead based paint, and investments is killing us
We tell 'em to fix it up but they just ain't feelin' us
They rather kicks us out and tear it down to the ground
So they can put up a parking lot, a mall, or some condos
Condemn the whole place cause if you sell crack 
Shit the rest ain't do nothin' wrong, what the fucks up with that
They say one rotten apple can spoil the whole bunch 
But we talkin' bout some people not apples, this ain't lunch
Make me wanna punch a politician dead in his face
You say you represent my district, get your ass on the case
Development is good for the hood yeah thats what you tellin' us
But bitch you on the pay roll of the builders and developers
Fuck what you sellin' us, pipe dreams for suckers
You can take that around the corner to them other motherfuckers man

So much youth they sacrifice
Just to live in paradise
Play they tricks and tell they lies I know
Its hurting to see how they treat the poor
They have so much and still they still want more
I see my people everyday on the floor

[Chorus]

Its time to educate the people man, free school and college
So everybody cross the border can get the same knowledge
 education leads to jobs and jobs kill poverty
And no more poverty means we makin' money obviously
Everybody makin' money everybody smilin'
Motherfuckers ain't eatin', them motherfuckers wildin'
Matter fact speakin' of eatin' lets feed the homeless in America
Let these motherfuckers handle their own shit
How am I gonna clean your house, and mine still dirty
How am I gonna feed your kids, and mine still thirsty
And speakin' of the kids we need to spend some more time with 'em
Cant turn 'em loose in the streets, cause they dying in 'em
And all this naked ass sex man you trippin', fuck love 
Im livin life you aint gonna catch your boy slippin'
You say your boy trippin', I'm just keepin' in it G
Cause you could see how good the world would be if it was up to me

[Verse 1:]
They say its always darkest before the dawn 
And that you don't know what you had until it's gone 
I thought I knew what I had but I was wrong 
And thats why I gots to write this song now 
Come on now come on say man I thought it would of been a long time for us 
And many more years on the grind for us 
I thought the future held a lot for us both 
And it was brighter we were super tight 
But finna' be super tighter 
I guess I just assumed we had more time for us to make more music 
And write more rhymes 
But never in my life could I ever have seen 
That I would ever have to lose the other half of my team (for real) 
And take away the glitter the gold and the gleam 
Say man I wonder to myself what does it all really mean 
Nothing without the people you love say man I miss my brother 
But I know he's looking down from above 
And thats an angel

It all began on Shreveport Ave sittin' off in the den 
Making beats and puttin' paper to pen 
We was determined to win 
And you couldn't tell us different 
Mama West was cool with it 
But Monroe kept trippin'
It seems just like yesterday sometimes 
Sittin' in ya bedroom writing dumb rhymes 
Man you makin' beats on the insonic 
And we was smokin' dirt weed cause it wasn't no chronic 
I still remember when we started the crew 
It was me Mitchell Queen Jamal Jackson and you 
Started out as 4BM but then we ended with two 
Thats when we introduced the world to the U 
To the G tot the K Underground Kings DJ Byrd Pimp C 
And Bun B we kept it G say word 
Who would'a known back in 92 in 2008 
I'd have to write this song sayin' I miss you but its true

Just for the record let me go ahead and say 
I love my brother Pimp C 
And man I miss him everyday 
Yeah my heart still hurts 
And the pain still fresh 
But I'ma put God first 
To keep that pressure off my chest 
And remind me that I'm blessed to have had him as a friend 
A ride or die homie that was with me till the end 
Real talk man we was closer than kin 
And I know that I'll never have a partner like that again 
So Chad Butler I just want you to know I keep ya memory close I'm never lettin' it go 
And they gon' always remember that you was here mayne 
Cause I'ma make'em remember thats why I'm here mayne yeah it's still hard 
And I still cry but you and God keep me strong so I'ma still try

Cause through your music you live forever so, trill don't die

At the crossroads ill see you there [x2]

Y'all don't really want to mess with me
Y'all better respect my G.
Better think before you step to me...
Where you from wodie?, I'm from the see-P-3
Y'all really down to ride with us
Cross side get wild with us
Get it crunk all the way live with us
From the South to the Eastside with us

(Verse One: Lil' Romeo)
Lets get it on I'm bad to the bone, edgin yo dome
What you know about a baby hummer sittin on chrome
Make moves like I'm grown with a style of my own
See the ice around my neck I go to school in a rover
Fifth grader seventy dollar phone two way pager
I'm a major, in other words I got flavor
I wreck mics rip shows and kick floors
Lil' Ro' got y'all throwin ya bows
I'm bout that if you hatin then stop that
Top that any club I rock that
Now rock that we takin our spot back
If you tryna stunt lil wodie I doubt that

(Chorus Twi: Lil' Romeo, Silkk the Shocker)
Y'all don't really want to mess with me
Y'all better respect my G
Better think before you step to me...

(Verse Two: Lil' Romeo)
Call me the master I'm what you been missin
The one who be flippin I'm cool like that so I never be trippin
I'm that cool cat nice with the ball, nicer than y'all
You better take your points cause you might not score
I'm guaranteed M.V.P. hit jumpers and score
Somethin like Allen I. but I play like I'm tall
Corn raise starch glaise when I walk through the mall
Let my pants sag and always find time to talk to 'em all
I love movies buy a new CD every Tuesday
(??) that down south stuff groovy
Keys in my pocket so these skills gonna do me
I practice y'all I'ma do this thing truly

(Chorus Three: Lil' Romeo, Silkk the Shocker)
Y'all don't really want to mess with me
Y'all better respect my G

(Verse Three: Lil' Romeo)
I'm the A I rock like a grown up on stage
I get e'm open leave e'm hoarse for days
Sound like a wild animal I need to be in a cage
I'm dangerous man in so many ways
I rip shows don't sleep shorty I'm woke
I been practicin since the age of four
I got my mind right I'm up in the limelight
I guess you hate me when you know that I rhyme tight
Nicer than nice I'm skillful make you think twice
What's my name Lil' Ro, I'm larger than life
When I'm not pushin a hummer I'm ridin a bike
A Lil' Soulja what they call me I go off on the mic
If a ticket was around my neck it would be covered in ice
And my wrist stay blingin its a lovable site
I'm ragin on all types of stages
You might be nice but see I'm the greatest
Wanna see me take it home from the stages
I'm the one I'm tellin you son like the matrix
Matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix

When I see you all I seem to feel is happiness
Grab ya wrist

Feel like takin' a ride on the swang Ma

Get butterflies when I look in your eyes
Last in my class
Friends getting mad
Can't wait to meet ya mom
And you can meet my dad
Smile a little more
You look so sad
You look too good to be seen like that
A boy should never act mean like that

And they wonder are you still alive and still laughin'
I still stress over your death
Caught four in to your chest
Lay your rest to the west
May your soul be blessed
And Lord knows how we miss you
Murder is a big issue
Can't stop the blood wit tissue
When the slugs hit you
All your family and friends shed tears
Cause for years 
We knew you would make it, it was clear
Toast to both coasts
We need to stand close
Cause it ain't no silence when God is right in front of your eyes
Awakin' the time to shine
In time you'll find
I roll a dutch
Cause the worlds to much, to take my pain away

I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens

Welcome to my center
Honies feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke
The faggot took the back way
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-CUPS
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches
Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon, plus

[I got more glocks and techs than you]
I make it hot [Nigga won't even stand next to you]
Nigga touch me you better bust me
tree times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on",What,2001

[Chorus: repeat 3X *sung*]
When I get grown, I'm gonna cherish that big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill here and keep it real

[Verse One: Lil' Romeo]
In ten years I can't believe man I'll be 20
Bought a couple cars livin large tryna put it in the picture
Cause my moms has been in it for years
and people sayin that's Little P handlin his business
I remember hangin on the block wit the boys
Goin to the dollar movies, me and V-played dodge the ball
We had fun even though times was hard
I mean me and Lance played Dreamcast
I can't believe my lil whodi lost his life in a car crash
One day you here then you gone ya heard me?

[Chorus sung:3x]
When I Get Grown
I'm gonna cherish that
big house on the hill
But for now I'd like to chill

[Verse Two: Lil' Romeo]
Never say god can't you gotta have a plan
I thank moms and pops for raisin me man
I seen kids get shot and some go to jail
When you die lil whodi is it Heaven or Hell?
I want to be like Mike I mean ball and make money
Keep it real wit my peeps and never act funny
I seen kids on drugs go to school and commit crimes
We use to fight each other but now its tecs and knives
Stay in school get a job education it goes far
Man, it's gotta be more to life than just jewlery and cars

I'm lookin for a girl who can touch my heart
someone pretty quiet she gotta be smart
hair curly demples beautiful smile
sense of humor sweet to shy to be wild
likes music from top of her grades A student
a dyme from her head to her toe shot by cupid
write letters to let me know how she feel
one of a kind good team you know that she's real
my juliet call her my baby boo
ain't know other girl made me feel like you
you always on time you know that you mine
when I first met you ma I knew it was real
I'm thinking movies and popcorn what's tha deal
I'm a lilsoulja so we all need love

I mean after school we could walk together
here's my 2way girl we could talk forever
who cares you care we like Ja' and Ashanti

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Long hikes even got his and her rights
I wouldn't know what to do if she was out of my life
we been together so long she considered my wife
got a lot in common she even likes what I likes
takes pictures she hangs wit my sisters
the lovable type lots of hugs and kisses
I take time off just ta be wit my girl
six flags dis is on she's apart of my world
the feeling was on we could paint together
if love is like ice we could bling together
my lucky charm I mean my four clovers

Can't understand I got the gift to speak 
And its a blessing so listen to the lesson I preach

I'm kinda spoiled 'cause everything that I want I got made
I wanted gear, got everything from cotton and suede
I make money every time my video is played
My hair was growing too long, so I got me some braids
And when my dishes got dirty, I got me a maid
And when the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise 'cause I rise to the top of my grades
Wanted peace on earth, so in god I praise.
Some kids across town thought I was afraid, they couldn't harm me...

Lil' Romeo,"Love has truly been good to me
Not even one second a memory I had
Since you came my way
I hope you know I'll gladly go
Anywhere you take me ain't no limit to this love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above

The first time I met you
I didn't sweat you
My Juliet I knew that I catch you
Gave you the key to my heart you unlocked it
A perfect match you the plug in the socket
As time moved on we became friends
I knew was love at first sight and it wasn't 'bout to get wit this
You was there when I needed you
I remember writing letters on the road I want to be wit you
I know we young and we got time
Little soldiers need love so girl I want to make you mine
We could row together, go to shows together
My best friend girl lets grow together


We could walk together rode buses together
Ya moms call us telling things we stuck together
We at park playin' hide-go-seek
I find you, or you find me
This was meant to be
They call us little one and shorty
Find us hugged up at every school party
We study together, ball together
Somebody said cupid must've brought us together
I love your cute eyes and you love my tight braids
Play video games almost everyday
And when we not together we on the phone
Talkin' 'bout our first kiss and we don't want to be alone


And I remember so while how your smile
Made me feel bright like the sun shine
I'm so glad that you mine, you my Juliet
I never let the jealous ones in between and that's a safe bet
And we could get the study in after school is over
Homework is a must so we can come over
And have the words we could hit the mall zip ices and cotton candy
And after that come chill wit the family

Got to tell you how you have me
I'm so happy that you came in here and changed my world
Bye Bye sadness hello Rome
You're the only boy that found someone that's so in love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above",True Love,2002

Tell me a story 
I believe, oh I believe
All things are possible on Christmas eve
[Lil' Romeo:]
Ok
It was a night before Christmas
And all through the house
Not a creature was stirring 
Not even a mouse
The stockings was hung
By the chimney with care
With hopes that st. nick soon would be there
Me and my sisters and brothers getting ready for bed 
Can't wait to get toys for all the break bread
Mom's in plent jammies in the middle 
And pops still 
Santa coming eating the cookies and milk
[Hilary:]
Tell me a story
I believe, oh I believe
All things are possible on Christmas Eve
Every time I hear that rhyme
I love it even more
Tell me a story 
About the night before
[Lil' Romeo:]
Could it be a dream 
I think I heard a noise
Jumped out of bed and
It's the no limit boys
I ran to the window
Creak creak
Bright red shin'nin the new Huh-v
Snow in the south haaa that's kinda silly
Is it santa claus or is it my uncle willy
Ya know here we play games but this one feels weird
When I see 8 shiny reindeer
Bout to come and get me
Come on
[Hilary:]
Tell me a story
[Lil' Romeo:]
Ok
You want to know
Check it out
Now santa 
Called them by name
Dasher, dancer, prancer
And they all came
Vixen, comet, cupid eyes droopin
Low ears they look's like they snoop'n
Can't forget donner and blitz
3 kings
They was carry'n the gifts
[Hilary:]
T-t-t-t-tell me a 
I believe, oh I believe
All things are possible on Christmas Eve
[Lil' Romeo:]
Wish for it, you just might get it
Every time I hear that rhyme
I love it even more
Tell me a story 
About the night before
[Lil' Romeo:]
Wish for it, you just might get it
I couldn't believe they were fly'n so high
To the moon and the stars and the lonely sky
They went up and around 
And sung as they flew
With the sleigh and the toys
And Saint nicholas too
[Lil' Romeo:]
Yo it ain't about the gifts
But I'm glad santa came
Thanks for the video games and the bling-bling
My lil sisters got bikes an trains
I'm just glad for the love and thangs
So you better not shout 
You better not pout
Why'all know what I'm talkin' about
Merry christmas to all
And have a good night

And I got you

[Chorus]
Shorty keep your head up
Even when you feed up
Shorty keep you're head up

(Just listen)
I seen you in school shorty
What's to do shorty?
You know I'm out here thuggin' but what's up wit me and you shorty?
You need me I'm on the three way 
I'm in the hood thuggin' wit my homie ?????
What you say he ain't treating you right?
Wuzzup baby girl you need a thugg in your life
Shorty keep your head up and ima be there 
When you need me gurl even when you feed up
And I ain't tryin' to boost you up or shoot you up
But if you was money you'll be a million buks
Just be there when I need ya
And if ya hungry Ima feed ya 
That's why them otha gurls want to be ya.
And gurl you shouldn't settle for less settle for that 
You a queen and you deserve the best
I know you don't know me
I 'member what you tol me 
""And I like the way you hold me""

[Chorus]
Shorty keep your head up
Even when you feed up
Shorty keep you're head up
Even when you feed up

I know you shooked 
And really ain't into meetin' new guys
Think we all the same good for tellin' you lies
But I can understand that 
I peep a frown ? on your face when I ask you ""where you men at?""
But I ain't really tryin' to invade your space
Your heart been shelter all over the place
And you used to be a bright gurl now world is death
Got an attitude which you hadn't heard of him
Ima P.I.M.P but I'll treat you right
Did I ?? gurl never ??????
When I was broke on the block you was there for me
See you can cut through loose you don't compare to me
Cause see I'm from the heart I just ran out of lies
I don't want to be the reason tears run from your eyes
Think I'm two G'ed up for my feelings to show?
Well go right ahead keep thinkin' you know
(You was wrong about me)

[Chorus:]
Shorty keep your head up
Even when you feed up
Shorty keep you're head up
Even when you feed up

Yo' ma I'm always seen you around but lately 
Seem somethin' keepin' you down and
They say your x so abusive 
You don't play sports how you get those bruses?
To be honest the dude is useless
Let me take you out the hood we can do this (ok)
You too cute to be seatin' on the bench 
You can start on my teem ma come n represent and
I can treat you better than that looser ever did
Cause you don't deserve the type of stress that he give
I know I'm young but I can treat you right
And if he trippin' then you need to be with me tonight
Ah and baby he don't have an ounce of respect for you 
That's why I think is Gangsta how you backed off and left the dude
Shorty age ain't nothin' but a number 
If you need to get away take the Benz or the Hummer and
You say I don't know enough about you but I just can't see myself being 
Without you 
Yeah

If you ain't wit my team you can get stomped out
When I get crunked on get stomped out
If you hatin on my team you can get stomped out
Get stomped out, get stomped out

[Verse:1]

Now the kid is back,
I'm not Michael Joradn but I'm coming back
Kinda like Pierce in Boston the truth is back
Got a dez on my team but his name ain't Shaq
Yeah my team is stacked, I only roll with the best
And yeah I'm leading the pack like my name was Ron Artest
Best believe I got my back brotha,
My cell on the right and lattrell on the left, huh
And I know things are gonna heat up,
When I watch the Suns and Heat I catch a fevea
That don't stop me from jumpin' up
And like Kobe Bryant jam my 360 dunk
It don't matta, I come cross to shake it dawgg
Like A.I. I'll break our ankles dawgg
I'm kinda like Shaq, no one could hold me
The only way to stop pme is if you foul and throw me

[Chorus:2x]

[Verse:2]

Ummm, let's get it crakin' like Jason Kidd I make it happen
Go through the legs I dunk the ball
I'm like Vince Carter I'm 1/2 amazing dawgg
Get rings like Detroit, I'll bend you like Ben Wallace
I'm going to the pro's then going to college
Ain't Lebron James, but the youngest in the game
And I put it through the net, like I was from New Jersey
Catch me in Philly with a throwback jersey
I like games with a real good pace
That's why I'm watching Indiana take on Yao Ming
I'm number one like Tracy McGrady
My jump shot daily the gotta pay me
Born to ball my game just so sick
My jump off os like my handles it's so tricky

Just to make you smile mami, we could spend some time in the mall
If you want it girl then you can grab it, girl I ain't trippin'
Whatever you need baby, it ain't no limit
Get it?, So you should roll with this dude
'cause you know I'm the one for you
Stay fresh to death, from my head to my shoes
Got everything I need shawty, all I'm missin' is you
You know the truth, if I had my way I would spend everyday around ya

And realise the good times a wait the bad
People wish that they could find sumthin' like we have
I couldnt wait to introduce you to my mom and dad
You keep me focused and away from all those playa hatas
When I'm down you pick me up, like an elevator
If ever we were apart, I don't think I could make it
You gave me your heart, I promise you I never break it
So won't you stick around for a while
I keep ya laughin' 'cause ya know I like to see ya smile
To get to where ya are, you know I run a hundred miles
I love ya personality, not to mention ya style
Uh, so I just want to know what it's gonna be
Baby girl you want to roll with me
I pick you up from school, in a new black bentley gt
And we can ride, till they run outta streets

When I'm all lonely, knows how to hold me, a little tight shawty, know what I mean.
Little attitude but not controlling, with them pink Nike's, and them passion jeans.
I need a girl sweet as a dove, first time in my life, I see I need love.
New no limit, mommy no gimmicks, laid back Benz, mommy jump in it.
You remind me of my diamonds, always shinin, I'm flawless girl.
I'm a young Bill Gates, get all this girl, in my g-4 we could tour the world,
Before I'm 24 I'ma rule the world, and you can be my queen, yo that's for real, ok.

And if I ev-ever fall in love again, I will be sure that the lady is a friend.
And if I ev-ever fall in love so true, I will make sure that the lady's just like you. Oh!

OK. I want my shawty to be like you, sweet and sassy, someone to write to.
Yes it's quite true, I kinda like you, you say we just friends but not tonight boo.

Keep you together in my butter soft weather.
Night is young, we could do whatever.
I know you see me on the TV shows, videos, big screen, but I'm just Romeo.
A real cool dude you should get to know, on a different plateu, like whoa!
Buyin out what's love, like fat Joe, mommy I know, but I'm willing to grow.
To the mountain top if you willing to go.
Don't be scared, Romeo take you there, come on.

And if I ev-ever fall in love again, I will be sure that the lady is a friend.
And if I ev-ever fall in love so true, I will make sure that the lady's just like you. Oh!

Look, if I ever fall in love it's all in knot, no reason for the kids to go and start fronting.
Looking for a girl who can press my button, hit me on the cell to do a lil something.
Can I ball?
You know it ma.
Playa thin and tall, I'm growing up.
It's a new no limit, y'all can't flow wit us, on my way to school I got my own bus,
And I can't leave home without my chain, got girls all over screaming out my name.
I'm like Tracy Mcgrady, and Yao Ming, I might switch up my team, but I'm still in the game.
MVP, so I'm earning that, searching for a chick who sweep, to put his slipper on her feet.
Until then, I'm gon run the street, keep spinning these rhymes, nick bring the beat.

I'm thinking about Miss Lorenzo...
My girl amy...
Sprewells,Giovanni,Daytons,Mo-Mos,Diablows
and my girl Ashanti......

[Chorus: Master P 2x]
I need dubs when I ride to the club
Cruisin with my girl,even rollin with
thugs,
I need dubs 22's, 24's shinin in the
hood,
I'm the king of the car shows...

[Verse 1: Master P]
I see it I buy it, you need it I got it, I could
transform a car til' a hally berry body man
Regular wheels I banned um, don't stand um
I'm the first one to put sprewells on a phantom
Girls see me and scream!!!
I'm repin Orleans
I got toys baby flex ain't never seen
Xzibit in the game but he can't pimp
my ride,
I got everything flip from the in to the outside
Them lambo doors 50' talkin bout
I had um on a cutless befo' I brought me house
I put ice on my grill just to hurt them haters
27 diped in crome for the escalator
Put candy on the body so it glow in the dark
Put light on my rims for at night when they walk
Can't roll like no scrub, man on no hubs
Ghetto bill up in here...
y'all know what's up!

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2: Master P]
From the streets to the pin
You know the soldiers gon' win
When they see me on t.v. they say
he did it again,!
From his shoes to his clothes
he's ballin outta of contol,
From the bentley to the beamer to the
hummer with 6 doors...
But wody don't stunt, make them 6
fours jump,
Like reebox pumps,
P miller amps in the truck louis vettan
Ferrari, 360 is so clean.....
Ashanti rims, that really bing bing
And girls trip when they get in the ride
I got see-L 5, steering wheel on the other
side,
And I'm gangsta man, whatcha thinkin man?....
Shawty want to roll cause I'm on them Twinkies man

Now I'm know I'm kinda young but I keep my dubs clean...
Nick name my rims deime (d-e-i-m-e) cause they older then me
At the age of 15 man, doin big thinkgs man,
Don't hate dog! (why) cause you ain't me man
Some say I'm ballin cause my crome stay crawlin
Took the phantom for a ride, now they stay I'm night crawlin
Never get hungry cause I keep them deep dish'es
The people you saw, then they take pictures
My hummer sit clean on the shaq's minus 8
White, gold and purple, just like them old days (man...)
Now its kinda crazy cause Mercedes getting jeolous (what?)
Range won't asanti's but they can't have it
All for less its my baby, my boo, if I ever need help!
I just scream whoodi whoo!,
P miller speakers match my p.miller sneakers
The ones on my feet and the ones on my beamer!

When I get money I spend it on the bills but my baby shes the exception
To the rules you might wanna call it obsession but this to my heart
It's just a natural progression and I know that she and me can work things out,
If things get tough, that's why shes a keeper that's why shes a keeper.

No one but you seems to get me they try to sweat me saying baby make
Me cum bed me even if they sexy it don't matter cause my heart won't
Let me put my other feelings aside, and I don't care what the other
Guys say they just jealous cause they don't have you,
They don't have you girl, they they they don't have you girl.

Baby they wanna take you away from me, but that's not gonna happen not
To us oh no, they wanna take you away from, but the bond we have is stronger
Than they know, they wanna take you away from me, I ain't your average Joe,
They wanna take you away, they they wanna take they wanna take take you away.

I never thought that I'd let this get to me, telling all my friends she and
I would never be closer than what all they expected but I still made sure
That she was always respected, cause I know she possibly could be the one
If things get tough that's why shes a keeper that's why shes a keeper

And I stay iced out like my name was frosty, see shorty she the different

1995, I was in junior high
I saw a lot of shit, so I was glad to be alive
A lot of people died, but a lot of people here

It's time to be a man, time to make a plan
It's cool to make a hundred, but it's best to make a grand

We got to pay the doctors, but God got the answer

My baby on the way so I can't go to jail
And to my niggas on the block, stop selling rocks
'Cause I'm a tell the truth you can't outsmart the cops

You see what I did, I only drop hits
Chopping up game, why'all chopping up bricks
And some niggas snitch, cause they can't take the heat
How we gone go buy a system when the system got his beat

[Young Redd]
Hey, I'm from the home of the Astros, home of the Rockets
Born to rap yo, with a microphone in my pocket
Always thought I was grown, you couldn't tell me nothing
I would talk shit if you tried to tell me something

But I regret that, I had some minor setbacks
Old people thought my future would be jet black
All my years growing up, I thought life was a game
You can't make it real far, thinking life is a game

Yeah we lost a couple of friends, I almost lost my brother
I don't know what would of happened if we lost eachother
Everyday is something new, I just take it in stride
You only got one life, so enjoy the ride

Sometimes I was paid, sometimes I was broke
Me and Gray started hustling but my mama didn't know
But it's cool, cause now I'm into this music
The man gave us a gift and we loving to use it

And if you look real close you'll see
That you can only be you, and I can be me
'Cause can't nobody ever live my life but me
But you will never see what I see like me huh me

[Chorus: x 2]
And you don't know what I've been through
So you shouldn't judge me
And you don't know what I will and I won't do
So you shouldn't judge me

[Lil Ron]
It's getting harder now I just don't understand
Why the people in the world disgrace the black man
All that I could say, is pray and let it be
Little right and try your best not to end up like me

See I was the nigga that slang dope and steal cars
Glad I stopped before it led behind bars
Heart aches and scars, help me feel my way
Understand today I got a decision to make

Now do I want to live right or continue going wrong
I'm never at home this music keep a nigga gone
But this is what gets me, who are you to judge
'Cause I'm young and black, people still hold a grudge

Just a nudge right now'd push me over the end
When I was 14 I lost a very close friend
And ever since then my life ain't been the same
That's the biggest reason why I had to make a change

[Lil' Flip]
Never judge a book by it's cover, a man by his wealth
And if you already on your feet why don't you help somebody else
This what I was taught, so that's what I live by
'Cause you can't take none of this shit with you when you die

So everyday I try, to keep my head high
But these bird ass niggas always jump fly
Should I take em out the game, naw I'ma use my brain
I'm a kill em with kindness, and blow up my name

I came from nothing, and now I got a little change
A nigga happy now but I went through some pain
And everyday it rain, there's gone be some sunshine
I never thought I could put my whole life in one rhyme

[Chorus: x 2",What I Been Through,2002

Look at the nigga right next to you, look at him

They call me Thunder Cat, cause I got so many hoes
They call me cookie man, cause I sold so many o's
Did a lot of shows, made a lot of cash
Slid out the Benz, jumped in a jag
Jumped out the Jag, then I hopped in a Hummer
Guess what I drop, underground this summer
But get ready, for the shit about to hit the air
And bitch you ain't smoking endo, so I don't care

[Lil Ron]
Say Flip, look at all these hoes
Some are girls, but its niggas also
I'm tired of getting attention, when walking in places

Change the paces, winning the races
Money I'm making, cookies a nigga baking
Feeling my status, above average
Lil Ron be ready for all that static

[Lil' Flip]
We got automatics, nigga we still thuggin'
Nigga we still hustlin', all the hoes still loving
The way that we flowing, the cars that we driving
The way that we hustle, that's the way we surviving
Going to shows, going to clubs
Riding on Blaze, riding on Dubs
We from the south, we country as hell
why'all smoking that brown weed, we got that funky smell
The dro and the do-do, the blueberry endo
Riding on low-lows (Flip there go the po-pos)

Step out, let me see your license
And your insurance (nah, cause)

You a hoe, you a hoe, you a hoe, you a hoe
If the laws pull you over, he a hoe
She a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe
If she want child support, she a hoe
He a hoe, he a hoe, he a hoe, he a hoe
If he fucked up your car, he a hoe
She a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe
If she tear up your Bentley she a hoe

[Redd]
I ain't never been the type, to be in love with a hoe
Instead I'm trying to leave, out the club with a hoe
A basket case, I spit in a bastard's face
Walk in, crash the party, and trash the place
Fuck it I tried to tell em, some niggas wouldn't like it
Too bad, you should of seen it coming like a psychic
Then its, back to the Benz that's sitting on chrome men
Waving at the hoes, yelling aiight then

Ki's from over seas, for me that's just some cain

Yeah fuck em, my nuts let em suck em and let em go

Coming down, gripping grain up on the do'
On the flo man you slow, and not knowing that she's a hoe

I'm candy paint with DVD's and PlayStation 2
I got a mic with a crown on top that say R.I.P. DJ Screw

Sold out shows at the Astro Dome, y'all ain't know my money long
Y'all money gone 'cause we changed the game
And came with tighter flows
I wear expensive clothes got plenty hoes, 'cause nigga that's all I know
Like shopping sprees and credit cards, two ways and cellulars
Smoking blunts and pulling broads, everyday I'm switching cars

Sipping Sprite and breaking mics, winning money, shaking dice
Hitting licks and shaking vikes, you want three chickens pay the price

I'm bout to cause a disaster, like a earthquake
Eighteen's, got little kids dropping milk shakes
I smoke and sip eights, poured in one soda
Treat my girls like dogs, nigga teach em to roll over
Give em the cold shoulder, if they don't listen
But they quickly convinced, when they see them rims twisting
Better pay attention, to that nigga Lil' Reezy
It takes six dimes in bikinis, just to please me
Better believe me, its real in the field
My chain like yellow lights, it make people ill
In the Porsche switching gears, like a Nascar racer
And the rocks on my bracelet, got it looking like a glacier
I'm a clutch player, like Robert Hory
These cats ain't balling, they telling stories
But ain't gotta worry, bout H.S.E.
If I ain't hating on you, then why you hating on me

We from the deep down South in the city
In the light, and I be seeing these girls be looking pretty
That's why, I got to stay on my grind

Y'all don't know where we been (where we been)

Three is for the drank, Four pass me the smoke
You won't see me riding, in any ole Benz
Unless its jet black, on twenty inch rims
I got more Air Force, than the government
Every color pair, I'm so fly trust me I'm loving it
I never leave the hoe, with just a single rubber
And I crawl like Ringling Brothers, hoes love us
Under the in-fluence, catch me swerving
Playing in a number six, like Julius Irving
My watch and my chain, got me coughing and sneezing
Still a young heathen, as long as I'm breathing
I pay for a show, turn it out then I'm leaving
The way the man told us, its flossing season
This year we got it made, we shining y'all
Even though we got a due, we still grinding y'all

Who am I, name is Lil' Flip
And I roll with, two clips
Just in case, something happen
While y'all niggas yapping, I'ma be capping
Rolling with my strap and, pistol packing

I'm not acting, I pack clips so
Play your roll, and stick to the script
Before I flip, and empty the clip
I'm Gladys Night, cause I'm a pimp

Gotta peep yo' surroundings
Watch for snake niggaz, snake bitches

A lot of people got crooked ways
'Cause they was broke and they couldn't really make no pay
I knew a dude that worked at the super market
Makin minimum wage, livin poor and starvin
He stopped by my house and told me he was on his ass
Then he asked, could I afford to front a half
I wasn't worried about him tryna play a nigga
I knew where he stayed, So I go and spray the nigga
I ran in and out and laid down the rules
Made sure he understood everything was cool
After 3 hours he pulled in my drive way
With all my money dog, this musta been a great day
But somethin wasn't right, that was just too quick
I found out this bitch was tryna be slick
This lil trick had a mic taped to his chest
So instead I hit him in the head, not the chest

Nigga was like shit nigga, I was like what come on man

[Scarface]
Street lights are glowing, everyday's another struggle
And moving slowly in silence, steady making sho' my hustle
Is air tight, these city streets is hectic gotta get it here
Tomorrow ain't a promise to me, so I don't live in fear
I work until I touch it, stack it until I need it
I spend it on what I want, re-up and that's when I bleed it
The soldier could never see me, as being some'ing that's lesser
A nigga straight out the gutter, murdered without a question
Product of my surroundings, click it clack it and and down him
All they know is he missing, but niggaz ain't never found him
I'm sorry but still in yet, I don't live it on regrets
I'm a motherfucking killer, for realer this ain't a threat
I'm as gangsta as it gets, and my advice to you is live your life
And never when niggaz might, hit you under city lights
So get it right (never know)
You never know when niggaz might, hit you under city lights get it right

[Hook - 2x]
Lord forgive me, cause I know I ain't living right
Still I gotta make some'ing happen, under them street lights
But pay attention, let me show you what my life like
You can get your days cut short, under them street lights

Them folks got me under the scope, cause I ain't living right
Still I ain't the one to provoke, dog you get it right
20 inch shoes when I cruise, under them city lights
Careful with the road I choose, cause you can lose your life
I'm praying and hoping, I never get caught in the moment
Shot from a glock, that's smoking from not scoping
When a nigga told me, you don't work you don't eat
So I'm slanging thangs for cheap, where the streets lights meet
And my pop, was a rolling stone
15 I was grown, 16 I was holding my own
Is it wrong to sell you a dream, or sell you a zone
A long way from home, on this road I roam
Still I'm po'ing the liquor, for niggaz who ain't with us
Ery'body ain't a gangsta, every nigga ain't a killa
Naw but them laws, couldn't tell ya the difference
So pay attention, or find yourself locked in prison this ain't living man

[Hook - 2x]

Years have passed, and shit in the hood getting drastic
Two days ago, my homegirl got blasted
That's tragic, happened right on my block
I'm feeling paranoid, laws might run in my spot
So I'm living low key, and them folks don't know me
Slowly I ride through the city, stack mo' cheese
Then I slide out, to the hideout and smoke on
Haters watching, my chest is froze like a snow-cone
But hold on, trash talking ain't my game
Rather pimp me a dame, or switch lanes in a Range
Peep this it ain't a secret, them laws ain't right
They like to catch a late night, living the life
That's why I'm on top of my game, always thinking twice
Don't get it twisted, I still got a mean right
But most of the time, my nigga I'm on chill
It's real in the field, it's easy to get killed

Isolating hearts, poetical poisonous darts 
Puncture like needles, I always take care of my peoples 
Verbals vital, no rivals, there's no equals, no sequels 

With no one to help us 

I'll leave you crying for help and helpless and healthless, wealthless 

Oversellers envious and jealous 

Bitches and sneaks, pants and muscles 

I saw a view through the eyes 

Fake ass, bitch ass niggaz in disguise 

Keep calm, release the neutron napalm bomb on young hawks 

Splitting wigs like logs, cloudy visions like fogs 

When the pump gets to pumping, 

niggaz get to jumping like frogs, smoke like bungs 

Get to stepping, stepping with your weapon 

Pause, creep crapped and left in the puddle in seconds 

Fuck 'em with veterans, with game... 



Chorus (2x) 



One time, on time 

Give it to me all, 'cause I want it all 

Give it to me all, 'cause I love to brawl 

Give it to me all, 'cause I want it all 

One time, yeah I love to brawl 

One time (give it up), one time (give it up) 

Check it out 



It's hard to sustain and maintain through life 

With these motherfuckers throwing niggaz three strikes 

The homie big Lou got a fo' on deez 

That's the word, came up from flipping birds 

Words travel like black talents 

The homie's loud at silence, real G's move in silence 

How you gonna make it to the next stage 

If one second you're broke, the next minute paid 

Now you got the police planning 

Niggaz on the street scanning, loading up cannons 

If it was me, I'd move silently 

Prepare warfare, react violently 

Lou is too flashy, new clothes 

(???) with hoes, and got penetrated 

He had too many hoes knowing where he resides 

Soon as he got home niggaz was waiting in sight, no game 

Shh... 



Know what?

Lil' Shanice,"[Lil' Kim]
.. My Aunt Dot
left a glock and some blood on my sheets
Told me clean the shit up, then she hit the streets
Even though I'm her niece, she copped me a piece
Wack-ass caliber, nickel-plated with the silencer
What? She don't know I like my guns pretty?
Like my boy Castor Troy with the twin-glizzies
I heard a knock at the door {*knock knock knock knock knock*}
To my surprise I saw these two familiar eyes
Who are you?

[Lil' Shanice]
Whattup? I'm Shanice, don't remember me?

[Lil' Kim]
She called me by my government name, Kimberly
Who sent you?

[Lil' Shanice]
My mom sent me; her name is Dottie
She packed a note in my knapsack along with a shottie

[Lil' Kim]
Hmmph, she was cute; and mad fly
She had the Prada knapsack, with the hat to match
Bavari hiking boots, with the mink bubblegoose
and I could see she was admiring my Minski suit
Then she handed me the note

[Lil' Shanice]
Here - read this

[Lil' Kim]
I just stared her up and down
cause I couldn't believe this - then I opened it
It said, ""Bitches is out to get you;
your so-called friends, put a bomb in your Benz.
I'm on a mission now to do some harm to your friends.
They know where you live, so evacuate the crib.
And oh, the little girl, that's your cousin Shanice.
Since I can't be with her, I need you to babysit her.
Besides; she looks up to you - you're her idol -
and tomorrow is her first violin recital, 
and she would be more than happy if you could take her.
Peace, my number's on the back of the paper, hit me later.""
Damn.. what went wrong? 
Can't we all just get along, and make hit songs? 
Bitches all up in my ass like a thong
If this was a show, why'all hoes would get ""gonged""
Cause if it's on, then it's on, bring it on
What the fuck you waitin for? see'mon, let's get it on
What? What's takin you so long? I got plans for the future
to bring back your head like Medusa

Chorus: Lil' Kim (repeat 2X)
Girls be actin stink, and mad funny
why'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a ""Humphrey""
I know it hurts.. (I'm killin why'all)

[Lil' Kim]
Uhhh, we in the Range in this fucked up weather
It's snowin and I'm tryin to put the whole shit together
How Laverne, she always wanted to be like me
and dress like me, and look like me
and Nicole, it's like she lived in my house
Askin me for money, day in - day out
And last but not least the grimiest one Tayesha
She planned it all, come to find out her name is Keisha
see'mon Shanice I'm takin you to my house in L. Conn.
(I want to go with you!) Uhh, be quiet, and we'll get along fine

[Lil' Shanice]
see'mon please, I want to be just like you
600 Mercedes, and 380's in my doll babies
Crazy baguettes in my barettes; and,
H-class rocks inside my baby G shop
Fuck Barney and Lambchops; I don't love them hoes!
But anything goes when it comes to bankrolls
Diamonds on my toes, X-and-O's
Versace hottie in designer clothes
Scoop Lil' Nique and Jus, then take 'em to Toys'are'Us
Make em spend they cheese then kick 'em out and take the bus
I'm the S-the-H-the-A-the-N-the-I-the-see-the-E
but all my friends call me Miss Little Queen Bee
What what? I like the green, know what I mean?
Ever seen The Professional? (uh-huh) Well I come cleaner

[Lil' Kim]
You know what? I like you; little big person
but rule number one - no cursin
Anyway, what you know about that?
You too young for that, when I was your age
I woulda got hung for that
Then I picked up the phone, to call my Aunt Dot
so she could fill me in a little more about the plot
Hmm.. nine-one-seven, eight-five-eight, two-one-two-two
""Hello?"" Yo, what's the deal?
Why these bitches buggin out; 
I mean, what's this all about?
""See it's sorta like what Tonya Harding did to Nancy
They don't want you to win no more
Soul Train they don't want you to attend no more
And I guess that's why, they ain't your friends no more
The other day, when I was comin out the grocery store
I saw the bitch Nicole in front of the salon next door""
For real? ""Yup, then I choked the bitch out
At least one to the heart, tied up her hands and feet
Through her in my backseat,
then I dumped her on a dead-end street
The other two? Yeah they still linger
But don't you lift a finger, I'ma get 'em
so just pray I come home
and when we hang up, get rid of your phone""
Whoo! When Aunt Dot comes, oh brother
It's like five Bloody Mary's, one after another
Hmmph, she have you stressed, no wearin white, no sex
And when she get vexed, you guess what happens next
Cause them other two girls, that's still on the menu
is the reason why the story is to be continued..

Chorus",Aunt Dot,2000
Lil' Sin,"Born in 1975
Brought up in a small neighborhood
On the outscers of San Diego California
Spent my time hangin out in the street corners with the home boys having a couple of cheves passing around a leno
No not bothering anybody
Tagging up on fences and benches
Neighborhood tensions
Mad dog expressions
Weapons in possessions
Beautiful rucas
Lowrider carruchas
That's just my lifestyle homeboy and it can't be stopped
Cause now I got this shit on lock.",Intro,1996
Lil' Style 7 Young,"(Lil' Style)

Nine in the mornin, feds at my door (my door)
Lou Cortez creakin cross the hardwood floor (right)
Dippin through the alley I made my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape
Man with no music but happy he's free
Bailin fast as I can bail down 19th Street
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand
Gold on my knuckle, my pistol's closed in hand
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC
Remotely controlled by the bomb-ity
But just livin in big city is a serious task
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask

(Snoop Doggy Dogg)

We're comin with that G shit, that see shit that makin niggas sick
How does it feel to see a G from your clique?
Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?)
Last night's dice game got my win on
About a G and a half is what I come with
But twenty five G's is what I left with
*?Teatley?* was the word I heard
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the cone
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas
I threw a see (C-I-X) so my point was the biggie
Seven-four-four-tre back to back
I sent two fools back to their lizzack

(Kurupt)

See now I'm off to the graveyard shift
And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip
But I chill 'cause my ho might call
Ain't no thang 'cause I sleeps all day and slang when night fall
And I takes a quick walk up the block
With my Glock cocke, ready to make a stop where I set up shop
On 59th and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin
That's where a nigga'll be slangin
I'm makin a cool grip of shit, this ain't me
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki
And now the shops on deck
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tek, I don't half step
Now I got ends
And I'm rollin a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends
But I could only trust a few
And unawarely I trusted you
But if only G

(Snoop)

It's Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin get-go
Devoted and quotin, back in '84
I was thirteen, G was a year older
But I still wadn't afraid to throw him from his shoulders
Gettin good on the hood was the anticipation
And yeah, King Park was the destination
Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night
Even the smokers that be levellin gettin sparked tonight

(Lil' Style)

Back on the streets, straight blue and grey
'cause I represent like every day
Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot
When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot
From at least about five years ago
When I was in junior high goin to Marshall
The homey use to come up to the school and rock
And leave and have the bitches flockin his jock
Damn them was the days of the past
But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin people's ass
And everybody a blast
And if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz
And that's your ass
Fucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha)
He didn't even run, he walked away (bust)
'cause I let it sit that day
I wished I was there I would've clowned
But that's why we axed your bitch ass from the Pound
'cause he wouldn't even squad back
Man we can't fuck with no niggas like that
He'll get us all cracked
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap
Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!)
I second the emotion you was dropped the clique (yeah yeah)

(Snoop)

Some of these nigga are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you've ever been *?toetone?*
Go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on

(Dat Nigga Daz)

It's 5:30 in the mornin, now I'm yizzawnin
Now as I perceive to get G to a tee
And before I bail to school you know I blaze up a sack
Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack
Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection
And let me dial slow, flossin, tossin a bitch (bitch)
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten
Shoot the piece, slip to your fiends
Seven, goddamn it, when it deal
A '64 for the honeys, straight ho for the G
Young Daz, little nigga you can't fuck with me

(Snoop)

Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you
So what made them niggas try to spit at you
Disrespect a gang that snitch on you
Y'all punk ass niggas, man y'all some bitches too

(Young Swoop)

Who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (ha ha)
Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin up on you
'cause when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes
Just quarters, ounces, half ounces and quota
PC is the season and I don't smoke blunt
It sees the indo with skunk, I might as well get drunk
To smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest
I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up
My hood is gettin hot and niggas is tryin ta plottin
Come up off a young nigga, call his shots
Swoop G ain't the one, I do its to be done (aah)
Al-ways have my gun and my G from 2-1
It's Cerritos but you don't hear me though 'cause you don't really know
About the you-know, I'm Cerritos, silly ho
Swoop G by the fuckin L-be's-see
None of these nigga wanna fuck with these (aah)
Swoop G, Swoop G, G

You have to prove your love is true to me

You say that there is no other
I am the only one
And you say that if we were lovers
We would have so much fun
But my mother warned me
That I should beware of yound boys saying things that you say
So I must be sure that if I give you my love
You won't take it then run away

[Chorus]",Better Not Fight,2010
Lil' Trill,"I lost my daddy at fourteen, I lost Trell at twelve, life in jail.
Ain't it funny how the money makes you separate the real and fake?
I started off small time victim of the game, a Monte Carlo to a Bentley and a diamond ring.
I got fame but mayne my whole world changed.
Some niggas left me in the rain, my girls changed, they changed on me!
I thought I got lucky, two hundred G's took my grandmother from me.
I hit my knees (Why lord?!) I tried syrup I tried weed I couldn't cope nigga.
Head down crying tears at the hospital.
A broken home, tried to get my hustle on nigga killed Lil Ivy my soul gone.
I bought my mama a house she cried instantly, all that shinin got my niggas in penitentiary!

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
I can clearly see the sunshine, but I'm steady walking through the rain!

[Lil Trill:]
Still got hatred in the city after all that we done 
Did all the toy give always school clothes and things.
Even for Easter givin the kids bikes 
And for that they ain't cryin up in Carroltyn now that ain't right.
We still smile though cause of the sunshine, wonder what I'll do if I could press rewind.
I done seen a lot half both sides of the field, the best of both worlds and yeah I'm for real.
Mama got seven kids with pops I stand alone.
I'm walking through the rain but still I move on, I just started so right now I'm far from done.
I keep moving on until I see the full sun.
Patiently waiting but the best is still yet to come, 
I guess things happen for a reason when its said and done.
Say Lil B keep your head up just take it serious bra 
Keep your faith in God cause he's the one who lay at us.

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Diabetes steady eating my insides fucking my vision up I swear to God I feel like giving up.
Some times I'm laughin' with my money machine, but they trying to put me on dialysis machine.
I-v's in my arms, I know I'm doing wrong no insurance back to early can't long.
Being a daddy only thing that make me happy, I'm tired of getting sick same thing for young savage.
I try to do right and help my community police still kicking at my door Dirty motherfuckers.
You probably think I got the world at my hands, but really dog I got the world on my shoulders!
When I look at your son I see your face homie 
(Lil Ivy) everybody pray for me cause they hating on me.
Wish I could take it all back sometimes, truth is I don't even like to rap sometimes.

[Chorus:Repeat x2]",The Rain,2010
Lil' Trill,"Well fuck it, go on, turn the music up again
I heat the streets up like a oven, it ain't nothin'
I want mine just hit me up when it's ""on time""

I'm'a die thuggin' I think I'm'a die bustin'
I'm'a die hustlin, 'cause I refuse to die with nothin'
Bumpin' crews who drove from Cali in my old school two-tone
They missed me niggas barely, I want they whole fuckin' crew gone!
In that zone, where there ain't no smirks, niggas get murked
Just keep hidin 'cause it's too late to go to church, now
Show you muthafuckers how this trill shit work, now
Turn your shit into the 4th of Ju-ly, boo-ya!

Lil' Troy,"Where the love at
Momma told me there'd be days like this 
But I didn't listen 
Never question the woman's intuition 
My ambition is to give you what you miss 
Sweet love 
Take off your shoes  come and get your feet rubbed 
Us in the tub 
That'll be the shit 
Anybody that don't believe this can eat a dick 
I think we soul mates 
'Cause we got so much in common 
You make them hoes wait 
When you find the proper woman 
Then next to me 
Put your head on my chest 
Attraction stimulates me 
But it's not all about the sex 
I respect you got a mind 
And you self sufficient 
Opinonate yet know how to listen 
Now what's mine is yours 
If I'm ballin' you ballin' 
Tell that other nigga 
He can stop callin' 
Check this out 

[Chorus]
I want to be your man 

I want to be your man baby 
I'm talkin' about 
Providing you with all the lights, securities 
I mean, I think the first step is 
Going to pick out some rings 
What you like 
Baggets and pistol skirts 

Can't spend a life 
Without giving you my answer tonight 
Cause I gotta catch a early flight 
What you yellin' about 
The simple fact that I'm bailin' out 
I'm makin' moves 
My record sellin' out 
I need some affection 
Love can you teach me a lesson 
I might be sittin' fat down here in Texas 
But the thugs ain't mean 
So how deep is your love for me 
How real do you cut for me 
If the laws came and got me 
How long were you stuck with me 
If not long then don't fuck with me 
I want you down on my team 
And support 
When I'm tryin' to make my green 
It's for real 
I throws some karats in your ring 
I'll make it last forever 
'Cause you know 
I had that cash forever 
We can ball till pass together baby 
Where the love at 

[Chorus]

Yeah that nigga Lil' Troy 
Short Stop Records 
Puttin' down like a G yo 
That's how we get our groove on 

Recognize the mobb 
I bet you cold working star 
When they see the flowers that I'm sendin' to your job 
Read the cards 
Stick it in your purse 
Let's keep it rosy 
'Cause everybody so nosy 
So you can't believe what people say 
Misery, loves company tell them keep away 
It'll be okay 
If you trust in me to make it right 
Before I hit you I'll ?? 
That's on my baby's life 
Will you be my wife 
Please take this ring 
And a service to token 
To make you realize baby I ain't jokin' 
I'm coping 
But my adversaries got me ?? 
I need a god-feared woman 
Who understands my heart 
Leave your baggage from past relationships 
Out of the picture 
I put my old flames out I done changed 
All of my digits 
And that's real 

[Chorus] 

I want to be your man 
Sober 
Ain't really no need to question me 
????? 
For my loyalty or my commitment life 
You know my presence 
But you alone 
To let you know 
You don't want to mess with me 
You need to spend time with me 

I bring the heat 
You want to play 
It ain't a thing ?? 
You say you changed 
You look the same to me 
Eat and ball too much 
On the real, cause I done stall too much 
Girl I want you all too much 
Ain't no way in the world 
Me and you an ball too much 
Imagine having cabbage 
Straight lavish 
Friends wish they can have it 
'Cause I push a rolez, sip crystal glasses 
I'm all wet 
Don't listen to your friends about me cheatin' 
They don't' know that 
Your best friend want me 
Tell that hoe that 
For show that 
You know she want the kids 
You should have knew this 
True this 
Two real niggas left 
I'm one of the fewest 
Holla at me girl 
I'm all this 
We can do this 
Do that love thing 
So I can prove that

Lil' Twist,"I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or will it end in tragedy

Fatal attraction ready for action
She had a body like Ms. Jackson
I knew there was trouble when she passed by
But she was so fly
She invited me over
So I hopped in the Rover
Then my lady called the phone
And I should of went home
But I let the phone roam

And it was like
Oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's was like
Oh
I can't keep my hands to myself

I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or will it end in tragedy

I swear that I was done
I'm never going back
Then she called me up
She said I left my hat
You know I can't live without my hat
I got an excuse double back y'all
So you know I'm gonna have a ball
I said I'm going back y'all
Believe me that's not all

And now I'm like
Oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's like
Oh (Young Money)
I can't keep my hands to myself

I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or let it end in tragedy

Uh, I got a main bitch and a mistress
I'm trying to work it out, I'm on my fitness
Probably won't last, but I'm optimistic
One makes me happy, the other one makes a difference
I ain't a player, but I love a lot
She loves me, she loves me not
But it feel good, and it's not supposed to
I eat her insides, mm soul food
She put her head back, then her eyes close
We stuck in the moment like the time froze
Then my girl call, back to reality
But I keep her in a picture in my heart gallery, oh!

Oh (Yeah)
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's like
Oh
I can't keep my hands to myself

I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or let it end in tragedy",Love Affair,

Of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now that's G
Don't ask me about shit but money
Fuckin' right my money long I got that 10ft money
I get it fast when I get to the money
When I walk, it sounds like 10 foots running
I meant feet, I'm in deep like wet pussy
I'm a purple heart proven war vet rookie
You can't even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me, or don't step to me
Now don't step nigga, march with me
To the steps of the court building
Like ain't we God's children
I know at all times God's feel me
So I play my part until the war kill me
Salute or shoot!

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Than do it for the troops
It's young money salute
It's young money salute",YM Salute,2010

Lil' Twist,"Nice tires on da ghini,
You should wanna king me
Brain dead flow, vegetable zukini
I live on the beach,
She walk around in her bikini
Girls are like school,
And I cut em like seniors
Im here to distinguish,
The bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap,
Get some money in between it
Glocs like police,
Pumps like fenas
This beat gettin totaled,
Pam,Keisha,Kema
Sittin on da World,
Thinkin bout a girl
Pistol on my side,
Paint you like mural
Digged in my pocket, pulled out the party
Be cool before you get stomped and pulled out the party
Ha Ha Hollygrove shit, im on my Hollygrove shit
Lookin for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick

Big bad flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Church like a choir and a couple of old priests
Elevator in my crib cause its five floors
Im not expectin you to have one inside yours hahe
Vince Young, suicide doors, haha,
Life's a bitch, now die for her.

I have the type of flow n-ggas don't have to like,
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don't have to write,
The way I'm eating n-ggas wish they had my appetite,
Straight up out of Texas and I'm major like apple white,
I pour four then hit the exit door,
Take a trip to Macy's cop the whole second floor,
Hood smell the scent of money coming out my pours,
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue, bore,
I made it from a flyer to the forbes, (see me)
Young Elvis Freshly, yes he flyer than the store,
Dropping babys out and your chicks cheek, kicks neat,
Got your son looking up to me like I'm 6 feet,
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
Your daughter need someone to save her, not me,
I'm knocking hoes down like Laila Ali,
Try he and imma put the toaster to ya kidney,
Then I pull off in a Bentley top open like a chimney,
Damn, its no ceilings like a Colosseum,
Candy slab, paint dripping like gonorrhea,
The way Im leaning Ima nod if I stand still
Flow harder than an anvil,
Short (short)

Ok, its Gudda hoe,
All about my bills like buffalo,
Your b-tch under my sheets,
I heard she was an undercover hoe,
Purple got me moving slow,
Like I'm in a snail race,
Pop pop pop 3 shots to the head,
Then I pick up my shell case,
Leave em with a pale face,
Yes, I am a young money goon,
Your girl like a motion picture she gon be coming soon,
I do a certain rule, I pop her like balloons,
I pass her off to Mills then drop her off the tune,
Couple screws lose, you wanna play with him,
This is No Ceilings b-tch, roofless like a stadium,
We shut down every f-cking spot these b-tches see us in,
You want us in your club well n-gga pay us then,

I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I want to confess but I can't 
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do?
Let it burn inside of me?
Or will I get away?
Or will it end in tragedy?

Fatal attraction
Ready for action
She had a body like Ms. Jackson
I knew that it was trouble when she passed by
But she was so fly
She invited me over 
So I hopped in the Rover
Then my lady called the phone 
And I should have went home
But I let the phone roam

And it was like oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear I'm like oh
I can't keep my hands to myself

[Chorus]

I swear that I was done 
I'm never going back
Then she called me up
She said I left my hat
You know I can't live without my hat
I got an excuse to double back y'all
So you know I'm gone have a ball
I said I'm going back y'all 
But knowing me that's not all

And it was like oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's like oh
I can't keep my hands to myself

[Chorus] 

I got a main bitch and mistress
I'm tryna' work it out
 I'm on my fitness
It probably won't last 
But I'm optimistic
One makes me happy 
The other makes a difference
I ain't a playa
But I love a lot
She loves me
She loves me not
But it feel good
And it's not supposed to
I eat her insides
Mmm soul food
She put her head back
Then her eyes close
We stuck in the moment
Like the time froze
Then my girl call
Back to reality 
But I keep her in a picture in my heart gallery

Oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear I'm like oh
I can't keep my hands to myself

Where the bad bitches at, gon' drank?
Where the bad bitches at that twerk?
Put them weak bitches out that can't
Look at shawty right there with them quirks
Got me tryin' not to scratch my paint
And when she shake that ass, I throw more cash
Swear she tryna get a piece of my bank
Back it up, back it up, bust it open, wide open, baby girl
Let me see what you're workin' with
Me and T, some pimp shit, this is the collision
My nigga at the front, I'm at the tail end, where is your girlfriend?
I'm lickin' the surface, try puttin' a word in
I jump in that pussy and turn that shit to a whirlwind
I'm Twizzy F Baby, Mista Mista Murda
I'ma kill you little niggas but the pussy, I'm murkin' 'em
Let me slow it up
Y'all already know what's up
Been gettin' paid since a young age
Now that's young money, watch me throw it up
I'm in King of Diamonds like what the fuck?
Throwin' stacks at her, throwin' racks at her
And don't worry 'bout it, girl, if I'm old enough
Just gon' do me a favor, girl, back it up

Gon' get this money, girl twerk it slow
Let me see it though, let me see it though
Yeah I'm talkin' bendin' over, girl touch your toes
Now strike a pose, then drop it low
I'm in the strip club with my big bro
Named Weezy F, and we do it the best
Already 60 racks and leave the floor messy
Young Money, homie, YMCMB
Got a brown tone for the T-Streets
I need 3 more for Chris, B and T
I'm a fool with it, just a young elite
Shit, what the Hell? You can't blame me
This the fast life, get your cash right
And when she think it's right
Then come back to Twist
And we can match it up and have a cash fight
Now I'm balling on em'
Still stunting on em'
In the strip club, still hunching on em'
Still ripping bands, homie by the grands
Im the young boss, follow my commands
Now I'm bring bought seven hands
Back to my table, racks on racks to my naval
Got all the girls wanna rock the young boy like a cradle, well!

Two shots of this, ass shots on her
Don't ask for nothing, let me throw it up
Man she all on my balls like bowling bruh
Auggh!!
I'm more than amazing, with the location, a lot of caucasians
Niggas with money and money your savings
Bout' my business, nigga no blazer
Why you tryna save her, nigga I slave her
While you pay her, I get paper
Got hoes lined up like a taper
Back to back I call that Laker, huh!
P-pop a pill, do it big
Bend it over, I see it's real
Drizzy voice, young money ill
I low my dick, then auto-kill
She know it's real

I put the kush in the stogey, yeah, I put the Bentley in Drive
I'm pulling out the garage, and thanking God I'm alive
I've been through so much shit, been through trouble and back
I ain't do much time, but dawg I ain't going back
These niggas fake and they phony, the paparazzi wait on me
I left the jail in Givenchies, they should have posted that homie
I'm in the A with Rich Homie, I'm in the A with 2 Chainz
I'm in the A with my brother, it's YMCM Rich Gang
Now tell them niggas line up, I tell them niggas time up
This KTZ gon' stand out, it's clear I don't give a fuck
In my closet I eat you up, my fashion ill, no duh
My whip game insane uh Ferrari Testarossa's
Y'all niggas thought I lost it, I'm awesome
I just took a break to teach a young nigga how to boss it
Like when KG went to Boston
Or when Melo went to the Knicks
And he brought JR Smith and they both started ballin'
Big bro went from serving birds to pelicans in New Orleans
Uh, let me take a break,
Let me catch my breath
Rolling with the Birdman homie
It's YM over everything, nigga, I don't need nothing else
It's Lil Twist, nigga, I'm checked in
I fucked home girl and her best friend
You don't wanna miss out on your blessing
Got the dope dick and I use it as a weapon I just

Check (shoot'er) Sometimes I think I'm Michael Jordan
Michael Tyson, Michael Phelps and Michael Jackson
Might just drop my fucking tape and fuck around, it might go platinum
How'd I do that off of freebies? Fill my double cup with ether
Got the same buzz as niggas with an album off of features
See I'm doing it again
Got a tool in the timbs, now the rules gotta bend
No tools in the gym but I gotta bring it in
'Cause niggas wanna flex, but they really slim Jim
Gotta point it at him, him, fuck it and him
All I wanna do is kill kill for the ching ching
Got a best friend and the best friend got a twin
Gotta fit 'em all in, now that's a win win win win
The room's spinning 'cause I'm faded
Watch how you run up on these businessmen, they're gang related
I said I like the way she dance, she like the way I made it
Fuck me without paying a rent, imagine if I paid it
I owe you one girl, I owe you one's
Money always been the main attraction
Homie told me women always been the main distraction
And I'm too focused, I just hate to get disturbed
I'm busy making millions, she just started laughing so you know I had to

So for certainly I'mma get my blast on
To the face of a fuck nigga trying to fuck with us
Think they can make it if they can run a decathlon
Stay blazing, I mack on,
Play brave and get back home with them AK's
Crack arms with a straight face
That calm and I fain gaze
And attack on with a straight razor in that palm
Any nigga want it he gotta get it
The Yappa got it rolling and rocking with it
I got a nigga showing and popping, picking and going
Packing a fight, everybody hit the floor, he shot the men and boom
Pall bearers, cold moms, militia all Bishop's, O-Dawg's
You should've drove off, hitting on bitches and poor dogs
Looking the nose off, looking like I'm flicking the stove off
When I'm kicking the stove off, kicking the doors off
Everybody hit the deck, still bodies get thrown off
Say making a remarkable pay
Meeting grandpa at a doc or a bay
Bad bitch, hide the grippers, I may
Fucking killing unbook, come the coppers and spray
Twizzie get the chicken, they plot him hopping the gate
If you get to trippin' then you get shot in the face
You ain't got the bitch in the kitchen popping the safe

Hoes lookin' over here 'cause they like Ski Jack

Chirper goin' off like I got a dispatch
Could be lookin' for that work and I ain't about to holla back
Post up on the whip and start lookin' for somethin' bad
Nice thighs, cute face and gotta have a fat ass

Bust that pussy open then I tell her bring it back
I'm a beast up in these sheets, it's like somethin' you never had
Caught you at the club doin' that sexy ass dance
Dropped it down to the floor and bought it back up in a stance, got damn

I like the way she workin' it
Ass sit right and it's like magic when she twerkin' it
Baby, don't you jerk me, I know this is for certain
'Cause it's guaranteed, she let me beat then I'll murk it

My dougie, my dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
She say she like my dougie, I'm fresh, my dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh, yep, flyer than a motherfucker

My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
She say she like my dougie, I'm fresh, my dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh, yep, flyer than a motherfucker

Just gotta fade, dressed to impress
Bone got a shoe fetish, so you know I stay fresh
I ain't worried about that mess a couple grand up on my chest
Plus drew then bought a tick and I stay fresher than some sess

Don't want my shoes to get no specks
Don't want no bitch to touch my neck
I'll tear this club up, if I feel some disrespect
I just wanna find a chick 'cause lil Wil just popped an x
And I don't wanna work hard 'cause I'm feenin' for some sex

Do my dougie fresh and watch them hoes get to choosin'
Middle of the club, jammin' hard to my music
Bet you can't do me like a triple x movie
Pull that dick up out ya pussy let it slap there on ya booty

Goin' hard in the jacuzzi, oh my god I like a [incomprehensible]
Stars still pursuin' 'cause I get a thing of boozey
Don't know what I'm doin' better check me out fully
Mix that dougie fresh with that north side boogie

My dougie, my dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
She say she like my dougie, I'm fresh, my dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh, yep, flyer than a motherfucker

Lil' Will,"You've got your home of the brave 
And I've got my land of the free.
You conform to what society says
And I conform to me.
Looking for light in the corners, 
Getting caught in the spider web.
You look at me as though I'm giving a performance
When I'm just feeding my head.

And you know that I'm doing alright
And I won't explain myself to you just to avoid a fight
How I'm living ain't correct, 
But for me, its just right

I'm not completely insane.
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy.
There's no one to blame, 
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me.

I've got a pair of ruby slippers that 
I don't wear much anymore
And if I had the nerve, 
I'd click my heels and return
To the wonderland I knew before.
I'm waiting on a slow boat to China, 
Gonna sail away to the sun.
I've been searching for myself, 
And I know I'm gonna find her
If I break away from everyone.

So, the way that I act may not fit in.
Just because I have a mind of my own,
Doesn't mean its a sin.
I don't ask you to give up; 
Don't expect me to give in.

I'm not completely insane.
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy.
There's no one to blame, 
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me.

Some like to live for the moment, 
Taking life into their hands every day.
And if they don't get killed, 
They get so high off the thrill,
They could float to heaven anyway.
And others want to save for tomorrow,
Thinking money is security.
Well, I understand the need, 
But I don't get the greed.
Y'know, they all seem pretty crazy to me.

You can tell by the expression I wear.
Though I seem a little strange to you
I don't really care.  I've got the freedom to be;
There are others like me everywhere...

I'm not completely insane.
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy.
There's no one to blame, 
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me.

Welcome to the life of a young thug nigga (yea)
Only hang out wit' them criminals and drug dealers (ayyy)
I'm from even where dead die (die)
But try an' do it big like the kid from Bedstuy
I see death around the corna and I ain't scared
I got a carbon 15 and I'm fully prepared (that's right)
Lord a mercy 20 rounds in a clip (yea)
Outta line get 20 rounds in ya hip (ayyy)
Shoot first and ask questions lata' (lata)
The answer is it was all about the paper (yea)
Everything the game is shit to lose
And a new forty-five that I'm dyin' to use (yeahhhh)

[Chorus - Ill Will]
If ya real like me (like me)
Throw ya hoods in the air so the whole wide world can see (ay)
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed
And if ya real like me (like me)
Keep that thang on ya hip that's just the way that it's gotta be
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed

[Verse 2 - Young Buck]
I done seen niggaz come and go
Shit the whole world done seen what I done before
We do anythang when the funds is low
I'm the reason outta towners don't come no mo'
Let me show you niggaz how to break down the whole thang
My nigga B.G. know Buck been a birdman
It's got to be in ya blood to be a thug
If I ain't makin' enough I'ma jack my plug
We was born in it
Not sworn in it
You can go against it or you can join wit' it
Made my mark so the streets gon' remember me
Now come and get it nigga Cashville Tennekee holla back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Trick Daddy]
Some of the dudes we thought was real O.G.'s was O.B's
Cause they talked pleas and included G's like you and me
The first step was going to set a trap
So in a short period, they convinced the grand jury to allow a phone tap
And if they listenin'
Not once did they hear us mentioning
Murder and a cocaine distributing
Through all that was dividends comin' in
I'm strict legit, and better yet we too smart for ya bullshit
Callin all cars (callin all cars)
Hit your brother along
And tell 'em hurry up and come them niggaz got gunz
Man down, shots fired, only fuck niggaz and cops died
First stage of a riot
And them fucks couldn't sneak by
Oh you want to witness some shit
Fine bitch, be quiet
Because they only got what you tell 'em
And only witness that they had, the bitch was layin' there dead
Shot in the street all red, with two shots to his head
Cause he was workin for the feds
And the last informant, informed us
They had it out for us
For a bird that he got popped for
So ride or die for him (ride or die for him)
Better yet, you better kill 'em
Cause I think he's gonna be the bitch to tell 'em
And he probably done all ready told 'em
But then again with out a witness them bitches ain't got shit

We can do it in the Black 500

You got me goin', I don't think I wanna stop now

And y'all looking now
I can see right now
y'all will never understand me
I call my best friend my family until they cross me
Alcohol and weed cost me
So I limit it
Running niggas over like Emmitt did without a squad
Drag you about a hundred yards
Many bumps and scars
Pull out in the hottest cars with my entourage
Smoke more L's than Debarge
With connects worldwide like Macintosh
I practice living large
Niggas out of town don't understand these kids (say what?)
Niggas comin' to get me can't find where I live
I got two or three cribs stack the mill in the mill
y'all get none of this dough shit y'all fiends stay ill

And the charts say I'm number one

Far from an amateur, a money maker
Leave your chick alone with me

The Highway meets College Park (yeah yeah shorty)

This is how we do it to em - [ALL THE HYDRO]
(we'll get a lady today) - [IT'S GOIN DOWN]
this is how we do it to em (believe that)
[ATLANTA STYLE BABY] (listen to this why'all)
No doubt, come on..

College Park got control of me
'Cause one of these snake niggaz told on me
Seen me in the cut, then he rolled on me
Thought I was gone but they was only holdin me

then it was told to me
Playboy, you only good as your team
You gotta leak find or seek,
hem it at the seams

I felt that, held back, went to the draft
Squeeze the juice from the peach when I pick my staff
Now I'm back with the slimiest, grimiest
Niggaz who behind me is the ones who know what time it is

Red Clay Renegades, violence is Minute Maid(?)
Still thugged out, hooked on Alize and Hennessey
Strictly in it til the day the game finish me
Honk your horn if you feelin me

Put your fists in the sky, wave them deuces high nigga
'Cause it ain't nuttin but that fire rolled up

[Chorus: x2]
I run with Worldwide Renegades, violence is Minute Maid(?)
Still thug livin, hooked on Alize and Hennessey
Stayin down til the day the game finish me
Honk your horn if you feelin me

I run with nothin but them woofer pushers, sittin on gold things
'drats give you slow brains who look like they on Soul Train
We run thangs, from the yea game to trickin
Don't come and think you stickin, below this Mason-Dixon it's rules

Born raised and die for it, hands kept high for it
Make niggaz mother cry for it
You know like I know, respect these rules
Don't make Don Chilly lose his cool

If it's a nickel sold in the Park, I want two-fifty
and if you chief a blunt, chief it with me
Respect my Bankhead killaz, McKennasville grave fillers
Others cross the city pushin pealers

'Cause I'm a true ATL-ier, Southside villain-er
Promise to check for shorty find out if they real or not
Come fake and get boxed, sent home
and watch the world spin like these twenty inch chromes

[Chorus]

I'm a have to slide with somethin, all the money in this game
Chicks callin my name, they want me bad, but I don't stop
I'm in my droptop V, I got a lot of things
to prove to niggaz and you'll see, by the way it looks

A lot of niggaz gon' be shook, don't disrespect
and no hard feelings took, I profile
while switchin styles in the crowd runnin wild
Have you niggaz home dottin your rhyme, blowed out

'Cause I showed out, so what'chu know about?
You gettin money or you assed-out
You sip a drink until you passed out
Circle the chiefers with no reefer

I'm in the corner where it's dark, preparin to spark
Niggaz screamin let me hit it like I'm (?) or somethin
It ain't no limit when it come to how much niggaz puffin
I mark the wall I dust em all
It's the Hennessey in me that'll blow the wall

You and me, privacy

I wanna talk back to her
Make love to her
I wanna hear you scream my name

I like it slow
And I know you like it too, baby

Let you know a nigga miss you when out on tour
When our tongues touch
Have a playboy sing it much
Roll a Dutch, let me tell you it turns me on
When 112 sing to you
What kinda feeling do it bring to you?
I bump hard till you say I'm being mean to you
I know the ice Roley gleam to you
A true player's what I seem to you
And if you want it
We can do it in the Black 500
Wit' the top down
In overdrive when we ride cause I'm hot now
You got me goin', I don't think I wanna stop now
Z feinin' like a criminal on lockdown
So let's get a way to get away
You gettin' hot baby, please don't melt away
I got a crib on the beach in Palmetto-way
And here's your personal key to see me everyday

Such a beautiful feeling

[Lil' Zane]
I know a lot of times, it seems like it gets hard.  
But you gotta always keep faith, and always look forward.  
You never know what the future might bring. 
You never know what's ahead.

[Lil' Zane]
You got the attention of all the fellas so the chickens are jealous
They at your toes when it rains tryin to hold you umbrella
The new meat in town, all the niggas wonna get down
When getting no play they frown, 
you on they bad side, they callin you bitch now
Sophomore year, two years to go
All you tryin to do is get your first car, and make doe
Got a part time job, and the man callin your bluff
Always out to cheat us if you love wasn't enough
Problems in the home, daddy dearest done turned abusive
He got your moms scared, so thoughts are skippin out are useless
How can you get them grades, when you can't keep your focus
16 and getting hit this drunk nigga think he Joseph
Givin you black eyes so in school you wearin glasses
Friends ask what happin but believe behind your back they laughin
You show no worry but the pain don't hide
Baby girl wipe your eyes, I'm here so don't cry
And it's

[Chorus]

[Lil' Zane]
You turn no fire till you lies, tellin me I was safe
I can't take it no longer father open the gate
I seen all I can take, child killin's and rape
The same niggas that I used to love was showin' me hate
My harts lyrics and my spirits through you body and soul
Makin you feel the way I felt when these rhymes was wrote
My antidote a little weed smoke, time and thought
Makin me come up wit that raw shit, hurttin your hart
I know you feel me cause you know things I'm sayin is true
Now would I lie to you, about my life and what I been through
Tell me have you ever lost a best friend, to drugs and gats
Had to tell his mother knowin she would have an attack
Sorry lady but your son and I was runnin the block
Ran up in the wrong neighborhood, flossin our knots
Actin folish when we should have been home in the bed
Restin instead, Tony took two to the head
He never made it

[Chorus]

[Lil' Zane]
I went hot summers and cold winters, wit no dinner and-a
Freezer full of ice ain't nothin nice
And I never cream in my life, so when I did get it
I had to work and run wit it, have fun wit it
High speeds in 740's, niggas starin' hard
Mini battles and war stories, bitches love my scares
Sweatin Kev' cause he payed, and plus he from the yard
No superstars, livin gods, is what we are
Town to town, dick em' down, that's how we do it baby
Under covers we wear rubbers cause catchin AIDs is crazy
I do the unbeliveable and talk the sweatest game
And see more doe then snipes on the money train
Me bein broke is the funniest joke
That's like a nigga tellin me I stole a song he wrote
And I ain't tryin to get caught up in all that madness, life is good
Young world follow me, lets get up out the hood

Chorus",Beautiful Feelin',2000
Lil' Zane,"[Lil' Zane]
What will it take for you to notice me; it's like I'm not here
Do you see us can you see us down here
We have a bad habit of lookin over people
But this time I'm gon' die famous and everybody gon' know

[Verse 1]
I'm just a skinny nigga tryin to get bigger and grow stronger
and the lust to live plush and can't wait no longer
sick of seein moms workin comin home back hurtin
Cryin on my shoulder 'cause the job's workin her over
On time everyday but the boss won't promote her
He's racist she say and assaultin in some way
Gon' see him on his off day, gon' let him know
You fucks wit moms no mo' when I drive the 44
When the headlines read, ""Boy's Last Heart Was His Mind For Greed""
And he'll probably get the chair if good reason ain't there
tell the judge my excuses for the crimes I've committed 
I was high when I did it
Worked a pound of Jay's herb, in the heat of the night
my mind clicked up on some other shit, something ain't right
met in the parking lot
he was comin out his parking spot
Bet nobody see it out there, it stay dark a lot
Went for the handle but the door was locked
At the same time cockin the glock kickin the car door
maybe not hold up, wait a minute
this rap game just got in it
and plus game I'm sayin two times
the world'll be mine

[Chorus: Lil' Zane]
Gonna be famous, hard to be nameless
Niggas gotta die to be famous
If I die famous, hard to explain this 
I live a life to die famous

[Verse 2]
hustle money by Bloods, Crips, and drug dealers
It's all love wit us but disrespect, you catch slugs nigga
I hang wit cutthroat niggas that'll choke yo niggas
Tie you up and rope yo niggas for rap or for dope baby
when I was young couldn't picture bein broke baby
then fuckin wit them dope boys
had me low crazy
you know it's crucial when I'm sellin to my folk figure
dope fiends mixed genes
Papa was a rolling stone and I ain't grown
Left this lil nigga all alone, now a nigga grown
Genetic game that you passed on
Guess how many niggas I've passed gone, niggas in the system now
Ho's wantin me to hit it, but I'm dissin now
They got me wild, I know it's foul
but respect my lifestyle, it isn't fair
Before I'm legal I'll be a millionaire

chorus 2X's

[Verse 3]
Woke up this morning and saw the news flash, special report
the judge gave a nigga life 'cause the boy shot up the court
witness we die for niggas
pullin triggas for a livin 
and we takin any and everything that we wasn't given
'cause hard times, keep a nigga keep writin hard rhymes
stash 9's run up in a nigga ain't scared to squeeze mines
freeze time, when I stop your heart
'cause the slugs that i'm spittin is the spot that could stop
I die famous, you be the nigga I shot
but still nameless, 'cause they can't figure the plot
my crew stainless, and we ain't hailin no pot 
and ain't nobody gettin bigger than the niggas we got
we worldwide, but we ride for a nation of thugs
we burnin heaters if you cheat us
dudes workin the slugs
And get the sex baby 'cause I'm addicted to fame
You make me bust just by screamin my name
and when I die I die famous

(Yes!)

(Why do we have to die)

[Chorus]

(I know a lot of times.. we go unnoticed)
(They act like they don't love us)
(But I love you that's all that counts)

(We love you that's all that counts)

(But we do it baby)

Left his wife and two kids at the crib lonely
Got in the way of a stray bullet when I pass
Trying to retaliate on beef that happened in the past
Ways of the world, how will I last when the economy crash
I'm going all out getting my cash
While spend mine open, with my eyes on the world
Ghettos and jail cells gave me stories to tell
Body swells from the evil smells that I inhale
Evil set me up to fail make my life so real
People tape will caution times being 
Lost my soul series to scar
I'm fighting demons off, it's the ways of the world

Even though it hurts chest
I'm gonna spark 'till I lose my breath
Living in sin since life began
Coming all the way out the water to get oxygen
Please father help me breathe again, at ease again

Even though it hurts chest
I'm gonna spark 'till I lose my breath
Living in sin since life began
Coming all the way out the water to get oxygen
Please father help me breathe again, at ease again

Looking at my self in the mirror, I took a second to think
Memories of being babies, given milk to drink
Without a worry at mind, we would play all the time
Name calling and b-balling took up most of our time
We were hard headed they all said it
From my parents to our teachers and even 
Preachers couldn't reach us
I say my prayers, I gave my momma 
Grey hairs she lives in fear
The thought of me not being there got her worried scared
They say I look just like my father, without the beard
They should have named that nigga magic he disappeared
A couple months out of the year, he reappears
Its all the same, ain't nothing changed, you still my nigga
Don't hold a grudge, just give me love, I'm on my own
I'm kinda sober from a broken home
Wondering what's going on, did I deserve this
Living in Atlanta got this little nigga nervous
Mama tried to feed us all, until she got laid off
Had the rats paid off, now we all laid off

Even though it hurts chest
I'm gonna spark 'till I lose my breath
Living in sin since life began
Coming all the way out the water to get oxygen
Please father help me breathe again, at ease again

Even though it hurts chest
I'm gonna spark 'till I lose my breath
Living in sin since life began
Coming all the way out the water to get oxygen
Please father help me breathe again, at ease again

Ducking the gun shots, at the age of thirteen
There was a war zone, so you choose your team
When the war strikes you better have a heart to fight
Or get lost in the world when you loose your life
I would like to get blown, so I read and pray
Surviving day to day, running the streets of stray
Living all my self no company
You better meet the heat when you come for me
And when I die, burn alive, that's a wish of mine
I know that heaving in the zone ain't that hard to find
And when you make it they gone take it, that's a must you know
Don't think of getting to the top without a problem or so
I take for precaution as for evil gotta hit on me
I've been a bad boy for momma, don't you quit on me
They built a jail so when we rise they can crush our dreams
Two of the largest in the industry, erased from the scene
And I don't wanna be a target so I got with a team
They got a glow around their body and do shit you've never seen,
Know what I mean?
Take it deep like submarines, that's what we do, only humans
Trying to get through the world with no confusion

When you close your eyes, can you state the pain, the misery
Bringing for you will rescue me
These are the ways of the world
Now I have to choose between life or lose my sanity
Go with the streets keep calling me
These are the ways of the world",Ways of the World,2000

is dedicated to that one girl that every player wants. 
I see you baby, and I want to know, what must I do?

[Lil' Zane]
What can I do to make you see that
You want a hot boy baby I'll be that
Tell ya man that you won't be comin' back
Them other cats that you don't need none of that
I won't dine you, I'll grind you
Standin up behind you
Hit it from the back so exact that it blind you
Never tried to find you
But now I know I need you to combine with
Help me raise mine with
I need a lady in my life when the streets is rough
So come on baby let me put ya heart in handcuffs
Won't stop even when you tellin me it's enough
Can't drop till I'm feelin that I'm killin ya stuff
want to be the one you livin' for and givin' ya more
Make ya blush when ya hit my plush bedroom floor
Nobody sittin baby
You gettin' more than you can take
So come on shorty stop bein' so fake

What must I do? (To show you that I love you)
What must I do? (Please tell me)
What must I do baby? (To have you)
What must I do baby? (To hold you, to have you)
What must I do? (Come closer, I'll grab you)
What must I do? (Please tell me)

What must I do baby? 
(Keep you iced out, spend nights out, baby I'll put ya lights out)

[Lil' Zane]
I know ya man ain't blind it ain't hard to see
Blew his mind when he saw you in the car with me
And my girl ain't blind 'cause she ask and want to see
Who is that wit you when I passed the hummer
I said nobody but she smelled yo' body
Wit you bout a hour ago
Should a listened when you told me take a shower though
If I was her man she'd even take half my dough
But I'm not
So hop up in the drop we can cruise the block
And got a spot where them niggas don't go
On the low shorty pop 'dro
But she don't let guys know
By the time we left, her eyes low
Let's do it in the parking lot
Baby I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
Already comin' out my shirt 'cause it's awfully hot
Got down to everything but my jewels and socks

Chorus

[Lil' Zane]
Last week I met this girl
My nigga she drove me crazy
Damn, she bad as hell
Even let her push my Mercedes
I hear she got a man
But he ain't beatin it crazy
That's why she came to Z
'cause I treat her like a lady
Took her up out the hood
Flossin' hard in fancy cars
By my side at the awards
Lookin' badder than the stars
Chickens was getting jealous
And players was lookin' mad
Of course, could have been my Porsche
But mami was kinda bad
Hold up, am I startin to catch feelings that I never had
And if I get serious will my niggas laugh
She like 25, I ain't even 20 yet
Diggin with her, gotta show her how my money stretch
She got drops that she ain't drove yet
She buyin' furs and it ain't even cold yet
Gimme anything I need, shorty gon' go get
I got platinum and I ain't even old yet

Girl its gotta be somethin
Slippin fallin slippin 
You must really love me

[Lil' Zane]
Told so many lies 
By so many different guys
Its hard to see the truth when in front of your eyes
I'm from a city of conflicts
Criminals and convicts
Livin on the run baby 
Only havin fun baby
She was just a friend so I never dug her
A young thug and so it wasn't in my heart to love her
You say you love me regardless 
You was young and I was heartless
We both said it
I was hard headed
Everything you said went into a ear and out another
I couldn't understand you wanted me to be your lover
You took time every night to write me love letters
And you used to whisper in my ear nobody does it better
And did I mention it was long letters
I like they way you squeeze in them dungaries
But the thongs betta
And you believe that I'm not there
Till it make it feel like if you leave then I won't care
Yeah

[chorus]

[Lil' Zane]
All my life I been goin through depression
More of the love and less dressin
I'm tired of guessin
Tell me if you want affection
You make a thug feel love
You head rushin
And I can't seem to get enough 
Can I touch somethin?
You're like an angle wit some wings sent to guide me
The law try to lock me down but you hide me
Be beside me strapped for war soldier guide me
I'm tryin to be wit you 
ain't a army that can stop me
Told me team the dream and automatically they knock me
Said ya beat me down cause I'm young I'm like ""watch me""
I love winnin, ice linen and keep my dubbs spinnin 
Love women, street corners and I'm gone keep on bendin
Wit you its no pretendin 
And even at the beginin I knew that you was wit it
Even tho I neva hit it
Forgive me for the times I bullshitted
And now I'm all yours
Baby you did it

[Lil' Zane]

Yeah, Next, uh Lil' Zane

Come on drop the top, let cha' hair fly

It's a clear sky tonight baby

Uh, let me know what's on ya mind

[Tweety]

It's Saturday, get the car shined up

Hair cut lined up, Heaven made my mind up

Professed one side of it tied up, won't see me there

I wonder how she wears her hair

If I see her I swear

I'm gonna put the game down like you

[Chorus: Next]

I'm just looking for love

I've been looking all over the club

Fresh Nikes, jeans cuffed, pressed in Sean John

Trying to find someone, someone for me

[R.L.]

I just tipped valet

Got in line through the metal detectors, stormin' days

Movin' to the sound of the DJ hoping she'll come my way

Is it the girl with the bomb weave, standin' next to me

Or is it the one with the short waves

A few are stepping but I ain't checking cause

[Chorus]

[Lil' Zane]

I switch lanes when I hoop game

Bet I score the same when I shoot game

I promise baby that I change whe the loop came

I'm off to bigger, better things with my new thang

No strings attached I'm on my two-way

Hopin' that our beams'll match

Gotta see you later baby, I'm a fiend for that

Wide body Navigator but my screens are flat

Now we watchin' motion pictures sittin' right in the track

Wanna honey dip, not interested in spendin' money

But how the money flip

She ain't concerned when I earn, she make money chips

I lit the fire place, baby gave me fine face

Tell me what cha' want but shorty I'm not Mase

I'm known for drillin' in a hole like I'm I-A

Fast as a speedin' bullet on the highway

Hopin' that I'm not late

And I ain't worried bout a ticket cause I got cake

Baby I'm lookin' for love

Lil' Zane,"Throw me the ball and watch me what I do with it
We got Bow Wow in the house
My man Lil' Zane, Lil' Wayne, Sammie sang to me

Strike one, got you by surprise
Strike two, right before your eyes
Pitch three, this ones to the wall
Ain't no game like a game of Hardball

When I step to the plate the outfielders get back (back)
Cuz they know I'm the only tight for dogs
So many back to back hits they call me little Sammie Sosa
Bubble gum, balled up all the hustlers
Y'all know how to work it when it's time to compete
On the field, on the court, over any hot beat
And break, and you know it when you see your clone
And right now that's all I see goin' on, holla at me
Game time, all I think about is bringing home the trophy
If your team is better mine, you really gotta show me
Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk
Mistreat me, and send my squad back home
'Cause I don't lose to much
Matter fact, I ain't never list at all
When I'm playin' Hardball (that's right)
So, if you on the mound about to pitch to me
Understand I'm like Griffin, I keep 'em to the wall

This goes out to them jocks that stay on my jock, throwin' the pop
Keep pithcin' 'em, I'm in the kitchen makin' radio rock
It's usually preferred, I be choosey with all my words
Throwin' eggs at them chicken heads, bangin' on the curb
I left 'em a word, I'm fast ballen' with a curb
Happy slidin' home, tellin' them friends that's in the third
Sure ya done heard, who I'm doing and what I'm doin' was false
And what's true, girl listen
When it comes to this game they call me Zane McGregor
That other kid was just a mark, so I made him retire
See, we all got a base, and we hold our own
But when I come up to bat, we all goin come home
And our fans cheers us, 'cause they know what the drill goin'
Out of the field and into your automobile
And I hope it ain't your Range Rover, that you spent your change over
I'm in the dug with my tounge out play the game over

Strike one, got you by surprise
Strike two, right before your eyes
Strike three, oh I got you out

They call me young Wheezy, Rodregous
You know I'm gettin' you hot, hot as the Kendrick, ya know
And I keep the crown bat swingin', swingin' that at iron
Pitch on the block like monaural
To bad for TV, you won't see me I'm ridin' the streets
I'm a hustler, people, my life in the streets
Watch the game, get you life in the streets
My watch, my chain, and my teeth Cost
That way I will never cheap talk
And I call my mommy sweat heart, she call me sweet daddy
And she gladly, loves the way that daddy batty, yeah baby
Whezzy Wee is a playa baby, and I don't share babies
So if you searchin' for some bitch ain't nothin' here, baby
Catch me throwin' an eighty in the latest Bentley
Goin' out, and Whezzy never hit a foul, a Hot Guy
Does hip-hop flyies are knockin' up, out the park
And after the game we gone meet up after dark

I won’t miss

Is there a place
A place to belong
Where love will recreate me?

Te confundí con una de ellas
Así tan bella eres tú


(coro) Eres la razón de mi vivir
Eres por quien yo soy tan feliz
La medida exacta a mi piel
Lo que yo mas quiero 


Eres la razón de mi vivir
Eres por quien yo soy tan feliz
El abrazo que siempre esperé
Mi amor eterno

Et sa peau de parchemin, ces dessins, oh
Ça prend tout son sens, chaque fois que j'y pense

Juste attend, juste un temps
C'était l'heure et le moment, je savais
Qu'il ne reviendrai pas

Aux heures blanches, avant l'aube et l'orage, oh
En silence, il a gagné le large, oh

Qu'on assure plus nos arrières
Qu'on s'trouve un bout d'océan pour poser nos cœurs en sueur

Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los 17,2005

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more

Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Wall Street bankers are we
With plenty of currency
We'd open up the safe
But we forgot where we put the key
We're the favorite lads
Of girls in the picture ads

But we can't be cads
The Vanderbilts are waiting at the club
But how are we to get there? That's the rub
That's the rub

We could sail up the avenue
But we haven't got a yacht
We could drive up the avenue
But the horse we had was shot
We could ride on a trolley car
But we haven't got the fare
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes we'll walk up the avenue
Yes we'll walk up the avenue 'til we're there

We would swim up the avenue

Lilla Crawford,"Look at that flesh
Pink and plump
Hello, little girl
Tender and fresh
Not one lump
Hello, little girl
This one's especially lush
Delicious
Hello, little girl
What's your rush
You're missing all the flowers
The sun won't set for hours
Take your time

Mother said: straight ahead
Not to delay or be misled
But slow, little girl
Hark and hush
The birds are singing sweetly
You'll miss the birds completely
You're traveling so fleetly

Grandmother first
Then Miss Plump
What a delectable couple
Utter perfection
One brittle, one supple
One moment, my dear
Mother said: come what may
Follow the path
And never stray

Just so, little girl
Any path
So many worth exploring
Just one would be so boring
And look what you're ignoring
Think of those crisp
Aging bones
Then something fresh on the palate
Think of that scrumptious carnality
Twice in one day
There's no possible way
To describe what you feel
When you're talking to your meal

Mother said
Not to stray
Still I suppose
A small delay
Granny might like
A fresh bouquet
Goodbye, Mr. Wolf
Goodbye, little girl
And hello","Hello, Little Girl",2014
Lilla Crawford,"Mother said: straight ahead
Not to delay
or be misled
I should have heeded
Her advice
But he seemed so nice
And he showed me things
Many beautiful things

That I hadn't thought to explore
They were off my path
So I never had dared
I had been so careful
I never had cared
And he made me feel excited

Well, excited and scared
When he said, come in
With that sickening grin
How could I know what was in store
Once his teeth were bared

Though, I really got scared
Well, excited and scared
But he drew me close
And he swallowed me down
Down a dark slimy path
Where lie secrets that I never want to know

And when everything familiar
Seemed to disappear forever
At the end of the path
Was Granny once again
So we wait in the dark

Until someone sets us free
And we're brought into the light
And we're back at the start
And I know things now
Many valuable things
That I hadn't known before

Do not put your faith
In a cape and a hood
They will not protect you
The way that they should
And take extra care with strangers
Even flowers have their dangers
And though scary is exciting
Nice is different than good

Now I know
Don't be scared
Granny is right
Just be prepared
Isn't it nice to know a lot
And a little bit not",I Know Things Now,2014
Lilla Crawford,"Mother cannot guide you
Now you're on your own
Only me beside you
Still, you're not alone
No one is alone
Truly
No one is alone

I wish...
I know
Mother isn't here now
Wrong things, right things
Who knows what she'd say?
Who can say what's true?
Nothing's quite so clear now
Do things, fight things
Feel you've lost your way?
You decide, but
You are not alone
Believe me
No one is alone (No one is alone)
Believe me
Truly

People make mistakes
Fathers
Mothers
People make mistakes
Holding to their own
Thinking they're alone
Honor their mistakes
Fight for their mistakes
Everybody makes

Our side
Someone else is not

Lilla Crawford,"But it isn't my fault
I was given those beans!
You persuaded me to trade away
My cow for beans!
And without those beans
There'd have been no stalk
To get up to the giant's
In the first place!

Wait a minute, magic beans
For a cow so old
That you had to tell
A lie to sell it
Which you told!
Were they worthless beans?
Were they oversold?
Oh, and tell us who persuaded you
To steal that gold

See, it's your fault
No!
Yes, it's you fault
No!
Yes, it is!
It's not!
It's true

Wait a minute
But I only stole the gold
To get my cow back
From you!

So it's your fault!
Yes!
No, it isn't!
I'd have kept those beans
But our house was cursed
She made us get the cow to get
The curse reversed!

It's his father's fault
That the curse got placed
And the place got cursed
In the first place!

Oh!
Then it's his fault!
So
It was his fault!
No
Yes, it is
It's his
I guess

Wait a minute, though
I chopped down the beanstalk
Right, that's clear?
But without any beanstalk
Then what's queer
Is how did the second giant get down here
In the first place?
Second place?

Yes!
How?
Hmmm
Well,
Who had the other bean?
The other bean?
The other bean?
You pocketed the other bean
I didn't!
Yes I did
So it's your-
No, it isn't
'Cause I gave it to my wife!
So it's her fault!
No, it isn't!
Then whose is it?
Wait a minute!
She exchanged that bean
To obtain your shoe
So the one who knows what happened
To that bean is you!
You mean that old bean
That your wife, oh, dear
But I never knew,
And so I threw-
Well, don't look here!

So it's your fault!
But-
See, it's her fault!
But-
And it isn't mine at all!
But what?
Well, if you hadn't gone
Back up again
We were needy
You were greedy!
Did you need that hen?
But I got it for my mother!
So it's her fault then!
Yes, and what about the harp
In the third place?
The harp, yes!
She went and dared me to!
I dared you to?
You dared me to!
She said that I was scared
So she dared me!
No, I didn't!
So it's your fault!
Wait a minute!
If you hadn't dared him to
And you had left the harp alone,
We wouldn't be in trouble

Why don't you make your dreams come true

But you can't keep it in your heart

Then we'll sleep by candle light

While flames of love are burning

So prove me wrong
