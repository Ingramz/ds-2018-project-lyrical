Lars Gullin,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,1995
Lars Gullin,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,1995
Lars Gullin,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",1999
Lars Gullin,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You,2002
Lars Gullin,"Alone, alone with a sky of romance above 
Alone, alone on a night that was meant for love 
There must be someone waiting 
Who feels the way I do
Who ever you are, are you, are you
Alone, alone on this night that we two could share
Alone, alone with your kiss that could make me care
And when you come I'll promise to be your very own
Alone, alone with a heart meant for you alone, alone
 
Alone, alone with a sky of romance above 
Alone, alone on a night that was meant for love 
There must be someone waiting

Lars Gullin,"Dancing in the dark 
Till the tune ends,
We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends,
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here,
Time hurries by, we're here and gone

Looking for the light of a new love,
To brighten up the night, I have you love,
And we can face the music together,

When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

Lars Gullin,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2003
Lars Gullin,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel

Lars Gullin,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Lars Gullin,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April [*],2005
Lars Gullin,"I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a-kissing
Oh, what I've been missing

Lars Risberg,"If it were love I would give
That love every second I had and I do
Did I know where he'd lead me to?
Did I plan, doing all of this for the love of a man?

Well I let it happen anyhow
And what I'm feeling now
Has no easy explanation
Reason plays no part

Heaven help my heart
I love him too much
What if he saw my whole existence
Turning around a word, a smile, a touch?

One of these days, and it won't be long
He'll know more about me than he should
All my dreams will be understood, no surprise
Nothing more to learn from the look in my eyes

Don't you know that time is not my friend
I'll fight it to the end
Hoping to keep that best of moments
When the passions start

Heaven help my heart
The day that I find
Suddenly I've run out of secrets
Suddenly I'm not always on his mind

Maybe it's best to love a stranger
Well, that's what I've done
Heaven help my heart
Heaven help my heart

Lars Roos,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1989
Lars Roos,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1989
Lars Sjösten,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Lars Vercelli,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I",Bewitched,2008
Lars Vercelli,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,2008
Lars Vercelli,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble

But our love is here to stay",Our Love Is Here to Stay,2008

They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star

Yo, it's whatever or not, if you want it, it's war
You can choose what I'ma use, the pump or the four

I believe that there's more to life that what I see

His help I will gather my faith so one day I will fly Chorus
Well this I feel and this I know That there's a God who made
Us all And on His throne He reigns on high And waits for us 

Until we fly, fly away I've been searching for a love divine to

Can only find through faith My head's been spinning round

Good or bad

A space that's between us becoming a hole

You and I

This sweetly is forming and molding my soul
As I'm growing older

Effrite ce que tu veux
Ce soir je vais leur parler de De mon One Love , Kamarade!
C'est le corbeau
Je me rappelle la première fois que je l'ai rencontré
Elle était dans les bras d'un certain Jackson
Elle faisait danser des zombies et allumait le sol
C'était l'époque où sur les ondes y'avait que son côté rock
Moi dans ma chambre je passai mon temps à danser le moonwalk
Chez moi on se prennait pour les Jackson Five
Pour moi elle etait pas d'ici comme E.T. et Alf
Sous le charme de son côté Black Américain
Encore plus quand j'ai vu le côté Jamaïcain
Je la voyais pleurer dans les bras d'un certain Bob
Elle était rasta et ne chantait que le Love
Elle parlait du monde, elle parlait des pauvres
Ses messages ont donnés naissance à ma colombe
Elle faisait de la poésie dans l'hexagone
Jean-Jacques Golman disait d'elle, Qu'elle était bonne
On disait aussi qu'elle adoucissait les moeurs
J'ai pris une feuille en esperant avoir, mon premier flirt
Je me suis promis qu'un jour je lui ferais des gosses
Promesse tenue, Quand j'ai rencontré son côté Hip-Hop

Elle m'a donné la voix
One, one love
Celle qui s'impose à moi
One, one love

Mon Hip-Hop, mon royaume, mon home sweet home
Il falait m'interner après les freestyle de Time Bomb
A cause de deux petits, je mettais mes baggys à l'envers
Grâce à deux grands je n'avais plus peur de crier ""N*que Ta Mère""
Là où je vis les métèques et Mat squattent le banc
Où sont diplômés à l'école du micro d'argent
On traînait à trente comme le Wu de ODB
On rêvait Queens grâce à C.N.N &. M.O.B.B
On croyait que Lacoste était riche grâce à Lino
On était tous les enfants seuls de Puccino
Une pensée poour 2Pac et Biggie
Le débit de mon Corbeau c'est du Bone Thugs-N-Garmony
J'avais la furie et la foi de la F.F
J'étais Mafia K'1 Fry quand Kary parlait de L.A.S
Grâce à Dre j'ai découvert snoop et Slim shady
J'étais fou quand Nas à rejoint la scène Jay-Z
J'ai des frissons quand je te parle de cette époque
Sens-tu mon coeur qui bat quand je te parle de Hip-Hop hein!

Que humadera que nos viente ahogando
la gente se pregunta nadie sabe qué es
Un carra viejo que viene pitando
con llantas de triciclo y el motor al revés

En la esquina yo esperando

Mis amigas se están burlando
Murmuran cosas de él

No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar
Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar

Miren muchachas que no me arrepiento
Y tampoco me a me avergüenzo yo de mi galán
Aunque sea pobre y tenga un carra viejo
Me saca como reina
Un hombre de verdad

Y aunque tenga una carcacha
Lo que importa es que voy con él
Tampoco será el más guapo
Pero sí es mi novio fiel

Carcacha, paso pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar

Las Guitarras del Renacimiento,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

Las Guitarras del Renacimiento,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1992
Las Guitarras del Renacimiento,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Las Guitarras del Renacimiento,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind,1997
Las Hermanas Huertas,"La negra noche tendió su manto 
Surgió la niebla, murió la luz 
Y en las tinieblas de mi alma triste 
Como una sombra llegaste tú

Ven, ilumina la árida senda 
Por donde vaga loca ilusión 
Dame tan solo una esperanza 
Que fortifique mi corazón 

Como en la noche nace el rocío 
Y en los jardines nace la flor 
Así en mi alma, niña adorada 
Nació mi amor 

Ya veo que asoma tras la ventana 
Tu rostro de ángel encantador 
Siento la dicha dentro de mi alma 
Ya no hay tinieblas, ya no hay tinieblas 
Ya salió el sol",La Negra Noche,2003

Anuncian tu nuevo día
Asómate a tu ventana
Y verás cuanta alegría

Ya cantan los pajarillos
En los bosques y jardines
Ya están despidiendo aromas
Los claveles y jazmines

También tendían sus aromas
Todas las flores del campo
Para perfumar tu casa
En este día de tu santo

De pronto comprendi que no podía fallar
Why es que ese maromo no dejaba de mirar
María del carmen, ¿quien es ese nene?
Ese es un amigo why ahora vienen otros siete

why se formó un revuelo pues no dejaban de entrar
Llegaron los otros siete why no sabía a quién mirar
Cogí las chanclas why mis gafas de sol
Why me puse mi poquito de bronceador

Tiene brazos rollo popeye
Míralo, a este maromo na detiene
Míralo, abrió la boca why to lo estropeó
Cogí mi coche why le dije adiós, yo le dije adiós
Le dije adiós, le dije adiós, le dije adiós
Why cogió su moto why me siguió

Ay mamá, me persigue un chulo

Las Ketchup,"Voy a contar
Voy a contar, la historia de una niña de papá
Que cambió D. Algodón por un liguero color rosa
La conocí, estando en un night club que hay en Madrí
Yo estaba en la barra why escuché una voz, me llamo Rosa

Ay, mi papa cuando descubrí
Que la gatita
Más pija why rica de la escuela donde fui
Se llama Pedro

Ella era así
Ella era así, desde chiquita quiso ser actriz
Why ser la protagonista de una peli glamurosa
Ni la Monroe, la Garbo ni siquiera la Dietrich
Tenían tanto sexapil como la más que era la Rosa

Ay, mi papa cuando descubrí
Que la gatita
Más pija why rica de la escuela donde fui
Se llama Pedro

Desde bebé
Desde bebé, la madre le ponía bragas de croché
Por supuesto, sin dudarlo como siempre color rosa
Why así creció mi Rosa sin ninguna represión
Siempre con las uñas de los pies pintadas de color de rosa

Ay, mi papa cuando descubrí
Que la gatita
Más pija why rica de la escuela donde fui
Se llama Pedro

Pa que decir
Pa que decir, que el mejor chulo siempre era pa mí
Me confesaba orgullosa entre cigarro, copa why copa
Seguía pues, sacando de su bolso de bagute
Why tomaba una tras una sus hormonas color rosa

Ay, mi papa cuando descubrí
Que la gatita
Más pija why rica de la escuela donde fui
Se llama Pedro

Me echa miradas que matan, lo tengo picao

Pas de cadeau m'a fait la vie
J'aurai bien voulu bouger au Guatemala ou en Asie

Comme tout le monde le summum j'vise

Et oui on s'arme comme tous ces connards zonent

Seul notre art trône
À la plus haute place et les rats grognent
Comme des beats enragés de nous voir tous manger, rongés
Enfins rangés une histoire pleine de dangers
Jamais tranché par une foufoune aux mèches branchées mon crew
Que l'on nous pardonne, d'avoir la pêche au mic
Faire pleurer le faux au point qu'il faut qu'il sèche ses Nike
Ouech ouech, paraît que mon flow te laisse en dèche mec
Faut que tu me pardonnes
Je suis là juste pour la fraîche et le stress
On teste ma trique comme le reste de ma clique
Faut qu'on s'offre le clac clac et les soit-disants clacs s'évanouissent
Combien nous suivent parce qu'on est plus quand on glisse?
C'est VIP style faut qu'on nous le pardonne

We make 'em jazzy
And make 'em parlez all the way
The kind of flows
That shake the hottest towns
We make the hottest sounds
And make the parties bounce

Joe&Phlowtron:
It's the infamous freak
And venomous Jizzow
We hold on
With Supafreak and AtomdaBomb
From Phlowtron
This how we do(this is how we do)
Yo,you best listen proper
On a Phat fam trip
With more kicks
Than foot locker
Your boots been rocking
Keeping it up in this mother
Your style's fake
Like it get sarcasm
Every time you knock her
It's urgent for us to be
Submerging from the underworld
We the chosen ones
You don't believe me
Ask the oracle
Read the chironicles of this
Mad rapper slash whoever
Yo we fam?
Yeah we fam
And keep it
Through this endeavour
This mission we ain't preaching
Just need to split some knowledge
Time to put fake noise
Wise in cold storage
We beyond
It's your time
You think you Hispanic
We think you charlatanic
Just chilling don't panic
Ain't no beef in this brother
The styles remain unheard of
Too Phat and Phlowtron
We taking this further

Yo what's your name(Malique)
And what you representing
Too Phat
I heard a lot of songs
The filling you now
I'd say now it's too bad
It's poetry of myself
And those cast that filling me
Like all your fans
No doubt
What you seem to hear
Squealing me
The stress is killing me
But remain the trendsetter
Like when push comes
To hold ups jeans
You should know better
A 13th letter song
She never yawn
To remind you of my name
Every time you be counting
One,two
No question
I got some assumption
Now an era of submission
On this repercussion
I superscript patch on
Equipped and all ready
Then everybody best believe
That you fly
Like I was R.Kelly
Yeah,I think this someâ??really
It's revolutionary
When we blow up spots
You know my style unheard of
It's Phat Fam
Representing on the slow song
Malique locking the down with me
(Who?)
Carleed from Phlowtron

Repeat Chorus[2x]

Muchachaz:
Norrenâ??I rock steady
My raps are not petty
My texts are locked fatty
Yo Ren your shots ready?
Oh yeah I'm ready
Step back and make way for Renita
One in the million stunner
I'm the femme de Nikita
1,2 Dahlia's coming for you
The dance queen,facinating
I'll be rocking the scene
Fantastic causes
Phat Family no pauses
We're pushing courses

M.O.B:
Ohhhh nooooâ?¦(No,No,No)
You better be ready for now
Coz MOB's coming for ya
Holla at me
If you wanna battle(battle)

As I running into the club
Give it up just stop
Don't think you're on top
Gotta be the one
Who's making it pop
Telling you a bit about
That's how we roll

Gotta stick to the plan
Caught a chick do that thang
Better keep to my slang
Got a gig to be hang
Rather be with my friends
Got you sick when I sang
Would you stick to my fang
Bet you flip I say so

Better be prepared
With a red carpet
Gotta move my steps
Taking off your hat
Show me some respect
Doing as I said
Everything's the fact
Flip that and so we roll

the Tarik Crew:
Save the best for last
Coming through
The only crew capable of
Taking this track
To critical mass
We got you open
Off the lines
That we be quoting
Exploding
We leave the venue
With the stage broken
That no sugar coating
Long rage we snipe
Scoping up close
With mic cords choking
Deliver the final blow
The rhyming prose
With melted wax vinyl flows
Oh,its time to go

Chorus[2x]

Las Pastillas del Abuelo,"Me escapé, del mundo yéndome al Norte
Pero otro mundo esperaba allá
Yo arrimé, siempre disparo a mansalva
Pero esa piel fue particular
La hacés bien, y aunque te hierva la sangre
Te encadenas para no llamar
¿Cómo hacés? Conozco todos tus trucos
Pero aún así me das que pensar
Te guardas el orgullo donde nadie
Pueda dudar de que lo tenés
Y así vas, sin perder el objetivo
Pidiendo dos cuando querés tres
Ya estoy bien, ya me ordené en mi desorden
Y aquellas voces no me hablan más
Por favor, mentime y dame la espalda
Otra vez no quiero patinar
Y me esperás, más de la cuenta
Siendo siempre la que yo soñe
Y firme yo, me encierro en que es peor
Amar y envejecer

¿Qué esperás? Mostrame todas las cartas
A cara de perro no sé jugar
Me endulzás, el ego siendo sincera
Dale un poco y te va a pedir más
Lo sabés, no hay arma más seductra
Que contestar siempre la verdad
Siempre estás, del otro lado del muro
De los lamentos que me contás
No sé hablar, sin decir malas palabras
Amantes, mentira, infidelidad
Nunca más, te vendo gato por liebre
Por no ser cruel, pierdo honestidad
No es el fin, el problema son los medios
No es algo que pueda respetar
No está mal, que termine en las historias
Mientras haya historias que contar
Y ya no esperarás, más de la cuenta
Y siempre serás la que yo soñé
Y yo seguiré pensando que es peor
Amar y envejecer",Amar y Envejecer,2007
Las Pastillas del Abuelo,"Quién te ha visto y quién te ve?
Piensa un chabón frente al espejo examinandose
Se acaba de levantar
Tiene el pelo amotinado y los ojos para atrás

La resaca lo vigila desde la almohada vacia
Mientras mete manotazos en el culo de la piba
Que acostada boca abajo
Ni se entera está dormida

Adivina adivinador ¿quién hizo quilombo anoche?
¿Quién prendió el televisor y perdió el control remoto?
¿Por qué hay tanto vidrio suelto todo de color marrón?
Y este olor a cenizero ¿de dónde mierda salió?

Un candombe en la cabeza que no es para bailar
Por más agua que le tira no lo puede hacer sonar
Un tambor en las entrañas no para de repicar

Media vuelta rápidito y las mano' a la pared
Va a escupir un real envido y es mejor tenerse en píe
Si le pifía al inodoro después tiene que limpiar

Ahora hay que encontrar la toalla
La que ayer dejó caer
La muy turra está escondida bien abajo del videt
Si hay un Dios es aspirina
Si hay un Cristo es un café

En la puerta está la piba
Está un poco mejor que él
Con sus dos tetas lo mira no soy yo quien vos queres
No te quemes la cabeza por un poco de placer

El chabón se queda solo pero mal acompañado
La resaca y la fisura le pellizacan el costado
Y el bardero ese del vidrio no para hasta encabronarlo

Tanta cara de boludo te estás pareciendo a mí
Si no fueras un reflejo diría que estoy ahí
No te aguanto la mirada
No estoy para discutir

Por guita baila el mono y vos no tenes swing
Y el miedo que te meten a vivir
Parece ya no tener vuelta atrás
Y tu grano de arena nunca tapa el mar
Métiendo la carnada están, sonríen con vehemencia cruel
Te quieren vender el buzón
Que un libro no te deja más que una cumbiamba loca
Y vos mordes a todo trapo

Y lo peor es que no te das cuenta
Propongamonos romper esta cadena
Siendo firmes al tratar con la conciencia
La traición a un pueblo llama a sentir pena
Porque creo y no exagero eso es demencia
Hace el hombre honrado vista gorda
Debe ser el bicho de malaventura
Mundo loco si los hay, ni los del Borda
Hacen las cosas que hace más de un cura
Hasta en el cielo debe haber
Una que otra injusticia
Me digo y se que juego mal
Pero tampoco da el talón

Donde todo es más gris
Donde todo es invierno?

A esa línea que separa a la vida
En locura y realidad

Ya no había más flores
Que crecieran en tus primaveras
Ya no tenías el calor de ninguna pollera

Ninguna cuota de amor
Que te brindara el destino
Ninguna piedra que pudiera cambiar tú camino

Sembrando tu cruz sin rosas

And he strikes, like thunderball

Talkin' behind my back, fakin' the smiles and huggin' me
Pointin' fingers, hatin', jealous of my success
Praying for my downfall, can't handle me being blessed

Now you'd rather see me at the bottom of the totem poll
Scraping for dollars on the edge 'bout to lose control
Back on the corner, still livin' in the projects
Still strugglin' down and out with no prophets

Still drivin' through the hood in a bucket
I'm 'bout bringing my people over like I'm Harriet Tubman, huh
Been through the fire like Kanye West
Beat the odds, now I'm on shuffles and I-pods

Against the odds, back still against the wall
Fighting to represent in the ring for God
Consciously makin' records for a different cause

This crab game keep pullin' me down
But like Ron Artest been known to rebound
And like Roy Jones, I'm pound for pound
Spittin' a different kind of message over platinum sounds

Play some music, unplug the phone
Chill fo' real 'cause I'm in my zone
Everything will be okay, gotta get away

Have no where to arrive
Visit somethin' from my past
Have a blast and be happy I'm alive

Have a scoop of ice cream

It's after 7 what's up Devin, we moving blow like George Jung 
Man the South is where we from, but we got love for the North 
I'm blowing dosha out my mouth, 4-85 is what it cost 
I'm a boss he a boss, homie this a new day 
Ro call Big Bub, tell him I need a Screw tape 

We got Screw that's true love, that Robert Earl Davis kind 
So I'll never put money in my pocket, if it's not mine 
Every dime every nickel every penny, I'ma put in work for it 
Cause ain't nothing in life for free, you pay money but I'ma spit a verse for it 
I'm a buisness baby, Z-Ro Incorporated ya dig 
What I'm doing now, gon' cover my great great great great grandkids 
Flip the closest thang to a brother I got, he trying to get to the bread 
What up Gulfbank and Homestead, but I represent the

We on a mash for the cash, we on a mash for the cash

Yes sir, Z-Ro, Lil' Keke, Screw to Mo City
CMG, KMJ, this how it go

[Chorus]
Sunshine, living in the ghetto daily trying to find
Sunshine, trying to make a million hustling got to dodge
One time, I keep my head up even though I feel like giving up
Sometimes, Keep your head up trying to find sunshine

[Z-Ro]
Man what happened to the sun on my lawn it's so gloomy and grey
I got a feeling 5-O gone try to do me today
Nothing but backstreets for me cause I don't need a vacation
Looking for front run up that seem the only compensation
The hood is on fire, other soldiers won't let it down
They ain't set tripping but out here jacking has been alive
Misery spinning what they clicking for no reason at all
Even intentions of stacking paper they pleasing them all
And outside, smelling like nothing but formaldrahide
It's an everyday suicide, R.I.P. to the ones that died
Wake up before you get caught up don't keep on selling your soul
Until your life fall up, you got to try to find

[Chorus]
[Lil' Keke]
We living in a world that's dirty and so shife
You trying to figure out this the game that's called life
These days is cold and got me searching for my soul
Like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold
I'm looking out my window for some, sunshine
I'm trying to give it up cause I swear it's my time
I five petreat and start thinking about my sins
Roll up another square and start thinking about the benz
Talent and skills is what I'm bringing
New homes and microphones got the cell phone ringing
Push play on the deck, to let my mind collect
And try to mash on the gas with no time to sweat
This the ghetto, and that's all I know
Another episode from the young don and Ro
If the family is tight, then everything's alright
So quick to catch flight for the sunlight, uh

[Chorus]
[Z-Ro]
Seem like I can't stand the rain prosecution and struggle up in my brain
Got to tell me slow down if you can see all of my veins
Cause I ain't having none of that riff raff to get back and blood
Keep my enemy close to me cause your killer be your 'cause
I wish I was, able to socialize with why'all
Instead of trading war stories and taking lies from why'all
It's how it be though, Lil' Keke and Z-Ro we on the grind 
Long as they talking about us, we know we staying on they mind
Don't hate us congratulate us, why why'all turning up why'all nose 
Cause it's been we be spittng straight be burning up why'all glow
Want to take it away from pin and pad and pick up a gun
You better repent my dog it's over, you done better try to find

Lasse Bagges Trio,"Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor
Nu surrar bin, och fåglar sjunger överallt
Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor
men i min trädgård är det visset, mörkt och kallt
Här är det risigt och förvuxet, fult och snårigt
och lika hopplöst trist och grått som i mitt bröst
Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter
Där är det sommar, men härinne är det høst

Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter
ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst
Försonad med min karaktär, för jag har aldrig
förmått at säga nej till någonting som helst
Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra
och levat livet, tills jag krossades en dag
Det börja med att du bedrog mig med en anna
en som du sa mar mycket finare än jag

Vårt gräl tog veckor, ropen blandades med gråten
och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän
tills du bekände att han givit dig på båten
Då blev det dödstyst här i trädgården igen!
Ifrån den stunden var den mannen dubbelt hatad
Han hade lekt med dig, med oss et litet slag
Och jag, jag kände det som även jag var ratad
Jag ville slåss, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag

Jag hade hammaren beredd under kavajen
när han kom ut i sidenscarf och sa: God dag
Kom in och slå dig ner en stund, så får vi prata
Jag bare stammade, nu minns jag inte vad
Och jag blev bjuden på cognac och på cigarrer
och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej
Och när vi skildes var vi bästisar och bundis
och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig

Jag går omkring i mitt Pompeji, bland ruiner
jag trampar runt i resterna utav vårt liv
Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner
och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv
Nej, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar
och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är
Och trots all kärleks brist och trasighet och fransar
Dig skall jag älska livet ut, dig har jag kär!",Trubbel,2006

Solljuset stiger ur havet,
spelar i koppar och glas,
Stockholm i gryningen strålar
som var hon en gyllene vas,
med blommor från Östersjöns stränder,
med ängsört från ekarnas sal,
en skönhet på urbergets stränder,
Mälarens ljuva vestal.

Stockholm i mitt hjärta,
låt mig besjunga dig nu,
åldrad i ungdomlig grönska,
öarnas stad, det är du!
Av städer jag känner i världen
är du den stad som fått allt.
Genom Mälarens kärlek till havet
en blandning av sött och salt.

Solljuset dansar på fjärden,
det glittrar för stort och för smått,
för träkåken uppe på Söder
men även för Konungens slott.
Det porlar i fiskrika strömmar,
det valsar i Mälarens famn,
det skymmer och skänker oss drömmar
sjungandes sjöstadens namn.

av kvällsbrisens skälvande hand.

en lovsång till Stockholm i natten
från skärgårdens vikar och sund.

Rough and tough although the mental will stomp ya
Pugilism electrocute like Blanka

Laszlo Gardony,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",Eleanor Rigby,2011
Laszlo Gardony,"Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who find the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa pa pa pa,
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending

Wonder how you manage to make ends meet",Lady Madonna,2011
Laszlo Honinger,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help
You'll have to learn to help yourself

She said on the telephone 
She wished me well. 
So alive with a spell

I've realized 
I've been dead for so long 

All my memories of her 
Like a fading light I suffer

Back in the early days 
I saw a lot of her 
She was the coolest girl in town 

And when I saw her standing there 
Everything was all right 
I took a journey in my mind 
And as I saw her beauty 
She was so kind 
That was a good time 

Everyday we met it was wild 
I felt like a child 
I loved to see her smile 
And as I played piano 
I was so inspired 
I always had a real good time 

And when last we met 
I just can't forget 
I took for sure I love her bad 
I just can't ignore 
Her loving response 
I always knew she'd be all right

She made me think I was okay 
And the love seemed so real 
I still got feelings for her 
And when I'm on tour 
Singing about her forever 
I'll remember blessings

I didn't know a thing about you

thought you could love

what's going on 
I was just singing my song
There's something mad about you

I took it wrong
You like my song
Why couldnt I have you
Crazy dream you done me wrong
You left me long
I couldnt stand to chance without you

you said the love was dead
And in my head
I just couldnt believe it

and on the phone you said
You never knew me at all

thought there was love
What a fool I was

and everything was in hyper-jinx

They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples lookin' for romance
Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellah packs a gun
Ev'rybody does his best to act just right
Cause there's gonna be a funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

Well, now you've heard my story 'bout a place I know
Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
HIdden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there alright
But they all go native on a Saturday night",Tennessee Saturday Night,2001

Late of the Pier,"Anything we should know about your change?]
Didn't sleep last night
Couldn't calm down
The cold water running past my window
Kept me crying out

Give me sunlight
The good medicine
It's all part of the open pressures
Of growing up

Met a friend but then again
You could get around town like they do
Have a shower, then drive around
Looking out for Northfields Avenue

The journey's sour, the fire is out
Love achieving sounds sell a heart of glue
Have a listen, a dirty mind
Moving matters untold residue

Its all evolution's fault now
It's all down to echoes in the crowd",Broken,2008
Late Tuesday,"Holding me close, he's always protected me
The calm in the storm, the joy that surrounds me
But left in my chains my emotions take over
My soul could be dead, but you've never left me

I never knew your heart 'til now
I never knew your soul
I'm crazy about the way he walks, the things he'll do
But now I know - I love you

It breaks me apart, oh like no other
My selfishness grows and my emotions take over
But wherever I am or how betrayed I become
I know that you will stand by me when all else is gone

Yeah the one thing I know is your love is constant
And brokenness comes but you will take me away from this place

Before it consumes you
To take a shelter and run into a stranger's arms

I finally found within myself that I knew nothing at all

One day, last year, I thought that I conquered the world
One day, last year, I knew the real world inside out
Nothing could stop me, not even you
But now look at me
I've conquered more than just the world

Before we met, I'd been crushed a thousand ways
Forgot my own name
Behind the limelight, kindness is all you gave to me
I thank you for your dignity
Caught up in the rat race I stopped to feel your hand
I think I finally know how it feels to be loved for who I am

Recurring nightmare I appear Like a hunter/
roll of thunder motherfuckerI'm live so shed your final tears/
They cry from fear I'm crying due to my madness/
I'm laughing as I cut up my face with broken glasses/
Surpass bliss with the pain so strange it fascinates/
Go rabid as the savage engage you need to vaccinate/
pack a razor blade in my skin slash it to make you grin/
stuff a slut full of my nut just to break her in/
It pays to sin motherfucker you gotta play to win/
They're hating him Forsaken the worst and I've disgraced my kin/
Fuck it though your face where my fucking knuckles go/
So pucker up this ain't no sucker punch its my fucking show/
I punish foes with blows and flows that eat the soul/
I'll take you pussies out of ya home like a comfort zone/
Blood rush I kill and I crush so they go up and arms/
Think twice before  putting the god on the undercard/

Violence  bloodshed
Torture straight death
I don't love nothing but I love this
I don't love nothing but I love this


I spawned satan and taught him the basics/
The hatred and racism and placed it across nations/
Embracing the heartbreak as I'm breaking the foundation/
Aroused by bloodshed its he sound and these frowned faces/
I wish your spirit to fry like a pound of bacon/
I've questioned their every move like they're building around masons/
Now they're about facing I'm never about patience/
They should've been out so now their flesh I'm about tasting/
I don't even flex on a beat I'm fetching my meat/
clenching my teeth  none as evil as Im destined to be/
My temperature heat They scream like witches burning alive/
Ain't nothing certain with Lateb but I'm certain you'll die/
Burning a church like this is where they worship the lies/
The more that it hurts to me it's more perfect the crime/
Accursed aside knives I'll insert in your sides/
They like pin cushions been pushing shit in they minds/

When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too

[Lateef The Truth Speaker - Verse One] 
When you first walked in and I saw you at the bar or somethin' 
I ain't really wanna holler or nothin' 
I just pegged you as the type for frontin' 
Steady chucklin' with your girlfriends actin' contrary and cluckin' 
But ya song came on, and somethin' changed in the way she was movin' along 
Eyelashes caught flashes of the possibilities, maybe this one is the one for me 
She's movin' to the dance floor, we'll see 
What I seen was inspirational, highly motivational 
Had to maneuver the set, up to confrontationals 
Even though it was my chance to mack 
I already did my dance, had the reservoir tapped 
Hit me like a thunder clap, though 
Can't let somethin' that fat pass BY, why asks why? 
Made my way through the crowd with the side to side 
Then I pushed up on the tush 'cause, uh, I ain't shy! 
Said, ""Excuse me Miss, but I liked what I saw"" 
When she spoke, I damn near dropped my jaw! 
HELL NAW! I can't believe she SAID that shit! 
I need to call my sister, ""Come up through and check this chick! 
And put some sense in her, cause her IQ 'bout six"" 
Bein' that, stu-pid in pub-lic there should be a law against 
I mean, she didn't have a CLUE, tell you what to do 
Just SHUT UP, ride the groove, and let's move now

[Gift of Gab - Verse Two] 
When I stepped into the coliseum, I was slidin' through 
Just bein' me, lovin' the space and lettin' everything be free 
And bein' free to 'til I seen her, me, I popped up, solutions 
Could it be? She was the one that could make me a believa? 
Step through the crowd like a bobber and a weaver 
Couldn't really see the crowd, all that I could see was HER 
Looked directly in her eyes, all that I could see was blurred vision 
Couldn't really tell if she was prime and ready furr pickin' 
She was downin' that 'Yac in straight shots 
Offered me a drink, I told her I was tryin' to stop 
I thought to reconsider mackin', then she pulled off her top 
and yelled, NEXT THING I KNOW, SHE WAS DOIN' THE WOP 
She said, ""Gabby, Gabby, Gabbyyy, you need to come and swig"" 
I said, ""I think I'm cool, you need to find another nigga"" 
Baby, baby, baby PLEASE, then she dropped down to her KNEES 
Then I had to leave, I didn't want to contract diseases 
I said, ""Don't take it personal, I think you need Jesus 
You're movin' kinda fast, you need to stop and just breathe"" 
Hopin' she would have a clue, tell you what to do 
Just SHUT UP, ride the groove and let's move, now..

As soon as I walked in the DO'-woe-woe 
The rati-o was in favor of me, 'cause as far as I could see 
all the bitties on the FLO'-woe-woe 
was movin' in such a way in the heat, kinda made me wanna pee 
Leavin' ME wanting MO'-woe-woe 
But I was scared, of major defeat, 'cause I saw the girl Lateef 
was dancin' with sayin' NO-woe-woe 
and Gab was wrestlin' with a freak who was topless 
I was intimated to SHOW, any interest at ALL 
I just stood still, pressed against the walllll (that's when I saw her) 
Time froze, the ice around my heart e-RODED 
Glasses she looked like a spy, wanna decode it 
I said, ""My name is Pi-Pi-Pigeon Johnny"" 
Stuttered a little bit, felt like a big DU-mmy 
She said I didn't have a clue, she told me what to do - 
She said, ""SHUT UP and ride the groove"" 
I said, ""Okay"", like..

If you gonna be creative, y'know 
You're ultimately offering yourself as a sacrifice 
A sacrifice of, channeling something, bigger than yourself 
and existing here at the same time, y'know 
Being measured upon your words 
when you're channeling yourself at higher than your state 
is a pre' serious, jump to take on 
So, if they truly about, the word 
poetry, singing, writing, and drawing and painting

want us to realize we're here to record ripples of vanity, y'know

Speak, how they wanna speak, livin? in defeat
When you don't wanna question what they teach, as the truth
With no proof, with the fear of burnin? in eternal heat

When your programmed not to be your own man, but a sheep
Bein? heard as they word it, so you think it ain't free
When you sleep in a deep sleep, standin? on your feet
When your beat makin? ends meat, raw, thin and they see

Must ain't soul enough, 'cause my heart ain't cold enough

Guess I got to brag more, must don't boast enough
Ain't New York enough, ain't west coast enough
But that's fine 'cause I'm gon' focus on mine

And a lot of the crews got sprayed and yelled RAID
Like a couple of roaches, as struggle approaches,
A brother'll blow this
Another ferocious jam, I smother the ?grossagran?
I hover above the land of lame emcees that don't blow
I'm poppin' the clip and then bo bo with the gun
And a once in a munch chest, rest in peace
And I ?bellow you to beast? I abolish emcees with sounds like these
Run over enemies and I rest in the west
Dark hemisphere, burn wit a fear is nothin but a mere setback
Hear when I'm here,
Earn wit a clear conscience in the middle of the jet black
I'm a dog, running through the jungle
Wit a hoodie and black hat choppin down ?noonsies?
Not a frog, cunning yet I'm humble
Gotta do the jewels tack wack talkin clowns
Tip me, I'ma knock 'em all around, bust a front
With a fat blunt swinging on a vine in the homeland
I'ma tack 'em in the sound little punks when the rap bump
Springin on the rhyme I bowl man
Gifted when I'm lifted off a spliff hit,
Reminisce shit, riff with dipshits
This shit is the mischievous style of the gifted,
I'm a whiz kid, get a whiff kid
Swingin' down low, breakin' down flows
With a new flow medley outgrow when you step back
To the black with a fat rap with a fat sack
With a little bit a funk in my napsack
Take it back to the brother land
And I was smotherin' stupid idiots like Tarzan
Givin' back to the brother man and get another land,
Man gimme it, its Or-land-o
How easy and tight wishin' into the depths
Up in the sound in the heart of the jungle
Gettin' wild with the art of the rumble,
Never amount to be smarter than Dumbo
Make 'em mumble, make 'em humble,
Get me round from the start, you will crumble,
And you tumble, and you stumble
And I do it like that
From the end to the other end never gonna end,
Set a trend with the maniac mic clutch
Hey ?bob by the ba?, said you keep your day job

Have to bail through the backstreets, raisin' hell to a black beat

Just about impossible to find
What a disgrace to the race of wack mc's
I am because I choose to stand my ground
FIRM and blowin' the rhythm the vermin and learnin'
All I know is we've earned every entry attained
And strained the game, and what I'm tryin' to explain is that
The deeper we're creepin' the more we find sleepin'
And slippin' just shootin' dead lips on a mission
Its missin' the reason the gift we've been given the rhythm
'cause that just the way we've been livin
And thrive in the essence, survive and its easy
To recognize when analyzing ?the bo?
Surprises the lame in this line and tryin'
To get you to buy into their fantasy world
Can it be damaged the ?emina? bones
Of the fellas and men that's exploting my culture
Can't understand every breast that you touch
Was as up ?paper scun? be one hung motherfucker
Such as nowadays, its fallin' and splinterin', just timber, instead of
Gettin out of my way, and what I'm -- meaning to say is that
The canopy that covers me now is the blackest, attack this
I thought we already established the wackness
Presented in the cemented jungle
By the bumblin' brothers stumblin' tumblin' down
Surround me in a cannibalistic style, but I just smile and
Silence 'em like the lambs, they all the whole flock
We just one magic stock style
I'm gettin' 'em off like crack viles, and wicked the whole fuckin while
Not trippin over no vines, or over no swine, or over no mines
Or over no line at the plot
Thinkin' of whippin' 'em like a glock in the jungle

(spoken)
Now in the beginning of the journey
Not in time, but in the mind
Imagine the camels being loaded up
The men, loading themselves up
It's a long journey -- the oasis is all in the clamor
As we start from the top we go to the very bottom
Of a myserious place -- a very mysterious place
What's that I see? Ahhhh

(Lyrics Born)
I can't even describe you, so I ain't even gon' try...hmmmm
Making hell of mc Asia is now this I don't dispute but you knew
You knew Lyrics Born was a ripped off note sheet of a hundred
And you scrape the paint off your bumpers making sure you beat the buzzer
Making sure Lyrics Born came out his mother's stomach
Covered with the lyrics that kill
No bumper, right? 'cause mo'fucka
I know you can make colors rhyme
And have the whole goddamn planet yellin uncle at you and even
Still take the time big up little ?egg?, can you imagine?
Big up Asia Born, this little bottle
Or that you would even be lightly concerned with little, little words
That you would tug at the line, pullin' the kind
Of lyrics out my mouth that make me big bad don, takin' kids' legs home
You can't even back a sliver roach, you know
That type shit, and then watch me wreck this stage
Boy like I got your daddy's style hangin' around my waist
And then watch me forget -- the way
Good lyrics taste, thinkin' I just ain't little rabbit eyes in your heart
Man, 'cause if I thought it was just
Lyrics Born that made lyrics born, lyrics born
And then suddenly I can't do no more, I'd be like
""Do you remember me?"" No, Asia
And you used to play my record on the way to the vapor

Estoy seguro que cupido 
Tenía un pasatiempo 
Y era jugar conmigo 

Y ahora que te tengo 
Le pregunto a ese tipo 
Por qué se ha tardado tanto 
En acertar su tiro

Y no puedo negarlo 
Que valió la pena 
Pero no era necesario 
Que gastara tantas flechas 

Le bastaba con la pregunta correcta 
Y sólo hubiera dicho 
Que la quería perfecta

Porque a tu lado yo me siento invencible 
Me das la fuerza que mi alma necesite 
Y no existe nada que no logre superarlo 
Mientras te tenga bien sujeta de mis manos

Porque a tu lado yo me siento inquebrantable 
Me das la fuerza de mil hombres al amarme 
Cuando cupido me flechó a enamorarme 
Malgastó su flecha 
Yo te amaba desde antes

Just a small town girl with her whole life
Packed in a suitcase by her feet

Shine as bright as they did
On her mamas tv screen

And the work seemed harder
And the days seemed longer
Than she ever thought theyd be

But you know you got to stick to your guns
When it all comes down
Cause sometimes you cant choose
Its like heads they win
Tails youre gonna lose

Win big--mamas fallen angel
Lose big--livin out her lies
Wants it all--mamas fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin the dice of her life

Now she found herself in the fast lane livin day to day
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
And let her family slip away

Just like a lost soul
Caught up in the hollywood scene
All the parties and the limousines

Such a good actress hiding all her pain
Trading her memories for fortune and fame

Just a step away from the edge of a fall
Caught between heaven and hell

But of course I'll call you tonight.
Did you know you missed my birthday?
The loneliest it gets is when the wind begins to chill.

And when I stand at the top of your old street,
The church top brings a stillness to me.
And I can't think of anything I'd rather do
Than have my heart broken by you.

Could we be saved by inventions and hopes?
Cause I'm not all right.
The night seems to swallow me whole
And spits out second guessing.

I remember ever since that first day that I saw you on the street.
I've always wanted you in the worst way, but now I can't compete.
And I'm so... and you're so... we're both so all fucked up.
I don't know but what to do.

It just makes me want to scream.
Isn't it about time that we try and get it right.
'Cause I can't sleep on no more floors
And I can't stay up no more nights.

I'd like to know what's going on.

If I could travel back in time for the creation of life
I'm sure that what God did for me would have been this very thing
Within you divine and supreme

Fortunately you, you have me I have you
It's fortunate for us, we have love, love has us
It's fortunate that we, we have time on our side
Never take for granted, that we are so fortunate to be

You're like an architect of sweetness
A man whose never heard can hear the melodies
Of your voice when you heart sings a song

You have me I've got you
It's fortunate for us, we have love, love has us
It's fortunate that we, we have time on our side
Never take for granted that we are so fortunate to be

Fortunately you, you have me, I have you
It's fortunate for us, we have love love has us
It's fortunate that we, we have time on our side
Never take for granted that we are so fortunate to be

You have me I've got you
It's fortunate for us, we have love, love has us
It's fortunate that we, we have time on our side
Never take for granted that we are so fortunate to be

She was like my homie, my best friend
If there was one girl perfect in this world
It would have to be her
She was the kind of girl that I needed
She was off the chain and I mean it
I swear that she was too good to be true
But she love the ground I walk on
In her eyes, I could do no wrong to her
But somewhere along the lines, started feelin' myself
And I got all into her

And I ended up losin her

[Memphis Bleek talking]
Yeah...I mean, M.A.D.E, no mob shit
Money, Attitude, Direction, and Education...some real
shit
Think about my hood one time, my hood...it's trippin'
Thinkin I've changed, crossed niggaz
Where we go wrong

[Verse 1]
I'm from that two-bedroom apartment, Marcy
5-3-4, that middle building...yeah, they say it started me
I'm new to it but consider me young
Seen it all happen, ain't understand what was done
But, all I wanted was the fly kicks fly shit
Little nigga but still kept a fly bitch
And back then it was love in the hood
Knuckle up with ya dog and fuck it, it's all good
Now, I'm in the crib rippin up to go to war with 'em
Same little niggaz I used to steal from the store with 'em
I go and get 'em from school
Used to take the same bus, same train back then we was cool
I broke bread at lunch with 'em
And if mom's left me with two singles, then you know
I'm splittin one with 'em
We cut school in the building I lived in, one floor higher
Smokin and gettin higher
Damn, think of age, now we locked up north
It was like yesterday we was practicin sports
Went from flippin on mats now he flippin in the box
Locked twenty-three hours up a day, he in the max
ain't no lookin back because this life goes on
We was kids didn't care about the rights and wrongs
But, nobody judged us the ghetto loved us
Streets, the only thing that ever took something from us
I lost a couple friends
But I promised and prayed that if I make it, I'm'a see 'em again
I admit, I was wild as a child
And my mom's ain't like none of my friends who use to call me Ismhael
My brother stayed on punishment, mama found out he hustle and
Found couple jacks, her plan she thought of flushin it
Me, I'm in the streets I swore, never change
My brother caught a cause, I came up to do the same

[Hook - Latif singing] (2X)
It's all about my days, this is all about my nights
This is all about my pain, this is all about my life

[Verse 2]
I got my first work, about the age of fourteen
My brother fighting a case his bail was fourteen
Me, still hustlin, school not going
My clothes started changin, the money started showin
My right hand was owing every hoe we know
She represent us through the ghetto every hood we know
He put me on on that traffic, though the money was average
I ain't care I learned how to handle that package
Then, a body dropped, O locked for minute
The squad it never died, I was left to represent it
Took a nigga out his crib his name I ain't gon' mention it
Know this hit home, I know this nigga listenin
Cause we was tighter than brothers where did the love go
I called your mother my mom's dog, I let the love show
This was supposed to be us
You was supposed to have the next verse dog, this was supposed to be us
And, you know I taught you the streets, taught you to pitch in
I gave you that gear got you all the bitches
I never thought you ever cross me dog
If they back me down in the corner, get 'em off me dog
Now I see exactly where we went wrong
When I spin through the hood and I see him, I keep it goin
Now the ghetto lookin at me like I changed
But, I'm still that regular nigga I'm still the same

From the club to the telly you know how it is
Most of the chicks I never tell 'em where a nigga live
Tryna reach me at my mansion or my mother crib
Hit my cell, hit my two, now I'm at my honey dips

Yo we talked about 8, said I was comin' through to hit
Now it's wee hours in the mornin' and I'm drunker than a bitch
Stumblin' and shit, I jumped up in the whip
Flipped open the horn like where's my honey dip

And bitch fuck ya man tonite, you know my steelo
Sizzurp wit the Cristal, the corners playin' cello
You see me well you jus smile you know we on the lelow
I'm whippin' through the town like we ballin' up a key load

I'm tryna dip up in the tele
Dip up in the room, then dip up in her belly
Dip off on Pirelli's, Dip-Sets Fonzarelli
My white T-shirt, lookin' dip up in my pelle

Smokin' weed up in the range, full speed left lane
It's me against the world, MOB up in my vein

You know, I'm lookin' for a honey dip
But I'm no dummy, most these bunnies
Are money hungry and lookin' for a money clip
So after the brother hit, I'll tell a honey dip

She won't see a contact, address nor buddy list
I ain't on some hubby shit, that lovey dovey shit
It's nuttin' trick I'm suttin' slick
You couldn't get enough of it

How a slugger jus slide up through the check in
Wit that linin' on the Wesson
Hundred diamonds on my neck and wrist shit
I'm rich bitch, rhyming's my profession

Watch how I do this stupid grindin' and perfectin'
Who's flyer when I step in got 'em spyin' every second
'Cause that 06 charger remind 'em of a 7
Yes man, I'm so fresh the pro mess wit bread honey

My jean's 800, these are called Red Munkey
The flossin' is gone, come talk to a Don
Fly enough to belong on a catwalk in Milan, holla

When I'm dippin' on the grind I get my money quick

I got me a lovely chick, I got me a slutty chick
I got 'em all but my favorite one is my honey dip
She get drunk wit me, roll the piff up wit me
Throw singles at other hoes in the strip club wit me

She do anything for jus one quicky
She a nympho chick for this slow dick
She give no lip, she jus go get
The paper I ask her for, my bitch so quick

Plus she know every Santana song
And she don't mind puttin' the damn bandanna on
Slap her ass tell her dance in this thong
She do it all for daddy, she move it all for daddy

She get a brick and she boof it all for daddy
Hit the road shake the State Troopers off for daddy
And she bring all that paper back
No short paper back, she sure don't play wit that

When I'm dippin' on the grind I get my money quick
But sometimes I wanna lay up wit my honey dip

With red lips and ink black hair
In the picture that I found
Underneath the stairs

I can see her dancing
When the music was low and slow
In shiny dress and jewelry
Somewhere there used to go

That was so long
When the red car would always ride
Way on up to Spring Street
Down the tracks to the other side

They pulled over and dropped her
At the house so late at night
She waved her keys and said goodbye
And went inside to cry

I guess she had some babies
And two more after that
They grew up men and ladies
And some got old and fat

She got a call from Tony
""What happened yesterday
When a man came down to see you?""
She didn't have much to say

Poured some coffee in a cup made of Mexican clay
""Sit down right in that chair and listen what I say
Richer men, poorer men, dumber men, sure men
Who would ever think that they were all made the same""

I laid down on the sofa and fell asleep just yesterday
And in my sleep a guy in white came up to me to say
""Bet you're wondering why everybody else gets all the breaks
While your mama and your papa and your sister's turning gray""

Made a cup of something hot, some kinda Hindu brew
Listen to me good 'cause this is all I have for you
Doesn't matter who you are, this side or that side of the fence
Or you got a pile of money or you can barely pay the rent

Of glory if he laid a wreath
And if the Empire called again, would he defend her?

While powers stalled and freedom hid
Or those that kept the Athens bridge
Traitored by the allied kiss

For uniforms where padres hide

shell
And you know you should be glad of the living

deep in the seams
Where your hotel nights are the stuff of the dreams
Of the men below

Imagine, having to fight
To work two miles down from the air and the light
And imagine, having to plead
That a job that can kill, is a job that you need

Darker blue this darkness, than a pale young miner's
eyes
Who has to see the convoy lights come shining
And can't close off his surprise
With his one poor piece of paving, pressing hard

against his palm
Knowing it might be the only way he'd ever get to spend
another day
With the men below

A bingo king is calling
It must be morning time again
And every gaudy ball that gets blown out
It seems it's numbered 'number ten'

up every seat

To the small and secret corners of this town
Race me fast on sunset

She's been married to debt for years
And now she's climbing the lone guard-rail
Gulls are er Mendelssohn, she has a bouquet of foliage

They have no interest in her flight

Come around me again and I'm a murder ya
I need some loot, so watch how I take your town
A bitch wanna hold me, I track her down
Get up in the brain, take over the soul
4 G's a night, I'm ready to roll
A big long black hella beat in the trunk
Baby kick back, it's hella heat for the funk
A dear mutherfucker, a step to the low
One too many drinks now he's gettin' a roll
So thought I 'cas kiss tell them hit this

Fantasie gelb, grün, rot, blau
Steck` mein Kopf unter Wasser, lass` den Flow raus
Rapstickistaow ich bin zu bekannt
Trinke zu viel Jacky, rauche zu viel Blunts
Auf einmal sagt ihr alle zu mir Guten Tag
Das würd' ich auch, zum neuen Superstar!
Willkommen in meiner Welt
Bin nicht sonderlich hell, aber blitzschnell
Wenn das Geld stimmt, auf die Ausbildung kacken hat für manche mehr Sinn
Wenn sie merken, dass sie mehr sind als im Endeffekt nur Hunde von nem anderen Herrchen
Warum lasst ihr euch beherrschen von `nem Märchen
Die nicht mehr wert sind als ein Gummibärchen Ah!
Alle meine Chabo`s sind Bause, Bause, alle meine Chabo`s sind Chief`s
Keiner passt in das System, aber, alle checken das Prinzip
Warte, für alle gibt es Hochs und Tiefs, grade
Läuft es aber ganz gut flieg, Palmen
Über meinem Kopf mein Team, started
Überollt euch und sieg, Party

Ich bin der, der durch die Stadt läuft wie ein Kaiser
Keinen Namen, nenn mich einfach deutscher Meister

Ich bin der, der euch begeistert
Und wer bist du?

Ich häng` mit Lativ und Rapsta, scheiße sind wir stoned
Sitzen in `nem Benzer weißer wie der Mond
Spitten ausm Fenster einfach wieder Flows
Lispeln alle etwas, keiner weiß wieso
Ihr macht auf uninteressiert , Zeit euch zu politisieren
Ihr könnt euch gewöhnen an den Flow, der König ist tot, die Krone ist mir
Ich bin sicherlich kein Hipster, ich passe nicht in dein Register
Twizzla Minister, ich fick deine Sister
Bis die Bitch Nichts als mein Jizz im Gesicht hat
Vernichte dein Magister, alles was Du im Leben gelernt hast, vergiss` das
Es gibt nichts umsonst, nur wenn ich deine Mama bang`, kriegst du Geschwister
Du steigerst dein Ego, zu weit, du bist nur auf Steine wie Lego
Bleib in deim` Tretboot, meine Torpedos ficken dein peinliches Life wie Yayo
Was is los mit euch Schlampen habt ihr keine Jobs?
Alles was ihr wollt is` Schwanz in euren Eierstock
Sie wissen nicht wer bist du bist, sie wissen nicht wer du bist
Sie weiß nicht wer du bist, doch wer ich bin, das weiß sie noch!

Yeah
Yeah, this me
I'm outta town but I'll be home soon, baby
I promise
Whatchu mean you don't believe me?
It's hard living this life I live
Just accept it, feel me?

[AZ]
I'm caught in a hole, I can't climb out
Caught in the mix 'cause I think she's just found out
A year later, in the league like the majors
Blowing my cell, 9-1-1 on my pager
You know the flava and how it goes down
I move in and out of town
But honey now I'm homebound
Before that spot's gone you need to slow down, right now 
For better or for worse, how that sound?

[LaTocha]
I sit and ask myself
Is it really worth it
Or are you tryin' to keep playin' with my mind
I don't know why I keep dealin' with it
'cause boy your love is wicked
And I'm so tired of those same old lies

1 - 	You told me that you love me
	You told me that you care
	Said you'd always be my baby
	How could you be so unfair

	Promised never to leave me lonely
	Promised never to leave my side
	Boy you turned your back on me
	Your promises were nothin' but lies

I can't explain the way I feel about this love
You left me all alone
Boy where did we go wrong?
'cause all the promises that you made
Were words just spoken
How could you leave me standing there

Let the truth speak
Bought you a jeep and the coup, please
Beach world, crump every Sierra with two seats
For two weeks both had beef, it grew deep
Made me loose sleep 
Forced me to creep with this new piece
Outta town for a minute now
Damn near finished now, simmer down
I know you stressed and it been a while
Daydreamin' and Daytona sun stay beamin'
Sea blue ocean beach, new waves gleamin'

Meet me at the chapel with your mamma and your poppa
Bring the whole fam' and be sure to dress propa'
Your girlfriend's are jealous, that's why they tried to stop us
Eyes wide open when they seen the rock I gotcha
Bounce to Cancun, the cottage on the mountain
Then sailed to San Juan, come drink from my fountain
For all my wrongs, I beg your pardon
How could you end this when we just startin'
(Promises were nothing but lies)

That you care, babe
That you lied to me, you lied to me

LaTocha Scott,"[Verse One:]
Never gonna put you out,
Never gonna let you down,
Never gonna break your heart,
Never gonna mess around.
Never gonna tell you lies,
Never gonna make you cry,
All those things you said,
Now would you mind telling me why,
I'm out here all alone,
And I'm feeling let down,
My heart's broken up in two,
I'm wondering what was true.
Hearing all the shit you said,
Now somebody else is in your bed,
And now that I've got your attention...

[Chorus:]
Listen to the sound of me breaking down, down, down,
Can't hear me losing my mind?
Everything that's everything is nothing,
And I can't tell your truth from your lies.
This is the sound of me breaking down, down, down,
Over and over in my head.
You're a liar, a liar, a liar.

[Verse Two:]
So why don't you just hush up all that noise,
That's all it ever was.
Hope you're gonna try to confess,
What you should've said.
Just a simple friend,
I didn't mean to fall in love,
Well I fell for the spell that you cast,
And as if that wasn't enough.
No hold up right now (wait a minute baby),
I gotta get this off my chest somehow,
'cause I'm running out of ways to say just what I mean,
Can you tell by the look on my face,
That I just want to scream.

[Repeat Chorus]
[Break:]
All the things we do in the heat of the moment,
It can cost you a lifetime of happiness.
All the things we do in the heat of the moment,
For many days to come can cause you nothing but distress.
All the things we said in the heat of the moment,
You may think everything's going right,
But the very next day they change.
All the things you said in the heat of the moment...

[Repeat Chorus to fade]
[Outro:]
Sometimes in our lives,
See there's right or wrong, right or wrong, right or wrong,
See I'm here to let why'all know,

That my life goes on","Liar, Liar",1999

Run your fingers through my fresh a** braids and say

I've been waiting on freeing the ring hell but ain't a thang changed
And I lost my brother in the struggle, and then he lost his mother
And I'm thinking about it who's mine's who gone raise my brother
Not to be a thug, stay in school, don't use drugs
Who'll teach him right from wrong and show them boys, true love
So I pray for the better days, face the bomb had a run-a-ways
And, I put my guns away and I pray for peace on Sundays, it's crazy ain't it

[Chorus]
Just like the soldiers, that ain't coming home this year
Just like the fellas, in prison, we miss you so much for real
What about the children, who ran away, that ain't coming home today
Well here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most a thug holiday

Just like em, just like em, just like em, a thug holiday - {2x}

Here go one for, all these killings and all these conflicts in religion
See the mothers, Jews and Christians but know they are all God's children
There's only, one him, plus ain't none of y'all confronting him
So blind in our own minds we wouldn't even know God if we confronted him
And, I read your books know all your remixes to the bottom
What about a, verse for the thugs curled with drugs and survival
That's asking chapels naming Martin, Malcolm and Faricon
In all my history books, only one died was the Americans
And, that's point of my, who's responsible for Vietnam
And, hold on there's more, we had two World Wars
And, how come the judges make more than the teachers is making
When they the ones raising all the taxes and got us fighting for education
Life is crazy ain't it

So many tears, through out the years
Somebody tell me what's going on
And so many liiives, but only God knows
About the pain deep inside
It gets so hard, you got to keep your head up
I know you're fed up, but stay strong
Here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most, thug holiday

Just like em, just like em, just like em, a thug holiday 
Just like em, just like em, just like em, a thug holiday

This is for my people in the ghetto
I'm calling out, calling out
To all my thugs in the ghetto
Calling out, calling out
It gets hard sometimes, but you
Got to keep your head up, and be strong
Here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most, a thug holiday",Thug Holiday,2002

Where the sleep ya slip soon as ya weakness met
From that real killer deal get ya steal and mash

Lookin rough in a bucket, tuckin tens and Macs
Dip roam, chip phones, flip (?) and clock
Lick shots and the cops and control your block

Ride providin 'em with guidance like your 'sposed to do

It's that time again and the place to be
Hands in the air, if you really want to party I'll take you there
Everybody get your groove on everywhere, everywhere
It's that time again and the place to be
I love to see, everybody want to party with a DPG
Take a toast and nigga get ready for the good part

Here we go again Crenshaw Boulevard
Hittin' switches in the fours again
Time to go Spring Break shoppin' and get some clothes again
All eyes as we rollin' in under the end ? lewis
Hit the Beverly Center the Hennessey and mystic
Mixed with this Indo got me lifted
O-Dizzle with the bomb dizzle now my nizzle bizzle twist it
Be legit it stack, now let me hit it
Ladies chase me and bustas scheme
See me caught up in the twist as I bust this dream
Too fly when we cruise by
Me and my Westside riders and plus my original squad
In PA sippin E & J
Dippin the everyday Chevrolets candy painted
Got my eyes wide shut
Kick back for a minute
Let my high rise up
I can't be faded tough guys wise up

[Chorus:]

You want to party with a DPG
Come and holla at me
I'll be up in Dark House with all the homies
Poppin' my call happy
Doin' it big as ever
In the City of Angels, Devils and pretty weather
The shark packed with bumper to bumper traffic
All bouncin' and 40 ouncin'
Hydraulic wit it, alcoholic wit it
Bumper paint and polished demolished
But we ain't trippin' we got heavy wallets
Sittin' on dubs, rollin' on three wheels
On the four with mugs and four with big wheels
Just breezing, and all the non-believers eventually end up believing

Philly fanatic automatic packin' with my khakis saggin'

You know the Young Assassins gon' get it crackin'
Every time we mashin'
Runnin' 'em up, actin' a straight nut
When the Yak in my cup spills, I get a refill
Enemies plottin' on me why'all better keep chill
I put it down like a G supposed to
And show you something that only a G could show you
Makin' all the cheese leavin' mice with tofu
Young but I'm cool laid back and old school
Come here girl let me show you how to G Walk
And maybe after we could sneak off
Talent scout with a casting couch
If you ain't got no talent ya gotta get out
Let me rock the breezies one time
With my bump rhyme
I show them how to do the snake with they jaw line
I'm DP'ed out
With every piece of love in the club that could follow me out
And they all mine

G'd up and others barbecuing
Ain't no telling what your daddy and your momma doing
Chewing on these baby-backs popping bottles with these macks

Everybody swimming, backyard full of women
I'm entertaining folks
Gave the lil' homie twenty dollars just to shine my hundred spokes
Coke with the Hennesey tends to be the remedy

Family and friends to me
Everyone pretends to be kin to me
I can't wait until the Fourth of July
To pop some fireworks with my kids

And fly some kites high in the sky
See, it's the family reunion
And down at the church house, they giving up the annual communion

It seems we made it to another summer
Yeah we came and come up
213 is more than friends
Yeah, we like blood brothers

Riding this 'til the wheels fall off
Can you dig that?
We got this summertime anthem for y'all
We did that

[Chorus]
We made it through winter
We made it through fall
We made it through the spring time
Tough times and all
It's good to see
I love the summer
I'm riding with the top down
Let the wind blow
Chillin' with my love
Partying fo' sho'
It feels good to see
I love the summer
Everybody if you with me sing

We got the game on lock
On the paper chase, can't stop
On a roll, still hot
Gotta be top notch

I like the girls ''cause they hot
Plus I know what they want
They want the game that we got
Hold up baby girl I think not

I like the nasty girls from around the way
Hoppin' in my gray drop-top Mercedes
Shouts go out to my sexy ladies
Just in case your man is hating

Tell your boy he better chill (Summertime)
Tell your boy he better chill (Summertime)

[Chorus]

I'm addicted to the sunshine the way it make these women dress
Tank tops, flip flops, make this n**** love the west
Different spots, even though different, it's still crackin'
In Jamaica, Queens I sit back, live and collect the cabbage

It's an affair that every state can relate to
And if you do what I do, then go on and follow suit
From Chi-Town to Diego, all the way back to NY
Stay fly, and never miss a piece of sunshine

When I'm at the church I barbeque for my kinfolk
Watch lil' Elijah and lil' Warren run the football
Got weed, got drink, but most of all the spirit
And it's a blessin' that the world want to hear our music

The summer is an inspiration as much as the fast
And to my my n**** Snoopdewoop, I love you fam'

Riding this 'til the wheels fall off
Can you dig that?
We got this summertime anthem for y'all
We did that

Yeah, another summer
Kanye West good looking on the beat, nephew
213 reminding y'all put your guns down
Well spent summertime, let's enjoy ourselves

That I, could find (excuse me miss)
Someone, so special (can I have a word wit' you baby)

[Busta Rhymes]
Miss can I get a second to speak and quietly mention
That I am so into who you are, can I get your attention
My observations of you creates conversations for you
And if you got a little time, I got the patience for you
Okay? Good, you giving me the time to talk?
While I figure it out and sort what I'm trying to say, let's walk
Just trying to keep it gutter, respectfully I won't stutter
Don't you agree, we look better when we walk with each other?
I've seen you many times, yes I've encountered many dimes
I'm feeling something special with us, it's just one of the many signs
I think that we have to look forward to our go-through
Any war with you regardless what it is I'm trying to score with you
Sometimes I think and wonder especially through rain and thunder
If I'd ever find the one to ride when I'm on top or under
Until we reach the end, ma with love as I be your friend
Oh, here you can take my number, I hope we can speak again

[Chorus One: LaToiya Williams]
No matter how mister, no doubt I'll die with ya
Until the end of life, lay down on the ground with ya
I'll give my life to you, I hope it all comes true
Ready to start for you, I give all my heart to you
And when together I hope we never fall apart you know
Now that it feels so good, our thoughts are understood

[Busta Rhymes]
I'd like to learn from ya, but I'm 'bout to turn from ya
It's been about a week and I ain't even heard from ya
Is it something at all or did I just bump in and fall
And even though you did I see how you was reluctant to call
But it's nothing to crawl before we walk (oh) listen
And it's nothing to stall before we talk, look
To tell the truth I'm happy I found you and that I can be around you
And thus I'm digging you, I ain't just trying to pound you
I'm only trying to crown you and wife you and wedding gown you
Regardless what I'm with, shorty seem like she always down to
just spend a little time and then click, you know that kind of chemistry
The recipe to then SIP, and a little bit of wine
Mami I like your kind that light the fireworks and bombs up
The type of chick I wanna talk about when I call my moms up
Until the love is empty I credit the one who sent me
The most beautifullest woman and she riding with me

[Chorus Two: LaToiya Williams]
(I'll do it all) I'll do it all with ya, go through any door with ya
It doesn't matter I will, go against the law with ya
Just know you live through me, your love is all I need
If you ain't know you make me, no one's ever shown you baby
Your dedication and commitment got me going crazy
Your love so real to me, and that's all that I, can see

[LaToiya Williams]
This is a thing I wanna feel forever, and I ain't going nowhere
Cause you mean so much to me
No matter how my people try to doubt ya, I know the truth about ya
It doesn't matter to me
Baby I love you and I always told ya, I'm always here to hold ya
Cause you do so much for me
No matter how they try they can't deceive us, nothing can come between us
Cause you mean so much to me

[Busta Rhymes]
Listen, trust me and I will trust you, I ain't into trying to fuss boo
Deeper than any lust, I'm only trying to mind fuck you
That's probably why and maybe I can nickname you my baby
Now that you made me a man you're officially now my lady
Despite the stormy weather I cherish your love forever
And nourish everything we have 'til we grow old together
I'll never trick you, mislead or try to be shaky with you
I only wanna make all the rest of my babies with you

LaTour,"Have you noticed, that people are still having sex?
All the denouncement, had absolutely no effect.
Parents and counselors, constantly scorn them.
But people are still having sex and nothing seems to stop them.
Do you realize that people are still having sex?
They've been told not to, perhaps they are perplexed.
When you see them holding hands, they're making future plans to engage in the activity.
Do you understand me?
People are still having sex.
Lust keeps on lurking.
Nothing makes them stop.
This aids things not working.
People are still having sex.
It's been going on for quite awhile.
Perhaps it's quite fashionable.
It hasn't gone out of style.
It's a fact that people are still having sex.
It's rather obvious, it's just what one expects.
The evidence is all around.
That everyone in every town has had it one time, or another in their life.
At this very moment people are still having sex.
In a downtown condo, or street in the projects.
Although you can't see them or hear their breathing sounds.
Someone in this world is having sex right now.
People are still having sex! (x4)
Sex! Sex! Sex! Sex!
Sex! Sex! Sex! Sex!
People are still having sex.

Pushin' sloppy sound out of their vocal orifice

From CEO boardrooms to porches to alley ways and gutters 
From coast to coast, east to west, south to north 
It's people talking of course!

In philanderin' usin' sex like a sedative 
Repetitive like rhetoric 
I'm bettin' ya think ya nice 'cause you give free add-vice right? 
But unless you got a tight alternative it's best to let it just live!

I know it hurts, there is no indigestion worse 
Than that which comes from having to eat your own words, 
I heard two people need not bicker in a burning home 
But some people know how to live everybodies life but their own so, 
Here's the poem dedicated 
To the hatred propagated by the ill-fated 
Snakes that's waitin' in grass 
Those that talk the most got the least to say 
But that ain't nothin' new 
And it ain't even really all that

Latyrx,"Mooo baby 
We can make it happen
Make it through baby 
All we need to do is begin rejuvenating 
Keep it all in focus and pursue it faithfully 
Do it patiently

Just the way the sea's been this evening 
I came out at eight, was leaning on the railing 
I kept hearing the waves crashin' beneath me 
Back and forth 
They just rephrased what they were saying 
Over and over, doing that repeatedly 
They'd crash and come back 
Its just a constant thing 
Every time they'd back out to sea 
Its like they'd draw just a little more out of me 
A lot of images and feelings 
Just a limitless release 
And I began to reminisce freely 
It was a cinema 
Featuring me and a cast of emotions 
That demanded my attention immediately 
I had previously put them on hold 
On the back burner since earlier 
I didn't want to deal with it 
At that time I felt like other things were pertinent 
Now I see its permanent unless I get real with it 
And it ain't that I don't love to tussle 
Especially mentally 
'Cause I generally do win 
Might not win at first, but definitely eventually 
'Cause I ain't never not been a shoe-in since birth 
But now, this is special though 
See, this is beyond my threshold 
I'm accustomed to just a conventional struggle 
With two opponents 
Only here the tussle's between you and the truth 
So ultimately I'm gonna lose 
Actually I gain though 
I gotta be honest with myself, or else 
I impede my personal progress 
I think it's better to be depressed for a minute 
Admit it, and get re-oriented 
Instead of being a bitter cynic isn't it?

Mooo baby 
We can make it happen
Make it through baby 
All we need to do is begin rejuvenating 
Keep it all in focus and pursue it faithfully 
Do it patiently

I'm getting older 
Everybody around me acts all sober 
Lookin' poker faced 
I started losing hair at the corners 
Matter-of-fact, I looked up top 
That whole border's jacked 
Nobody's gonna chauffeur me anymore 
Whatever this is, we all go through it I guess 
It's just awkward 
I'm not a hundred percent comfortable with 
The rate that everything's developing at 
It's just a little overwhelming at times 
I'm dealing with hella shit to process 
It's new data daily 
There's really no preparing for this thing 
Or, maybe it's mainly just me acting strangely 
Just me facing the challenge 
I doubt it though 
'Cause I met thousands of people 
Seen something similar in their faces 
It's like the outlook is changing 
I think it's called bein' a man in the making 
It's burnt, I like pralines now 
Long walks solo, where I can sort my thoughts out 
Just what I've been taught to date 
It doesn't gel well with the way that I've been feeling these days 
That's coming from a ton of angles, hella places 
I'm really not trying to make a political statement 
But just in terms of internally inside
I'm at an interval in life where it's a turbulent time 
And I could pretend that it's all good 
And that I shouldn't put so much on it 
Let it sit and just settle itself 
Stop acting all sobby and sentimental 
Besides everything's perfectly fine 
But here I am on this balcony 
With my thoughts just traveling randomly on some tangent
And in the back of my mind 
I keep hearing this lady 
Her voice is beautiful, she keeps saying 

Mooo baby 
We can make it happen
Make it through baby 
All we need to do is begin rejuvenating 
Keep it all in focus and pursue it faithfully 
Do it patiently",Balcony Beach,1997

Tried to get my point across using regular me(ans)

Your debt's still lingering 
While you erect gates with codes really nobody knows 
I ask, ""Why's it always closed?"" 
I'm told it's my approach 
Well let's suppose 
Just for the sole sake of argument that
Despite the spite and all the ill will you're harboring 
That me, Lyrics Born, all this power that I'm harnessing 
That I didn't come in here to no conquering 
That I came in here to do a little bargaining 
Grease key people do some apple polishing 
Maybe hail a cab for my local congressman 
So he can hook me with the landlord in parliament 
Then I'll set up a booth, hand-pick my operatives 
Train 'em up, send my squad of garbagemen 
To spread the good will, all in the environment 
And all the false doctrine and all the carcinogens, but now 
I gotta be wise 'bout who I'm targeting 
The key is make the young folks offerings 
So that they don't become adults that are demonstrative 
Or else my chances of retirement go spiraling 
So then I work my way into their subconsciousness 
I tell them always use caution, now, cautiousness, because 
Are you absolutely positive that you can make it without us and be prosperous? 
You need to look at me and my accomplishments 
Hey, I got an idea, let's start a partnership! 
It'll be just like livin' in a Harlequin 
And we'll feed our pond fishies ostriches 
We'll feed the starved kiddies self-doubt lozenges 
Just peeling layer after layer off their confidence 
Until it's one planet us homogenous 
Versus one gumball you optimists!!

This is what we gonna do,
We gonna

Shall I fan you with foliage in front of an audience? 
Hi-five Napoleon?

Then and only then would there ever be an opening 
Well, that's just your big, wet blanket of power 
You weight us down with double-talk until we think we're insane 
But if you're trying to save your pride 
You're trying to save your pride 
As far as I'm concerned that shit is going down in flames 
With your piddly-ass riddles 
You think I ain't mentally apt 
I see you slither 'round my ankle like I ain't gonna react 
No more me nibblin' on a bridle while you're kickin' my abs 
No more ""everything's Ore-Ida"" when I can't even stand 
No more fiddling with the maps 
No more belittling the past 
No more  when my questions is asked 
No more concessions for an ego so fragile 
Any self-expression chips away at your castle 
Your pride's your damsel, you built your barricade 
I was so careful 
I danced around your insecurities 
On your schedule 
Ignored all your absurdities 
But all the people 
You parody with that dogshit your nurturing 
Then you have the nerve to take certain shit personally 
I didn't even speak a handful and I encroached on your territory

You need therapy there mister Pharisee 
Seriously, 'cause apparently your circuitry's terribly damaged 
How 'bout a nice hot kerosene bath 
I'll come back 
I'll serenade you with flaming arrows oh serpentine 
Your pride needs refurbishing

Latyrx,"Cheyenne! Look at what the liquor brings about,
Throw out the magic basket full of wires and let them flail all on the ground.
Why do they love it so?
Hatched seeds of light supported by light seaward breezes, 
And we see these orbs in a car chase of sorts, 
Absorbs sweet Lorraine and her dolly on the front porch and it escorts them into
Deep, dark, space around Taurus, 
And the Mormons can't explain the stars reflectin' in her corneas. 
It makes they hearts beat hard against they corsets which 
Bops they lockets up against they foreheads, and--
Who was it that sent this little girl's mind up into orbit? 
She had to forfeit little dolly while in space so that she could touch the stars like torches. 
Privately, we recorded her, 
Intimately, yes! We courted her with
""Miss Cinnamon Tea, please rest your itty bitty palms in my
Incandescently glowing hands and infinitely, 
We will explore your inquisitive tendencies; 
The intrinsic and the explicit, 
We won't inhibit any of your inquiry, 
But first the fire must be met then quenched by you candidly and randomly venting any 
Thoughts, memories, anything! 
It's time for you to start channeling what you've been gathering!"" 
So we left gravity, 
Instantly engulfing Lorraine in a shimmering cavity then, 
Flattening like an elasticine band that stretches and contorts, 
And then I'd widen like the space highway spiraling sideways, contract and dilate,
Then straighten up at 100 mph then fall on myself in layers like a thickened band of taffy, 
Assuming every length and shape imaginable, 
Then I catapulted Lorraine and her stuffed animal into still deeper space, 
But fathoming what I had actually done and her pace increasing rapidly, 
I shot out like a javelin after her screams, 
First matching her speed, then surpassing her, hearing her laughter as I passed her, 
But the web I spun had not strengthened yet, 
And the momentum sent them stretching through my intentions, And I popped! 
Dolly lost
And Lorraine
Plopped back down into her bedroom, 
And coughed

Born 
The correlation 
Relation shapin' 
The forms 
Are takin' their stations warned 
We're warmed 
The verbal intercourse and mind fornication 
Is on, whine, design is tight, 
Corn burn more than blunts 
Or oil at midnight 
The clock turns, as it often does 
Fight it with all ya might scrub 
Ya learn more if ya listen 
Timing is more than tic-toc-tickin' 
Rippin's a mission so come equipped 
But not with remote clickin's or clips 
In the nine 
Ya mind 
Is fine 
With me 
Brother 
Ya chickens, you caint rhyme 
And punks react violently 
But bad men respond silently 
Later hearing your gone, and the facts while sipping on cognac quitely 
Privately 
Commenting on society 
Modestly, 
Honestly, 
Asking why fools even try it 
When they're undeniably 
And obviously, 
Undoubtedly, 
Decidedly, 
Wack 
I strech out and expand 
In 3-D like 
Galaxies establishing terrestrial contact, like 
Roll up the windows, crank the heat, relax recline the seat, 
And thank Lateef, 
Take two and pass, 
Give it a little gas and ask 
""What's the riddle mean?"" 
Fantastic 
G E=MC2 don't be sarcastic, my mind moves at the speed of light when blasted 
Synchopated audiosyncratic madness 
Concentrated 
Focused 
On the rabbit 
Like I'm rabid, gigantic, teething wolverine 
Armed with claws that bring murderous tragedies 
To even human beings burdened with feelings of sadness 
Ludicrous thang is I'm glad to be the baddest 
Sittin' fattest after I'm finished lunchin', munchin' em 
Before that 
I'm slashin', attackin with rippin' action 
In sound clashes 
Bastard I'm the fastest 
Quick draw 
Like: western classics 
BIG JAW, voice cuts like a saw 
Sprinkling you like Magic 
As the cataclysm hits 
Like SMACK 
Vocabic havoc cracks 
Your sternum, spine, and scapula 
Spectacularly 
Propelling you backwards over the edge 
Of the track

Now that we have made our way away from the sky apple, 
You will notice from your new knowledge experience, 
That the distance from the crust to the mantle to the core, 
Is much greater than previous measurements, 
And as lyricists in this time period we experiment with a myriad of new findings, 
Different from the supposed truths, 
The ample evidence we presented, 
It complemented our argument that ""everything is impermanent"". 
Not static or at settled standstill as the opposite element has suggested is legitimate, 
And finally, as a reminder, 
The precious metals and ores mined for early in the earth's surface sediment, 
Cannot compare to the infinite introspective splendor, 
Represented by the treasures indicative of our entrance into the earth's center, 
Incentive isn't it?

Yes, yes, yes, YES, well, yes, yes, yes, 
You're dealing with lyricists that's fresh, fresh, fresh, 
You wan test surely ya jest, look, lets just get 
One thing correct before ya step focus on breath, breath, breath, 
One rep, 
Breath, breath, breath, 
Select yet another set of styles? Yup, yup, yep, 
Each one as hard as erections I got to flex, flex, flex, 
For project protection I'm collecting text, techs, tex, 
While you're caught up, 
Thinking rap is just sex, sex, sex, 
And more flesh, flesh, flesh, 
Robbing your soul of its precious sensuousness 
Most of these rappers are talking shit out of the side of they neck 
What the heck? 
It's more and more suckas gettin' signed for less, less, less, and less 
And lesson 1: if aiming to impress, press, press, 
You gotta do it yourself 
Quiet as kept, kept, kept, 
If my work is respected I collect checks, checks, checks, 
They cain't all bounce and if they do I got an ounce at the rest 
So I ain't stressin' off that bullshit. 

'Cause I've walked on water weapons baby haven't you heard? 
I've authored songs on different planes and left the boundaries blurred, 
And I taught Neanderthal to use the rotary phone, 
I kicked the devil in his neck without my rosary on. 

And I checked out the vampire's nest 
Sans garlic, dissed his harlots, then without the crucifix 
Plunged the wooden stake deep inside his chest 
Pinned him! 
Thrashing around in the bottom of his sarcophagus 
Writhing around 
Till the only thing left, 
Were little scraps of nothingness 
Those scattered all about infinity

All different shapes and sizes going wherever 

But all of one entity 

That I had brought together for my pleasure 
Watch this now, 

Your last dinner in my chamber where I tempered weapons rendered from a rusty Ford fender, 
You get your steak and eggs, 
Your Caesar vinaigrette, 
Savor your cigarette, 
'Cause I'ma tape your lips, 
Become my marionette, 
You curtsy, pirouette, 
And when my blade caresses, 
I scrape my bayonet, 
You lose your favorite legs, 
I love that fragrance, 
Playful Pet! Yes I'm the patron saint of Dangerous, 
You slaying La-Tyrx? 
You're driving majorettes, 
Over some acreage.

As you sit there pensively, tentatively fidgeting with creation 
But you fuck 'round with this and you'll get aten.

You gettin laid to rest 
Ain't slayin' Latyrx 
You gettin laid to rest 
Over the Sunset's edge",Latyrx,1997

You can't see them!

[Lateef]
One way - a mircophone works
Checkin' suckas on the usage of vocal tones
While the breaks be bangin'
Cold shakin' ya homes
Vibrations reverberatin give identification
In meter Neter like Metu
Leavin' Holes in your speakers
Scold a brotha like Lateef - oh, that's a no can do
The Black and Puerto Rican lyric deacon speaking the truth
I'll make ya giggle like a tickle or a nipple tweaker
I freak a style from here to Mogadishu - here to Mozambique-a
>From here to Mount Zion I'm hard to reach when at my peak
Of shinin' flowin' like a creek lava spicy like paprika
That's neither here nor there
Fully chargin' up the air - heavy sounds gettign thicker like the atmosphere?
Ya gotta get up no it 'cause we got watcha want - the
Beats be fat like the factory Wanka
Suckas keep bitin' like a gang of piranhas
Ya betta come with it if your thinkin' is stronger
The mindset couldn't be any wronger
We roll deep swoll like the island of Tonga
Don't even really need to rock the mic any longer
So I stop!
Pass the mic like I pass on the porkchops

Chorus #1:
And it don't quit
I say that to say this
You can't oppose this
I say that to say this
'cause if the clothes fit
I say that to say this
You're a hostess

You're so sensitive
All I said was simple sentences
Premises was left as if the messages were venomous
They are though
Guess it's just my penmanshipt and how it moves
Your torso
Suckas steer clear of me like feminists
Do carshows
There's a little punchline for those of you
Who love rhymes with those in 'em
Hear it one time then you're finished with 'em
Give you that nasty, tangy feeling
Check it out
Free rhymes for griots in Fiats and Klingons
And wee tots with crayons and Koreans
In Reeboks in kiosks at flea marts and peons
That be on some feline shit
y'all like the FBI on some espionage
Asking questions but my head's beyond that
Be openly honest
y'all write ya'll own rhymes?
Oh I doubt it
I's dotted
T's crossed
Tell you what
I make a song
You take it home, you think about it
Promise me with every opportunity you'll use the all illuminating eye
Beyond the obvious buffoonery
Defy the allegations and the rumory
Be out the labyrinth the average imp's enamored with

Chorus #2:
And you don't stop
I say that to say this
Cause with a closed fist
I say that to say this
Youc an't oppose this

Latyrx,"The past is a thing who approached you and asked if he wrote you a note
And then he quoted you with poems
All the things you pursue, anything to see you front too
Who's zooming who
It's a privilege that's known as lyricism
I must admit this is a bit embarrassing
But can I be characteristically caffeinated
Apple-cinnamon and licorice thoughts of gibberish
And we can reminisce about the history we're making right now
Live a little
Let your whims control your limbs
Let the wind uphold your wings
Let your friends stay home again
Just give into your sins and unfold your linens and unroll your ribbons
Don't give your body time to react, just relax
Just lean back, your seat back
There ain't no need to freak out, just peep out
There ain't no one way to do nothing baby
Sailing through the crab-shoot of life not knowing where we're going
But don't evade me

When I self-emerge myself into a microphone, hey
When I shoot the wind I drift away with oxygen and out of sight I'm gone
There is no stopping time

See it like this baby
Like you got sunlight and then you got the shade
You got the grass bright green and then you got the pavement
Got your whole life for sights you've seen and things you did
And the gravy
The only place you're staying is the changes that you making
Grow, hold on, try and take it on yourself
But when you do it, when you get it you become, thrown away
But hold on
Know you're strong so keep your grip
Cause they'll be trying there best to trip you
Still, we 'gon carry it home
We've come so far we've got infinite future
Keep the soul, the bloodline flowing on
It's like your mom says, baby-bubba
Don't you worry, pray
You'll discover
A brand new place
Somewhere or another
Where you'll get your things straight
Then in order
Better have your issues covered like the world reporter
Concepts over-flow over air and water
How many people missing this times importance
Every moment that passses seems that time is shorter
Then you reach your ultimate height will all the colors
Represent your life, yourself, just know your culture
Then you'll keep it rooted in your mind of polluted love
Non-convoluted with the righteous result

When I self-emerge myself into a microphone, hey
When I shoot the wind I drift away with oxygen and out of sight I'm gone
There is no stopping time

Looking, over a city, that's gritty, and rather pretty
A pity, it's hard to find, but inequity, cover
Every itty bitty square diamond of jiggy
They givin ??, up to woodsy
Manipulatin they minds in the alleyways
These dizzy and shitty rats, the sizes of kitty-kats
They cross paths when traffic subsides; somewhere
Some brothers is overstandin on a hot black rooftop
Freestylin for they GOT damn lives, the spirit, it gets live
And answers the question why God blessed the Earth
But, buildings block out the sky, and the children
Are oversexualized, media-wise, brutalized by parents
At the tender age of five, in front of they siblings wide-eyed
Nah not surprised, just the real scene regularly
Up in between the lies, try to put it together GET
They pieces of the pie, hope they clever and tough
Make it better before they die, plant the next seeds
Somewhere in the South Bronx, or Patterson ??
The baddest with sharp chomp, to splatter when mouths-off
Retali' and swear he could damage em Dunn
But that will shatter his Mom's faith
In the art that she burns, herbs and candles of perm'
It's hard to call it see cause times change and the world turn
Some end up slangin dope, some end up strung out
On coke and sherm, some party every night for the rest of they life
And some learn, go corporate all professional rhetoric
With sensational glory, let me tell you all one day
That it is it ain't boring, and so hard to ignore it
Cause any day in this fork, that they callin New York
Based on nothin but currents, you can find yourself a failure
Or a success story
On the subway, at three in the mornin, huh
Or on the corner, or up on a rooftop yawnin
Meditatin upon it, lookin over a city that's gritty

It's a batch of latin girl, actin rappin off the spanish
English quest, can't understand, as the languages clash
And every ad is vandalism, the trash gets aneurysms
It's delegates and panelists all representin they nationalism
And the battle inches on, every section separated
By eth-nic features decorated veterans deliverin
Les-sons to the younger people stoops that double as bleachers
And I'm part, of an elite fleet, of MC's, and Truth Speakers
I import, concrete beats, that just speak, when my moods flavor
My peers I beg forgiveness, I just don't buy twelve inches
Too many independents, they share the same resemblance
Too hard to make decisions, I built up a resistance
Like I'm fightin off a sickness plus they just don't hold my interest
But, mission'in out, to the indigineous birthplace
The first day, I inched below the sur-face
And found, inspiration, in surplus, in my, in-terpretation
Of dis-turbed crazy world, of love, dope shit, attemptin contemplation on
Uniquely woven and continuously flowin intricately sewn into

Latyrx,"Check it
It began at sea
Three cross currents concurrently
Started turning creatin' the mother of all tempest to be
Excess precipitation and ionization
The cloud cover hovered ground 2000 feet
Listening swiftly to meet the ocean's wave peak
Along the jet stream was a fog
Sparkin', rollin', and pourin' needles of rain
Thunderin' like god's bowlin' lane

Crashin' and collidin', the master of craftsmen 
Passionately expressing his anger with his angst 
Then flashes rains
Insanity in fastening are rationally lashing out
Blossoming from his majestic means
Patterns and waves gravity couldn't tame
Battling seas with seas the skies were stale
The light light rain of lightening veins
Brought in gray clouds with bright silk, then fade

Devistating
The dark, thick, all bliss, cumulus
Looked more like swabs of cotton in a chalk cold ditch
Stretched across all four tips of the horizon
Yet its movement was swift
But then there seemed to be a shift
A small pause with and oddness and a stillness that felt
Ominous

Now if the storm was the servant under the earth's surface
The congregation was stirrin'
Nourishin', swellin', like a serpent turning
Like a burning furnace yearning
It was churning perturbed and quite determined to be heard
So the ocean floor bursts the earthquake emerged
And it formed a network of corridors
Which made the earth porous, the force urge forth, the surf warm
And the storm that served above it assumed the same course
Now as the rain poured waters the basin tore its corners
And they both aimed toward the northern california shore
And as the wind whispered warning, the ground hinted authority
The long shore men leaned forward, also were corneas
Quadruple in proportion he was lord by his formal introduction
To the forth coming force

That afternoon the appetite of the catastrophe beast cooled
Began by snacking on the panoramic view, the population of people
Every single house so feeble in the mouth of the storm
The needle of the richter scale teetered and trembled
So beautifully warned
Picturesque hale shot through the windowsill 
The glass splinters sailed through the innards of little children
Waitin' for dinner, they entered then exited
The earth split like dry flesh and then engulfed two whole blocks
The roofs flew off like screw off tops
The school for the arts, the schoolin' docks
Plus few supermarkets and all its human contents
Of ruddy is screwed on top like you throw blocks
Now if you're alive to announce true accounts all over your mouth
Of rumble mills spouted keep your mouths and dollars damaged
The doom, the trials, the tribulations
You can do without the balance between life and total devastation

Everything around you shakin' and you quakin'
And you feel the rocking of the foundation 
This madness slanted vibrations
And down you go, your mind's been slow around you so
Dishes flying out of their kitchen cabinet door
A few crashin' when they smash in the windows
That's when you recognize 
The warning isn't just the terror in your eyes
Or fear between your ears
It's thunderin', the rumblin', is it all over you're now wonderin'
That's when the telephone pole rips through the roof
And adds a wide stake through your living room 
Nature's heavy burden is now passed on to you
Your world eaves and pulls, you watch the house next door
Swallowed by a sinkhole, it's out of control, wow

Riveting whirlwinds gripping the world
Women and children wait a minute we're all in jeopardy

The wind brought the rain
The rain cleared the lane for the quake
And still made room for more rockin'
The quake shook the state, the state took the bait
Then sank, but still made room for more rockin', rockin'

It's like the bible says, the final days, the tidal waves
The earthquakes, the storm that breaks, simultaneously
Smack the landmass, orderin' california
The pourin' rain , the smoke and flames
The earth engaged in open man, from growin' pains
The broken mains regurgitating all in vain, pain 
Your orphan daughter screams in vain
The block you came rectangular lace, from people grievin'
Neighborhoods that hydroplane, heavy breathin' can repeat
From passenger and everybody trying to escape on half a tank
Hearts palpitate, valves breakin', gas tanks, fault lines, open wine
We fall flyin', nose line
Behind us a car is blindsided by a semi
Fallin', cascadin', golden gate totaled, spiralin', spiralin'
Until the hemorrhages fall",Storm Warning,1999

Of the aisle, of the temple I was

Won't there at least come a day 
When we ask ourselves 
""When can we breath again?""
You asked for freedom, 
You asked for patience, you're alive
This tiny trembling is the hand 
Of indecision, all your own
'cause in the end its only I
Someday this will all make sense to me
In between a walking dream or the shadow 
We ask if we cry ourselves aloud
Do the tears in your eyes belong 
To realize our sense?

That I could be losing your heart

You said that she's one well to see
How deep you're in love with me
And intentions were not to get in between
But I see possibilities

And you say that you feel
I'm the best thing in your life
And I know it's real, I see it in your eyes
There's no reason for me to even feel this way

Burn it to the ground, where you laid me down
I could curse the moon, curse your love, curse your name
But instead I curse the bed

I took a shower, put on a long white dress
Danced for hours, around the flames, around the mess
Poured some champagne, made a toast, said goodbye to all my ghosts
But all that metal, all that steel, are like your words that I still feel

At the grave of her mother
And she visited there so often and wept so much
That her tears watered it until it had become
A magnificent tree

I wish

What it's that you wish child

Do you know what you wish
Are you certain what you wish
Is what you want
If you know what you want
Then make a wish
Ask the tree
And you shall have your wish",Cinderella at the Grave,2002
Laura Benanti,"He's a very smart prince
He's a Prince who prepares
Knowing this time I'd run from him
He spread pitch on the stairs
I was caught unawares

And I thought, well, he cares
This is more than just malice
Better stop and take stock
While you're standing here stuck
On the steps of the palace

You think, what do you want?
You think, make a decision
Why not stay and be caught?
You think, well, it's a thought

What would be his response?
But then what if he knew
Who you were when you know
That you're not what he thinks
That he wants?

And then what if you are
What a prince would envision?
Although how can you know
Who you are till you know
What you want, which you don't?

So then which do you pick
Where you're safe, out of sight
And yourself, but where every thing's wrong?
Or where every thing's right
And you know that you'll never belong?

And whichever you pick
Do it quick
'Cause you're starting to stick
To the steps of the palace

It's your first big decision
The choice isn't easy to make
To arrive at a ball
Is exciting and all
Once you're there, though, it's scary

And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave
But you have to be wary
There's a lot that's at stake
But you've stalled long enough
'Cause you're still standing stuck
In the stuff on the steps

Better run along home
And avoid the collision
Even though they don't care
You'll be better off there
Where there's nothing to choose
So there's nothing to lose

So you pry up your shoes
Then from out of the blue
And without any guide
You know what your decision is
Which is not to decide

You'll just leave him a clue
For example, a shoe
And then see what he'll do
Now it's he and not you
Who is stuck with a shoe

In a stew, In the goo
And you've learned something, too
Something you never knew
On the steps of the palace

And will you still love me tomorrow

My name

And if you're ever feeling humble

Into the fire
'Cause I'm out of sympathy
And I can't walk this wire

So find yourself somebody new
To catch you when you fall
'Cause I got just one thing to say to you
And that's all

Down by the place on the corner
Where we used to meet
Two people to proud to give
Afraid of what the heart demands
Two of a kind
We made up our minds to live
Without the ties that bind
Each to each
No surrender 
Out of reach
Where not one tender sound was heard
Not a cry or a whisper
No farewell
Nothing spoken
Silence fell while hearts were broken
No one stirred
Was it love?
Did we ever know the meaning of the word?
Now there's a moon rising in the cold and distant skies
And I can feel it shinin' down like a lover's eyes
Don't know where you are tonight
Or how to tell the things we say
From what we mean
Or why we could never cross the distance in between

Only time will tell what a heart is gonna do
Only time will tell who's the dreamer, who's the fool
Only time will tell

We tie the ties that bind with a simple act of faith
No matter how we try we're in the hands of fate
We take the gift of life and give it to each other
We promise you and I a promise that we'll try to keep

Only time will tell if a love is true
Only time will tell what a heart is gonna do
Only time will tell who's the dreamer, who's the fool

Started livin' without you now look who's back here 
You've had a change of heart, well, mine just couldn't wait, no no 
You found out you loved me just a little too late
Once the cards were held by you 

Now there's nothin' you can do
All those nights you sit alone starin' at the telephone 
Wonderin' if I'm ever comin' home 

Solitaire, see what it's like now
Solitaire, to cry all night now 
Solitaire, see how it feels to play
Solitaire, it gets so lonely 
Solitaire, you want to hold me 

Don't wait up, ''cause babe, I won't be there
Solitaire, solitaire, solitaire 
Solitaire, see what it's like now 
Solitaire, to cry all night now 
Solitaire, see how it feels to play
Solitaire, it gets so lonely 
Solitaire, you want to hold me
Don't wait up, ''cause babe, I won't be there

Laura Branigan,"If you loved me, I'm sure that you would know 
Wouldn't be so easy for you to let me go 
If you loved me, you'd put away your pride 
And put some love inside, and hold it there forever 
 
If you loved me, if you ever did before 
You could find those feelings, and feel them all once more 
If you loved me, that love would pull us through 
You'd do all you could do to keep that love together 
 
You had me walkin' on a rainbow that vanished at my feet 
Now that it's over, I see the truth my heart refused to see 
 
If you loved me the way I love you from the start 
Wouldn't be so easy for you to break my heart 
If you loved me, you'd give it one more try 
You wouldn't let it die, you'd hold me close forever

If you loved me 
If you loved me like I love you",If You Loved Me,2006

Laura Bryna,"She wakes up to Sponge Bob and Captain Crunch
And the love of her family fills the room
She plays with her new friends 'til it's time for lunch
But she remembers why she's there each afternoon

The doctor talked about a blood test
She's not sure what that means
And today she met some volunteers
Who asked about her dreams

Would you like to meet with Dolly
Hang out with Micky Mouse?
Maybe ride a roller coaster
Get turned upside down?

Think of one thing in this whole wide world
You wouldn't wanna miss
Take your time, close your eyes
And make a wish

She let out a big shout and gave them a hug
Said would you mind if my Care Bear tag along?
'Cause he's been my best friend and he brings me luck
And to go somewhere without him would be wrong

They handed her a pencil
Said it's okay to make a list
If you can't spell it, you can draw it
It doesn't matter what it is

Would you like to make a movie
Take your picture with a star?
Have a party in a playhouse
In your very own backyard?

Think of one thing in this whole wide world
You wouldn't wanna miss
Take your time, close your eyes
And make a wish

She thought it over for a moment
Said I know what I'd like to do
My only wish is to make
My friends wishes all come true

Would you like to meet with Dolly
Hang out with Mickey Mouse?
Maybe ride a roller coaster
And get turned upside down?

Take your time, close your eyes
And make a wish

To analyze this strange frontier I come

An oasis in this dry desert sand
Well, you won't be long too long

Laura Bryna,"We had a fire so bright, could light up the darkest night
Never was love so right as it was then
But all of that’s over now 'cause your flames burned out somehow
You came here to let me down with just a few words
And turned the light of your life into smoke from a bridge you burned

Have you really thought this through?
If you let go I will too
That all of the love I thought we knew will never return
Oh, it will drift off to nothing, smoke from a bridge you burned

Then someday when it’s too late you’ll realize
It’s more than my memory stinging your eyes
And you’ll run back to tell me the lessons you've learned
But you’ll only find ashes and smoke from a bridge you burned

You know once you close that door it won’t open anymore
So turn around now if you're ever going to turn
‘Cause the moment you leave
You’ll be turning me into smoke from a bridge you burned

Laura Cantrell,"Well, the whiskey makes you sweeter than you are
If I'd quit drinkin' sooner, I'm sure I wouldn't have gone that far
Now the haze has lifted I can see
That the whiskey makes you sweeter than you could ever really be

I started slow and steady, I went from Cola to a beer
I made a resolution from the liquor I'd steer clear
When I saw you there, somethin' inside of me switched off
And when I switched to the whiskey, then I knew that I was gone

'Cause the whiskey makes you sweeter than you are
If I'd quit drinkin' sooner, I'm sure I wouldn't have gone that far
Now the haze has lifted I can see
That the whiskey makes you sweeter than you could ever really be

""Sweets for a sweetheart"", that is what you said to me
As you handed me a shot glass, and drank down hungrily
I was lost in dreams of sweet things, runnin' through my head
If it wasn't for the whiskey, I'd have run away instead

'Cause the whiskey makes you sweeter than you are

Laura Cantrell,"Sam Stone came home
To his wife and family
After serving in the conflict overseas

And the time that he served
Had shattered all his nerves
And left a little shrapnel in hs knee

But the morphine eased the pain
And the grass grew 'round his brain
And gave him all the confidence he lacked
With a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back

There's a hole in daddy's arm
Where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothing I suppose

Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long
On broken radios

Sam Stone's welcome home
Didn't last too long
He went to work, he'd spent his last dime

And Sammy took to stealing
When he got that empty feeling
For a hundred dollar habit, without overtime

And the gold rolled through his veins
Like a thousand railroad trains
Eased his mind in the hours that he chose
While the kids ran around wearing other
People's clothes

There's a hole in daddy's arm
Where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothing I suppose

Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long
On broken radios

Sam Stone was alone
When he popped his last balloon
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair

Well, he played his last request
While the room smelled just like death
With an overdose hovering in the air

But life had lost it's fun
And there was nothing to be done
Trade his house that he bought on the GI Bill
For a flag draped casket on a local heroes hill

There's a hole in daddy's arm
Where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothing I suppose

Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long
On broken radios

And you don't know
That I'm walking right behind you
Walking real slow
I don't want to catch up with you
'Cause once we got started
We'd have to see it through

I see you on the street
You kiss my cheek
My knees go weak
It's clear you've got nothing to lose
But I'm losing sleep

I see you walking up 14th Street
But you don't know
I'm following behind you
Counting my steps as I go
Maybe ten steps or twelve
Divide us in two
Not counting the blocks 
Between me and you

See you on the street
You kiss my cheek
My knees go weak
It's clear you've got nothing to lose
While I'm losing sleep

People said watch out for that situation
It's nothing more than crazy infatuation
Insist it was love, I weighed common sense
I payed with my heart 'til I saw how much I spent

I see you walking up 14th Street
And you don't know
Now I'm so close behind you
Almost in your shadow

Maybe one step or two
And I'd be walking next to you
Not counting the blocks

You kiss my cheek
My knees go weak
It's clear you've got nothing to lose
