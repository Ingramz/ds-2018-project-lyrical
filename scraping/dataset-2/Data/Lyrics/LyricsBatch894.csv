Its like race car lights
Its just like shakin' the dice
Just pray for your life ain't always makin' it right
I'm safe in the light
The subjects to the dangers of all
They aimin' at cha'll
And we the ones mostly involved
It's most of why'all
Trust me, they don't know me to ball
See the truth is I don't feel they owe me at all
The focus is small
A nigga either broke or he ball
And me, I smoke til I choke and I cough, drink til I barf
Sometimes I ain't thinkin' at all
But I don't pray to take my eyes of why'all
These streets don't brawl
(stick 'em up!)
Don't nobody hesitate to drop a body 
Karate can't do nothing to me
I got a shawty if anybody need to penetrate 'em
Now you can die while in the streetz of illustrated
This world was given to me I went here to make it
Now you gon' relate to this, or you either hatin'

[Chorus:]
We be in 'em streetz, every single day
We be in 'em streetz, every single day 
We be in 'em streetz, every single day
(See we just write about it, but you can die about it)
We be in 'em streetz, every single day
(Now you can be a see about it nigga G about it)

Me and Bad Azz is makin' that dash
Smokin' that hash
Spendin' the cash

Willin' to mash
When we pass we gon' blast
Who gon' last this aftermath?
Who gon' rock shit after that?
Comin' from a gang bang habitat
Nigga can't even have that
Motherfucker didn't even have a gat
Who the fuck do you think we laughin' at?
Youse a bitch, youse a snitch, youse the nigga that I have to jack
I'm the man, gat in hand, didn't think that I'd have to pack
But I do, fuckin' you, how's your life, can't have it back

To slide through in the lak with the ray chrome on 'em
Jump to it, and I ain't never gotta, bounce back
I count stacks

Announce back
You big mouth hater, you, we hit back
We got slugs in exchange for you
You underminded, we a keep ya here and change the truth
If you can find us we got drugs in exchange for lute
The cops got pictures of our mugs and our gangsta suits
Traffic ain't shit ta niggas like us with a 20 proof
We make it really hot
And those that really cops
Somebody that really shot
See how much you really got
The streetz'll eat you up
If they don't catch you first and beat you up
Nigga the little kids'll eat you up!

Bad Azz,"[Chorus]
What I'm going do, what I'm going be
If I have to please you and I don't please me
I got too many choices, too many choices
What I'm going do, what I'm going be
If I have to please you and I don't please me
I got too many choices, too many choices

?
I've been so many places, still I don't know where I want to be
People forever changing, rearranging, I see things
I gotta go, don't want to know your name
Cause your life, is none like
But I want you to know before I go, that baby, we could've had it all
We could've had it all

[Bad Azz]
Just to be alive is a blessing to me
Hey, you can lose your mind and heavy stress moving
Recently, I've been talking to myself a lot
I answer back, thinking 'I ain't supposed to answer that'
Is that a fact? Am I losing it for what I said?
Or is it 'cause a nigga talking and ain't no one there
I can't remember 'cause I'm scared, I don't look back
It's hell behind me and I ain't trying get took back
I know you feel me, stressing, learning lessons of life
Till they kill me, and we'll be, alright in the long run
Maybe mix son gin with my life 'cause we all gone crazy
And maybe, we'd learn to maintain
It'd help us stay sane, for the time we remain
Or maybe, the rest of the world'd lose they mind
And we'd die not knowing how we wasted perfect time
Damn, (we could've had it all)

[Chorus: x2]

[Lil' Beau]
I'm on top of the world and about it
Yeah, it don't make sense, only chase for sex and presidents
Probably next on the set but I check myself quick
My old homies want to get me (fuck why y'all), the devil want to hit me
Flashing cash that like ? on ass
Giving into greed, doing dirty deeds for the last time
I swore to God it was, but I lie
I try to stay clean but clocking green made the Holy Ghost die
That's why B.T. banging now, that's why bigets is slanging 'round
It's 'cause we don't know how, to stay sane in this game
Having chips and then they took away, it's just another face of pain
And while I got a couple bitches try and dirty up my name
Getting served by a couple hoes, gobble up the game, going crazy
And still grind sales in this paying-the-world game
But I choke, it ain't nobody fall but Lil' Beau
Tell the tag on my toe and nigga mourn what he here for
Friends be the snakes in disguise so I fear for 'em
Knowing Jesus watching all my homies and my kinfolk
Guide me the right way, you'll pay for ? yourself, yeah

[Chorus: x2]

[Lil' Tip Toe]
I wake up early in the morning everyday, when the sun rise
Just praying for the world to come together before my son rise
And get old, and have to go through life without a daddy
Just because your Caddy came through with a barrel pointed at me
Life is short to being happy, so I live with smiles and hugs
But some folks, they rather trip to spitting rounds of slugs
I keep it real for those that choose to learn game from me
I'd probably blast myself before you'd ever see a change in me
I'm going crazy out here, God help me if you will
I try to keep it real, on my journey up the hill for a mil
But still, I got too many choices to make
And while Tha Lowlifes rising to the top they hoping we brake
Lil' Tip'll never fall without a reason from God
You will never fall without a reason from God
(I got too many choices, too many choices, we could've had it all)

Ha, discrimination - 
to a crafty-ass hoe that's tryin' to fuck up a niggaz lil' nation
Fuck the penetration hoe if you gon' pillow talk (that's real baby)
You want me to be like ghetto Green Eggs & Ham
And turn into the Grinch and check yo' bitch ass
So what if I hit the gushy? (so fuckin' what?)
Uh bitch, you was s'posed to shut yo' motherfuckin' mouth
Even though I secretly hit the pussy (Ooooooh)
That's the problem with you hoes
Uh, you want me to take off this muzzle that's on my pit bull

[Bad Azz]
You was beautiful, suitable, do-able, so we do a few
Now I can't stand your guts, I'm like ""who is you?""
Boo you're through, I found another shooby-doo
You got my name all in that drama talkin' whoopty woop
How you just holla cause a nigga down with Snoopy group (Dogg Pound!)
Well me, I'm only down with you cause what your coochie do
Hoochie bitch, flossin' in a groupie suit
You was attracted to the mackin' and the Coupe was cute
I jumped out, hair braided, jean suits and boots
Chronic weed, Hennessy, my fo'-five and some loot
With my best girl, lookin' like - damn, you belong to a baller ""yes"" girl
Don't believe what she holler
Bitch 'bout a block past stupid with her raggedy ass

Now we's about to blast in with the hot chrome plated
Since I'm the big homie, I'ma aim the gun
And let you pull the trigger little Bad Azz nigga
Set it off - them niggaz talkin', get it off
And money ain't a thang like J, bet it all for cash
We 'bout to smash, pit bull mood

All in my business, you best get your own
You a guest, get blasted in the danger zone - ooooooh

Six feet deep, you get a customized ditch
Act like you don't know me when you see me with my bitch, bitch!

If you see me walkin' with my bitch - (don't say shit!)
You better keep it on the low-low (keep it on the low-low)

Bad Azz,"A lot of people say when they smoke weed 
It makes them feel nervous or not in control. 
Not for me. When I smoke weed I just feel good. 
You know, this one time I was in the Bay 
Hangin' out with some of my buddies, smokin' a blunt. 
Everyone's getting highfy. 
Me being the outsider I am, 
I wanna be involved to. 
So I jump in my buddies car, 
I'm ghost ridin the whip down E. 14th St, 
But he forgot to tell me he didn't have a wheel alignment.
One thing pot definitely does it makes you 
Shut the Fuck up Bitch!

Nigga I'm dangerous, A wild big blue pit, 
The type of dog you don't really wanna fool with
You get bit cause I'm dangerous 
You get bit when my homie stay sippin'

Yea

My name Daz I'm a cool what it is nigga 
Rollin with some niggas that split a niggas 
Wig I'm just chillin' up tryin' to get it popping 
Kill you about my paper if you plottin' 
Don't stop it I gives a fuck bout what you talking 
Give a fuck bout what your hopin' 
If you come for mine your body is a target 
I got some drink and a swisher full of that shit 
Hit you with this pistol I can make you hit 
A back flip you know my name you can see it in my face 
Ridin' through the streets with heater on my waist 
And the last thing I need is a case 
I keep bail money with a cool 50 K 
Just to remind ya with this pistol 
I'll blind ya leave you dead in your tracks nigga 
That's where they find ya I'm the most gangsterous 
You can think of don't be surprised I'm the nigga you hate to love

[Chorus: x2]

They took Tooky but he still lives in us he tried to say he? give? 
Schwarzenegger didn't give a fuck 
It's every man for himself 
So keep a pistol tucked, 
As far as rap goes it ain't hard to see the Crip in Us! 
A lot of nerves everybody gotta get rushed 
It's like a big picture painted by a killas brush 
Self defense be the case I'll be home for lunch 
A little drum sticky koosh and a swisher blunt 
Daddy was a ridah Moms was a wisher six dead homies 
Cause I've been that nigga I'll take your bitch 
I don't know if I'm a be back with her 
I'm hittin' niggas up every time I start spittin'
Take a peek make your whole block shiver niggas drop and roll 
With the shit I deliver I'm a Dogg Pound general 
Second in command you cross that line nigga 
Your dead where you stand you and your man Nigga

[Chorus: x2]

Now I'm back on a creep 'n real low key 
Niggas make a move Fuck an O.G. 
Niggas can't hold me I hold heat 
And the temperature don't rise slowly it's lonely 
On these cold streets Wheel it, 
Any car that's available hop out guns out, 
Naw we ain't scared of you
Yea it's true, you should see what clip bananas do, 
Run up in your crib ain't shit your man you can do.
He'll get hit through his shirt, through his vest, through his T, 
Through his chest and when I'm done with him ain't a damn thing left 
Just leekin' out his flesh 
Pourin' liquor out his vest 
And if you ask about me then the answer will be yes. Yes. 
This some g shit real niggas fuck 
With you can holla when you see me nigga but

Bad Azz,"Every night - a different town - I sing my song
I play and sing - pack my things and move along

A pretty face, another place I never get to know
A one night stand, another show

My guitar - a railroad car - a bus or plane
Chocolate bar - and there you are - the price of fame

If I could do what I want to, I'd stay and never go
A one night stand is all I know

I wish that I could be two people
Instead of bein' on my own
I wish that I could be two people
And then I'd never be alone

Photographs of where I've been and all I've done
In this whole world - is there a girl - no, not one

Goodbye, hello - I've got to go - I hope you understand
A one night man is all I am
A one night stand, a one night man.

Doo doo doo...
Goodbye, hello - I've got to go - I hope you understand
A one night man is all I am
A one night stand, a one night man

Y aprender todos los secretos que esconde tu piel, yeah

No en la tierra si no en el aire a 30 mil pies

Y vas a ver como de nuevo querrás otra vez

Sólo nubes blancas y una vida sin estrés (Remix)

Quiero que te quedes un poquito más

Millones por el mundo hay igual 
Esas que si te miran fijo, te van a enamorar 

Ojos café, un cuerpo bien 
Olor espectacular 
No sé qué fue, pero noté 
Usted tiene el paquete completo y me hipnoticé

Y ella es mala, mala, mala, mala y peligrosa 
Tiene una mirada y sensual y una carita hermosa 
Y es que es mala, mala, mala, mala y peligrosa 
Mujer que vive segura de sí misma, es toda una diosa 

Tú eres peligrosa como ruleta rusa 
Envuelve a los hombres cuando baila y después los usa 
De diseñador la cartera, también la blusa 
Una diabla con cara de diosa, por eso es que abusa 

Contigo camino en la cuerda floja 
Entiende que en verdad yo tengo lo que te despoja 
Engáñame pero que no te coja 
Porque a la primera te saco tarjeta roja 

Me enamoró aunque yo no quería 
Le pregunte al gran combo qué se hace cuando te hacen brujería 
Me dijo que después de tanto tiempo que no sabía

Ves cómo mis labios se enloquecen
Pero tu orgullo 
Nota que mi cuerpo se estremece 

Me pides que te bese, despacio 
Como las olas cuando el mar las mece 
Y voy controlando tu hermosura como el sol cuando amanece 

Yo no me quiero dejar llevar 
Pero tú eres mala, mala 
Esto va a terminar mal 
Yo sé que tú me quieres enredar 
Pero tu juego no lo voy a jugar

Están llenos de veneno y de malicia 
Yo te lo juro, trato de evitar 
Pero con cada uno que me da, me envicia

Es que es mala, mala, mala 
Puede provocar pasiones con tan solo una mirada 
Peligrosa mala, mala, mala 
Es capaz de hipnotizarte si la miras a la cara

The night you came through made me realize
There's no way I could leave

Addicted to temptation, and we did not resist

Liebe kann eine bittere pille sein

Liebe ist eine bittere pille

Hold me close
Don't ever let me go
Cause I'm confused
But maybe someday I will know why

Sometimes I'm right as rain
And when it rains it pours
You're such a mystery
Why can't I unlock the door

All that glitters isn't gold
Too much is overkill
Love can be beautiful
Or a bitter pill

Forget that pretty babe

Headmaster's breaking all the rules
Having fun and playing fools
Smashing up the woodwork tools
All the teachers in the pub
Passing round the ready-rub
Trying not to think of when
The lunchtime bell will ring again.

Oh what fun we had
But, did it really turn out bad
All I learnt at school
Was how to bend not break the rules
Oh what fun we had
But at the time it seemed so bad
Trying different ways
To make a difference to the days.

The headmaster's had enough today
All the kids have gone away
Gone to fight with next door's school
Every term, that is the rule
Sits alone and bends his cane
Same old backsides again
All the small ones tell tall tales
Walking home and squashing snails.

Lots of girls and lots of boys
Lots of smells and lots of noise
Playing football in the park
Kicking pushbikes after dark
Baggy trousers, dirty shirt
Pulling hair and eating dirt
Teacher comes to break it up
Back of the 'ead with a plastic cup.

Bad Manners,"It's just gone noon
Half past monsoon
On the banks of the river Nile
Here comes the boat
Only half-afloat
Oarsman grins a toothless smile
Only just one more
To this desolate shore
Last boat along the river Nile
Doesn't seem to care
No more wind in his hair
As he reaches his last half mile
The oar snaps in his hand
Before he reaches dry land
But the sound doesn't deafen his smile
Just pokes at wet sand
With an oar in his hand
Floats off down the river Nile
Floats off down the river Nile

Bad Meets Evil,"What's your favorite scary movie?
Yo, Slim Shady (Yo, Royce 5'9"")
Y'all wanna make a movie? (What, what?)
We got the film right here

Yeah, I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really have to, I really slap you
King of Detroit, who they naming the city after
Scandalous partners whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with content, yo, who wanna start with?
Expert, Bad & Evil is coming soon
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
Leaving all of you cats shitting kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cocking pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splitting the profits with you
Six percent of y'all niggas is just pretend
Cliques with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks
Niggas act bully and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packing semi
Speak darts; yo, you get paid?
Rhyming about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
5'9"", a street nigga with deep feeling
I keep illing, my steez willing to keep killing
Fuck rap! A lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks; one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'm a pitbull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw
Split y'all, holler, ""It's on!"", then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggas get pissed on claiming you pissed off

Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers coming in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directing and starring in it

The one man on the planet
That'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle will get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this – and you better inhale!
‘Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy
Pushing a ten speed, screaming to Aunt Peg
With three spokes sticking outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache! Give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em! The rap struck 'em
Harder than getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

And slipping a Molotov in your Cocktail (take that)
Burning your contracts, punch your A&R in the face 
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
I'm on some shook shit, if it's missing I took it (whoops!)

Nurse look at this straitjacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head 
When the rest of his body's still alive running?

Coming with five gunmen, waiting to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what?) hide from it
For every hundred MC's rhyming about birds
Only about two-thirds'd really set it without words

Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's raining slugs (what?)
I'm the hottest shit in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defending me

You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what?)

I take it if you run your mouth, then you want to get sent up
Heat it up, you be leaking blood and spitting phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title

Walking in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces

Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icing my fame, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading, I won't die, I'm never leaving (what?)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing

That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer,
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I've gone through,
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it,
Every rule I'm breakin' it

Terrible, but not rippable, invincible, I'm hung invisible
Fuckin' mistletoe, over the wall to stuck my ass up under it
Now pucker up them lips and kiss it ho, here we go
Bad and Evil, so you know how this'll go
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches, this is no,
Joke goin' overboard, like someone threw us off the boat, choke
Puff up all the smoke I'm tryna stay on fire
So you know if I hate fucking water-sprinklers, I don't love the hoes
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff his face
Back, then I smother that mothafucka 'til it suffocates
Who? You! Handlin' the over weight
Why are they tryin' to be so sick, when bad and evil has reunited, hey?
Came back to annihilate, the game's in dire straits, it's our way
Worlds Satan as I drop, ? Ouija board
Now you lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I'm sleepin' now, as if I was awake
I'm teared bitch, I'll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy, never mushy, so you can't squish
Never on my damn toosh, in fact if I jump out a bush
And sneak attack's the only was I say I ambush
Outlandish are these words and weapons that are Brandish
Stand off, it's the hoes, keep your hands off this
Can't tie a bitch, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for?
Law, fuck protocol, I'd holla at this ho, but now my throat is sore

I'm at your homie, I'm at your home ready to spray you
Why you nappin' homie? Have everything on and around your mattress

Go 'head jump, no matter how high you get
You gon' come up short like Spud Webb

I stay violent, y'all go the peace route
You got a mouth like Kanye, I knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit I'm just nice with mine
And this just rap, I'm just like Ricky Hatton, I just like the line
These sweet rappers wanna set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em left to right, head or gut
What y'all messin' with is a nigga that'll leave you fubar
Fucked up beyond all recognition
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite
I could just throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it
Partner, you not hard, I body your hot bars
Beef has left you prayin' right? Like Allahuakbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot, you ain't gon' be on your metro
In a bad area that car drops

Sometimes life seems so unfortunate,
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer,
It's just so disproportionate

Bad Meets Evil,"First verse, uh I'm on 'til I'm on a island
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been born or if you conform
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette witcha asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past,
So that basically resurrected my cash flow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the eighties!
My nineties was like the Navy, you was like the Brady´s
You still fly kites daily!

Catch me in my Mercedes
Bumpin' ""Ice, Ice Baby,"" screamin' Shady 'til I die
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now before I get on a roll (danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin', try them trailer parks
Crazy, I am back, and I am razor sharp, baby
And that's back with' a capital B with' an exclamation mark, maybe
You should listen when I flip the linguistics
'Cause I'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'Cause after I spit the bullets, I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics! So get this dick, I'ma live this

Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die

I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)

My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with' a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the Devil that says ""I'll let you take me
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpe of Jack Kevorkian""
Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
My tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers
Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity

Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up, and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down
He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now
Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck the mall, he shuts
The whole motherfuckin' Wal-mart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with five nine to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown
Shawty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips, I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it

And then after takin' that, I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinating
It's gon' say ""The whole rap game passed away"" on top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson' activator
Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data
Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Dropped in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent)

Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck pay dirt
You rollin' with a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin'

You're putting on a show, where's your mic at?
Cause you're breaking my heart

Uh, pull up to the club in a Porsche, not a Pinto
While Marshall's at a white trash party, I'm at drama central
I walk up in there looking at my phone, on Twitter tweetin'
I'm feelin' a bunch of bitches lookin' at a nigga, cheesin'
I get approached by this little skeezer
She asked me am I the realest G, cause I'm Gucci from head to feet
I said, yeah, I'm really is cause I spit in your man's face
Like Cam did that little kid on Killa Season
She said I'm feeling a bit of ego, wait, am I talking wrong?
I said nah, I'm a walking Kanye Beyonce song
She said I'm mad at you, I said why?
She said why you never make songs for chicks as if it's hard to do?
I said I make songs for me, leave the studio
And go and fuck the bitch who belongs to who makin' songs for you
She said I'm feelin' your whole swagger and flow, can we hook up?
I said, um, you just used the word swagger, so no, she said

You ain't really like that, oh

We been ridin' around in this hatchback 'til I'm fucking hunchback
Where the fuck's this party at slutbag cunt? Cut what act?
Think it's an act? Fuck that, I'm tryna shag scuz
Better find this love shack or somewhere to fuck at, ah, don't touch that
You fat dyke, I'm tryna hear some Bagpipes from Baghdad
Don't act like you don't like 'em, them accents, I rap tight
And I'm a torture you 'til we find this place, yeah that's right
Thought it was just past this light, just past Van Dyke
Better hit that map right, read them directions, oh yeah
You can't read and you can't write, told me that last night
She took my CD out the deck, snapped in half like
Relapse sucked, I snapped, hit the gas like
Blew through the light, spun out, hit a patch of black ice
Forgot we had a trailer hitch to the back, we jackknifed
Bitch flew out of the car, I laughed like, she deserved it
She didn't think I'd act like that in person
(Royce, Marshall just crashed right in front of the club!)

Tell him I'll be there in a minute
I'm tryna break up this cat fight between my mistress and my damn wife
Then a chick wanted a hug, she was fat
So I gave her dap and told her to scat, I'm not mean, I'm cute
On my way to the front door, taking the scenic route
To avoid this chick with a lace front lookin' like Venus and Serena's hooves
I'm just sayin', those chicks got horse asses, they been attractive
Hope when they see me they don't slap me with they tennis rackets
My mind drifted back to this shit
I seen my wife push her down, step over her body and smack the mistress
Police outside, I turn and pass the gat to Vicious
Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin
He mugs the mistress, turns around and gives the misses hugs and kisses
Looks at me twisted, like Nickel ""Yeah, watch this shit""
He smacks the dentures outta the mouth of the fat bitch he rode with
Looks back to mention, ""Royce, it's good to be back to business""

You ain't really like that, oh
You're putting on a show, where's your mic at?

Bad Meets Evil,"You're going to be okay, kid. You're going to be okay

Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me

Always been the type of dude that'll feed my clique
I know that without the fans,
I ain't shit
But y'all better read my lips,
I don't spit raps this ill
For you to just hack and steal and leak my shit,
So peep my drift
I hope y'all don't think you're helping me out with that shit
That shit stressin' me out
Nickel nine is blowin' up
Christmas time, you should hang my album on top of your fireplace
Cause around that time, my stocking is goin' up
Feels like a victory, bittersweet, cause the bigger I get?
The bigger the wedge,
Between the relationship of me and my bigger bro, hear what I said?
Feels like the shit just switched on me
Everything I do for the nigga, and the nigga know
I would do anything for him, but the nigga refuse
To just quit straight shittin' on me
Keepin' your distance?
Probably best if you don't wanna fuck with me
But you know me probably best, fuck pity
You want that? You know it's Leila Ali's chest
Tough titty, the problems,
You got a problem, you think that I'm already set
So I'm a look down on you?
Just be proud of me, you already got my respect
I ain't tryna say something I regret
So I'm a just stop, chasing the pain
Let you deal with the fact we don't get along
Cause I got a big face in the game
Sometimes I feel like fuck my life,
I fuck with a few niggas that I know that
If my chick was a Shady hoe
Niggas wouldn't think twice 'fore they fuck my wife
Guess that's the difference in friends and associates,
I done been broke, I done been through the motions
I don't pay no attention to birds,
I use my scope then I tend to the vultures
No one ever blows up your phone to talk,
I don't make money just to loan it to y'all
Tell a nigga that the new album is like ?
Is like talking to a hole in the wall
Please look at these expenses,
these niggas expensive, if I gotta lend you money every time
I see you just to be your friend, bitch, I don't need your friendship

Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me

I give (and I give), and you take (and you take)
And you just walk away without nothing to say
You just take from me, you just take from me

I live in a bubble, I struggle with the fame
Trouble as the pain grows double, give a fuck what you say
When my music you take so subtle, just to give it away
To people who don't even appreciate flows, mothafucka, I'm living today
Cause I break my back to give you my art, you steal my thoughts
It's like driving a spike through my heart
You might not think it's not that big of a deal to steal from me
But music is all I got
Aside from my daughters, not to sound like a martyr
But it's getting harder than I thought
To not just go crazy, trapped in this house, I'm about to just snap
And I might not deserving of what I got to, did I not work for it?
Put it all in every record I record
Well then please tell me why ?
But I wonder sometimes is it worth all the bullshit
'Cause it feels like a down there ain't no gettin' up from
But I won't let it get me down, I won't succumb, I'm anything but ? so fuck 'em
They'll appreciate me when I'm gone, they say it was ill, right?
The way I kill mics? But the way I feel right now
It just feels like I'm so done with this shit I might as well wipe
I have nothing else to give you, nothing left to contribute
Farewell I bid you, but before I go, my last gift to you
Ladies and gentleman, Slaughterhouse I give you!

Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me

Welcome to hell

There's a switch, I flip, I spit emotions cut off
So cold I'll roast my butt off
And it ain't even anticipating the tip of the 
Ice burg in the middle of the ocean yet so fuck off
Other words I didn't put a dent in a can 
Compared to the damage I've yet to do

Long as you still have feelings to hurt
I'll be around as long as you let me get to you
Long as I got two balls to palm
I'll be the bomb, you're just a false alarm

Get scared little piss ants 
And see if I don't come along and stop your farm
Thunder and lightning, rain, hail
Sleet with a tornado's the kind of brainstorm I get
So when the wind starts blowing, shit, talking about goin' in?
Goin' insane's more like it

Wizard of words when he he spits hazardous with it
Like a disastrous blizzard 
So you better listen quick fast don't miss it
Yeah go ahead little prick bastard, diss it

But when you get hit with a sick ass explicit flow
Don't ask how much of his passion is it that goes
Just know, that all he knows is this
It's better to kick ass than kiss it

Dick dastardly of audacity mental capacity
Unmatched it has to be stopped
But it can't be, but man I can't just keep doing them like that
Or no one will rap with me
'Cept one, you asked who is it?

Guess who just came through to blast you bitches
With the ratchet, the book of Mathew, a book of matches
Lighting 'em under white linen

You about to have to admit it
They pass you the mic, asked you to spit it
You got handed your own ass, your ass in your own hands
I'm sure they gonna laugh when you go into the bathroom with it
Now with what would you come against us?
Better be something with a big foot pedigree

Easily these are the reasons that we need to be in your prayers
Each region breed some emcees that wanna be, 
Which means they wanna breath our air
With these ideas, anybody thinkin' that the game don't need
The bad and the evil regime
That's like saying that bad boy 
Piston team didn't need Isaiah

Sip piss and bleed, 
This is a different breed of emcees, I swear
Better be aware, there's too much at stake, 
And to find someone this raw on a beat is rare
You can kiss my ass 
And the shit stains on my underwear that I don't even wear

This gotta be no fair
This like hittin' the lottery, oh yeah
Who you know hotter? there gotta be no pair
Shotty that I got a lobotomy, your hair
Classic, smack it, smother it
Read it and weep and perhaps you'll have no rebuttalin'
In fact, you seein' me in this rap 
Is like saying tila tequila can sing like Jasmin Sullivan

Back to bash her skull again
Push a bitch out the Aston until I get the fuck outta dodge
Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors?
You has been's are dumber than 
Color books that ain't colored in

Second and third, fourth wind, gotta another win
Here they come again, none other than, bad and evil
Also known as Sadam and Osama Bin

It's been a long time, 
But I bet neither one of us have felt as sick as we do right now
And we only get iller with time, 
Me and nickel fucking shit up on the grounds
Tellin' us to pipe down
It's like talking to a meth head

Bruce Willis on his death bed
Last breath with an infection
Fightin' it while he's watching internet porn
About to meet his death with an erection
My god, what I mean is
David Carrideine jacking his penis in front of his tripod
Choking his own neck, what part you don't get?
I'm saying I die hard

When you listen to my bars, nothin' but the fire
Comin' out your iPod, we come up in a place
Chicks heads start spinning like motherfuckin' white walls

Got your mother suckin' my balls while we fuck each other 
Punch each other in the eyeballs

Cause I ain't took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'mma set this bitch on fire
And this time I don't mean I'mma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
'Cause this time when I fuck this world I'm put my whole God damn dick inside her

Don't stop

Yeah, Bad and Evil is (back)

We bout to get into a tail of gunner that details the dungeon
This is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
Oh once again where I fail from blundering
Shady lifted his wing than I fell from under it
Now I'm free fallin'
My career is gone and the weed callin'
Regardless of who's fault I was b-ballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Marshall double backed and got me from on top of the hearse
I'm alive nigga, Justin T ain't got nothing on me
Cause I done cried Mary J Blige rivers
I realized that God's with us as soon as I decided
To put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges
The writings on the wall
Since niggas seen me at the baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z
Suddenly everybody calls
""Like I'm just checking on you dog""
While I throw up this message on the star

When them bottles stop poppin'
And them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)

How can I be a quitter when haters dont stop (dont stop)

Well pick ya ass up lil homie, come on
You just gone sit there and take it or make em suck it
Tell em where to shove it straight up,
You gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it?
The last time the light kicked me in the ass
I pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass
Man what a catastrophe it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop ass
Did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day I say I ain't poop
Shit, the day that I don't straight shoot
I'll drop out of my anti-women hate group
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back and put it on straight loop
You haters look like you ate a grape fruit
You see me climbing back on that wagon
Got my swagga back I was dragging, hop back on it
Grab the reigns on that bastard and came back on em
Without remorse man
Man of course I'm a one trick pony
Cause I'll be screaming on these whores till I'm hoarse!

With AK's with baby bayonet's
I'mma get rich or I'mma die trying
That's why its either kill or be killed
So call me suicide homicide Ryan

There's a bomb inside my head
I'mma live wire, I am on the edge
Teetering on it like I tore the iron mike
Get on a nut like a tire iron

Man I'm laughing at 'em the entire time, why am I up?
Cause tribulations I have triumphed bitch I'm fired up

The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack
And you can get the fickity-finger, the middle
You little dizzy bitch, eatin' spaghetti again
Got a 6 o'clock craving, stop, get Ciroc

I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
Came to sip vodka, shit
Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear
But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha)
What are you, pit, rott, mixed?
Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then, let's lip-lock
If not then, chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog

So bring clairvoyance to this bangin and I'mma keep on saying

Do the job of killing Shady, then the karma will

Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rocking with a sadist
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertaining
I ain't stopping till be sprayed it
Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shaking
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking
What's it called again? I'm blanking
The thing above the balls between my legs and I think
I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging
Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick
then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
Got a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis
chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet
at least that's what her train of thought is
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it
quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches some complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie
So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride

And sat down did an ALS challenge, huh
I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again

About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand

Bitch, get the fuck out of my face
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me
I said saint, por favor
Thought I said to wait, had four doors
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever)
I leave the club with my tab still open

Got a few Jordans, three, four pairs of Louboutins
That's besides the point like a shootin' guard
Nigga, I'm a rockstar

With whoopin' cough
(I am) sick, George Clooney wit' a Uzi
What kind of a movie star
Would hop out a movin' car just to prove he’s hard?
Fuck you doin', you retard?
Should be put in a cast as soon as we start shootin', dog

The way I drug a bitch through the yard
Stuffed little Suzie in cardboard after wrappin' her nude and newly scarred
Body in waterproof tarp covered in roofin' tar
So what you so blunt for?
Did you fuckin' fall off, chump? Or did you jump?
Or did you just become more
Been into a funk, I just become morbid
And more self-absorbed in my own world, everyone orbits
Pen at the table, I don’t know when I’ll be able to stop
Told you from the gate
One thought it generally takes and I’m off to the races
Wait, mentally stable, hold your fuckin' horses
There’s nothin' more disgustin' an animal
I just got done snortin' the fuckin' bathroom soap
And the tannin' lotion
To unwarp this mind you gon' need some sort of an antidote
There’s not a pill for bananas though
It’s unfortunate, you got delusions of grandeur though
Actin' like you’re Michelangelo with a fuckin' cordless
I think I'm Shredder, so you better better crawl back in your shell
Or run 'fore you get injured
A fuckin' Ninja Turtle wouldn’t come toward us
Two joint forces, of course this is what blunt force is
'Cause we’d smoke you on any joint
Bad and evil's back, bitch
You might experience some shortness of breath
As you sit with your lungs punctured

Hear their motherfuckin' tears come pourin'
If I tell you once more, then you’re done for
You’re going to have to learn
How to fuckin' hear from a ruptured eardrum
Forrest, am I clear? You Gump, you’re as dumb as a stump
To think we'd come with a trump shortage
Bass in your face, bitch
Chuck Norris’ nunchucks morph into guns, swords
This is what blood sport is
The goriest, glorious, notorious bigamous, shogun warriors

God damn, the Slaughter boy general
Once I slaughter it, you couldn’t un-slaughter it
Once I order a hit, you couldn’t un-order it
Hit's an order, this the consortium

So orchestrated, opponent's heads with this anger
Always, ‘cause this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)

If I don’t got no more drama, bitch, I’m a fish outta water bottle
After all these guys I slaughter
Applause is gettin' louder, how the fuck did this happen?
I never rapped for bitches, how's it my audience now is broader?
Devil without a cause, rebel without a pause
I am a kaze without the kami
You wouldn’t be a G if it cost me a thousand dollars
Infrared in my pencil lead
But always keep an extra one stocked though
In the back pocket and both of 'em locked
And they're loaded, like cocked twin Glocks that I’m holdin'
You better pause when you see these two dots on your colon
Fuckin' punks, you wait, just got to rockin' and rollin'
'Cause Elvis ain’t left the buildin' yet, I’m still a villain
You feel a threat when I step in and kill a set in a millisec
With the weapon of intellect, Hannibal Lecter with the black belt
And kung fu, protect your neck and

Respect the gun rule
Read in the Art of War book 'bout Sun Tzu
You realize if you defy, you probably won't be around here long
Rapunzel (get over it)
Look, bitch, I got the bands in my pocket
And the drum roll poppin', that's...
That’s overkill, I keep the kill under me
I keep the chill one degree
I hit you with a hook that’ll make you see threes
You realize as soon as you beat me that you didn’t
Yeah, there’s still one of me, I'll meat slap you
That’s a recap view, that’s normal embarrassing
And you slap me, that’s knee-slap humor, that’s hardly hilarious
So we scrap over you lying like a feline cub in a forest
Cherishing a kill from a dominant male

And I’m born with Malaria
Form of Lou Gehrigs
To torture and terrify corporate America
Poor little Erica
In the morning the sheriff's and Law Enforcement
Will find one fourth of her buried
Under a barrier of the kitchen floor
With the stairs in an outdoor wooded area

From the moment I go to bed 'till I wake up
All day, this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)
So orchestrated, opponent's heads with this anger
Always, ‘cause this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)

Back then, hoes didn't want it
Now black Benz all hid in corners
My spectacular, vernacular
I spit like giving Ex-Lax to a Dracula
Let me translate, I’m tryna find me a bitch
And then I’m sucking on her neck while she naked
And then I’m shitting on her

And I’m getting boners from what I’m spitting
Getting blown to smithereens in a Toyota
Getting stoner, Jonas Brothers
Brothers, songs fricken rotisserie how these birds are flipping
A time bomb with a nervous ticking
Another murder victim, I flirted with them first
And burrr-stick ‘em, I burn up if I try to step up inside a Church Chicken
Wanna, making sure any who battle me crawl away
Assault and battery holiday, and just when you’re thinking that’ll be all I say
I’ll start automatically calling names and rattling off fellow rappers so pardon the analogy
But I disappear as quick as Natalie Holloway
It’s my mentality all the way, I’m normally a suicide mission to try dissin'
But one thing I never mind's getting called Elvis all the time
In the articles that you write which is why I never reply, 'cause he died shitting
So-a, shitting, I'm spitting my infinite supply of written bonafide
Kidding aside, critics take my little white dick in your eyelid and fuck it
Switch subjects, moving on to the next one its, Ch- Chucky
Who wanna play with number one overall, Kid Cudi
A psycho buddy who might go nutty ‘cause he don’t like nobody
His knife's so bloody ‘cause he just sliced somebody

Who pussy the tightest?
That’s amazing, sit your ass down
I don’t like the pussy too tight
Get the fuck outta here and have some babies
Vocabulary still ill, the 911 still will
It’s all yellow with the black stripe, kill bill
I’m so far ahead of the skills here
I’m getting ready for my past life
I’m the real deal

Like Holyfield, think you irreplaceable? Bite it (that’s overkill)
'Till I kill over like somebody stuffed roadkill and
Ebola in my bowl of oatmeal, you know the deal
I’m not about to sit and go through the whole spiel
Of how I’m, how I’m cold steel like a old cold snowmobile
And no feeling, it’s so jovial
But don’t be one of those who mistake me for a joke, it’s so for real
It’s what I told the phoney emcee before I broke his will
Drove a drill through his skull to see his soul
Told him when I snap like a photo
He’ll get exposed like a roll of film
Now here he goes again, oh
I’m so trill, I’mma get the hoes again

Fill up them buns with a hot dog and be frank these other motherfuckers ain’t even in the ball park
Then she pulled out the condiment drawer
She must heard this is where the condoms get stored
Sign above the door to the sauna says “welcome to Sodom and Gomorrah”
Told her I got something for her, sharp and it’s pointed
And it’s head’s on swole, hold it like a samurai
She said, “Woah, look at that bulge, must have a huge ego”
I said “is it me you’re aiming that compliment toward”
She said “yes my ninja, please get to stabbing this shit”

Threw my black belt and gauntlets all onto the floor

And grab yourself a neighbor's skeleton to lean upon
Did you know him in life - one filled with regret
So soon we all forget we ever met

For a man estranged; I won't deny that I'm inclined to isolate

Now this is what I am talking about
Stuck in side, but I am letting it out
I am struggling just to keep my poise
And I don't stop screamin' till I lose my voice
Keep on doing what I feel the most
One last hit and then I am ghost
If it's not my fault that's how it has to be
That's how I am keeping my chastity
If I had it all I would give it away
No idea how I am living today

Ask me again and I'll still say no

Don't be hatin' on me baby 
Give me that sweet stuff all night long
I feel like it's my first time 
I feel like it's my first time

I remember the first time I met you
Couldn't for get you
Everything was right
Knew I had to let you
Into my life
But the question was how
It all seems so clear looking back now
Back in '92 didn't have a clue
School bell ring sky clear blue
Get my ass home
Call you on the phone
You promise later on that night 
We be alone
Next five hours, don't think I sat
Took a trip to the store for a lubricated hat
Check my self in the mirror 
91 times
Rehearsed in my head
99 lines
Came to your door
You grabbed me by the hand
Heart beatin' quick
I am about to be a man
Girl, you satisfy my soul
Went to put the Trojan on, shit, it had a hole

I am always wakin' up real early 
Some time around two o'clock
Girls can't wait for me to call 
So they can get this started
It's a daily operation
F train to my subway station
But I am still a virgin, babe
So lets stick, to masturbation

Remember shit, I am ready to go
Saw a girl I met at a show
Forgot her name
And she got mad
How could she miss what she never really had?
Got love from here to infinity
Loose control when she's in my vicinity
I want to take her home and show her I am a surgeon
Tell I love her
Then tell her I am a virgin

Four strange men on a mission to change shit.
And I had a couple of dreams in the past

Introduced myself 'cause that's my style.
She said, ""Yeah I know you, I love your CD.
I know all your rhymes, you're my favorite MC.""
Quick to the point no time at all
Snuck on in to her residence hall.
In ten minutes flat we were both butt naked.
She was screaming and yelling yo I just couldn't take it.
Her roomate got pissed while we fucked in her bed,
Bitch stole my pumas while I was getting head.

I can't believe I'm never gonna see you again,
You were more than a lover, you were also a friend.
The things I learned, in just one night,
When I say goodbye, it'll be alright, alright, alright!
Now people let me tell you 'bout this girl Suzanne,
Met her at the bar and I was like god damn!
She didn't have a man, no drink in her hand,
Bought her a shot and took her back to the van.
She was tall, slim, and tan. A White Owl fan,
Asked if I would take part in some perverted plan?
She dropped her skirt, she had another head.

Dentro dos meus braços os abraços hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim, colado assim, calado assim
Abraços e beijinhos e carinhos sem ter fim
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio de viver longe de mim
Não quero mais esse negócio de você viver assim
Vamos deixar desse negócio de você viver sem mim
Não quero mais esse negócio de você viver assim",Chega De Saudade,2013

I will be remembering

Baden Powell,"Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes, ah

When she walks she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes
Each one she passes goes, ah

Oh, but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes he smiles
But she doesn't see

Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
É ela, a menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço caminho do mar

Moça do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado é mais que um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar

Ah, porque estou tão sozinho
Ah, porque tudo é tão triste
Ah, a beleza que existe
A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa sozinha

Ah, se ela soubesse que quando ela passa
O mundo sorrindo se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo por causa do amor

Oh, but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he

And tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
He smiles but she doesn't see

She just doesn't see
No, she doesn't see
But she doesn't see

Drum denk ich auch, daß er noch hält.
Doch jetzt ruder ich I'm Rettungsboot
Durch`s eigene Öl zum Strand.
Ein Fischer schaut mich traurig an,
Drum reich ich ihm die Hand.

Why did the old man wash his hands?
Who grew the flower that was big enough to kill?

I can hear his shiny boots fall on the sand
With a basket at his side. And the morning full of pride
You can see him cast his line with skillful hands

Hey hey, fisherman. Wish you luck that's all I can
Hey hey, fisherman. Forget the world if that's your plan

As the morning turns to noon. He's content to sit and croon
And he lights his twisted pipe and settles down
Onward goes the time, as he tries new baited line
So he digs another worm up from the ground
Hey hey, fisherman, wish you luck that's all I can
Hey hey, fisherman, forget the world if that's your plan

T'ween the nightness and the light, the line is taut, he has a bite

And his patient mind is blown.'Cause the fish is overgrown

He won't be back no more

She's got no place to go

Too proud to let him know
