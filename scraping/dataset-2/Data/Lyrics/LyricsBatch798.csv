Olive,"I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

Olive,"Take someone you know
They have climbed the highest tree
You think the fight was won
Take a look around

A smile should now appear
Beaming brightly ear to ear
Consolidate your stride
On solid ground

But what you see is all for show
There is no meaner man to know
You can run back to what you had
You're all alone

I'll mark the day
When we can meet beyond the fray
Don't lose the will to see your home
You find the way so we can meet beyond the fray
I'll fight to see that you get home

Consider this small clue
Look beyond your point of view
Make a space for honesty hide

Much of what you do
Smacks of one whose friends are few
Do the decent thing and jump the ride

But what you see is all for show
There is no meaner man to know
You can't run back to what you had

It's a wonder what he keeps in his selfish mind

A darker shade of blue
Still I draw closer to you

Indulge me, please

Olive,"There's a gentleness within
There's a kindness that she'll bring
Through her eyes of sadness lies
All her love for him
Imprisoned every
A hansom price to pay

Even when she's done her time
She'll insist that life is just fine
Someday soon she'll make her move
Seize her chance to shine
It's all that she can do
To free herself from you

It's her liberty
(that she wants you to see)
It's her liberty

Where has all her lifeblood gone
Will you ever see
Even if she understood
Is it written that she should

Come and see him when she is gone
He's surprised but knows he is wrong
A simple case of do or die
And now she's cut and run
Your vision let you down
You almost let her drown

Olive,"When you find someone to make your dream 
They respond with loving care 
His reluctance to contrive his life 
Her apparent debonair 

In the wake of what she called her right 
Here was something they could share 
His belief that he was on her side 
Her illicit love affair 

Long lost love affair 
You`re not so strange 
What you have spared for them 
Needed to change 
Should always have to change 
Always have to change 

When their love was all but lost at sea 
Quite unable to be seen 
In the depths of their subconscious minds 
There was something evergreen 

If you wipe away her tears you`ll find 
Bitter sweet humility 
It`s the backbone of his dignity 
What it took to make her see 

Long lost love affair 
You`re not so strange 
What you have spared for them 
Needed to change

Si on s’était connu la veille

Pour que nos cœurs à nu habitent les nuages

Si nous étions montés à pied
Aurions-nous pu toucher le feu

Nous serions-nous aimés pareil

Oliver,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

And the clouds are so low
You can touch them, and so
Come out to the meadow, Jean

Jean, Jean, you're young and alive
Come out of your half-dreamed dream
And run, if you will, to the top of the hill
Open your arms, bonnie Jean

	Till the sheep in the valley come home my way
	Till the stars fall around me and find me alone
	When the sun comes a-singin' I'll still be waitin'

And all of the leaves have gone green
While the hills are ablaze with the moon's yellow haze

I missed her through the day
But I'd forget it
I never said it
I'd pass the flower shop
Lord knows I meant to stop
But I'd say, tomorrow, perhaps tomorrow
Tomorrow there'd be time
There'd always be another spring
Time to make her laughter ring
Time to give her everything
Oh my, 
Angelica, my Angelica 
There's so much you never knew
So much I always meant to say
And do for you, for you, Angelica
But then the cold winds came
And when I spoke her name
And held her near me
She couldn't hear me 
The shadow had been cast
Too many springs had passed
For Angelica
Sweet Angelica 
Now in my silent room
I tend the flowers that I buy
As they slowly fade and die
Watered by the tears I cry for my Angelica
My Angelica
There's so much you never knew
So much I always meant to say
And do for you, for you

Sunday morning
Sun shining from your eyes
Sleepy face 
Smiling into mine

Sunday morning
Lots of time with nothing to do
Lots of time to spend with you
On Sunday morning

It's so quiet in the street
We can hear the sound of feet walking by
I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do what other people do
On Sunday morning

I love Sunday, Sunday morning

Come hold me in your arms
I love you
Everything's alright

Oliver Cachin,"On est tous solidaire face à la merde à la galère
Sortir la tête de la misère pour que les gens nous considère
En tant que citoyen non en tant que chien
La France nous ronge à un point
De ne plus avoir confiance en son prochain
Législation conçue pour nous descendre
Frère derrière les barreaux et maintenant
Y penserais que l'on pourrait se rendre
On est pas dupe en plus on est tous chaud
Pour mission exterminer les ministres et les fachos
Car de nos jours, ça sert à rien de gueuler, de parler à des murs
À croire que le seul moyen de s'faire entendre est de brûler des voitures
Un putain de système haineux, cramer mais après tout ça avance pas
Et je sais que ça les arrangent si on se bouffe entre nous
Soit disante démocratie aux yeux d'un peuple endormi
Les droits de l'homme franchement où ils sont passés
Faut faire en somme que ça change et que des frères cessent
D'être chassés en charter c'est nos frères qui j'artère rapatriement
Et maintenant la haine coule dans nos artères
Nous faire taire franchement ça serait impossible quand on s'aperçoit
Que la plus part du temps c'est nous qu'ils prennent pour cible

La France est une garce et on s'est fait trahir
Le système voilà ce qui nous pousse à les haïr
La haine c'est ce qui rend nos propos vulgaires
On nique la France sous une tendance de musique populaire
On est d'accord et on se moque des répressions
On se fou de la république et de la liberté d'expression
Faudrait changer les lois et pouvoir voir
Bientôt à l'Élysée des arabes et des noirs au pouvoir

Faut que ça pète! Tu sais que le système nous marche dessus
Nous on baisse pas la tête on est pas prêt de s'avouer vaincus
Des frères béton tous victime de trahison
T'façon si y aurait pas de balance y aurait personne en prison
La délinquance augmente même les plus jeunes s'y mettent
Pèttent des bus parlent de braquage et à l'école ils raquettent
Des rondes de flics toujours là pour nous pourrir la vie
Attendent de te serrer tout seul et de font voir du pays
Emeut qui explose ça commence par interpellation
Suivie de coups de bâtons et ça se finit par incarcération
T'façon on se démerde, mec ici on survie
Fume des substances nocives pour apeser les ennuis
La galère n'arrange rien au contraire elle empire les choses
Si certains prennent des doses c'est pour penser à autre chose
Les frères sont armés jusqu'aux dents, tous prêts à faire la guerre
Ça va du gun jusu'au fusil à pompe, pit bull et rotweiller
À quoi ça mène, embrouille de cité, on se tape dessus
Mais tu te mets à chialer lorsque ton pote se fait tirer dessus
Encore un bico ou un négro, les babylons sont fiers
Ça les arrangent ce coup là y aura pas besoin de bavure policière
Frère je lance un appel, on est là pour tous niquer
Leur laisser des traces et des séquelles avant de crever

La France aux Français, tant que j'y serais ce sera impossible
Par mesure du possible je viens cracher des faits inadmissibles
À vrai dire les zincs en perdent le sourire
Obliger de courir certains on eu le malheur de mourir
Des homicides volontaires j'ai une pensé pour leurs mères
Blessés par un décès, bavures classées en simple faits divers
Contrôle qui part en couilles, des potes s'font serrer par les keufs
J'ai le saïme lorsque je jette des pavés sur les J9
Mes potes je les aiment c'est pour ça que je les laisserais jamais béton
Même si il y en a qui béton, tu sais on est tous des jeunes du béton
À présent y a plus de bluffe on vient dire toute la vérité
Faut leur en faire baver v'la la seule chose qu'ils ont mérités
Ma parole les gars si il y en a un qui se la joue véner
Si y veut s'la raconter j'vais lui baiser sa mère
T'façon j'ai plus rien à perdre, j'aimerais les faire pendre
Non c'est pas parce qui porte un flingue qui peut penser mettre à l'amende
La vérité est masquée, à savoir ce qui s'est passé
Le mystère des G.A.V. un blème qui ne pourra être démasqué
Je dédis ce texte à toute mes gardes à vue
Ils m'en on fait baver les enculés mais ils ont pas tout vu",La France (Itineraire d'une Polemique),2006

Turn the dark cloud inside out

""Help a nation in distress.""

Honour bade us do no less,

To a tyrant's yoke should bend,
And a noble heart must answer
To the sacred call of ""Friend.""

And when you're not looking they change masks
Somewhere over the rainbow it's the same
Instead of needle infested train tracks
No matter how fast you run from the eye you hate
There is no escape (There is no escape)
So I wait for the heaven that I seek
Which makes everything insignificant differences
Innocence intendance the vision amongst religion
Visioning innovative criticisms are the state of mind we're living
Time is ticking
If you listen to the sign that wisdom efficiantly spreads
Sing a song that officially deadens the mission
They cling on the friction
I stand stiff in this position
Plans shift
Cause to me your man is in an issue of your ego tissue
Explicit to the point of non-existence
And life in the past is your only interest
I used to build forts in the backyard to hide from the daytime
Missing all the beauty of the sunshine
It's my fault
But I blame the world to a small degree
I've never seen the sky cause I been too scared it would fall on me
So what? You're mad cause I don't want to talk?
But you'd be even more pissed off if I told you what i really thought
So just walk away (just walk away)
You're better off never caring what I say (never caring what I say)

I been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces
I don't miss none of them and they don't miss me
Fell in love with sensation
Now I'm high on mental piation
But that's the price you pay if you want to live free
Kill my dedication
Put me on your medication
Drop me off in space and never come to get me
Nothing that I say has ever been that amazing
So when I die do me a favor and forget me (Forget me)
(Forget me)
(Forget me)
(Forget me)
(Forget me)
(Forget me)
(Forget me)

Well
Something in the air make me not want to care
Let 'em stare until I'm riding on an empty spare
Follow the vein straight
As it drapes across the landscape and the sand and the lake
Off the beaten path
Learn the secret math
Keeping the laugh, smug
Too deep in the back of luck
Happy as fuck
But nobody's convinced
Play daddy to the love and try to drop a couple hints
Ever since I came to learn all the right turns
I was cursed with the cigarette burns and the lost words
Found inspiration inside your misery
Always trying to take an inch
More than what they're giving me
Dear God
Let me die on the rich people's lawns
Because I'm not so sure they're gonna learn my songs
Every morning he repeats that same shit
Spends the day trying to be famous
Well another day, shot
And I'm thinking this aquarium is deeper than the last one
My castle was never made of sand
It's one big aluminum can
The chateau of the damned
The shadow of the man you pretend you are
Had a rough thought that got caught and went too far
If I did have a car I'd go broke from the gas
On the shoulder of the road
As you roll past

I been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces
I don't miss none of them and they don't miss me
Fell in love with sensation
Now I'm high on mental piation
But that's the price you pay if you want to live free

Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

And Friday rolls around

We pray some, and sin some

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?

I never mind the rain from the skies

That's how I am, so what can I do?

Oliver Jackson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

Of all the hopes and dreams I could've prayed for
Here you are

If I could have one dance forever
I would take you by the hand
Tonight it's you and I together
I'm so glad I'm your man

And if I lived a thousand years
You know I never could explain
The way I lost my heart to you that day

Then the world would never know

And did I tell you that I love you tonight?

Never tell me dreams come true

With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,

I could live without love
Now I must admit,

Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

As I walk let me walk close to Thee

If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who but Thee my burden shares?
None but Thee, oh Lord, none but Thee.

I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Oliver Jones,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2007

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

How long has this been goin' on?

Finding another world

What a break, for heaven's sake

And I thought about you

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There was music I was listening
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing 
This serenade made for remembering
 
A small cafe, Mam'selle
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing

But when grandma danced to it

Oliver Reed,"He seems to be completely unreceptive
The tests I gave him show no sense at all
His eyes react to light the dials detect it
He hears but cannot answer to your call

See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me

There is no chance no untried operation
All hope lies with him and none with me
Imagine though the shock from isolation
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see

See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me

His eyes can see
His ears can hear his lips speak
All the time the needles flick and rock
No machine can give the kind of stimulation
Needed to remove his inner block

Go to the mirror boy!
Go to the mirror boy!

I often wonder what he is feeling
Has he ever heard a word I've said?
Look at him in the mirror dreaming
What is happening in his head?

Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet!

Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinions
From you, I get the story

What is happening in his head
Ooooh I wish I knew, I wish I knew",Go to the Mirror,1982
Oliver Rohrbeck,"Am anderen Ende dieser Leitung hört sie auf
Die Welt und mit ihr alles was wir kannten

Und dass du das nicht kannst, dass ist auch gut so
Weil's große Fragen gibt
Wie viel Leben passt hier eigentlich rein?
Mehr als irgendwer erwartet hat
Und wenn du's selber sehen könntest, du würdest es nicht glauben
Du denkst und träumst, das Leben ist ja so winzig, dass es unter der Tür durchpasst
Und endlich mal nach draußen kommt
Alles besser als das, was war, wir werden sehen
Hier ist es ätzend kalt und viel zu hell für jemanden der so ungern in den Spiegel schaut!
 
Am anderen Ende dieser Leitung fängt er an

Man will Verständnis, denn man tut halt was man kann

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2006

When I feel the sensation
It's not a one night temptation
With an imprint of your love 
That will linger for all times

Now your touching secret places
No ones touched before 
And I want to feel you deep inside 
Forever mi amour

Baby when 2 souls touch (when our souls touch)
There's no way that you can escape from the rush (the rush)
I'm under your power just like a flower (I'm ready baby)
Who's ready to open up
When 2 souls touch

ooohhhhhhhh
haaaaaaaaa

For your love that i'm living
All the joy that your giving
The new light in my life
Prayed for you so many nights
There's no words to express it
So i'd rather not dress it
Like the shadows on the wall
Speak they eliquence of love

Now your touching secret places
No ones touched before 
And I want to feel you deep inside 
Forever mi amour

Baby when 2 souls touch (Baby...The way you touch me yea)
There's no way that you can escape from the rush (No way there's no way boo)
I'm under your power just like a flower (Under your power)
Who's ready to open up
When 2 souls touch

Loving you constantly
Seems to be all i need 
My only thought 
My one desire
When your loves deep inside
Feels so good i could cry
Tears of joy 
Like raindrops from the sky
From my eyes",When 2 Souls Touch,2001

It's high as the mountain top
Petey gonna give you the Martin Luther dream
And I mean it
Fine as you is
You the type of girl that makes a man want to have some kids
When I was locked up doing that six years bid
Never think I'ma see the world again
You were right there
Me and you with all it is
Can't wait to get a crib so I can move you in
Your homie, your lover, your friend
You held it down for your man
Your friends can't tell you shit
You ain't seen it, I ain't did it
That's when a brother knew it's time to quit
When he finds something he loves
Stronger than this

For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy

While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit

Olivia,"We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

You called me angel eyes
Child of the morning
You and I will soon be together

To find
That you look
Just as I left you.

All, I've done 
Is wasted,
I don't know where to run.

It's, too indescribable
I've got to think it over
When you kiss me like that.
Too indescribable
I've got a sinking feeling,
I don't like where this is at.

I take, my time.
Time is all
I've got left on my hand

Start, to fall
You've wasted 
Your sweetness on my heart.

It's too indescribable
I've got to think it over
When you kiss me like that.

The feeling I get
Close the door, make no noise, keep it a secret

And lock love away in some safe place
Where you won't lose love and keep love
Each day untouched, so warm and near
Where love will stay, so pure and clear

The evenings pass and I wonder
Where you are sleeping tonight
Are you awake running through memories
Remembering how good it felt when love took hold
Our future plans that won't unfold

Now days are long
Just patches of time thrown together like clouds
Of empty hours blinded by pictures of places we knew
And now in space I stare
Without your soul and voice to share

It all seems lost
Left are just words but without much to say

You have to trust and let love go its way

It's early in the morning
Today I'm moving away
Sittin' here for the last time
Makes me feel so strange

My life here has ended
Like a pulled up weed
Don't play no sad songs
They'll make me cry

This situation reminds me
Of when I went away to school
My friends they all called me
And said I've been made a fool

My boyfriend he left me
For my best friend
Ahh don't play no sad songs
They'll make me cry

'Cause sad songs are tearin' up my heart again
Loneliness is standing in my path again
I can feel it comin'
I can hear it callin' out my name

I don't wanna remember
What I'm leavin' behind
The radio plays a sad song
And brings it on

Loneliness surrounds me
Like clouds bring rain
Ahh don't play no sad songs
They'll make me cry

I can hear it callin' out my name

Olivia Newton-John,"In the corner of the bar there stands a jukebox 
With the best of country music, old and new 
You can hear your five selections for a quarter 
And somebody else's songs when your's are through

I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter 
And my friends around to help me ease the pain 
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song 
And here I am just missing you again 

Please, Mister, please, don't play be-17
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over 
Please, Mister, please, if you know what I mean 
I don't ever wanna hear that song again 

If I had a dime for every time I held you 
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me 
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville 
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee 

But I guess I'd better get myself together 
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind 
Just a note that said ""I'm sorry"" by your picture 
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind 

Please, Mister, please, don't play be-17 
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over 
Please, Mister, please, if you know what I mean 
I don't ever wanna hear that song again

Olivia Newton-John,"Never thought it would be so rough
And I wonder if I have enough
To keep from breaking down
No mercy in this town

Every day is just another test
Seems I'm always second best
But you learn along the way
That's the price you have to pay

I try to stay defiant
Be tough and self-reliant
Though I get tired to the bone

Love is just a wish you keep inside
How's it gonna help me to survive
Looks like I'm in this fight alone

And I'm living in desperate times
Being alive's my only crime
Don't care what I have to do
I'll find some way to make it through

Oh, and I'm living in desperate times
And it's too late to change my mind
Till these desperate times are done
Gonna run, watch me run

Innocents get taken in
By the promise of an easy win
They start off so naive
So eager to believe

But the glitter of the city lights
Only covers up a lonely night
Of strangers slamming doors
You're hungry and ignored

I've faced the competition
I've made the hard decisions
Will it be worth it in the end?

Taking any chance that comes along
Getting hard to tell what's right or wrong
I only wish I had a friend

And I'm livin' in desperate times
Being alive's my only crime
Don't care what I have to do
I'll find some way to make it through

Oh, and I'm livin' in desperate times
And it's too late to change my mind
Till these desperate times are done

Have you seen them
Playing car games
Revving up your heart
Before the lights change
Have you been there
And not been aware
That you are the victim
Of a highway love affair

through your window
There's a stranger
Cruising right beside you
Courting danger
When your eyes meet
For one second you believe
You're another victim
Of a highway love affair

Car games--faces with no names
Freeway lovers lanes
Car games--silent rendezvous
For a mile or two
Playing car games

Every morning there's another
Chance to fuel the fantasy all over
Are we cheating
If it's only in our minds
Have you been a victim
Of a highway love affair

Just because it's now all up to me

To make some plans
Oh--I know it hurts
With our roles reversed

Yes I know it's hard to mind the kids

I know you hate it when I start to fuss
Here's the letter for your teacher

Five minutes in the microwave
Don't wait for me this evening
I'm probably working late

Your dad is coming over
With his new lover
And I don't wanna be around
So I'm gonna do some shopping
I'll buy you those stockings
I'll be back in half an hour

There'd be a confrontation
I know how much it breaks your heart

To make a brand new start

But we're gonna have a happy ending--you and me

We'll spend the weekend playing
I hope it won't be raining
When we go to the game with Dan
I know you think he's boring
But this time don't ignore him
Won't you give him half a chance
No he's not as fun as dad
But there's good as well as bad
In hanging on to yesterday
I'm not trying to replace him
Guess I'm really trying to say

And we've both been takin' the fall

[Chorus]
But tomorrow
We'll run a little bit faster
Tomorrow
We're gonna find what we're after at last
Feelings that we left in the past
There's romance in the sunset
We're boats against the current to the end

Maybe we're older
And maybe we're colder
So we disregard solutions
While we cling to our illusions once again
And we keep remembering when
Seasons are changing
Oh my reasons are changing
But the story isn't ending
So we find ourselves pretending one more day
And the years keep slipping away

Where I've never been before

Seem to linger in my mind like the fragments of a dream
That was once a part of you and remains a part of me

Have just changed the world we knew, if they'd only turned out right
But now I'm a little wise
I can even raise a laugh

At the funny face you pulled on a faded photograph
New days replace yesterdays in time
It's well to bear in mind
That new ways erase

Nothing stays the same
And now you've even changed your name
Forever I'll remember as I pass by on the train
Streets of paradise we loved

Now so few of them remain
Guess it's finally goodbye

And ate the wild fruit there
Fell asleep until the moonlight woke me

Out of all the idle scheming
Can't we have something to feel?

Once upon a time leaves me empty
Tomorrow never came

Out of all the good you gave
If a rumor should delay you

I give you stars and sunshine
A rainbow at your feet each time you rise
So dry your eyes
The house of yesterday is crumblin' at my feet
But I don't mind, I had my time

I am but yesterday
And you my child, tomorrow
There's nothing I can give you
For you have more than me
You are the truth within your youth

I watch you dance and playing
The little prince of all that you survey
Each night, each day
I am the good old days,
And you my child, tomorrow

If I have any future
It is within your eyes
Each time you smile
My child, my child
The hand of life will rock you
I brought you forth
And then my task was through
I give to you
This wondrous view

I am but yesterday
And you my child, tomorrow
And you my child, tomorrow
And you my child, tomorrow

You mustn't be afraid to face another day

Remember the man who asked you if you would be his wife",Mary Skeffington,1994

If you come around, and I know you will,
Don't expect to find me teary eyed
Time has surely told us we were never right
Baby, you were ready, so was I

Don't worry...
Don't worry, baby...
If the sun should never shine again
And the skies were never blue
Maybe then I'd feel I've lost a friend
Maybe then I'll think of you

If the birds could never sing again
And the world held nothing new
Maybe then I'd feel I've lost a friend
Maybe then I'll think of you

When we were together, we were so alone
Conversations had gone out of style
Though I felt a sadness when you said goodbye
I've heard the word before and I'll survive

Don't worry...
Don't worry, baby...
If the sun should never shine again
And the skies were never blue
Maybe then I'd feel I've lost a friend
Maybe then I'll think of you

If the birds could never sing again

Olivia Newton-John,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me

The sadness creeps into my song

For far too long I've had nothing new to show to you
Goodbye dry eyes
I watched your plane fade off west of the moon
And it felt so strange to walk away alone

No regrets
No tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry again
Say goodbye again

The hours that were yours
Echo like empty rooms
The thoughts we used to share
I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you
Not thinking you were gone
It felt so strange to lie awake alone

No regrets
No tears goodbye
Don't want you back

To turn my nights into day
Strange faces in your place

With the best of country music, old and new
You can hear your five selections for a quarter
And somebody else's songs when yours are through

I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter
And my friends around to help me ease the pain
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song
And here I am just missing you again

Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again

If I had a dime for every time I held you
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee

But I guess I'd better get myself together
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind
Just a note that said ""I'm sorry"" by your picture
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind

Things have changed
All that's left are the memories of two
Two who loved and dreamed where
The trees seem to whisper your name
But I don't like to go there
'Cause Rosewater no longer feels the same
Through the glass
The sun shows the knocks on the wall
seasons pass and you know how it looks in the fall
Here at my Rosewater,the glass is a deeper green
And a calm surrounds her
when love was here,the warmest place I've ever been
As I walk the echo of empty,I hear
And I feel that this house is not home
And now we're not here,It's lonely
The stairs seem to beckon me to stay
But dreams are better treasured
Than slowly eaten away
Christmas time,when snow filled your garden with while
Then the moon's cold patterns on windows at night
Now you'll make a new home
With people as hopefull as we
Over their dreams and their secrets
But don't ever,please don't ever

Could be no other love but ours

I grew to love you more, each passing day
Before too long I'd built my world around you
And I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay

[Chorus:]
If you love me, let me know, if you don't, then let me go
I can't take another minute of the day without you in it
If you love me, let it be, if you don't, then set me free
Take the chains away that keep me loving you
The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says, ""Hello, it's good to see you""
Anytime I turn around to find you there
It's this and so much more that makes me love you
What else can I do to make you see
You know you have whatever's mine to give you
But a love affair for one can never be

A little more than I should

I love you
I honestly love you

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid
This is pure and simple
And you should realize
That it's coming from my heart and not my head

I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all
But this feeling doesn't come along everyday
And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you've got the chance to say

If we both were born
In another place and time
This moment might be ending in a kiss
But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine

Love can't be love
If it's just for the moment
Only to pass the night away
As we both get nearer
Deeper love is so much clearer
Long as we do it face to face

And I have known
All the lost lonely people
My world has found a place in your smile
If you're searching
For a different love than mine
You'll never stop me loving you

More of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
No letting go, but let each other know
If we never try
Then we never lie face to face

You make a man
Like a child with your power
Help me to find my way inside
Let me drink your potion
Let me drown in your emotion
Lover to lover, face to face

In time we learn
From the lost lonely people
That love can last as long as time
There was never born another one for me
And you'll never stop me loving you

More of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
No letting go, but let each other know
If we never try
Then we never lie face to face

I'll be with you when the world is lies
And the music dies
Just as long as I know there will be

More of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
No letting go, but let each other know
If we never try
Then we never lie face to face

I'll be with you when the world is lies
And the music dies
Just as long as I know there will be
More of your love
More of the warmer ride...

With the best of country music, old and new
You can hear your five selections for a quarter
And somebody else's songs when your's are through

And my friends around to help me ease the pain
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song
And here I am, just missing you again

Please, mister, please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song but it's over
Please, mister, please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again

If I had a dime for every time I held you
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee

But I guess I'd better get myself together
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind
Just a note that said, ""I'm sorry"", by your picture
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind

What child is this, who laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come peasant king to own Him,
The King of Kings, salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
Raise, raise the song on high,
The Virgin sings her lullaby:

Doing what's the other thing
To anything their mothers say

In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows
Ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking, talking

You talk on the talk shows, I stare at the tv

I'm taking this chance today, to let you know

Of all the lovers I've ever known, you stand alone

When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her","I Hate U, I Love U [Robin Schulz Remix]",2017

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses

Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

que l'on se disait tout cela,
Tous les matins et les midis
et toute la semaine aussi.

C'est ridicule mais c'est comme ça,
si l'on recule on voit tout ça.
On voit s'éteindre dans le ciel,
les étoiles et les arc-en-ciels.

She looks like a fire dog and I love it !

I have a tear of poison under my tongue
Flowing under my lashes, on my cheek
It burns like an acid made with my jealousy

Forgive our foolish ways! 
Re-clothe us in our rightful mind, 
In purer lives thy service find, 
In deeper reverence praise. 

In simple trust like theirs who heard, 
Beside the Syrian sea, 
The gracious calling of the Lord, 
Let us, like them, without a word 
Rise up and follow thee. 

O Sabbath rest by Galilee! 
O calm of hills above, 
Where Jesus knelt to share with thee 
The silence of eternity, 
Interpreted by love! 

Drop thy still dews of quietness, 
Till all our strivings cease, 
Take from our souls the strain and stress, 
And let our ordered lives confess 
The beauty of thy peace. 

Breathe through the heats of our desire 
Thy coolness and thy balm, 
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire,

Even one that never was to be

I've been staring at a photograph
From when I thought
You'd always be my better half

Standing so far from you now
Would you ever come around and

Say what you used to say to me
When I could still believe it
Be like we used to be
When I thought that you could mean it
Because no one else
Can fill up the space you left
And there's only empty promises

I think about the plans we never made
I was sure that the hurt would finally fade
But I guess I never let you go

Could we repair it somehow?

When I could still believe it
Be like we used to be
When I thought that you could mean it
Because no one else
Can fill up the space you left
And there's only empty promises

And the days are far away
Like pictures starting to fade
While we're living our own lives

And I still wish you were here

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
