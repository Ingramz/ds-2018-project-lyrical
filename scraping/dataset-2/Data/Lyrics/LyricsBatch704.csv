MC Versatile,"I feel you moving close closer to me now 
Now that I am free now I'm not in need 
Where we were before where we were before 
I was not content your messing with my head 
So why should I let you back in? 

Tellin' me that its all cool 
But I wont be a fool for you 
No more no more 
Tellin' me that we're alright askin' 
Why I said goodbye that was kind of obvious 
Its kind of obvious 

[Chorus: x2]
Tell me what it is tell me what it is 
That's got me down like this what is it you do? 
I'm losing all control 
I'm weak when I am not by you 

I feel yourself work again 
But I don't wanna be let back in why you makin' this so heard 
I feel like I'm out in his head 
And it hurts so bad that your well aware but I am so helpless 
I'm helpless for your love 

[Chorus: x2] 

I love you, I need you, I want you, I miss you 
I cant live without you oh baby I feel you 
U mean the world to me but what do I mean to you 'cause 
When I'm all alone all I want is you 
'cause you know your my lady lady but you drive me crazy crazy 
I wanna kiss you I wanna held you but will you b my baby baby 
I'm yours and your mine so baby go ease your mind 
Just take the time to un-wind 
'cause true love is so hard to find

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

A rainy night in Georgia

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

And I said fine but I never asked her why
And since then loneliness has been a friend of mine

I let her slip away

She had the nicest legs I'd ever seen.
Back then she wrote me letters, just to say she'd loved me,
But now her face is just a memory

Now that seven years have gone
I've grown up but she's moved on,
Somehow I'm still holding on to her.

I still got so many unsaid things I want to say,
And I just can't wait another day,
I wish she knew.
I still wait up wondering if she will remember me,
But there's no way for me to know.

Now she's got pregnant with her bay-hay-hay-bee
It feels like she's slipping away from me.

When it gets dark I'll hold your body next to mine,
Then we'll find some wood and hell we'll build a fire,
And then we'll find some rope and make a string guitar.

Captivated by the way you look tonight
the light is dancing in your eyes
Your sweet eyes
Times like these we'll never forget
Staying out to watch the sunset
I'm glad I shared this with you
You set me free
Showed me how good my life could be
How did you happen to me
Yeahhh aww

And then I'll swing you girl until you fall asleep
And when you wake up you'll be lying next to me
We'll go to Hollywood make you a movie star
I want the the world to know how beautiful you are

I've played the silver ball. 
From Soho down to Brighton 
I must have played them all. 
But I ain't seen nothing like him 
In any amusement hall

Sure plays a mean pin ball!

Becomes part of the machine. 
Feeling all the bumpers 
Always playing clean. 
He plays by intuition, 
The digit counters fall.

Sure plays a mean pin ball! 

He's a pin ball wizard 
There has got to be a twist. 
A pin ball wizard, 
S'got such a supple wrist. 

'How do you think he does it? I don't know! 
What makes him so good?' 

He ain't got no distractions 
Can't hear those buzzers and bells, 
Don't see lights a flashin' 
Plays by sense of smell. 
Always has a replay, 
'n' never tilts at all

The Bally table king. 
But I just handed 
My pin ball crown to him.

And he just does the rest.

'cause living without, without, without you in my life, 
And you wrote the book on how to be a liar,
And lose all your friends, 
Did I mean nothing at all? 
Was I just another ghost that's been in your bed?

McFly,"Kicking off is the hardest part
Nothing's certain at the start
Letting go,
So something can begin

Figure out how to get a life
leave tomorrow, live tonight
Gotta throw
throw your heart right in

'Cause we all fall down

Everybody knows the end
When the curtain hits the floor
Everybody knows the end
Don't wanna get there wishing that you'd given more
It's not over
Till it's over
So how do we begin?
When everybody knows the end

I need to live with nothing fixed
Don't tell me what's gonna happen next
I'm all right
I like the way this feels

Leave behind all the things I'll miss
The next stop isn't where you think it is
'Cause tonight
I'm riding off the rails

'Cause we all fall down

Everybody knows the end
When the curtain hits the floor
Everybody knows the end
Don't wanna get there wishing that you'd given more
It's not over
Till it's over
So how do we begin?
When everybody knows

The end is where you hope you never say
'I could've done it better
I'm gonna keep what counts
and throw away
what doesn't really matter
And I wanna die (and I wanna die)
On the highest high (on the highest high)

It's not over (it's not over)
Till it's over
I wanna stay here forever

'Cause we all fall down

Everybody knows the end
When the curtain hits the floor
Everybody knows the end
Don't wanna get there wishing that you'd given more
It's not over
Till it's over
So how do we begin?
When everybody knows the end

McFly,"I never thought she'd remember
The way that I left her heart
Didn't know I had it all
Til the moment I lost it all
People mind mistakes and fall
And she won't ever recover

I couldn't get over
And I can never move on
And I'm trying to recall
From the day I made her fall
She was broken on the floor
I made her shattered

Foolish for me to think she wouldn't leave by December
Foolish to let misery let it fall apart in autumn
Driving on a one way street, no u-turn to get back to me
Running close to empty but I'll, I'll never say goodbye
(I'll never say, I'll never say, I'll never say)

And now I'm running in circles
Feels like I'm losing my mind
And I'm trying to get off
Anywhere before she's gone
Going down the lonely road
Hoping to see her again

Cos I keep seeing reflections
Flashes in every mirror
Kissing her when I'm alone
Making love until the dawn
Now that every night I know
Can't live without her

Foolish for me to think she wouldn't leave by December
Foolish to let misery let it fall apart in autumn
Driving on a one way street, no u-turn to get back to me
Running close to empty but I'll, I'll never say goodbye

Foolish for me to think she wouldn't leave by December
Foolish to let misery let it fall apart in autumn
Driving on a one way street, no u-turn to get back to me

McFly,"I've been searching for some
Love and affection but there's nobody giving me that kind of attention
I'm alone
Oh, I'm alone

Can't help thinking that there's
Somebody missing who should
Hold me and please me 'til I'm
Tired of her kissing
I'm alone
Oh, I'm alone

But when it gets to midnight
I'm in my bed alone
You're all I want
You're all I need
It's cold in the night
But I'm looking for the heat

Baby I, I need a woman
Not any woman
But a woman who needs me too
So how about you?

Songs on the radio are
Just carbon copies of the
Way that I'm feeling after
Five cups of coffee
I'm alone
Oh, I'm alone

But when it gets to sunrise
I'm waking up alone
You're all I want
You're all I need

But a woman who needs me too

Holding a book about compatible signs
I should have talked to her
I should have tried

I got excited, I lost my mind
I lost the number that read ""Let's have a good time"", so

If you see Kate
Tell her that I'm looking for her
Cause she's so fine
That girls been on my mind, ooh

I saw her friend that was in line that day
And had to tell her how I felt about Kate
She said ""could've read your mind or stand in line,
I've seen her do this to men a thousand times""
She had a rep for spreadin all her love around
And everywhere she went Kate drew a crowd
""Don't bother me, that's what I said
Cause I can't seem to get that girl out of my head""

Whisper in my ear you broaden my horizons
Stay with me, let's make it the longest day
Pour yourself into my mouth

Gruff stunnin', just like Hev I keep it comin'
keep the Gin pumpin', freaks I'm slam dunkin'
twistin' 'em, whippin' 'em, pourin' Criss on 'em
the more I spit at 'em the more it gets to them
position 'em, explore and fish in 'em
keep them rainhats like I'm goin' fishin'n
go deep, man I ain't no lil' Bo peep
sex so sweet, lick you neck to yo' feet
we can go eat, scoop you in the Range Rov. jeep
creep to the Marriot get a lil' suite

it'll have a nigga trickin' his cash the whole week. 

Chorus - 

Verse 1:
Gruffy, girl you know you want to rush me
cuss me, talkin' 'bout I ain't see you since you fucked me
I don't want to argue, I want to puff and sip Bubbly
don't be mad at me 'cause these other chicks love me
now I'm ugly? what's the matter you don't trust me?
what you mean you beeped me? I ain't get that
don't sweat that, respect that
Gruff put them Diamonds where your neck at
picked you up in Lefrak just so I can sex that
talk to you Dirty Baby, kiss you where your breasts at
can you dig that? that new attitude you need to quit that
I ain't wit' that, you ain't the way you was when I hit that
did that, girls just be givin' up the Kit-Kat

All the Ladies want to know is where Gruff at?
they Love that smooth Harlem World thug cat

dough to invest, Pressy Rol's with baguettes
the whole mess, from here where we go next?
what a nigga wouldn't do for yo' sex?
Harlem Diplomat, crime hound nigga stickin' that
twistin' that, never lickin' that and that's that

I bust shots until the heat gets heavy.
Fuck bitches until the sheets get sweaty.
Beats and melodies, will make me blink.
I'll pull my shank out, and give a warrior's cry.
If you ain't down wit' my crew, all you die.

Some want to have emotions and kill me.
Put the toast to my kidney, when I speak most of them feel me.
So, keep my name off ya breath.

And tell P.H. that the camera job, come on, that's a waste of mine.

Work the spring court, you know for me, that just scary.
How Harlem nigga do, get in the building, bitch, hurry,
Before my girl see, back to top, so she can give me one on jury.
Says hung, got her sprung, she felt that I'm young.
Her little toy boy, make her lick my ass wit a tongue.
She's so smart, she's dumb, but I keep; tomorrow ain't promised.
Now I might need a one way flight to St. Thomas,
And at the same time I got a JAG fetish,
And who knows, I might have bad credit.
I can't borrow from niggas I ass betted.
Go to your girl, I pop my truck faster.
Don't make me Flex on you, ghetto style, like Funkmaster.

I like your smell, sweet perfume from Chanel
What's your name miss? You got the mother dane's pissed
All up in your grill, is if you was famous
She said her name's Armani, half black, half Italiani
Nails all done, sportin Muskina on her body
She 5'3"", straight out the NYC
Tellin me, this other cute girl's Gruff, gon make you try me
Now check me, listen up, first of all, you're sexy
And not like them gold diggin chickens try to peck me
I see through them hoes, they can't get no new clothes
Askin for blue Parasukos, expensive shoe stores
Just for 'cause I'm young and hold figgas
Gold diggas try to gas me, they better gas them other niggas
'cause I ain't give them a cent, picture Gruff money bein spent

Don't start flaggin, whites and Arabs ain't right
Hop in the 6 double 0, don't front, let's go
I'm mad tow up, you know, off the bubble and 'dro
Yo you drive, I'mma play the passenger side
Kinda tired, don't want me and no car to collide

[Chorus to fade]",What You Want,1998
McGruff,"Verse 1:
I was born a poor black kid, Pops doin' a bid
ran down tenement, barely no food in the fridge
My Moms dukes had to raise my on her own
all alone, never had a Father home
I remember clear as day seein' my Mother pray
hopin' I don't be like my Pops and go the other way
but you get tired of your pockets bein' empty
gear skimpy, yo the peer pressure tempt me
at Thirteen had to get my by all means
sellin' to fiends, Pops up State raisin' Hell in the Greens
fuck that, I'm'a hustle, I can't see my Momma struggle
in these Harlem streets drama loves you.

Chorus - Some niggas may have, some niggas may not have, but God bless
the child who holds his own, who holds his own. 

Verse 2:
Never was a stray A student
always played hookie, gettin' buddhad
dropped out of High school, the streets raised me
runnin' 'round holdin' heat crazy
My Pops played me, left when I was a Baby
perhaps he hate me, why the Mothafucka make me?
why the Hell is life like this? Trife like this?
sometimes I want to slice my wrist
found out I had a gift and thought twice 'bout shit
now I'm changin', whole like re-arrangin'
left the crack game'n for the rap game'n
ain't exactly where I want to be but I ain't complainin'
maintainin', focus on my money and my fame'n
entertainin', risin' to the top since I came in
blazin', and I ain't goin' nowhere yo I'm remainin'

Chorus 

Verse 3:
Man, I miss them niggas who got clapped for tryin' to get them figures
everybody leavin' 
they say thugs go to Hell when we stop breathin', and I believe 'em
and I ain't tryin' to be there, I got mouths to feed
love my seeds, look just like me
dress like me, gotta be the best like me
raise 'em up right so they won't be stressed like me
gotta be there for them, not no Penetentiary
think back, sippin' Remy, maybe Henessey
nigga ballin' now, gotta say one love to Heavy-D

McKenna Medley,"You watched your hand hold the pen
And write the note, but it wasn't you
And every single word was wrong
But every word you wrote you knew was true

And as you stepped into the night
You wondered how this ever got so damned confused
And again you cry in the darkness all alone
The bitter taste of the California goodbye

You watch the desert fall away to mountains
And to forest green and rivers blue
An you glance down at your watch and wonder
What he's thinking now that it's already noon

And then you think you'll chance the radio again
Though the last time every song just made you cry
Wo, wo, yes, it did
And as you touch the dial
Another tear falls for the California goodbye

There are dreams that we can keep
And there are stars that shine through space
Though it's cold and deep, dreams that we can keep
Oceans rise and fall and desert winds don't sleep

Tomorrow you'll be home again
A thousand memories down the road from yesterday
And if you're not too late
You might see, baby, brother pack his things and walk away

But somewhere deep inside
You know an aching heart can never run and hide
Ah, then you, you wanna die
As the sun sets fire to the desert sky
A curtain falls on the California goodbye, goodbye

McManus Gang,"Big nothing. 
He stood in the road outside of town 
With a broken clockwork toy in his hand. 
A graveyard for childish dreams in his palm 
A broken lifeline. 

Big nothing. 
The mechanical amusement sputtered to life in his fist. 
As he clenched, it whirred and died again. 
It was a cowboy who drew his gun, 
But the pistol was welded to the holster 
By age and careless children, 
So it struggled and strained 
And it unwound its own spring. 

Big nothing. 
He didn't need tattoos to show where he'd been 
And who he'd loved. 
It was the same thing that men had cried for; 
That women had dyed their hair for. 
The cellophane illusion of a starry sky 
Stretched over an open sore. 

Big nothing. 
He thought about his lost daughter 
The way her eyes would alight at the greedy circus barker's blackmail song 
How he wanted to smash her skull in when she parroted back, 
'Tell mommy; tell poppy; you need this little dolly.' 

Big nothing. 
Big nothing. 
The smoky voice of the petaled girl woke him long enough. 
There was too much light in the room, so he unscrewed the bulb. 
She took him to bed like an adopted dog. 

Big nothing. 
She lit sickly incense, as he tried to tell himself 
The resemblance were pure and coincidental. 
He unleashed his grip on the toy and all it meant to him, 
And it wound down forever. 

Big nothing. 
He woke up in a sweat, the next day. 
With her smile still painted on his mouth 
He walked out of a town called Big Nothing.

I dreamed last night No more cops
It felt alright No more cops
No need to fight No more cops

'Cause no one needs to steal
Everyone gets a meal
If it was only real
We'd need no more cops

I dreamed last night no police
An army-less world doomed to peace
And now as all my dreaming stops
I see it clear, we need no more cops

No need to fear
I'd want to cheer
And I wish you were here
Before my slumber stops

It seems to me
That if we're really free
We need no more cops

No Holy War No more God
No more rent No more deeds
No more money No more greed
No more hate No more fear

No one unhappy No one sad
No one ripped off No one mad
But I awake Here instead
I wish I had Stayed in bed

I'd stay asleep in the deep
And in my thoughts I'd keep
No more cops

When life gets mean
Share in the dream
Until you scream - no more cops
I dreamed late last night

No more cops
No more cops
No more cops






",No More Cops,1986
MDC,"I remember a funny man who used to make us laugh
But the proof of his truth, they cut his life in half
A caustic wit that cut a bit, opinions were too strong
He must have rubbed somebody wrong
Cause he's long time gone

I remember a crucial man, played strat' with his left hand
Tunes he chose of ""Gold and Roe"" and ""Castles Made of Sand""
Social ills, hi conscience willed a different type of song
Sang about ""lead"", click, bang! He's dead, he's long time gone

I remember an ebony prince who taught his brothers pride
Said the black man's loss, just another cross on which another prophet has died
Some people wanted them leaderless, a race of hungry pawns
Their solution to his revolution: To make him long time gone

Though some will object when you suspect
That they cause to affect the cause and effect
When you reflect on lives that were checked
Still in retrospect the truth was neglected
Though some will protect the order they pecked
For failing to suspect the cleansing effect
Till you they reject with a Haitian insect
With AIDS they infect by a bite on the neck
Like the Nazi correct, kill and dissect
""The inferior Sect"", their race to protect

I remember a gentleman who took his cause o far
Said not to be afraid but to parade and be just what you are
Defied the name of guilt and shame, he proved his skeptics wrong
Must have said something wrong, 'cause now he's long time gone",Long Time Gone,1993
MDC,"They say the darkest hour is just before the dawn
In chess, without exception, white moves the first pawn
They called it ""Black Tuesday"" when the stock market crashed
A fix in 1919 turned the White Sox to Black
Black balled, black magic, executioner's hood
White hatted, white horsed, champion of good
Black knight of Dark Ages on the darkest night
The Pope walks in truth, head to toe in white

[Chorus]
Who started all this bullshit - were they looking for a fight?
You didn't have to be there to know that they were white
But when you're talking skin tone, let's not fuck around
Cause no one's really black or white, we're all just shades of brown

Black hearted, black beard on the briney deep
Or the family outcast you call the black sheep
Days of black plague - draw your final breath
Heading for heaven white dying of Black Death

Mankind is preoccupied to keep each other down
Some use superstition, a Bible or a crown
At best it's fear and ignorance, at worst, it's a sin
Not God and country, king or crown, it's the pigment of our skin
Used to reinforce what's wrong or right
It's really just the presence or absence of light
In the blackest hour of the blackest day
It isn't mighty white of us, but we gotta say

[Chorus]

White when your marry, black when you die
A racial hierarchy, a festering white lie
White stands for ignorance, pure and sincere
But if you're talking bigotry it should be crystal clear
The new world beckoned, the immigrants came
Homogenized their culture, anglicized their names
Then they painted Jesus, blond with eyes of blue
Not a Nazarene, more a nazi than a Jew
In the black revolution with their Black Power found
Till their leaders were all jailed or stomped into the ground
And the final step ironic to nail that coffin tight
The powder of enslavement in their glassine bags of white",Shades of Brown,1993
MDC,"I remember when I first went to school
They said, Don't be a joker, don't be a fool
Pledge your allegiance to the red, white and blue
Don't expect your country to do nothin' for you
They said your forefathers loved you
but I only had one
And I watched him die in the heat of the sun
Suckin' up the bullets of a policeman's gun
There was nothin' I could do but stay away

In the U.S.A. you gotta take your chances
If you plan on stayin' free
They call this the land of the living 
But they're trying to make a dead man out of me

I remember when I first hit the road
I was runnin' from the lenders of the money I owed
Came to Austin, heard a knock at my door
Crossed another border and I'm runnin' some more
They say they're gonna get me but it ain't happened yet
Burnin' my fingers on my last cigarette
It's time to remember time to forget
Nothin' I could do but get away

I remember all the stories I heard
How a man's supposed to be 'bout as free as a bird
My brother's in prison, my father's dead
Me, I'm tired of living with a price on my head
I wonder if there's a place to be
In the whole wide country for a fella like me
Name's in the paper, face on T.V.
Nothin'I can do but get away ",I Remember,2001

Cause when we give it to you bitch we give you all that we've got
Now all it takes is one shot to put your ass in a ditch
But you gon' get the other 49 for bein' a bitch
Go to war with the big men when it makes no sense to
Repercussions get extreme when we ride against you
Ain't no movie, your baby mama, teachers and your kids

Don't get ya bitch gun, but nigga what you want, what?

Pull ya piece nigga, and watch ya rest it

These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas,
But scared to sing it.
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout
Or smokin' that joint 'bout.
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em
Or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain,
And leavin' stains on cerebellums.

Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke
When my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch
'Cause I fell in love with my chrome-plated woman.
I love my wood wheel Grant,
'84 Cadillacs that slant,
Slowed-down Screw tapes that knock,
Blowin' on Green private stock.
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks,
Try 20-ounce Angus beef.
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas,
'N got big-ass diamonds off in they teeth.

Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?

Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerilla pimpin' at its finest.
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us

Touched like Midas, these bitch-ass niggas they study and bite us.
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show,
And bitch niggas try to fight us.
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war

Nobody could've been sweeter
I was wrong, should have had the bombita
But, now she gone
I don't know where she go
Me, I'm frustated down so, and the other men miss her
I guess I surely know that, baby
Where did she gone? Where the rose bush rise up
Are you wicked than bandolero
Then a-better wise up
Or we go, ash to ash, and dust onto the dust
You just big up a chest and go loco

Vamos a tequila, senorita, bonita
I really need it now
Hay ya no tengo dinero, camarero
Say can we work it out

Smile up on the face
Make the next plan
Wiggle the bottom to attract the next man
Rude boys, beware
This one's a-come fe run the things
Swing them together
Like vendetta the gun things
She lick a shot, sa, to get
She take care of da freak
And you get the money
'Cause her punani popularity
Bum, bye-bye, she make a grown man cry
She just big up her chest and go loco

That was written long ago
'Bout a kingdom on a mountain
And the valley-folk below

On the mountain was a treasure
Buried deep beneath the stone
And the valley-people swore
They'd have it for their very own

Go ahead and hate your neighbor
Go ahead and cheat a friend
Do it in the name of heaven
You can justify it in the end
There won't be any trumpets blowing
Come the judgment day
On the bloody morning after
One tin soldier rides away

So the people of the valley
Sent a message up the hill
Asking for the buried treasure
Tons of gold for which they'd kill

It came an answer from the mountain
With our brothers we will share
All the secrets of our mountain
All the riches buried there

Go ahead and hate your neighbor
Go ahead and cheat a friend
Do it in the name of heaven
You can justify it in the end
There won't be any trumpets blowing
Come the judgment day
On the bloody morning after
One tin soldier rides away

Now the valley cried with anger
""Mount your horses! Draw your sword!""
And they killed the mountain-people
So they won their just reward

Now they stood beside the treasure
On the mountain, dark and red
Turned the stone and looked beneath it
""Peace on Earth"" was all it said

Come blow that horn, start celebrating
Right this way, your table's waiting

No use permitting some prophet of doom
To wipe every smile away
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret

I used to have girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared four sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hour

The day she died the neighbors came to snicker
Well that's what comes from too much pills and liquor
But when I saw her laid up like a queen
She was the happiest corps I've seen

And as for me, as for me
I made my mind up back in Chelsea
When I go I am going like Elsie

Stop by admitting from cradle to tomb
It's such a long, long smile
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret

What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret

Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the caba, come to the caba, I love a cabaret",Stepping Out,1999

Me First and the Gimme Gimmes,"Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends 
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation 
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

It wasn't two weeks after she got married that 
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce 
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order 
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta 
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan 
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas, they tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feelin' weak? Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know
Well the weeks went by and spring turned to summer 
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand 
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam 
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

And she says to wake her up when I am through

With cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid

 Some may be shallow and some may be deeper and
 deeper my brother
 Man sits with pan and scans the land for what he can
 Hopin' that he might strike gold
 Wading in the water, in search of the soul
 To find what you seek, the valleys and the peaks
 Open up your ears to the grooves and beats and be 
 complete
 Now the water's deep
 You see dancin' and rejoicin' now people make some noise
 and
 Dive into the water let it splash across your face
 Don't you stop the party and don't you lose your faith
 Keep it goin' on and movin' on son
 Converge upon your urge and be submerged 
 In the funk
 We all come to the river because the water brings
 growth
 Let the Lord provide it baby can you stroke
 The style in the south of the union:Good food and good
 jams is our communion
 Down at the river the soul is wet
 Take a dip and revive yourself
 Revival! Revival! Go into the...
 Get into the water boy we're havin' a revival
 If you don't learn to groove then tell me what is your 
 survival chances

 The fellowship is dope
 If the water is to shallow then gallows and ropes await
 me

 And see the reality of spirtuality
 Positive Individuality

 and seek and greet
 And walk the path of the rhythm we're with them

 wash the B.S. away
 To gain strength for another day
 To get into the river I figure the music must
 Play to make the crowd sway throw ho's and hey's and
 shake out booty's
 Our duty is to be here to stay
 Because people we are in it for survival
 So won't you come and join me at the river at the Revival
 I see little children eatin' watermelon and elderly storytellin' 
 ruffnecks scrappin' and yellin'
 Deacons and preachin' and Hip Hop beats and
 Funky aquaboogie we could be achieving groovy salvation

Admiration and respect, for there is nothing above
A mother's strength and a father's concern
There was guidance no matter which way I turned
Yo, pops, if I could be half the man you are, I'd be a star
Moms, thanks for pushin' me real far
As I proceed through the tundra and harsh winds
I think, reviewin' what you've instilled within
So I'm takin' time out to let you know
Once a boy, now a man; thanks for helpin' me grow

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru]
Goin' out to my peoples for all the times we've spent
Fifty deep up in the party, gettin' crazy, stupid bent
Around the block, puffin' lye, cruisin' in the car
Whatever we was doin', I won't forget it, Baby Pah
When I had no dough, you were there
You hooked me with some ends to show me that you cared
You stood by me through the ups and downs
While the other fakin' clowns tried to start hangin' around
See, you were always genuine
That's why respect is due, and I got you on my mind
A lot of people might not understand the way we click
We're rollin' thick, hittin' harder than a ton of bricks
With all the drama and the phony personas
I'd rather check my man, so we can share some knowledge
If the streets were college, some emcees would flunk out
Sendin' shouts to my peeps, crazy love no doubt

[Chorus]

[Guru]
A true friend, kid, is mad, mad rare
Trustin' others is a risk; a lot of things ain't fair
'Cause where I be at, a lot of strange things happen, Jack
You can know a kid for years, and still, he'll stab you in the back
But that's alright 'cause I'm a good judge of character
And me and my family - we maintain the balance to
Master the challenges of life
Like the chain and the star, we link up to shine mad bright
To all my boys way across the country
Dealin' with the struggle - the good, the bad, and the ugly
Yo, under pressure we're the best
No matter what the circumstance, no matter how much stress
Our force has the power to bring forth change
I'd rather see us succeed than feel shame or go insane
Dedicated to my fam that supported
You shall always, I said always, be applauded

[Chorus x 2]",For You,1995
Me'Shell Ndegéocello,"You enchant me so my bittersweet flower
Mystery of the sages come into my realm 
of imagination let me digest you

You enchant me so my bittersweet flower
Shall we make love feel the waves of the 
ocean come to rest in the eye of a storm

I cry myself to sleep over you
You come then you go
The more I fall the more you let go
The sweet taste of you stains my lips
Even through the pain it's only you I miss

Unlike those before I wanna free you
Let the sweetness of your kiss rush over me
I search so many lifetimes 
Let my soul rest in your arms
And I'll let you inside",Bittersweet,1996
Me'Shell Ndegéocello,"All I ever wanted was a nigger who would be true
All I wanted was a nigger man

All I ever wanted was a nigger who would be true, be good to me
While doin' the evil that niggers do
My view of self was that of a divine ho
Like the ones portrayed on the white man colonized minded rap shows
Oh the afro dizzy act of my blak rebel
I am a woman and to this world I accommodate myself
My place is in my blak man's defiance my nigger divine for his Sadness
So well complemented mine
When I look at you so blak and blue
My love for you sad but true

All I ever wanted was a nigger who would be true
All I wanted was a nigger man

One night on a love high we metamorphasized into gigantic blak butterflies
And for the first time I saw the god inside
I realized my nigger redefined was the blak man divine and he could take me higher
And the divine woman was what the blak man desired

But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat;
for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die
To them he said I will greatly multiply your pain and your
conception; in pain shall you bring forth children, and you shall be
dependent on your husband and he shall rule over you
Then god said, let us make man in our image

Let's go back to the time when the mind and soul were divine faith unquestioned
Mother father god said let us make man in our own image god
was not alone as no one should be I search for a righteous hand to rule over me

For you are a holy people to the Lord your god; The Lord your god
has chosen you to be a beloved people to himself, above all
people that are upon the face of the earth

The Lord shall bring a nation against you from afar, from the ends
of the earth, as swift as the eagle that flies; a nation whose
language you do not understand

Your sons and daughters shall be given to another people and
your eyes shall look on, and you shall grieve over them all the day
long and there shall be no might in your hand to do anything

The fruit of your labors shall a nation that you know not eat up and
you shall be wronged and oppressed always",Deuteronomy: Niggerman,1996

Where it rose that from thence it may rise again
Finding all things wearisome unsatisfied my

Wondering of that which is now that which has been and that which is to be
For my time on earth I pay dearly for the past
Confusion embraces my heart for to know

Free my mind of my worldly wants and desires

Would reap the benefits of her labor

To cook and to clean
For the man who broke her
And I love to watch her dance to the tunes on
The soul stations, yeah
Just to ease her mind

She was vindictive in her own fashion
So she passed down to me her traits

I'd never be

""did he feel so much pain
That it would make him wanna hurt another?""

But there was no excuse
There was no excuse to make up for the pain

That I too became a slave, to my heart

That I'd do anything

I never got the nerve
To ask my father ""why?""
But my mother
She would say,
She stayed for my brother and myself
But I would have sold my soul
Just to share in one day
Of my mother's desired happiness

When night fell
Sometimes when night fell
I'd close my eyes
And I'd hide
Close your eyes
When they would yell and scream
When my father would paint her
With a dark face
Of being belittled, disrespected
And set aside
His liquor, the salve
For the unseen wounds

I learned so much from him
What did I learn?
How to hurt all of those
Who try to get too close

Sometimes I get so,
Make me wanna holler
I just don't understand
Why?
Make me wanna holler
Tell me why
Mm, so sorry
So sorry for the pain
Make me wanna holler
So sorry

I'm so sorry
Just play for me
Play for me

He would close his heart and hide
She would close her eyes and cry

You're so beautiful
You flirt and tease enviously I wish you'd flirt with me

Come and I'll set you free into an endless valley of fruits both sweet and sour
And whatever displeases your palate my kisses will wash away

Stay. If you must dance, dance for me
Blessed are the pure at heart for they shall see god so close your eyes and dream

When we make love I cry
When you kiss me my lips they burn with fear
For even a love that crowns may crucify

In the cradle of creation between the hand of love I died and there you were
I was warmed amidst the gaze of your eyes, our minds wounded
by The need for understanding, our bodies betrayed by time

Do you hear me can you taste my pain for love has no other desire but to fulfill itself
But to deny yourself the pleasure of that pain is to love selfishly

I stood there
Your heart lay captive in a cage fashioned by your fears not knowing what to say
You have many lovers and yet I alone love you far beyond any lily white fairy tale

I would not exchange the sorrows of my heart for the joys of the multitude
And I would not have the tears that sadness makes to flow from my every part turn into laughter

The light is so blinding
Your followers condemn me your words used to enslave me

Jesus cured the blind man so that he could see the evils of the world
Perchance blindness is but a dark thought overcome by the light
Maybe Judas was the better man and Mary made a virgin just to save face
I too am so ashamed on bended knees 
Prayin' to my pretty white Jesus

Brother John Paul convinced himself of his wisdom to judge to forgive to condemn
Mother Mary full of grace I'm so confused by her pale white face

That intoxicants would be widely used

So you can see this happening in the Muslim world and
Just intensifying from quite time some ago

Another sign would be nakedness
That people would begin to remove their clothes
And he said until it would get to the point where
People would actually walk around in the marketplaces in shorts
With their thighs fully exposed

Um, he said also that people would have sexual intercourse
In front of other people, was a sign of the end of times
Another one would be speed in travel
He said great distances would be traversed in very short times
And he said people would hop between the clouds and the earth

And he said musical instruments would be everywhere
And he said that people would dance with instruments on their head
Which some have interpreted as headphones

Pies, para que los quiero si tengo alas pa' volar
Después de todas las horas vividas
Sin mas deseo que seguir, hasta encontrarse, lentamente
Con enorme inquietud
Pero con la certeza de que todo lo rige la sección de oro
Hay un acomodo celular, hay un movimiento
Hay luz, todos los centros son los mismos
La locura no existe
Somos los mismos que ya fuimos y seremos
Sin contar con el estúpido destino

Must have been a miracle
It's been a hell of ride
Destination still unknown, it's a fact of life

If you make one wrong move with the gun to your head
You dare to walk the line or you'll be left for dead

I'm a ticker on a bomb that you can't turn back

Let the end of the world come tumbling down
I'll be the last man standing on the ground
As long as I got blood rush trough my veins
I'm still alive

Lost in the night
Feeling so invisible
Oh, a dead man walking the wire
I have broke the devils net that's made of fire

And it's a long way down from the top of the world
You better look around or you gonna get burned

To keep the morning light from shinin'
The highest wall ain't tall enough
To keep the smallest man from climbin'

The more it pulls you in
The more you hang on for your life

By the water
Can you see me

Through empty quarters

I was there too
I should have told you

I'm the only boy awake now
Gazing at the stars
I dive into the blue and you, oh oh

I never had to walk like this before
I never had to hide away
I don't really want to talk like this no more

Meagan Moore,"I'm wishing on a star
And trying to believe
That even thought it's far
He'll find me Christmas Eve
I guess that Santa's busy
'Cause he's never come around
I think of him when Christmas comes to town

The best time of the year
When everyone comes home
With all this Christmas cheer
It's hard to be alone
Putting up the Christmas tree
With friends that come around
It's so much fun when Christmas comes to town

Presents for the children wrapped in red and green
All the things I've heard about but never really seen
No one will be sleeping on the night of Christmas Eve
Hoping Santa's on his way

Presents for the children wrapped in red and green
All the things I've heard about but never really seen
No one will be sleeping on the night of Christmas Eve
Hoping Santa's on his way

When Santa's sleight bells ring
I listen all around
The herald angels sing
I never hear a sound
And all the dreams of the children
Once lost will all be found
That's all I want when Christmas comes to town
That's all I want when Christmas comes to town",When Christmas Comes to Town,2004

Purring like a kitten

Locked up in your rib cage

And it might fall apart
But you'll only feel the beat

It's been a year now and it's getting so much better.
You came home without a word.
Though everybody said you'll soon forget her.
Thay couldn't see and they just didn't understand.
And lookin' in the mirror there were fools at either hand.

Can you understand.(Yes I understand) Can you feel it's right.
(I know it is) Will you be the same.(I'll do it all again).

How many days had I been waiting there to tell you.
I really can't believe.
We're walkin' out into the world tonight.

The sun was going down, there was music all around
It felt so right.

It was one of those nights, one of those nights when
you feel the world stop turnin', you were standing
There, there was music in the air. I should have been
Away, but I knew I'd have to stay.

Last train to London, just headin' out,
Last train to London, just leavin' town.
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you,
Let the music play on down the line tonight.

It was one of those nights, one of those nights when
you feel the fire is burnin', everybody was there,
everybody to share
It felt so right.

There you were on your own, lookin' like you were
The only one around, I had to be with you,
nothin' else that I could do,
I should have been away, but I knew I'd have to stay.

Last train to London, just headin' out,
Last train to London, just leavin' town.
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you.
Let the music play on down the line tonight.

Underneath a starry sky, time was still but hours
Must really have rushed by, I didn't realize,
But love was in your eyes, I really should have
Gone, but love went on and on...

i'm picking up on my frequencies

triggered by a laser beam
listening to a love supreme

its a funny feeling
i wonder if it has a feeling

only later do i see 
what it did to me..
