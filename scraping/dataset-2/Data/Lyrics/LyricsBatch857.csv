Point of Grace,"We've got something so good
We're gonna show you
It makes me happy
Always makes me feel free
When I'm in His hands
Do you understand
Not trying to sell you
I'm only trying to tell you
That His love is for real
It's there for you to feel
There is no reason to run from the One
Who can free you oh yeah

[Chorus:]
We've got something so good
We're gonna show you
Stand in His light you'll see
It's gonna shine through

Open you heart it's real
And waiting for you
We've got something so good 
All through the highs and lows
The only thing you need to know
Is that Jesus will be true
He's there to comfort you
You're not the only one
Who feels like everything you've done
Is measured in pain
Come in from the rain
There's no reason to run from the One
Who can free you oh yeah

[Chorus]

A love we can give 
A love we can share
A love that is more than money can buy
I believe
That He'll
Set you free",Something So Good,2001
Point of Grace,"Words & music by joel lindsay & tony wood

When I said that I would follow
It was with an honest heart
But I didn't fully understand the cost
'cause there are saints throughout the ages
And there are those today
Who show us what it really means to carry the cross
That only fuels my devotion
No matter what comes I will say

(chorus)
Yes, I believe
I believe with all that is in me
Yes, I believe
Though the world rises up against me
I will be faithful
To the choice I have made
I am determined
I will not be ashamed
To live so the whole world can see
That yes, I believe

There will never be a reason
To lose this confidence
For I have found where my assurance lies
It is not in my own power
But in who my savior is
And the truth of this conviction
Makes me shout to the sky

(repeat chorus)

Yes, I believe he is risen
Yes, I believe we are forgiven
Yes, I believe and one day we'll see him
And together we'll say

(repeat chorus)

Point of Grace,"Along life's road 
There will be sunshine and rain 
Roses and thorns, laughter and pain

But I want you to remember 
I want you to know

You will never walk alone 
As long as you have faith 
Jesus will be right beside you all the way 
And you may feel you're far from home 
But home is where He is 
And He'll be there down every road 
You will never walk alone 

never, no never 

The path will wind 
And you will find wonders and fears 
Labors of love and a few falling tears 
Across the years 
There will be some twists and turns 
Mistakes to make and lessons to learn 
Sometimes the journey's gentle 
Sometimes the cold winds blow 
But I want you to remember wherever you may go

With every breath we make this vow

With all our hearts for all our days

And how I'm standing here is unbelievable

Didn't anyone ever tell you
Didn't anyone ever say
Did you capture a vision of glory
As she held out her hand today
It's reaching to the broken heart
Right down to where you stand

Didn't anyone ever tell you
This is your land
Didn't anyone ever tell you

For the sad and the meek and the righteous
And all those who will hunger and thirst
So let the poor in spirit know

Didn't anyone ever tell you

You'll be given the robes of princes
You'll be flying on golden wings

Who embroiders on my jeans
I got my poor old gray-haired Daddy

But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

Could somebody here, somebody please explain to me
Cause I'm feeling so damn deceived

Come close I'll tell you the problem that I find
I'm sick and tired of the damage you've done

Blame yourself for the ghosts in your past
Kiss my ass

Poison,"Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for the mile
Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for a mile

Miles from home and I'm all alone
And looking for a first time
We took a long ride
And there by your side
I did my first crime

Well Mary Mary quite contrary
Just how does your garden grow
She said you ring my bell
And rattle my shell
I'll be your pretty maid all in a row

Put me to the test
Lay me down to rest
While your nails cut me up like a knife
Put me in you like a flesh tattoo
And scarred this poor boy for life

Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for the mile
Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for a mile

It was a hot one
In the summer sun
And more than heat was rising
I remember that September
And just how you left me smiling

I left there shaken
Body was achin'
Like it never did before

Begged and pleaded
Swear I needed
Needed you a whole lot more

Put me to the test
Lay me down to rest
While your nails cut me up like a knife
Put me in you like a flesh tattoo
And scarred this poor boy for life

Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for the mile
Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for a mile

Made this boy's bell ring
And there I earned my wings
Left me there in sweet pain
Hell I'll never be the same

If you won't take me for the mile
Don't give up an inch girl
If you won't take me for a mile",Don't Give up an Inch,1990
Poison,"Did you ever get up on the wrong side of bed
With an achin' head and just fall apart?
You're running late, the boss is bitchin',

Cause we all got our cross to bear

When I hear the music

When I hear the music
Sure as darkness I can see the day
When I hear the music
Let it play
Let it play

Life's just rented space getting laid to waste
When the lines on my face say I'm growing older
Just a stitch in time gonna save my mind 
When the weight of the world lies on my shoulders

Soon I won't have a place to fit
But I'll cross that bridge when I come to it

[Chorus]",Let It Play,1990
Poison,"I felt this before now I feel it again
No matter how hard I try
This feeling won't end
So I pretend you're here by my side
Tonight on this lonely ride
Keep telling myself that

Life goes on while you're miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on as night steals the day
There's nothing I can do

You heal up my wounds
I tasted your tears
You spilled out your heart
So I let out my fears

But one fear that I kept to myself
How I prayed that you'd love no one else
Like you're saying you love me

Life goes on while you're miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on as night steals the day
There's nothing I can do
If you only knew how much I miss you

When my mind plays these tricks on me
It shows me things I don't want to see
That's why I tell myself now
I keep telling myself now
Just take another piece of me

Life goes on while you're miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on as night steals the day
There's nothing I can do

Life goes on you're still miles away
And I need you

And this last mile I travel with you",Life Goes On,1990

The mysteries all gone

She's all gone

Can't you see it in my eyes
She sweet has turned to sour
I think it's time for me to fly

Well my vices have turned to habits
And my habits have turned to stone
The lies chipped away at my smile now baby
While the truth ate me down to the bone

One more step and I swear
I'll be over the edge
I've gotta stop living at a pace that kills
Before I wake up dead

Good times, bad times
How life loves a tragedy
Heartbreaks, heartaches
How life loves a tragedy

The nights I spent in danger
With strangers I thought were friends
Only to wake in anger
For some pleasure they swore they'd send

I think it's time I move on 
Like a rolling stone
Cause I got all the broken dreams I can buy
It's time to sell the ones I stole

Well I paid the price
For every thrill I got
Those thrills are all long gone baby
But I'm still paying for them like it or not

And some born to lose
And sing them poor boy blues

Lord I've lived everywhere
Almost drowned in the puddle of my own sweat I swear
I believe it's due time I get my mansion in ole Bel Air

Poor boy blues
You don't know how I'm feeling baby
Until you're wearing my shoes
Sure as I'm standing here
I got them poor boy blues

And tossed in the local slam
At least I get three square meals
Until someone gets me out of this jam
In the meanwhile all my green
Is going to Uncle Sam

Though I tried

Easy go

Has he ever felt like this

If I could have let you know somehow I guess

Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

And that I never meant that much to you

My future wife walked in

I needed me a dose of her, so I got a little closer
And this is what she said

Time can only heal it

Saturday night for my gin
Come Sunday morning, I'm asking the good Lord
To forgive me for my sins

Wouldn't get me out of bed
I felt like some big wrecking ball
Done hit upside my head

Now I don't need a preacher man
Telling me how to run my life
Until an angel sitting next to me

Now honey let me please explain
'Cause I didn't mean you no wrong

I didn't mean to hurt you baby
Wouldn't do that to you

You're the bastard son of a thousand blues

Well my Daddy was gone by the day I was born
And my Mama I have never seen
I was born in the back of a black Cadillac
And raised by a Gypsy queen

And as a child I was hell gone wild
Raised in the eye of a storm
By the time I was ten I was doing time again
'Cause I knew what that gun was for

No, no, no, I'm the bastard son of a thousand blues
No, no, no, Don't know what I'm going to do
No, no, no, I'm the bastard son of a thousand blues

But there's one I remember quite well
Years have gone past, but her memory lasts
But the story I cannot tell

Well I've lived and I've lied
And I've loved and I've tried
To put my soul to good use

Guess I'm shit out of luck
Cause that name, it just stuck

Could have been a devil's tomb
90 miles east of LA

If I don't try, the answer dies inside of me

Blind faith takes me to the mountains
Blind faith lead me to the sea
Blind faith takes me to a higher ground

Caught between the liars and fools
She spent her days thinking about her life

She was full of dreams and doubts
searching for that one way out

Caught between Heaven and Hell

Poison,"I felt this before
Now I feel it again
No matter how hard I try
This feeling won't end

So I pretend you're here by my side
Tonight on this lonely ride
I keep telling myself that

[Chorus]
Life goes on while you're miles away
And I need you
Time goes on as night steals the day
There's nothing I can do

You heal up my wounds
I tasted your tears
You spilled out your heart
So I let out my fears

But one fear that I kept to myself
Was how I prayed that you'd love no one else
Like you're saying you love me

If you only knew how much I miss you

When my mind plays these tricks on me
It shows me things I don't want to see

Only to fly where eagles dare

Burning till the night is done.

when I couldn't fly

You held me close
You held me close to you

And when the cuttin' was done
The only part that wasn't bloody
Was the soles of the big man's feet
Yeah he were cut in a million places
And he were shot in a couple more
And you better believe
They told a different kind of story
When big Jim hit the floor ... See ya Jim Boy

Hey yo, throw ya hands in the air!
And wave 'em like ya just don't care!
And if you're ready to rock with JT and the Clan, 
Lemme hear ya say, aw yeah!

Verse 1:  JT Money
JT, wreckin' shit like a drunk driver
The Bitch-izer's richer and wiser
Niggas camouflage to be large like the great one
Talkin' shit?  Oh, that's a mistake, son!
'Cause I'm on track like a train
Puttin' niggas in pain, who think they can hang
With the likes of the Money Man
I'm from the Clan; I leave your head spinnin' like a fan
So spread your hustle, we can go off the muscle
Brothers talk shit, but still don't want to tussle
With the Clan's warrior!
Make a sad story o' whoever's in the section, 
'Cause all you get is wrecked, son
If you don't know what you're in for,
Pay attention as I mention the info
Or you'll get slapped like a hoe
I'm from the bottom, niggas!  Act like you know!

Chorus (4x):
[I am ROUGH!]
[Another hit from the freestyle fanatic]

Verse 2:  JT Money
Save the beef for the patty; I don't rap for the weak
The Poison Clan's mack daddy ain't your speed
I get respect to the maximum, some be actin' dumb
They're not down with the Poison, so I'm taxin' 'em
Eatin' 'em up, like a gyro sandwich
They're never Poison Clan 'cause they do zero damage
JT Money's the man you can never predict
I'm crusin' while suckas gettin' sea-sick
Now stuff like this you can't resist nowadays
Poison is power, and power pays
So I choose to be Poisonous
You can never pose a threat if you put your boys in this
But rather though, you'll tell your kids a story of
JT, the Poison Clan warrior
I'm never lost in the source 'cause I'm the boss
Hot like the devil but cool as Jack Frost
And I fly niggas' head like a frisbee
You just seen a rough nigga gettin' busy

Chorus

Motherfuckers on ropes and still can't hang with me
The mack daddy's back on track and it's plain to see
I'm one of the best out, I'm waitin' the next 'bout
Never fakin' makin' the opposite sex shout
Niggas act hard when they know they soft 
Pull a switch on your back and turn yo' ass off
'Cause the shit y'all kickin' ain't hittin'
The shit I kick kick ass; I ain't bullshittin'
I'm on a rampage to do damage
Eat you like a sandwich, 'cause you can't manage
Niggas try to get fly, so then I wreck 'em
Kick 'em in the rectum, and then reject 'em
I make Hell raise, kick like a 12-gauge
Make you feel like you're trapped in a steel cage
Niggas kickin' nursery rhymes and weak fables
I kick shit like I'm walkin' through a horse stable
Gettin' shit on my steel-toe, but still chilled, though
My foot'll be up yo' ass like a dildo
So don't be next, black
'Cause I cause way more shit than Ex-Lax

[DEB:] Word! 

[DRUGZ:] Hey yo  baby  come here  yo  why you tryin' to front on my man 

Debonaire? 

[ANGIE:] Debonaire? 

[DRUGZ:] Yeah. 

[ANGIE:] Uh uh. All the girls tell me that he's no good. 

[DRUGZ:] Oh, aaight, I ain't gon' argue, but yo, wussup with me? My name is 

Drugz! 

[ANGIE:] Look, all you Poison Clan brothers are no good. 



[Verse 1: Debonaire] 



Debonaire's bad and so I'm called the Devil's Dad 

I kick the funky stuff because I'm rough, and I'ma add 

That, girls, I cold leave 'em, I totally deceive 'em 

I soothe and then relieve 'em, and then you best believe I'm, 

Outie-5000, and I find another bitty 

They tell me it's a pity, I want to get the whole city 

Girl, so don't you be shocked, you best to get set 

Women say I'm sick, but ask me have I seen a vet yet? 

Naw, I just keep on, I keep hoe-in' 

I keep goin' nowhere and, I can't stop and so in 

About a two year period I think I'll put Jim in, 

Wait up, lemme see, well, about a hunderd women 

(Damn!) Because of that, lots of women want to hate ya 

But I'm sayin', yo, it's in my nature! 



[Chorus: Angie ]

According to the Poison Clan, you can never trust a man 

I know a man would fool around, but I still can't understand 



[Verse 2: JT Money] 



Lovin' and leavin', that's what I believe in 

Yo! I only think about me when I'm skeezin' 

So, women get mad and call me everything from A to Z 

But I don't care, 'cause you know, I'm the J to T, 

To the dollar sign, and you will hardly find 

Another brother with a pipe game as good as mine 

So I flaunt the gift that I was given 

And don't ask because you know how I'm livin' 

(True.) Bein' in love's for the birds; I ain't a pigeon 

They say love is blind; I got 20/20 vision 

(Word.) So if you don't want your feelings hurt, 

Don't be on my back like you a Poison Clan t-shirt 

And when I tell you these things, it's not to make you 

Mad at me, but you should know it's in my nature 



[Chorus ]



[Verse 3: Debonaire] 



Women crowd around and say, ""Look how insane he acts!"" 

When they need to check out Drugz and Uzi, man, they're maniacs 

It's facts that I'm kickin', so girl, ain't nothin' made up 

I'm talkin' on a straight-up, 

but still you're sayin' to hold up and wait up 

You think I'm lyin', while talkin' of my nature then 

It's not my fault that all the women want to hate ya when 

People can't help it, they shouldn't want to hate ya, 

But they think it's voluntary, not just in my nature 



[DRUGZ:] Yo, now you see what I'm sayin'? 

Yo, Debonaire and JT, they ain't got no flavor, but I'm versatille! 

[ANGIE:] Uh-uh, 'cause y'all run the same ol' game, day after day. 

DRUGZ:] Oh, naw, not me, baby, I'm different! 

[ANGIE:] Look, birds of a feather flock together. 

[DRUGZ:] Hey yo, my name is Drugz, and I change up like the weather! 



[Chorus] 



[Verse 4: JT Money] 

People say the things I do to women make 'em rowdy 

Lie to get down, bang the boots, then I'm outie 

5 on a mission, see I'm not dissin' 

As long as there's fish in the sea, I'll be fishin' 

'Cause one's not enough; I ain't a wimp, I'm a pimp, 

And uh, I ain't lonely for no relationships! 

You want to be the girl that I hate? I ain't frontin' 

'Cause this ain't the A-Team, slim, You Gets Nothin' 

No money, no clothes, or a lil' kiss 

None of that unless you like gettin' dissed! 

I act this way, not because I hate ya, 

But you should know, it's in my nature

But not through reggae,

And that's the way it's gonna stay
If you don't wanna try
You better have a reason why

Pass the laws obey by it
Break the rules don't give a shit
I only have one commandment
Destroy to create, build a new
Smash the hate

What are they for?
Why were rules made?
To be broken!

Who's to blame
For all your flaws?
Make abortion outlawed
And put prayer back in school
The truth is as clear as a cespool
I say piss on all your fucking rules
From where I stand
The inside view of a promised land
Is the inside view of a garbage can
I'll bite the hand that feeds me shit
I am getting sick of the taste of it

What are they for?
Why were rules made?
To be broken!

Leave the police bleeding
Leave the churches smoking
And your rules leave them
Out in the street because
Your rules were made to be broken

Bottle, bottle, on the wall, who's the drunkest of us all?
Set yourself up for the fall, who's a slave to alcohol,
I know a place where you can go, you'll probably see no one that you know,
A few minutes will make you think you probably need another drink.
They said that I had a disease, I asked them, ""What?"" if they please,
I asked them what the fuck they meant,
Victim of the six percent,
Now I'm so ashamed of it,
I guess it's time that I quit.
I saw a friend the other day, getting out of N.A.
He was looking really good, that made me think of myself,
I care about my worthless friends, don't like to see them kill themselves,
Get so strung out they lose all hope, why do you think they call it dope?
Trembling hands, blooodshot eyes, propose a toast to my demise.
God gave me this liver,
I didn't know he was an indian giver.

How can I smile in a world of corruption, hate, death and self-destruction.

",Don't Like It Here,1989
Poison Idea,"


Freedom's just a word to those who give in,
Or a state of mind for those who put out,
Everything they have for an absence,
Or another word for no oppression,
Your sterile, fake community means un-civil liberty,
But it's out there, if you want it,
A change, a social change, is out there, if you want it.
Street politics are an important part of life,
You gotta know something about it if you don't want to die,
But if you die you say it's not gonna matter,
Cause all your life, it was handed to you on a platter.
Your sterile, fake community means un-civil liverty,
But it's out there, if you want it.
Money, happiness, freedom, a saviour, if you want it.
So go and die for whatever you don't believe in.
From the day that I was born,
Stars and stripes, a uniform,
Permanently rearrange,
Don't you sense a certain change?
A message to all, not just some,
Sprayed on the wall, legalize freedom
Hold your ground, keep it down, don't sell yourself short
Subvert? Don't vote? Do I have a right to bitch?
Does it count?

Who says it has to be.

I want to be dominated, have my masculinity deflated,
Push me around a little more, that way I respect you more,
When it's all said and done, what a strange idea of fun,

My heart's such an open sore, how can I trust you any more,
Slap my face, pull my hair, love me, tell me you care.

Here it comes again, a thorn in my side, a set of rules or a set up,
Give me grief and run it in just by the tone of your voice,

All the pressures the day inflicts,
All the pain that makes that clock inside your heart tick.

Motorhead, you can call me Motorhead, alright

Brain dead, total amnesia,
Get some mental anesthesia,
Don't move, I'll shut the door and kill the lights,
And if I can't be wrong I could be right,
All good clean fun,
Have another stick of gum,
Man, you look better already,
Motorhead, remember me now Motorhead, alright

Fourth day, five day marathon,
We're moving like a parallelogram,
Don't move, I'll shut the door and kill the lights,
I guess I'll see you all on the ice,
I should be tired,
And all I am is wired,
Ain't felt this good for an hour,
Motorhead, remember me now, Motorhead alright",Motorhead,1994
Poison Idea,"


Victory of heart, presence of mind
A smile on my face
I know what the next night brings
Wear and tear and pretend you care
Nothing is final, but exception is everything
Nothing is final, but exception is anything
Nothing is final, but exception is something
Your premonition, paranoia symptom
You just gotta live and learn






",Nothing Is Final,1994
Poison Idea,"


Take my hand, now there's no turning back
Walk right up the path into the black
The city down below, shines up so bright
We can do it in the moonlight
Stare into the night, I see the truth
Take a drink and tell me who you've used
The stars up above shine down so bright
We can do it in the moonlight
He's the father, the son
The holy ghost, all rolled up into one
This town's souls been sold
This town's views are old
This town's grey and cold
This place to the west
This place I like the best
This place reeks of death
I used to think that the hills were full
Of rich little girls and their cheap little games,
Until one night something happened, occurred,
I cannot forget his name
I'm the seeker, I'm the finder,
I'm the cosmic teeth grinder,
My lord's calling me home,
And I stand all alone.






",The Temple,1994
Poison Idea,"


Out with the old, in with the new
Change my appearance/sound/attitude to impress you
Do everything just one way
But change my mind day to day
It's so predictable it will never happen again
Correct my mistakes then I rip off a friend
Time is short, it goes too fast
Think what you've done in the past
All those things that have happened to you
And all the things you are gonna go through
It's so typical but what's done is done
I keep playing my games and what hurts is fun
Emotions spill just like wine
Tears flow in one straight line
Hearts break, it's no mistake
It's a shallow truth, I can see you're fake
Now it's time to rap my rhyme, rock it into overtime
But it's the wrong way to go. Isn't that just typical?

Poison Pen,"(feat. see-Rayz Walz, Diabolic, Loucipher, 
Poison Pen, Pumpkinhead, Tonedeff)
[Intro: from the film ""Scarface""]


Host: I've heard whispers about the financial support
your government receives from the drug industry.

Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
this money, which is in the billions, is coming from
your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
our national product, which is of course cocaine.

Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States
government is spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
same time, we are doing business with the very same
government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.

[Beat starts]

*Two Men Speak in Spanish*

[Immortal Technique - Worker]
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to ""Heso Preisto"" when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine, paced and play my position

[Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss]
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials

[Diabolic - Peruvian Leader]
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people...the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third-world fashion state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see

[Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor]
Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
Woulda ya...mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
c'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
But CIA conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough

[Poison Pen - Drug Dealer]
I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot? 
Give me the YAY YAY like Ice Cube, so don't play with my llello
We won't stop for you bastards
Must choose (?), chop it and bag it

[Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer]
Taking pictures and tapping phones 
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, blast the fo', 
Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack the blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room

[C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate]
Out the evidence room (*Said with Loucipher*)
Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and (?)
Feds will be up in your mouth...like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep a flow on a boat for Peruvian Coke
Players do favors for governers and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier

[Immortal Technique Speaking] 
The story just told is an example of the path that
drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
the niggas on your block. So when they point the
finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:

[Wesley Snipes - from ""New Jack City""]
I'm not guilty. YOU'RE the one that's guilty. The
lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords,
all you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
the ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
business. This is the American way.",Peruvian Cocaine,2003
Poison the Well,"Why do your eyes paralyze me 
What makes me feel this way 
Just carry me away with silence and heartbeats 
As rapid thinking about your embrace 

And how it makes me feel 
I just want to feel this way forever 
Sleep on portraits painted as perfect as you 
Why have I been given the chance to fly 

When I'm not with you I feel lesser alone 
I remember your face / imprinted on angels 
Your voice as beautiful / as the sounds of waves 
Crashing against my heart 

Time slows down when you look at me 
I'm infatuated with this / infatuated with you 
It's so hard for me to understand why 
I hadn't found you before don't dull away 
Hold my hand",Nerdy,1999
Poison the Well,"Feelings non existent. 
Loss of a tortured soul. 
So cold and fearful. 
Unnoticed and unclaimed. 
Left as one alone. 
On the endless road. 
To bear on for a lifetime. 
Of loneliness.
She sits alone and slowly fades away into nothingness.

[Chorus]
And as she struggles on. 
Her mind begins to wander. 
Thoughts of endless bliss. 
The wind her only friend.
Never again to be cared for. 
She tries to hold her head up high.
Just a mask to hide the tears behind. 
Only waiting to die. 
Only waiting to die.

As they sit by and watch. 
Another dead existance. 
Dreams torn apart. 
As the spirit dies. 
Hiding behind the lies. 
And silent darkness.

[Chorus]",Torn,2002
Poisonblack,"I can't help but follow in spite of going insane
For I know you'll swallow the whole of my pain
I'm stepping out of the light to feel what darkness can sow
I stare at the dead red lie...just one glance and I know

All disguised beneath the smile of the temptress, siren, evil child
The devil's sweetest whore

Cause you're feeding the fire within me
Cause you're making me feel so alive
Cause it's only the end of the suffering and I?m drowning in this rush

I was down, now flying...going nowhere fast
There's no denying I need this feeling to last
I breathe in and get higher and the ache fades from sharp to dull
The knives of desire...I feel them all

A thousand cuts still leave me cold
Give me more this soul's been sold and I hope this time I won't wake up dead

Don't blame yourself for what you can't ignore? Don't blame yourself for wanting more and more
Flesh on flesh raising breaths on breaths
I love the rush of death...",Rush,2006

It's a great day for the Irish, it's a great day for fair!
Begosh, there's not a cop to stop a raiding
Begorra all the cops are out parading!
It's a great day for the Shamrock, for the flags in full aray
And as we go a swinging, ev'ry Irish heart is singing
It's a great, great day!

Pokrovsky Ensemble,"There's a spot in my heart,
Which no colleen may own.
There's a depth in my soul,
Never sounded or known;

There's a place in my mem'ry,
My life, that you fill,
No other can take it,
No one ever will.

[Chorus]
Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

Spinning Wheel got to go 'round
Talkin' 'bout your troubles
It's a cryin' sin
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel spin
You got no money, you got no home
Spinning Wheel all alone
Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you
You never learn
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel turn
Did you find your directing sign 
On the straight and narrow highway
Would you mind a reflecting sign?
Just let it shine within your mind
And show you the colors that are real
Someone is waiting just for you

Drop all you troubles by the river side",The Spinning Wheel,2000

Yo, I'm out here all day
From when you hear the sounds of the car skidding
Then start dickin, gangsta from start to the finish
Whats up - never socialable, nigga we too disposable
If I get close to you it's probably to dispose of you quicker
Go 'head, try something live or die by these numbers
I'd rather live paralyzed than to die running, you feel it
Stay out his path, he's chaotic and mad
Pull a K out and blast, and treat every day like his last
I'm just a street nigga rhyming some words
Dabble in the finest of furs, cowboy minus the spurs and saddle
Prefer for battle; most deserved
In highest level in cowboy status is not from herdin cattle
One strange guy, I'm ? nuttin like you mayn
Guns all look the same to the un-trained eye
Easy to find, tell me how a gorilla can hide
The realest nigga breathin, ain't no nigga realer alive

Sniff 'em out like a bloodhound
Like they bag mills out in Vegas on the Greyhound
I never plead guilty, come to court filthy
Lawyer drunk off Henny, parole violators with me
And still I walk cause it's real
Take they ass to trial then they lose a quarter mil', now that's a deal
Filthy rich at his best
Love hell I write, with a 7 on my chest
I come, real street knowledge, boulevard trade school
Paid dues, cause niggaz know I honor the rules
Left no clues, X found, case is closed
While you go against the grain, with a plane of fo's
Take that slang to go, with the rubber handle steel
Spit dumb-dums at labels, with a 50-50 deal
Explode to your guts, that part left hollow
Show the world your nuts, I'm the hoodlum role model
To all the competition that'll follow
Just remember damage to the 99th power
No one knows the hour, that the Bow will strike
Took the sword from Hitler, that they stuck in Christ
Now who's nice? .. Now who's nice?

Yo, you see the press is too hot (uh-huh) when you rush my flows
I got, three for twenty-five, rhymes flip like blows
What you never heard this voice, it's big Cee from the state
(where you from nigga?) Where we pimp hustle hard, bang it out for the weight
Eyes wide, cause me and my niggaz organize crime
You either get it in the streets, or runnin from the jail lines
My game's at command, I show the world my status
It's filthy to the death blastin black automatics
You niggaz talk pain, he will catch these shells
Twenty-three hours on lockdown, one out your cell
I know it sounds sick, when you deal in this form
My city, the home where the killers is born
Close capture, East and West, now that you have to
Leave a little room for this Midwest rapture
And there's no endin, to the words I spit
I sacrifice my soul for this filthy rich shit (gangsta shit)

As we could, we could have it all
Even times got no power to stop us here tonight
As we could, we could have it all.

It's just one thing left for us to do
Before this night with you
Something that I want from you

I feel you
Heart beating, barely breathing
One minute before we fade to love,
Before we fade to love

I feel you
Heart beating, barely breathing
One minute before we fade to love,

Have you ever felt like your skin's on fire
As we could, we could have it all
You touch the surface, but you know is not enough
When we could, we could have it all.

It's just one thing left for us to do
Before this night with you
Something that I want from you

I feel you

One minute before we fade to love,

And who will pay the price for every hardship that you've went through, been done to?

Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go

Do me a line
As your searching for my savior

Polly Scattergood,"Nitrogen pink and a whole load of Wednesdays
They're these sweet rotting memories
That keep you alive

Nitrogen pink, please
Throw me a moment just to
Get my composure and to
Stamp on a fly

And the boys had they're pearls
And the girls had to backs
And everybody was laughing at you
Singing isn't it, isn't it, isn't it
Such a funny old world the way tragedy strikes

Nitrogen pink and a whole load of Wednesdays
They're these sweet rotting memories
That keep you alive
Nitrogen Pink please throw me a moment just to
Get my composure and to stamp on a fly

And the blind man was seeing clouds all grey
Until the weather man blew his rain away
And nobody, nobody, nobody make a sound

Nitrogen pink and a pill for my breakfast
And a bag full of ketchup that he spilt on his tie
Nitrogen pink for the unwritten bible
About this mad mad days survival
Till he kicked it up in the flames

And all the education daddy, it never paid
Because the fat man took my innocence away
And I though and I thought and I thought
You said all the streets were paved with gold

Nitrogen pink for the real captain red beard
For the unlikely pianist, the sad and the gay
Nitrogen pink for the man in the corner
For the pig in the slaughter house
The sweet melody

Played slot machines got so rich then we lost it
Found a hole in my pocket
Crack a smile and we're okay

That long drive home
Nothing much ever after
Nothing hurts me more than laughter
Man I wish you could be here

Nitrogen pink and a whole load of Wednesdays
They're these sweet rotting memories
That keep you alive

Throw me a moment just to
Get my composure and to
Wave you good bye

And I can't walk in a straight line
My path is always, always gritty

And I like to play piano but it's often out of tune
And there are lots of broken fingers
In the dark parts of my room

Please don't touch
Please don't stop and stare
Yes I thank you for your kindness
But there's sadness in the air

Please don't touch
'Cause it makes me jitter
And although I lost my mind sir
I think you lost yours quicker
Please don't touch

Love me tender, love me true
Show your colors black and blue
Make another crupper on the sofa
Eating marmalade

Hate to pry now it's forgotten
Feeling strange and looking rotten
Fighting like a soldier over skinny jeans and pick'n' mix

Fickle like a fruit machine
Playing with the cruise ship queen
Taking all his apples
And then going to play hide and seek

If you feel me please don't brake me
Please don't let that rat man take me
'Cause he thinks I'm weird
Well what's a girl to do

Please don't touch
Please don't stop and stare
Yes I thank you for your kindness
But there's sadness in the air

Polly Scattergood,"I try not to let my insecurities
Dictate who I am, and who I want to be.
I gave you all my words, and my words are my soul.
So, please try to be kind, if you are in control.
Because
Time takes, time takes, times takes, time takes many tears away.

If I had some elegance, some airs or grace,
Or if I had buttons made of silver, 
Or tops made of lace.
Then, I'd be that girl you want.
I'd ooze with charm.
And I'd have diamonds on my fingers, and you on my arm.
But 
Time takes, time takes, times takes, time takes many tears away.

Everybody seems to just turn a blind eye
On the 159 to Brixton, when a blonde girl cries,
And so, I will always be that girl that you never quite kissed,
And I've ribbons on my fingers and cuts on my wrist.
Because
Time takes, time takes, times takes, time takes many tears away.

If I was brave enough I'd get onto my knees,
And I would ask for you to try again
To love me please.
Because I have never felt that unconditionally
And learning takes some time but don't give up on me.
'Cause time takes, time takes, times takes, time takes many tears away.

Time takes, time takes, time takes courage!
And time, time takes many tears away.

Black and blue my petals fall on broken glass.
Please, teach me how to love and to forget the past.
Because tiny steps I take each day, but most days I crawl.
Please, try to be kind because I often fall.

Tão longe e tão perto do que eu quero ser
Cantar, uma balada, de sonhos despertos
De braços abertos para te conhecer

Estou aqui pra te sentir
Para te ver a sorrir

Estou a aprender a ser feliz
Aquilo que eu vou ser ninguém me diz
A guitarra que só toca por amor
Não acalma o desejo, nem a dor

Bem vês, companheira, eu parto sozinho
E corro o destino as vezes sem crer
Talvez, também queira, cantar-te baixinho
Dar-te o meu carinho e tudo esquecer

Estou aqui pra te sentir

I posed enough
Got freaky enough

Took pictures enough

I see a cute boy chilling in some jeans and Tims
I think I like him and I just might leave this club with him
And this swagger tight I'm feeling two's on me
Make me wanna, wanna, wanna got with him

VIP like ""Hey""
Dissing with my girls like ""Hey""
Then I call him off to meet me
I couldn't resist, so sexy

Baby won't you take me out of this club

I partied enough

I stuttered enough
I flossed enough
I snapped enough
Two step enough

Now I want this awesome woman up in this club
And I like her and I wanna leave this club with her
Ever since the mama broke it down to the floor
I say she ready she ready she ready to go, to go

Then I got behind her like ""hey""
She pushed it on me like ""hey""
And she ain't scared to get dirty
Even though she's so pretty purdy

DJ get on the mic
And give us head from the front to the rear

See my Bentley, what I got when my two Phantoms had a baby
I'm not crazy, why you lazy? I get so politely daisy

I sellin', heard you tellin', thought you killin' while you stealin'
Thought you dealin' while you chillin', you ain't ballin' with a million
God made me super rich, the devil made you stupid, bitch
You could be just like me if you quit with all that stupid shit

Why you actin' hard now you must want go see God now?
The same niggas you were beefin' with are up in your yard now
If you bout to run dogg, I guess you better start now
Forgot to bring your gun so you got to use your heart now

It's hard to get rich but it ain't shit to go to hell
It's hard to sell dope but it ain't shit to go to jail
It's hard to keep it real but it ain't shit for you to tell
I smoked so much of this that I can't even hide the smell

So drop
Drop, drop, drop
Now drop
Drop, drop, drop

We marijuana farmers, all our rides look like Transformers
Tell the pretty girls to pull they titties out and dance for us
You don't need a Gym Class, crack like Slim Fast
Take a hit and loss a fuckin' hundred pounds quick fast

Snow cone with a chain on and deep off or chain off
My blunt goin' kick the game off, we never take the game off
Find a hater, sign a hater, let him see my elevator
Hundreds in my refrigerator, now they know we gettin' paper
Find a hater, sign a hater, let him see my elevator
Hundreds in my refrigerator, now they know we gettin' paper

Pullin' coupes and escalators, enemies on respirators
Million dollar generators, 90 fast investigators
For flashy cars, the prison bars, ménage à trois
The playin' cards I swear it's hard, now drop

Someone to take it back to the eye's level
I want somebody to always run back to me
And trust I'll always be here with that cool thang

Still be there for me if I lost it all today?
Would ya care for me? Yeah, would you write me?

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

Pomeroy,"Music is a world within itself 
With a language we all understand 
With an equal opportunity 
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands 
But just because a record has a groove 
Don't make it in the groove 
But you can tell right away at letter A 
When the people start to move 
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over people 
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over people 
Music knows it is and always will 
Be one of the things that life just won't quit 
But here are some of music's pioneers

For there's Basie, Miller, Sachmo 
And the king of all Sir Duke 
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out

When a terrible explosion may ring down upon our land
Leaving horrible destruction blotting out the works of man

[Chorus]
Are you ready for that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your Savior in the end?
Will you shout or will you cry when the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?

There is one way to escape and be prepared to meet the Lord
Give your heart and soul to Jesus, He will be your shield and sword
He will surely stand beside and you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety and eternal peace and rest

[Chorus]

There's an army who can conquer all the enemy's great bands
It's a regiment of Christians guided by the Savior's hand
When the mushroom of destruction falls and all it's fury great
God will surely save His children from this awful, awful fate

Emptied and alone

Counting tile, losing bile and sleep.
""it's just a diet, I've kept it quiet. Even if you told all my family and
Friends they would never believe it.""
I think you're right. I can't believe it too
That it's you, but it's you.

I weighed out every option, that scale's not fit for advice.
Medical language won't ever help to shape this if that mind is just as frail
As it's frame.
You know I'd leave it alone.

We can beat genetics, adopting new aesthetics for beautiful bodies, figures
Ever-so-slender
Taking control, oh. oh, what a nice, nice thing.

Besides, my problems hide in numbers that leave when I gag and heave

Y a los veintidós cumplidos
Ya yo grababa, ya yo grababa
Ya la gente comenzaba
A valorizar mi canto
Y al lado del gran Colacho
Me llené de requisitos
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

He vivido todo el tiempo
Enamorado de una morena
La que meritoriamente
Hizo que fuera yo el dueño de ella
La pobre ha salio tan buena
Pero casi vive sola
Porque salgo a toda hora
A cumplir mis compromisos
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

Vivo muy agradecido
De aquella gente que me acompaña
A donde quiera que voy

Y ahora sé que morir es tratar de vivir
Sin tu amor
Sin tu amor

Mi niña bonita mi dulce princesa
Me siento en las nubes cuando tú me besas
Y siento que vuelo más alto que el cielo
Si tengo de cerca el olor de tú pelo

Mi niña bonita brillante lucero
Te queda pequeña la frase te quiero
Por eso mis labios te dicen te amo
Cuando estamos juntos más nos enamoramos

Aquí hay amor
Aquí hay amor
Aquí hay amor amor
Aquí hay amor amor
Aquí hay hay hay hay hay hay amor

Este amor que como espuma sube
Que cuando te tomo de la mano por el parque
Camino en las nubes
Parece mentira que ya no recuerdo nada
Cuando solo estuve
Nada se podrá comparar
Con algo tan especial

Nada se compara con lo nuestro mi vida

Le agradezco al tiempo
Que me ha demostrado que las cosas buenas llegan
En cualquier momento
Yo no imaginaba que conocería
Algún día este sentimiento
Un amor puro y natural
Digno de admirar
(digno de admirar princesa)

Un amor de fantasía, lleno de romance y alegría
De bello detalle cada día
Nena quién lo diría
Que algún día yo me enamoraría
Y que sin tu amor no viviría
Como sabia que esto pasaría
Que ibas a ser mía
Y que yo querría
Amarte por siempre mi niña bonita

Mi niña bonita mi dulce princesa
Me siento en las nubes cuando tú me besas
Y siento que vuelo más alto que el cielo
Si tengo de cerca el olor de tú pelo

Mi niña bonita brillante lucero
Te queda pequeña la frase te quiero
Por eso mis labios te dicen te amo
Cuando estamos juntos más nos enamoramos
Aquí hay amor

Aquí hay amor

Aquí hay amor amor
Aquí hay amor amor
Aquí hay hay hay hay hay hay amor

Poo Bear,"And it's hard
Hard

Yea yea sittin' looking out my window the streets I see ain't pretty
Sometimes I wonder if I was born rich with plenty
Money, and everyday was sunny didn't no rain fall
Life was beautiful like the colors of a rainbow
Would I be the same prim row all my niggas know
If I didn't have to learn to beat them streets and get that dough
What if I never witnessed killings with my own two eyes
Bussin' leave they own folks layin' in the street to die
Life without respective if every second I was shakin'
Cause I injected dope in my veins
Divide and strain could I describe pain could I
Describe livin' life without desire mayne
Could I survive if I couldn't rap or entertain alive
And free you can't beat it
Who can you blame my world is like a picture and the frame
The picture might change but the frame stays the same

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

What if you was on the other end of the bullet
When a killer wanna pull it would it seem like
The light flash in front of your face
Or would you run real slow like I ran in my dream like
Just the other day I tried to be a hero but it wasn't the side of me
Or maybe it just wasn't the time to be but if the shoe had to fit then I would be
Ahead of the game playin' the part I bring it all into the light from out of the dark
I hit the bat into the ball and out of the park
And live with the question alone that's meddlin' hard
What if you had to live under the bridge and do anything just to feed your kids
Think about that and the deed you did the first thing that impress me kid
Oh yes you did and I ain't even tryna choke your chain or pull your leg
And I ain't even tryna fuck with your head and I ain't even tryna sweat this shit
Just spit these messages cause I'm blessed with it
What if you had the chance to be able to switch hands with me or anyone you see
And if you really wanna take it deep this shit not quanum to me
For one and each and each and all for the sci-fi mat more religious superstitious
Politicious and all the listeners with us this shit be cold as Christmas
So put your head to the sky say a prayer for the sick and the old the young and the weak
For the bombs and the single moms with six kids askin' for something to eat

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

And when you get up they seem to hold you down
Down to the ground gotta stay focused with your eyes opened wide
See the sun rise I keep my hands on the steering wheel when I'm creepin' up 75
(woo woo woo) changing lanes on the regular talkin' on my cellular fast
Watching cause they wanna take me away
I'm just trying to feed my babies face
But I'm just hustling I'm waiting on tomorrow

Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

Touch a good girl, you're a good girl
And I know that I don't treat you like I should girl
Like I could girl, like my good girl

Here I go again, on my shit again

You came to shop, I came to ho hop
You had your girl with you, both looking great
I wanted both of y'all, how 'bout a double take
She was hating, looking at me like a scumbag
But something made you wanna turn around and come back
Probably cause I just don't give a fuck
I just wanna see one of these hookas in my truck
So tell your girlfriend ""tough luck""
She just wanna see you with somebody dressed up well

But you continue to text message me
Right after saying that we should move separately
But you don't wanna see me go
Even though I've only given you dick and cold cereal
So you must have a thing for Lucky Charms
Or the bad girl in you just fell in my lucky arms
You love to cuss me out and call me crazy
Say I'm no good and all of your friends hate me
Then you show up to my room and damn near rape me
And then it goes from ""fuck you"" to ""fuck me baby""
You leave early so nobody sees you out the spot
Now you stuck between a hard place and a rock
You call me a player but I have lied to you not
Cause I'm not a player, I just crush a lot, holler

Called you in the morning and you just fucking laughed
You think this cute, you love my crazy ass
And I wonder if you'll ever leave my side
Cause the more that I ignore you, the more you wanna ride
I tell you that I'm bad but you never ask why
Cause you just want the good from a really bad guy
You wanna rock, let's rock and roll, just know
I'm only good at one thing and that's not control
But I am consistent, that's something to be proud of
Cause I ain't shit with you and I ain't shit without you

Poo Bear,"Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Love and death are quite similar
How they come and go like cat burglars
Reality is kind of hard to face
Like actual facts and flat-earthers
Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow
And pain's a requirement for power to grow
It's a miracle how one could change from one what was just hours ago
Such is life though, it's just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture
Are exactly same, it's macro, micro
Crack your ad and let your light glow
One day you can be the king of pop
And the next one just be wack ol' Michael
It's human nature, just like he told us
Let's face reality, crack the cycle

Know it hurts to see the truth in your face
Circumstances bring you down to your knees
Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it
Enough to put your heart at ease
Ooh, don't lose your self esteem
I apologise, for being a man
It's way harder than what it seems

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh (reality)
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh (you might get mad at me, but I'll be at your bedside)

Pooca Leroy,"[Trae]
I find myself in a daze, sitting watching time fly on by
I tried to catch a grip, but somehow we keep moving on by
We came a long way, from playing hide-and-seek on the block
To bleeding corners on the daily, barely missing the cops
We turned to grown men, quicker than the blink of an eye
Some of us made it some of us didn't, but still we got by
What about the good times, ain't too many but I remember
Stadium Bowl, the rest of the clubs wouldn't let us in 'em
We was young, and plus our pants sag like Dubs
But we ain't care, cause half of the parking lot knew who we was
We came from riding on a bike, and graduated to a Houpe
Six deep with a grey cassette, trying to swang banging Screw
That was the days, but now we only riding with guns
Only understanding I got, is multiplying my funds
And moving slow in a drop, pass bops so grimey
Missing better days, hoping they could come and find me

[Hook]
I remember, being kids on the block
Pennies and my nickels, soon turned to a knot
I went from playing tag, to me running from the cops
Went from Tunker Toys, me swanging in a drop
Flying pass bops
I remember, being kids on the block
Pennies and my nickels, soon turned to a knot
I went from shooting water, to me loading up a glock
I came from the gutter, trying to make it to the top
Shit don't stop

[Jay'Ton]
I remember kicking it, with my niggaz in Middle School
In the hall full time, fuck class and all the rules
Late night, I was with the O.G.'s on the block
Curfew broke, but I was trying to stack me a knot
With my nigga Raw-C, Nick and the T-Head
Can't forget about the J2, and blocks we bled
Playing tackle football, while we on the concrete
In the house, imitating everybody we can beat
From the West to the North, with my nigga Pyrex
On the hunt for some bops, roaming through the projects
When I turned 16, Trae bought me a car
Four 15's, so the hood know who we are
Jay walking, so you know I'm walking it fly
T-shirt creased up, fuck a suit and a tie
Them was the days, I'll probably never see him again
So my main focus now, is for me stacking my ends

[Boss]
I was raised back in the 80's, I can tell ya bout the Smurfs
We was kids, we done traded our nurse for hard work
I can go back in the day, to playing get like me
In the hood looking for trouble, can you hit like me
I was a youngster in the street life, bailing through the street lights
First pair of G-Nike's, ask a nigga what that G like
I remember playing curve ball, and soccer
They got most of my homies chained up, in 5-by-7 lockers
The days ain't the same, in '79
Nigga was cool in '94, but now everybody walk in a shady line
25 years of keeping it real, wasn't hard for me
Living for the moment, to hit the gates for the Lord to see

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
I done came a long way, from cutting class
No more ducking hall monitors, now the FED's on my ass
Grown man shit Joseph Wayne McVey, I never thought I would say
That a state jail or prison, is a place I'd have to stay
I remember Saturday morning, cartoons and basketball
Half of the niggaz I was hooping with, in a casket y'all
The streets, is a graveyard
187's every second, please watch over my days Lord
I'm nothing but a Christian, I'm down with Jehovah
But this day in time, you ain't gon make it if you ain't a soldier
So God forgive me because I'm strapped, somebody might try to do me
The real world ain't like my block, this shit it like a movie
Make me wanna travel back in time, like Michael J. Fox
To when all my people was living, and it was love on the block
But ain't nothing but the future, bout to take place
It'll never be 1989 again, so nigga fuck friends

What's that name again? I forgot

A scrunchie for a hair, LaPerle underwear

That's what I love about her
Make the thugs bring the love up out em
She know you comin', she gon stop and get the nut up out em
They learn enough about 'em
They get enough up out 'em
Just like a nigga that soon she fuck give a fuck about em
That's my type, baby
No disrespect to tha bourgeois and too polite ladies
I'll do tha wife, maybe
Maybe later when a player in his thirties
Man I can't afford these young'ns tryna play a nigga dirty
Have me up all night talkin' bout I can't sleep
Too hurt to eat, baby girl neva see, that be he
Not me I'm way a better cheat
You know me better, be
We just fuck em and duck em and leave em..

All night can't sleep too hurt to eat
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes

See all my life I've been the type to keep a lil bitch
Fresh in the mornin' put it on me , cook a lil grits
She like to touch my lips
Yea I like to touch her hips
Then we get it poppin' when a player get enough to split
Back to that block where I be
I'm on her mind though
I wanna call her and ball her I'm on my grind though
She wanna ride on the love train
But love man, ain't what I'm here for
That's not what I care for
I'm in and out when I wanna
Don't wanna one-a
We could kick it in the winter
But I'm cool in the summer
I rather go through my act
With them packie packies on her lap
We on the corner, nigga heavy and he packin' stacks
Quality time, you outta ya mind
You steppin' over ya line
I know that you fine, girl
But all I do is fuck em and duck em
Pops told me don't trust em
Every night is another one
Pooda got em up

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Baby girl, don't act foolish when you know that you know betta
I keep you fine 'cause you a dime but you gets no cheddar
Its hard to show feelings when you know you ain't got none
I ain't the type of brother that'll bail soon as ya drop one
I'm in the crib yea soon as tha block done
I lay pipe all night so let tha bed bugs bite
She grippin' the sheets tight
I came when she came twice
Oh you got the right one
We sex till the sun come
Good thing I brought a box of them Magnums
Or nine months later she pop out wit a bad one
And everything change that a chicken be naggin'
Listening to her girlfriends, now she want more ends
Taking out my Benz, scraping up my rims
Every other weekend she out, girlfriend be clubbin'
Went from somethin' to nothin' now she huffin' and puffin'
Cause a nigga be frontin' and I got her up

Everybody name brand me I was same pants, same top
Coke and hot dogs out the same pot
Since a buck, I been packing weapons
Only strappin' niggas doin' when they sexin'

Every head is in the crew is yes man
My music and my shootin' perfected
I can't afford to lose I'm destined
To hit that road, collect and try to hop up
Out of the hood niggas, frown they see me pop up

Get locked up and they still with them coppers
Give 'em somethin' from the choppers
I got to flow with the choppers
Giving them gas they need ox call the doctor
Raw and uncut no mask know who shot ya

Try to tell them chill for real but they don't listen though
'Till the 45th come kiss 'em under the mistletoe
And that's the last time I'ma remind y'all
Next time creepin' up with somethin' behind y'all

It's the life, just livin' it right
Shoot first and don't think twice
And homie if the price is right, niggas say get at ya
'Bout who draw the fastest, casket or the ashes

Yo, it's lovely when your squeezin' 'em
Ugly when you're receivin' 'em
And ya peeps going crazy in the receivin' room
A gun like a lung you goin' need more than one
This for every block in the ghetto or where I'm from

I started off 9 or 10 runnin' wit my step pops
Learned how to collect from niggas and set up shizzop
Never buy hard from him I learned to cook rock
Summer time blizzock winter time shizzop

Let the smokers run them in, all they want is 3 for 10
Give up that password before you get the fuck in
Before we get to buckin', leave 'em where they stand at
Respect we demand that, now tell me where them grams at

Stacks rubber band wraps the streets the limmy
Got me a squadder wit a driver a souped up hemi
Be happy you in my presence, I can't give you a penny
'Cause this nigga only tough when that shit's up in any nigga

It's the life, just livin' it right
Shoot first and don't think twice
And homie if the price is right, niggas say get at ya
'Bout who draw the fastest, casket or the ashes

Yeah, ain't nuttin soft about me but niggas they doubt me
So I'm a have to run through they alley
Pick bread off of they balcony
Then toss the gun nigga, I'm outty or nigga I'm rowdy

But common sense plays a bigger part of me
My pookie when it comes to the Uzi it just be callin' me
Mr.Brown not Bob or Foxy or Nino
It's pooda baby the ruger baby will clean the scene though

Excuse me ladies been through it lately but doin' my thing though
The crib 24 hours nigga the hood casino
You lil niggas soft 'till that banana clip emptyin'
He not there dot on his head like he an Indian

It's training day nigga wake up early
Or we be in your crib burners wake up Shirley
Cabinets and the bed nigga check that thoroughly
I need that cooked up cookie homie end that story

Shoot first and don't think twice

So tutto non parlare più 
Lo so che forse è meglio 
Ma crederci non voglio 
Non c'ero preparato 
Ci vuole fiato a dirti
Addio 
C'è fumo e odore caldo qui 
(Di dolci e di caffè) 
E ognuno pensa a sé 
È il giorno più normale 
Ma io sto male, male 

Dammi solo un minuto 
Un soffio di fiato 
Un attimo ancora 
Stare insieme è finito 
Abbiamo capito 
Ma dirselo è dura 
È stato un bel tempo il mio tempo 
Con te

Dammi solo un minuto 
Un soffio di fiato 
Un attimo ancora 
Noi tranquilli e lontani 
Oguno per sé 
Piangeremo domani 
Svegliati, svegliami, dai
Come fai? 
Ma è vero che sta tremando il tuo respiro 
Ma sì che è proprio vero?

Got my swisha rolled
I'm finsta go up here to the liquor sto'
To equalize my high
And try to see if I could fly
I know I can't but still 
I drink and smoke that kill
I'm real, I chill, I fucked a gal
Who had to tell mine, guess that was just my luck
Sluts, hoes, bitches, tramps, all of the clits get down
When it comes to certain purchases they can't go get with stamps
But before I got a chance to learn I got caught up
The bitch got high, then my name was brought up
Fucked my whole game up, told the whole hood
Tried to go back to the crib and get pussy - no good
I shoulda known it, blowin it like she owned it
Now the phone clicks and damn, my gal is gone, shit
A hard lesson to learn, now I'm just finna turn
This curb and go buy some herb and try to wet my worm
With some bitch who don't even know my muthafuckin' name
It's a shame, shame, shame

It's a shame when you're left out
And you're runnin' all over town
Am I to blame, am I the only one
To pick myself up after fallin' down
When I try, tryin' so hard
To keep my feet on solid ground
So many people comin'into my life with bullshit in my ear
Steadily irkin' me, won't you stop workin' me

Why (why) do the seasons change (seasons change)
Why (why why) do I feel this way
Why do I feel this way

Get up and get high
A sweet to the head, my eyes redder than fire
I'm gettin' blowed, lettin' smoke go right out the screen do'
People walkin' by, ""Hey D, have you seen...?"" No
I'm by myself and alone
And if it's bullshit I gotta listen to, man, gone
Don't even like to go but when I show at a club
I be lookin' for pussy, seldom searchin' for love
But I fucked up again and I went once mo'
Wasn't tryin' to find a bitch but stumbled upon a hoe
So me and this bitch who didn't even know me
Left the curb so she can serve me, wanted to show me
A nice quiet private place no one would know
I rolled somethin' to smoke, she had somethin' to blow
But then them laws, though, they had us fucked in the game
Charged the bitch for prostitution, charged me for the caine
It's a shame

The things that'll make you laugh
Can be the same things that make you cry (cry)

All the bullshit stops here, let's get this clear
Shoot rear fresh off the top tier
What I'm about to do for you is not fair
I'm not answering questions for you that are not clear

What up to State Prop the crew, were they not there?
The moment that they heard it the verdict
When it was declared, ya boy had to sit a year
Did they really disappear, did Jay really not visit there?

Dame and Bean's are they tight as it seems
Or is it all fabricated from that same fabric
That ripped the Roc marriage straight from the scenes
Things ain't what it seems but in time do tell the truth shall prevail

Until then you dudes bite y'all nails in anticipation
Before I know you hate it
Why I got you waiting, I too am waiting
Gotta see a couple faces when I make them face it

Truth that is that your boy ain't have patience
As a matter of fact it's wearing thin
But I tell you this though when the new year begins
Pussy's ain't got nuts because I'm going all in

Yet my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

Now let's not get this misconstrued
To say that in this record I don't diss my dudes
Out of respect I couldn't check my once fist tight crew
Never in front of you, I couldn't get that rude

And I don't give a fuck but I couldn't get that cruel
It's knowing what I do I could get like, ooh
You wanna know what I do, don't ya?
Ya love it if I told you old fuckers, won't ya?

Uh, uh, scrap got to pay for this one
I'm sorry youngin', got to wait on this one

Well, fuck it I don't wanna stop
But you forgot the gunner pop, tell me who you wanna rock
It's crew love Rocafella 'til I die
Nigga keep it moving, don't get caught up in this drive-by

The breaks over, your boy about to take over
If that number one spot open, give it here
Give my ground, dust off my chair
And y'all niggas can kiss my ass before I sit it there

Back from the dead fresh off the prison tier
Daddy here to put the kids to bed
By the way the war's on you can't call it off
It's too late plus the boss involved

Yeah baby
It's about the nastiest little
Song you ever heard of
So your momma's and daddy's better close ears
Cause I am about to get explicit

Verse 1:

Relax bitch
And take off your fucking coat
Call me the bay
About to rock your fucking boat
You said sing a song
So I sang to you
11 long bitchs
Yeah bitch and I'm blaming it
Throw those big wet thighs on my shoulders
While I attack it like a motherfucking soldier
You said you love me
Scream a little louder bitch
I can't tell from the moans and groans and shit
I am straight sweating my dick is on pause
Slow down baby lets take it to and fro
I feel it coming can you handle the nut
This shit feels hella good awww fuck straight

Course:

Your dick feels so good
Feels so good to me

Verse 2:

I guess it's tongue time
Put you knees to the floor
Take your time baby
Your lips are kind of cold
I never thought she would suck me this right
You suck my dick like a rap on the mic
That's good honey so do it like that
You like the way it feels to suck a big mack?
You went down like you knew your righteous place
You little freak wipe that cum off your face
Don't swallow it to fast
Take time to savor it
Use your tongue and be a bitch and play with it
Do it real good make my knees weak
And tell it how it feels young freak

Course:
Your dick feels so good
Feels so good to me

Verse 3:
Take it out
Take the dick and steoke it
Put it in your mouth but don't choke bitch
Suck me fuck me lick me freak me
If not everyday we can do it weekly
And now I am tired so lets hit the tub
Yeah baby give me a backrub
It was cool it lasted kind of long
Yeah bitch it's the 1990 love song

Course:

Your dick feels so good
feels so good to me

Seeking deeper and deeper, you just might slip
Into a trance, mind going slow
Didn't want to curse so they'll pump it on the radio
Called up Banks on the GTE mobil
Well it's about 9:00, yo Ant I'll be over
Searching through some records from way back when
Found something smooth, and yo Ant give it a spin
Thought of something cool, rhymes definitely pumpin'
Bassline groove and kick drum thumpin'
Using my mind like a Webster encylcopedia
Pooh-Man is selling out and this is for the media
A little something, from the Mack to the Oaktown
To the papers who keep putting our names down
Short Short but Funky, Dangerous Dame
En Vouge and the Toni's just to add some names
Can't forget Pebbles, Sly and Larry Graham
And yours truly, MC Pooh-Man
Oaktown is on the rise, and I knew you'd ever see
We just funky as ahhhhh, we want to be

First rhyme, just on the PG
Going through history and fools can't get with me
Looking fake, perpetrating rappers every day
Misguided brothers without nothing to say
All kind of critic say we diss mentality
But don't they know that ""Rated are"" is ""Reality?""
My other homeboy said ""Kill At Will""
That's the way we live and we know it's real
My boy from the east said ""Fear of a Black Planet""
I know a certain race that couldn't understand it
To see a black man clocking fat grands
To a grafted devil, it's hard to understand
But I'm an artist, begging your pardon
Used to be small, but my pockets are enlarging
Straight from the streets, I use game as a weapon
You ask ""What is game?"" But fool keep stepping
But I'm a keep rolling, Ant Banks and me
And I'm a come, Funky as I want to Be

Rap's going, I be flowing something different
Something mellow, cool with an accent
Kind of tender like Ant Banks' girlfriend
I changed the style, something they couldn't comprehend
Ant said ""Pooh, let's make it kind of serious""
Not funny, just to make the money
Say I'm a pro and I can flow with the best of 'em
Then say ""I be damn"" to the rest of 'em
See you're caught up in my rapture cause it's been so long
Let me stop using the bitches' songs
Baby don't like rap, but I like soul
She might listen to my lyrics and lose control

See I'm F-you-N-K-why as I want to be",Funky as I Wanna Be,1992

Said I would never make it now look at me now

Look at your women she is screaming it too
Never faking the funk

I give them nothing but that Oaktown game
Some of ya are pregnant, and I gotta let them know
Pooh clams nothing gotta go gotta go

But you will get hit by Eastside's Mellow Man

Plotting for richs
Brothers keep talking man but I ain't trippin
I talk bad about women
Only out for the vogues

Sluts like Alisha don't know where to turn
Pooh's like fire baby play and get burned
Ain't ??? that this game that I spit
One step wrong and I dismiss the trick
I remember the girls that moved way too fast
We get in the truck and she expects cash
The money is mine, so is the house
Drop my keys on the table baby get the hell out

Not a worry in the world, I'm all about money, man
Getting my grind on was all my mind was on
Making a grip, nigga, my money was on
Double back pulling nothing but mail, fuck a briefcase
Rolex watch with the diamond-studded face
More Benzes than a dealership
Slant-nose Porche with the whole damn kit
Slanging more keys than the older players
D.A. was on my dick but a real nigga didn't care
They kicked in my door a million times
And fine-ass bitches was all that they'd ever find
Treated me like Vaseline, but quick as a fox
Drop a key for 25 like they was hot
Fools was jealous, I had too many tricks
Fuck a playa hater, cause I was all about real niggas
Niggas like John-John, the boy from the deuce side
O.G. motherfuckers like Daddy G and Clyde
They gave me the game to survive, oppenents gonna die
Fuck him and his family, let the motherfuckers cry
Nigga caught a bullet cause it wasn't my dope he was selling
So I shot him behind me, death was trailing
Always asking myself, who would be next, bitch?
Gotta wear a vest cause I paranoid as shit
I gotta survive, I gotta survive, I gotta survive
Who wants to know I want to die?
But the only way I'm going out is spraying
Because the niggas from the deuce ain't playing

>From my way up in the dope game, I met a lot of stops
I got into some funk, one of my boys got shot
Some fool was on my turf selling dope that wasn't mine
I'm a gangsta, I mean problem with nines
It never mattered that I knew the fool a long time
Cross me once and death is all you'll find
But this here will be my last hit
To use a gun, it really didn't take shit
We did it, we did it, we did it, we done it
Mossberg street sweeper, I pumped it
Unloaded all 15 rounds
As I shot and I shot, niggas went down
Bullets flying, niggas dying, but I ain't trippin
I caught a fool with the back bitch slippin
Pulled out the nine and I popped him 4 times
Now let's see your black ass cry
He looked at me with on his ass and said
""Fuck you!"" (gunshot) Nigga fuck you, too!
The hit was on and it was time to go
So I stood in my stide, jumped in the K5
Come on niggas, come on niggas, come on niggas
I'm a business man, I can't stand bullshitters
I hate to cause your family dismay
But plain and simple nigga, we don't play

I went 5150 when we lost my nigga Bruce
27 shots from a clip, getting loose
For real motherfuckers, I was sharpening my shooting skills
Hella mad nightly, shooting motherfuckers at will
CTE, I got nothing to lose
And a hell of a lot to gain, by killing you
A thrill killa from the heart of real killers know
In order to give I might have to take a blow
It's kind of cold that you lost your brother
But we still lost Bruce, motherfucker
Tomorrow ain't promised a gangsta good luck
Just a bullet motherfucker, cause death is a must
As I bust, squeezing on my nine on your block
Doing what I feel I gotta do to watch your ass drop
And if your punk-ass bitch is in my way
Let the stanky-pussy bitch meet my motherfucking AK
Making moves for money, ain't no delaying
It's '91, and the nigga named Pooh, he ain't playing",Niggas Ain't Playin',1992
Pooh-Man,"Player haters, player haters
We can't the player haters
Yeah, man, let's kick the funky gangster shit
Give enough respect

Mike, a.k.a Cash Money
Man, I tell ya, this nigga is funny
Always bragging to the girls about what he had
Sucker always told his dry ass has drama drag

Told the partners he was down with us
We should of figured, he was out to get us
He had another partner named Jeff
He hooked up with him and game done left

Now we talk bad about me and my crew
High siding with bitches and talking about fuck Pooh
Now I know just how to handle this
Call up her sister and let her suck my dick

Or maybe I should call his women
And stick my dick in her motherfucking mouth when I'm cumming
See, here is some game for you motherfucking fakers
He crossed game, so he is a motherfucking player hater

Player haters
Player haters
Player haters

I know you're asking yourself what is a player hater
Another brother who hates me because my game is greater
See, I got a lot of female friends
I drive a '73 Chevy instead of an '89 Benz

When it comes to women, I put my foot down
I give them respect but sometimes I have to clown
And niggas down aspected game
So they get behind my back and talk bad about my name

Now I see if you was doing better than me
Now take what he's got and multiply times three
It ain't a bragging thang
I am just a nigga who refuses to cross game

Or let a bitch be the reason
Man, I tell ya, it ain't shit but treason
I tell ya, man, niggas ain't shit
He's just mad because I am fucking his bitch

See I fucked her but never am I paying her
You be a player hater

Player haters, player haters
They can't stand player haters
Player haters

Cash Money is a player hater, Vince is too
Fuck you niggas and the whole damn crew
You thought you could do me with your punk ass words
But all that bullshit get shot to the curb

Told that bitch about my other bitch
All that player hating did stop shit, niggas I rob
Ricky and Jay and all you players around the bay
Now let's not forget about Moe and this clip

Ain't shit but a player hating son of a bitch
Now I know we got 'em and will be sitting in the lane
Pussy ass niggas is jealous of the next man
Now I took this time to throw off steam

But I still got his little ass bitch on my team
Now we talk all that shit, it didn't work faker
But it fucked up trick, you ain't shit but a player hater

Pooh-Man,"""Life, it's all about sex money and murder.
To all those motherfuckers out there who can't deal with it;
You just a punk ass bitch!""

Sex money and murder, elements of the streets
You either play the role or get your god damn ass beat
See I can get the pussy and money is a must
Try to stop me, ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The suckers try to win, let the games begin
Meet me, Ant Banks, Kenny Wayne and the mac-10's
We were born to die any god damn way
Here last week, but you're dead today
No time for the bullshit, let the bullets disperse
Hospital to the morgue to the motherfuckin', hearse
Deep in the game, since I was eleven
The streets are hell, so what the fuck is heaven?
I'm one of the biggest baby and refuse to get took down
A god damn killer comin' straight from the Oaktown
Step out of line, it's mandatory I hurt ya
My hobbies in life, what? Sex money and murder

[Chorus]
Sex from your bitch (""run, run up punk"")
Money from the crack (""death.. death is a cycle"")
Murder is a hobby.. murder-murder is a hobby,
Murder-murder is a hobby that I had since way back

I live the life of a criminal and hustle each day
Fool step wrong, live loose, get blown away
The ave is the only home I knew
So to get what I got, I did what I had to
Kill, deal, rob, I didn't give a fuck
You had what I needed? You was shit out of luck
A chopper is mandatory, to lose is another story
Fools try to get with me, wind up history
You just mad, cause I got yo' bitch
And now she's ridin' on the Dangerous dick
And I can tell by your face, you're mad and full of steam
Cause now your bitch is on Pooh-Man's team
She's my bitch, was yo' bitch, come and sucks my dick
It don't stop with this young-ass trick
Run up punk, and watch yo' friends desert ya
Because my lifestyle punk, sex money and murder

[Chorus

So much shit, gettin' talked by the other crowd
Always talkin' and don't know what the fuck about
I get criticized, ridiculed and other shit
But they go wild when I yell out bitch
So I can take a little criticism and laugh
And tell the critics they can kiss my ass
I ain't trippin', my money is made,
I kick back and I straight get paid
Rated X is life, mother fuck PG
Death is a factor on the Oakland street
If you can't deal with life, don't fuck with my rap
It's like this, cause it happen like that
Sex from your bitch, money from the crack
Murder is a hobby that I had since way back
A hit ain't shit, I learned it in class
Creep slow, shoot fast
This is the way I live, fuck pain and torture
Believe in life, sex money and murder","Sex, Money and Murder",1992

Time to pay respects to a player from my crew
He got caught up and paid with his life
Slipping on the block on the late night
Now everybody's at his funeral with tears in their eyes
Wonder why my homie had to die
Just another one of my dead friends
And all that's on my mind is getting revenge
Kissed my playa on his cheek
And whispered in his ear ""I love you and rest in peace""
But for me, the funk is on
I'm strapped with my chrome from dusk til dawn
And you can run but you can't hide, fell me?
So when you get your first glance, you'd best to kill me
Cause I'm out to gets you, pranksta
And you know you can't fade a gangsta

They try to tell me revenge is the wrong way
But that ain't what my comrades would say
And if it was Pooh, laying in the casket
Somebody would be getting they punk ass blasted
I'm riding strapped in the LTD
Ready to put some punks to sleep
Tears filled Antione's eyes
As he thinks of the way my homie died
AK's across my lap
And it's on with the mini 14 in the back
The Angel of Death's on a mission
I want your life nigga, fuck sqaushing shit
And as far as the toll goes
Nigga you can talk to these motherfucking bullet holes
Now the deuce is out to hang ya
And we ain't shit but gangstas

Now we know for sure who pulled the trigga
Fake-ass nigga
So we kicked in his mom's door at home
And find her old ass there all alone
She gave up his number and all
So I gave his mark ass a call
Look punk, we got your momma
And she'll be dead on arrival if you don't cut the drama
You killed my partner so I gots to kill you
And I'm a do what I have to
This wrinkled-up bitch, you'll find her in a ditch
If your ass don't get here quick
I'm getting tired of your drama
Now ask yourself nigga, do you love your momma?

Poor Boy Rappers,"Hey all you low riders that cruise the street 
We've got one bad rap that can't be beat 
With a beat that will blow our b-o-y Heads 
Just give us a beat and we'll pass the test 
We're gonna make you down from your head to your toes, 
Turn up the stereos and here we go

Now early one day I got the urge to drive 
So I took my moms car for a joyride 
The ride was so sweet, the noise so chill, 
The time that night came I cruised it again

When the next day came I was all alone 
Just thinkin' about a car I could call my own 
So early in the night I went to find 
A job so I wouldn't have to hustle, steal a ride 

So I got a little job at the grocery store, 
Packin' all those groceries, man what a bore 
But I just kept thinkin' how it would feel 
To be cruisin' down the street in my own set of wheels 

I saved up my money put it all in the bank 
And put some aside for my gas tank 
Now we're the poor boys here to make some noise
Tryin' to bring all the people some pride and joy
We're the last three brothers on the microphone 
Just cruisin' around where the beat my go 

I was gunnin' for work one Monday at three, 
Came down Van Buren and was lucky to see 
It was sittin' in the lot, it was all the way vibe
It was a cool old chevy, a sixty five! 

So I went into the lot and I asked the owner,
How much do you want for the car in the corner? 
He said one hundred and fifty is my price 
And then I took it for a ride and it rode real nice 

So I bought the car, a couple days later
I found a hole in the radiator 
I got that fixed for twenty five bills
And when I got more money and got me some wheels

They were classic, really fantastic,
Made my car look for real 
Just turned on the ignition, blow my sounds, 
Give all the girls a thrill 

Show your fun side as we're crusin' 
Now hold it right there, don't go,
Now let me see somebody do the jiggalow 
Jigga-shake, jigga-strut, 
Jigga-any kind of way but get off your butt 
See the party can't cruise if you don't wanna move, 
C'mon everybody get in the groove

Cruisin' is a thing today 
And you can cruise in any old way 
You can cruise on the bus, 
You can cruise in your car, 
You can cruise no matter how far 
You can cruise all day, 
You can cruise all night, 
You can cruise in the lane to the right 
You can cruise to your girl on the telephone,
You can cruise when you're all alone
You can cruise to the rhythm of the funky beat 
And you can cruise cause it sounds so sweet

Shake that girl, let's cruise 
Build it up from the groove 
How you gonna win if you think you're gonna lose? 
Gotta cruise in those dancin' shoes 

Now me and my fine lady took off for LA 
Cause they were havin' a car show the very next day
We got to LA It was a very hip town, 
A lot a party people were there gettin' down 

North, east, south, and west 
Low riders everywhere but mine was the best 
We entered the car show and took first place, 
Real happy that we came cause it wasn't a waste 

Got to the party, 
Everybody's groovin' 
The sound of hydraulics got everybody jumpin'
All the cars lined up against the wall but my car I won jumped four feet tall!

I'm gonna call my girl, set up a date, 
Do all the chores early so I won't be late 
Gonna cash my check, see the money with my eyes,
Give my mom a little bit so she won't cry 

Gonna wash my car, lubricate my grill,
Then cruise across town to pick up my girl 
Gonna take her to the disco dance, yep it's on 
The fast, the slow, the struttin' along 
I'm gonna be GQ'd out, have her in gown,
Gonna be slippin' and slidin' yeah really gettin' down 

We're all low riders, that's who we are 
Some ride here, some ride far 
No matter how far some of us go, 
We're gonna drive our low riders very slow 


I bought a Lincoln Continental seventy nine,
Always shinin' it up, keepin' it lookin' real fine
Got it up in the front, drag low in the back, 
When I hit the switch I got it goin' whack! 

Got to do what I can with my paid job, 
Thursday's I do people say I'm done 
I keep the white lookin' great, 
Got the magic LA On my license plate 
Didn't buy no rims, just pop my hood, 
See that's what we prefer in our car club 
Gotta the sun roof popped and rear views tint 
And when you open my door all you can smell is peppermint 

As we cruise through the city got my music up loud
And every place we stop we seem to form a crowd
Keep my car dropped low, won't raise it any higher,
Want everyone to know that I'm a lowrider 

We're all low riders, that's who we are 
Some ride here, some ride far 
No matter how far some of us go, 
We're gonna drive our low riders very slow 

One plus two plus three is six, 
We're the poor boy rappers livin' in Phoenix 
We're gonna hip, gonna hop, gonna rap to the beat 
Til everyone around starts movin' their feet 
We could run, swim, walk, fly, dance, jump, turn around, 
Hey! We could really get down",Low Rider Rap,2018
Poor Old Lu,"Oblivious to some things more in store
And when I wept I knew not what
Or when or why what for

One good thing one way one chance

And glimmer shining up and through the floor
Will run and hide and fade
Just like He said it would before
And now my head is really spinning fast
I lived it all for me
And now it simply moved right past

Imagine when I knew and saw
And fell before the Lord

Here comes the teacher with another funky new
radical, butt-naked booty stinkin form of thinkin
Off an on step, concept, tell em Culture Freedom
Shall I sex this? (Well God it's sexy!)
This this step steppers come and steppers swingin
Most blacks back back-up what the hell we bringin
G-fine nearly singin, my rhythm hit the roof!!
This one's dedicated to the CISI missing youth, cause
This hit the teacher with another style of mashin up
a damn dance, jams get, jammed by the PRT p-osse

Heard about million and one of my songs, my favorite's Holy Intellect
Check Wise on the rise I emerge from slum
Come one come all see, the teacher heal the dumb
Cause, this hit the teacher givin birth to a ghetto style
display, most poor people of the planet
can relate to, poverty in a song
Conquered and divided, tricked and undecided

So when I forget ya what I think ya need to know
Understanding jamming mind and Culture Freedom tell ya so
No black no white, cause black be's first
Son of man, take a stand, for black children of the earth
Just, just check out teacher and the way that I evolved
Since last time, I'm truly perfection
But, don't balance this with the other LP
For the last rhymes, cause there's no connection
If I was the DJ Father Sha he'd come and tell em what I'd say...
""Hot damn I'm great""

Chorus: repeat two lines 4X

See draw the clear picture of the teacher teachin this
It's, sort of smooth, roughness
Plus this flow go more miles back
God's gotta be that of a leader in this thing called rap
Cause, this hit the teacher on the roads often travelled
by the multitude, Culture Freedom knows it best
Some of them got a problem with the Gods in the house
Cause we don't sleep, traitor interpretate this
Allah equal God equal He with supreme qualities
You best believe God's real and
If it's God Sha, it's gotta be
(""Tribe... called... P... R... T-T..."")
Culture Free, Father Sha, and me, cause
This hit the teacher on a whole nother level
with a clear scope, and range on things hang
out by the speaker if you're weak or come and eat
From the strong song, that's if you are what you eat
Never will I teach ya that of poison and disguise it

Blacks still that of Asiatic

Poor Righteous Teachers,"Roots!

Praise for the days when I couldn't get paid
In the fix on the mix in the damn projects
Cracks for the blacks but I couldn't sell that
Even though blacks couldn't get jobs and shit
Hit after hit from the Sugarhill Gang
Hear a Pow Wow, hear a Big Bank Hank
It was strange, I was broke but I still got the record
Even though I was poor and about butt naked
Rats in my front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley running styles for the crack
It was ill on the real, I be still bugging off it
In the ways I will walk it so today I can talk it
It's a shame how the games in the ghetto get played
On the cracks they paid for the tricks they laid
I'm afraid for the youth in this time we're living in
Just about 13 on the scene scrambling
Gambling small-time, apologize nice
I'm about to roll 10 7's for the crap I rolled twice
Rough business, it's a rich mon time
When you ain't got the loot, you resort to the crime
From the cess house, the youth house, the jail house, the Cult house
Where I perfected these skills I be doggin
Love to teach the facts but the brothers in the back
Can't see what I'm saying cause the blunt smoke is foggin
Still I proceed with degrees of the wisdom
Cause this shit's thick, it kicks and I know it
Lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto

From ghetto to ghetto, from project to project
Bookbag of lessons but I ain't have dough yet
From knowledge to wisdom, from wisdom to see
And understand me if you don't dance, G
It's a god in the house, it's a god in the house
And I'm godding it out, and I'm godding it out
I've come a long way, the strong way, the wrong way, I lived it
The right way, you might say, I got it, I'll give it
But praise for the days when I used to be tramp
And had to freeload of my Earth's food stamps
Til I stopped, paused, start the pop's stores
It was ill on the real, but who's to die for us?
Say that I rock my own community
Ain't a damn thing owned by the you or the me
It's Koreans I be seeing on the neighborhood corners
With the guns and the stores and love the ??? owners
So beg my parton, peace Natasha Harton
See I won't forget, I know for shit's starting
From my way to LA, from JA to UK
I am who I am, I say what I say
I gots no time to love a slave trader
Cause according to the constitution, they'll always hate us
Play this, say this, and say it like I said it
Cause a magazine edit can get your ass beheaded
I'm thorough breaded, black slave dreaded
The shit that y'all doing, I already did it!
But lickle do you know there's a God and so
Born just like Christ in a damn ghetto

Praise for the days when I used to be trife
With a lack of understanding anything about life
So thanks to Malcom, Martin, Wylee Ferartin
Father Allah talk the talk that I'm starting
Peace to Elijah, we can't forget about ya
Teaching us how ta, get up out the
Project complex caves
Another damn rave for the damn ex-slave
My ghetto noise ringing from a project hallway
Don't want to hear my mom say ""Blacks have come a long way""
How can she see that when we haven't eaten all day
Haven't had a job since the ending of the slave trade
Then they give us church, attempt to try and ease this
But I check it out, had to learn about Jesus
Told em he was black and they called me a hater
Then he's on the church wall, yeah like a slave trader
Something real funny's going on boy I'll tell ya
Send you up sell ya, free ya try to kill ya
Martin taught me much when he simply tried to love em
Brother all about peace but the devils had to snuff him, but

Yeah, This one is dedicated to all my niggaz in central New Jerusalem
All the brothers who picked up that ring after I put it down
And took Miss Ghetto to be their unlawfully wedded wives
Poor Righteous Teachers representing the nine

It's like that and you don't stop
She's like cocaine, running around my brain
Miss Ghetto be like cocaine, running around your brain

I know some crack slingers, crack slingers and cracker shankers
They soldier-train us, teaching their kids to murder strangers
They live for danger, they express the ""I a Nigga""
Miss Ghetto got 'em dreaming of loot and Swiss bankers
The finest weapons, packing tri-action Smith and Wessons
Unlike the 80's, ladies packing 680's(?)
The shit is crazy, but it's like the ghetto babies
They gotta eat, so the streets provide the gravy
I thought that maybe I could show them that other way G
of Gods and Earths, resurrected through mental birth
From death to life, teaching niggas of every type
The wrongs and rights, to put an end to living trife
The black man is God, the 12th jewel is thirteen
The pursuit of it can make savages out of kings
Cause blush, to live with these niggas is in a rush
In God they trust, so they sell crack to us
Lust for what whitey got and whitey has
Can see your ass on pursuit to get cash
To look thrash, to driving the latest jags
To rock rags made by Italian fags
See, I never meant to fall in love with this shit
But Miss Ghetto you's a slut so I'm divorcing you bitch
Bust it

Chorus:
I ain't marrying Miss Ghetto again 
First chance I get to bounce world life I'm bouncing (x2)

She's like cocaine running around my brain
(No matter how much loot I get I'm staying in the projects) (x2)

Down in my gutter
Just like others there's teenage mothers
There's dying brothers, shooting out with one another
They wanted badly, for sisters to call them Daddy
To drive a Caddy, stories unheard by Dear Abby
They're dressing flashy
Can't be caught in fatigue khakis
They're rocking cool G(?), versace and cold boots G
These brothers do it for the love of the life
But I refuse to fall twice and take Miss Ghetto to wife
I used to sex her, bust my nut, get my cash real fast
But that was all that she produced, I felt my life wouldn't last
We used to go to New York, traffic guns of all sort
When killing became sport street life became short
I thought, ""Are we junkies like these baseheads, Yo
They addicted to the crack while we addicted to dough""
For truly, I never meant to fall in love with this shit
But Miss Ghetto you's a slut so I'm divorcing you bitch
Bust it

Chorus

See, there go some niggas that I used to roll with
Still on that crack and gun shit
Endless pursuit to rush shit, bust it
Miss Ghetto got 'em strung out on the putang cream
That does up Wu-Tang fiends 
For slingin cocaine, dig it
We used to do the bumper crack for the sex
While making love to the checks, Miss Ghetto's steelo complex
Living trifling, no matter where my life went
Miss Ghetto, my new wife, went she made it more exciting
Fighting, shooting out, doing all types dirt
Being these, seeing G's putting in much work
Word, we used to keep a sisters underwear laced
With ganja and freebase and bo juice to parlay
Flip! Me and my niggas ran the strip pushing dips
Black cats and plastics, fucking the minds of black kids
Till one day, I was confronted by this wise old chap
He said, ""I know you sell crack, but what, you out to kill blacks?""
I wasn't trying to hear it, my excuse sorta weak
I said that we gotta eat, that's why we running these streets
Then he said, ""Don't you know that whitey give you that coke,
that bullshit pursuit of plush that got you killing your folk?""
Life, I didn't understand that shit back then
But now I do so I refuse to roll with whitey again
Bust it
I ain't marrying Miss Ghetto again
First chance I get to bounce word life I'm bouncing, niggas.

I ain't marrying Miss Ghetto again
First chance I get to bounce word life I'm bouncing, niggas.

Chorus x2

See Gods, you like cocaine, fucking with my brain
You like cocaine, running around my brain
For the love of this...",Miss Ghetto,1996

You know what I'm saying?

Just like knowledge is infinite
I'm God and I'm living it
Giving it all that I've got
Shots lick and Bic lighters flick
I strike a pose, strike my mic with these flows
Am I nice?  I suppose
Heaven knows I'm on some other shit
Sisters and shows call me boombastic
I feel I'm dime-blasted
Stamp on it girl, I'm telling you
For truly strong like that's the God that's in me
She was my agony, and no idea, see
I educate you through the teacher in me
There ain't no reefer in me
One swig of malt licquor end a nigga
I touch the mic and universally greet
Rising earths with peace
And you know how I'm like that
Do this for blacks stranded in projects
Cashing welfare checks, we gots to do what we gots to
My peoples flip for the slang I spit
Shots ring, I trip, grip this plastic
I gots to stay refined, body and mind

Ginseng and juice, chew sticks I chew
We watch lecture spots, shake hands with the ock
Heads'll clap non-stop, dock and yes give props
Hip hop fly on top all blacks up on lock
P.R.T. crew drops life in your head-top
One hundred thirty seven one third miles per hour
I put your planet in continuous revolution
Penetrate, dry mist from a lake
Create rain, snow, sleet, hail and earthquakes
Snowflakes under the surface of the spot that you stand
See God is a man, and you can't deny that
I set it off, let it off it pops
Fuck track backdrops for fat raps I rock
Knoledge, me going deaf kiss the sky like Meth
Rise above earthly matters watch the truth undress
I saw the moon turn to blood, watch the sun go black
Sisters crying come back, cause now the whole world lacks science
Recognize the infinite size

Back in the day before the words became flesh
Poor Righteous Teachers ran shit in a triple stage of blackness
I spat the spit fact this chick gave birth
To black gods on earth, cause I be cream of the planet G
You notice me, freaking shit like Jodeci
Who the fuck you supposed to be? Siegfried and Wise
Love outburst mercy if my word ever fail
I accepted death I saw through my words being false
Splendid way of life, knowledge and wisdom complete
Understanding, over-standing on this Superman beat
Poor Righteous Teachers sat back
Saw what it was that y'all lack
Culture designed the attack
We got one Clark for the track
Set it off it's bond, true
Word is bond
I got my cellular phone cause the wisdom's calling
Keep 'em refined, body and mind

Cause' else perfect ways, shell Adidas

Smellin' reefer, way before purple haze
Private stock, peer nigga, with ill walks like Mark Clare
Has tilted wild, niggaz, lickin' shots in the air

Ain't nothin' changed but the names Nostradamus and Blitz
What project is this? Q.B., burnin' in tint
12th street murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat
What could you tell me? Niggas, seen it all in this game
When it's all said and done just remember our name

I'm familiar with the dead grass drama, black gates and crime
Embryo of the ghetto born, face and time
Niggas, shatter they dreams while I'm chasing mine
Ghetto fame, got a fellow's name draped and shined
How do I describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted?

Where corruptors and new police being recruited
Somehow I make it through the day stayin' secluded
While the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed
Many thought's 'cause I see the past grimly

That could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street
Through all the pap grease and street chases
Sudden raids and confrontations, leadin' the misdeamenor weed cases
I blew smoke through hallway window

Watched the buddah clouds lingo
Pluckin' the blunt brokes from my fingers
My eyes flip different shades
Similar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways

Seein' nothing but another day
In this six story rat trap
Them gats clap, another nigga's blazed
Events in my hood rotate

Like the battle on the thirty-eight
Snob in the world of fake love
Before I blaze son, I'm kissing the slugs
Coming at you kisses and hugs

When death calls, who's really a thug
The street glory got me deeply in love
Can't shake it, can't take it, can't make it
Got me needin' this drug

Remember me, when I use to write my rhymes in class
At Dick Dall Middle School, all them niggaz would laugh
Telling me I would never make it, cause I rap too fast
I was desperately trying to find out, how to go from scraps to cash
Remember, how y'all use to chase me home from school
Just cause I sported corduroy britches, and Pro Wing shoes
I use to have a lunch card, cause them times was hard
Since the seven people living in one house, with no cars in the yard
I remember stressing so hard, I couldn't keep my focus
My only love was for extras, and overs
Fuck all you niggaz, don't make me slap the fuck out all you niggaz
If it ain't related to making paper, I ain't calling you niggaz
I bet Mo City remember, when I took it over with rapping
51-11 Ridgevan, moving that crack bitch I was stacking
Residuals redeemingly, I was raw mayn raw caine
Rapidly running my neighborhood, I was the law mayn
'Member when I dropped my first album, in '98
Fucking with Herman Fisher, but now that nigga hate me he's a cake
Suppose to be mad at me, tal'n bout I owe him some change
Nigga just mad cause they can't eat with me, I eat with Lil' James

They use to rank on my low budget clothes, and my glasses

[P.O.P.:]
I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights
No gas no lights, a ghetto low life
So my flow twice as strong, from the memories
I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies
See niggaz tend to be, down when your bread up
But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck
Yeah I remember that, so you remember this
Hard times be my fuel, so I ain't finna quit
I vividly, R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R
Craig up in the E-R, bloody getting CPR
So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory
I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me
Me P.O.P., so many forgot bout
But not I, this for those who remember little Popeye
And I remember hot guys, ridiculed the flow
Now I'm front and center nigga, haters finna do me so

Shit I remember back in the game, it was tough
No matter what a nigga had, it was never enough
See if I had five I wanted ten, and if I had ten I wanted twenty
Fuck having some, shit I wanted plenty
Back in the gap, when I first hit the block
With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks
Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch
Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch
I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college
And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge
That broke her heart, and for that I had to go
So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show
Everything came slow, and nothing came fast
Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass
But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G
I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B

Pop Da Brown Hornet,"[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Gon' keep that spectacular, free shit
Knowhatimean?
Put a condom in ya ear, I'm bout to make love to it

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
I'm not sure, no more, constant war
What's it all for? Everybody out here poor
Niggas cuttin throat, got crack heads sellin soap
Little shorties down the block, pushin dope and coke
Try and make it out the ghetto, where you gon run to
Oh I see he got you, exactly where he wants you
In the projects, doin fucked up things
Like sellin crack, it's like my whole family fiends
If it ain't one thing, it's bound to be another
Peace to all three time felons, word to mother
Niggas gettin hit with outrageous bids
While the next man in the world raisin ya kid
Now what you gon do, it's all up to you
Be your own man, or run behind your crew
If you get bag, don't expect no help
In the street life, everybody roll for delf

Chorus 2X:
Black on black crime, you know it gotta stop
It's time that my peeps, we start reachin for the top
The only way we gonna get there, is together
Let's start the revolution, you know I'm for whatever

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
If I had one wish, every black man would be rich
Own they own property, have they tailor made shit
In peacefully, in luxury, comfortably
Every memory, would be a butter milk fantasy
We enjoy the great outdoor, fuck war
Everyday live, would be like a paid rapper on tour
Without the problems, we don't really need them
Every wiz would be a dime, every nigga be handsome
The only drug would be jarweed, with a little bonbon jee
That's all a black man need
Money would be somethin that we burn in the fire
While livin in Alaska, with ya midnight desire
Sippin on Dacarri, happily, enjoyin the scenery
Snow fall, natural like a girl's virginity
Every time be like the first time
Somethin like the last time
Remindin you of your past time
When things bob you wasn't that great
Robbin niggas for waste, up ya childhood upstate
Couldn't escape, the gun slingin, flower bringin
Under the buildin, callin yourself kingpinnin'

Aiyo, got ya muthafucka seein stars

Blastin muthafuckas out the muthafuckin box
(Out the box)

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
Shake rattle & roll, ratters than ya peasants ya peasants
Form a line, while I'm handin out presents
Stiff jabs or stiff kicks, for a nigga
Big back with stiff dick, for my bitches

Burn like a cancer stick, free loaded spit
Them cops that killed Diallo, they can suck my dick
41 shots, enough lead to take a city exam
Or ain't that one man with the NYPD

Who need the Ku Klux Klan
I ain't runnin or hiddin, like 2Pac I'm riddin and dyin
New York, New York, It's where brothers are sport
Make it to the playoffs, don't get happy get ya head blown off

We got dick for nuts, puttin fingers on red buttons
Ready to launch, tellin us, turnin ya arms
Hell no baby, ya devils must be crazy
Out of ya mind, I'm holdin on to my nine

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
You hold every sentimental
As for me, I lost my feelings somewhere inside the temple
Where they got throat cutters and back stabbers
A life is lost right in front of your eyes, nothing really matters

You just go on living, Projects is like prison
We got fags and dikes, razor blades and knives
Homo thugs, and all type of drugs
Addicts, snitches, bitches, holdin ya pictures

With nothin on but a thong
Fuck me, leave at night, for a trailer visit, fuck you in the morn
Bad boys, we killin toys, they muffle and noise
Never lose they boys, they just keep on squeezin

Bodies drop for no reason, kill you for breathin
Rumble till we even, or till one of us die
Eye for an eye, yo it's no more Mr. Nice Guy
Heads gotta fly, we 'em up, let 'em hang dry

Choke 'em till they pass out, wake up in ya briefs
Playin for keeps, yo fuck you and your peeps
Never had it good, my last album went wood
Bought my words when you hear this, I'm movin out the hood

Takin no prisoners, no eye witnesses, if ya sensitive
Back up, you want no part of this
Ghetto bastard, who never got his ass kicked
I just stay kickin ass, got the mic and the smash

Step up, feel the blast from the Brown Bomber
You don't really want drama, quick to start shit
But then go runnin to ya mama ""Dial 911
Brown Hornet on the new cent, he fuckin with my son""

Bitch tell that piece of shit to finish what he started
With this cold hearted, half retarded, hip hop artist
Weak rapper, told ya lame ass not to cry
But you gotta fry fuckin wit no more Mr. Nice Guy

Ai-yo, ai-yo, ai-yo, this Smoke right here
The new millennium, ain't no more Mr. nice guy

When you see us in the streets, no more Mr. nice guy

What's goin on world?
It's Pop Da Brown Hornet
Chillin wit Black, Blackstreet, Chauncey
This song is dedicated to, inspired by
Brother of mine, Poo Johnson
My love baby, this for you

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
A childhood friend of mine, was shot to death
I visioned his body, fo' they lay him to rest
The autopsy showed he was hit in the head, in the chest
Weakened the strip, straight through his flesh
Whoever responsible will see the judge
I hold no grudge, I fight evil with love
I hear no evil, and I see non either
Comin from believin the creator
As a juvenile, I would often sit and wonder
Starin out the window at the lightning and thunder
Will they better days for mom dukes and me, at birth
She wrapped up her dreams and gave them to me
Genetically, I could feel the energy
Pullin me towards my destiny, it was meant to be
Eventually, it'll all pay off
If you want it bad enough, you gotta give what it costs

[Chorus]
Every woman, every man
To spread the news across the land
Stand up, stand up, stand up
Everybody, there has to be a better plan
Stand up, stand up, stand up

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
Nothin in life for free, not even death
Can know and at em, cut out to be the best
With we form mistakes, no one was born perfect
Be careful who you love, because they might no deserve
The knowledge that I drop, pure enough to worship
As for Pop the individual, I'm just a mere mortal
I'm trying to make it out of poverty
Buy some property, build for the family
Establish and establishment
Put the proceeds I receive from entertainment
All I want is love-love, so I can retire the all black knockout glove
And just touch you in the mental, reach the next level
Weed out the devil, assemble the puzzle
Blow up a 8X10 so you can see the big picture
Take care of self, we can all get richer

[Chorus]

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
Yo, any day could be our last, a world full of psychopaths
Learn ya math, or you just might crash
How to reality and into insanity
In this cold world we can't even trust family
Nowhere to turn when you stuck in between a
Concrete jungle and a pack of hyenas
Scavenger huntin, ain't no time for frontin
Brothers in the street with nothin
Always tryin to take somethin from somebody
They usually pray on the week, 
sacrifice a life 'cause somehow they gotta eat
No regrets when actin out threats
It's a different world when growin up inside the Projects
Outsiders get hawked by night riders
You bound to get game in a world full of liars
You gotta stand firm on shaky grounds
Yo Chauncey, break it down for Da Brown

It's only Pop and I'm hangin MC's like a stockin
Leavin them no option, throwin the towel
Or gettin they face boxed in
No time for B.S.'in, second guessin, all that's outta the question
I'm here to terrorize, make rappers apologize
I refuse to lose, I'm beat, battered and bruised
Now that I'm on, fuck payin dudes
Fuck all of youse, I'm bad news to goody two shoes
Who be finger snappin and toe tappin
I'm that kid that keep it crackin, 'cause I'm what's happenin
I love this game with a passion, stop askin
How do you like me now, that I'm the last one laughin
Hole fucked up, puffin on Alaskan
Hundred miles an hour, eyes closed, without crashin
Constantly, I gotta flip they wig
For I'm the kid, that got the state pumpin in they trips
CD, cassette, car, jeep, chopper or plane
Girls screamin my name, it's all part of the game
No sloppy copies, it's ya black Poppy
Rollin in between the sheets, been missin for weeks

The sun neva chill, I melt down ya ice grill
Cats be coolin down, I neva had, I neva will
I refuse to stop, look around the rock
That's why no one can do it quite like MC Pop

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
Ladies and gentlemen, feel the adrenaline rush
Two triple oh, from poor to plush
Started workin out, I went from gut to cuts
Now when they see me it be ""ooh"" and ""ahh""
Before they used to call me a want to be rap star
Now they tellin stories on how we used to hang
And how they encouraged me to keep doing my thing
Funny how non believers, want to take the credit
They so pathetic, but me don't sweat it
I stay focus, they hocus pocus
Disappear in the struggle, reappear when ya bubble
Where was you in my time of need
Now you smell success, you stick around like creed
To smoke up all the weed, ya drink up all the Guinness
Don't want to leave until everything finish
Same muthafucka who curse ya name
Be the same muthafucka who soft you for ya gleam
Then tell me, ""Don't complain, it's part of the game""

What you want? House squad, I'm here to clean out the pipe
Here to make it right, make sure the rhymes keep flowin
Minds stay blowin, my jobs are constantly showin
How to do that deal like the All I Seeyin
Rappers get scared, they start Caller I.D.'ing
Afraid to get the message there career's been terminated
And Pop Da Brown has officially graduated 
into the ranks of top contention
And while I'm here I have to give mention 
to my mom, my dad, they knew the time
Other leaders get the dick, your world was mine
Stripped of ya shine, know you just as bright as a bird
Haven't you heard, heard, heard

Truth in a silent place
Hope when it's hopeless and
There's nothing left to save

I'm all broken up all the pieces unglued
I'm seeing everything that I had float away
Thrown the side like a cast away

Where are you now?
Where are you now?

You know it weighs me down
Pressure building all around
You said you'd never let me drown
But now I'm dead in the water
Time washing over

Sinking till I'm out of sight
You said you'd bring me back to life
But now I'm dead in the water

Drenched in a sorrow of the

See when you blinded by the
Flood filling up my lungs

So many questions always unanswered
Still we bleed for the answers
Ash to dust bleed we must
Will it all be undone when the kingdom comes

Built to simply be shattered
This isolation still concerning
Just letting go of the unknown
Sometimes leads me to madness
Instead we choose to spend our days in blackness

Pop Love,"[Chorus: x 2]
I'm gonna tell 'em that I'm not here
Ain't taking no calls today
Time to refresh and do it all my way
Get off my back
Not taking orders
It's time to refresh, make tracks and sing

[The Grouch]
Bring about that piece of mind and recline
Let your guard down and see what you find
Inhale and exhale deeply, get loose
Stretch out your muscles and squeeze you some juice

Light that incense up and then bless your space
Go to that place where the calm is on your face
I promise that a taste of this is pure bliss
Where thought grows freely and minutes mean shit

I'm up in it clean fit, dreamin' so vivid
I let it all radiate, you see how I'm livin'
Energized and rested, tested time after time
I'm impressed with my body and mind

My hobby's so strenuous I gotta cool out
Focus on health so that I'm not ruled out
Exercise my knowledge and abolish all stress
Get a good sleep and tomorrow I press

Today I'm...

[Chorus: x 2]

[Bicasso]
Now let's pretend that I was just born
A niggas first breath, heartbeat, a life with no scorn
It wasn't me, it was the egos of MCs they say
The mic tempt me too

But like the dollars makes 'em fishy dude ok
The average day I got the duties of a lifeguard for myself
When I'm swimmin' in a system makes it so hard
But at the rest I just post up fine,

Patrol my coastline and make the most of my mind
Create the envelope and push it to the people on the avenue
The ones stuck in they offices, this world is a vacuum
But my sauce it got some smack too

Like on a Sunday afternoon I got you tuned into the spiciness
Blended just right with this in the pocket like some jeans
Or the rhythm of these funk strings and I might just get
Another dosage of this slow shit

It's bumpin in my system and my soul too,
It's what I do when I'm alone, it's like some soul food
I wouldn't just get up from the table man, it's too smooth
This groove is better than any wrong thing

And if the phone rings I'm'a hit 'em back now
Let the song sing...

[Chorus: x 2]

[Pep Love]
I'm unavailable for comment
I'd rather go sail my boat and ride the tail of a
Comet, inhale of the chronic, a glass of orange juice,
Read a book, write a poem,

Hike a trail in the forest dude!
Breathe in fresh air
Release pressure
Extend and bend and strength yeah!

Burn a incense, silence my mind in a instant
Because now is the time and I'm in this
It gets me open like Halls Mentholyptus
Pine cones and eucalyptus leaves

Mushrooms and wild flowers bloom
And cool Cali breeze
Make me feel superhuman
I might fly a kite, go home rock the mic

Throw on a song I like, call up my girl to bone
I'm in my own world, a zone
And it be them days like this when I don't answer the phone
I'm clearing my space

Excuse me while I take this brief intermission
From out the rat race
No hustle and bustle though my muscles are strong
I just don't want to do nothing

But sing my song...

Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

Pop Will Eat Itself,"Built to stay the place
Not lazy! Bleary eyed
A wide berth crazy
Taken easy
Lived the steazy lifestyle
On the jaws of a crocodile
Wired and fired up
To erode the '90s
Total overload excites me
Standing naked
Come to make it fall apart
For all the wild at heart
Party people
With hearty appetites
Start at Z 'cause we get up at night
Walk a tightwire
Breathing fire and thunder
Then we're dead and down under
CHORUS
Expressway to a higher heaven
A long ride up
A quick slide down
Expressway to a higher heaven
A slow slow fuck and
A slow slow suck
Psychedelic love flow freely
Hold in high esteem hold dearly
When you're near me
We'll positively gravitate
Just wait you'll see
Born to live and love
Not to push and shove
Here to give hope and rise above
All the bullshit and all the crap
'cause we got it like that
CHORUS
Slow! Slow! Slow! Slow! Slow!
I got no questions
I got all answers
I give no reasons I got no time
I live in splendour
I'll die in chaos
I'd love to stay but I got no time
The real deal
Is a steal of quality
Sex and death and
Know no apologies
Free of ties and
Of all lies and disguise
I use a wise guy's eyes
When we've sown the seeds
Of passion we'll explode
In a most artistic fashion
First to explore
A kiss before dying
Now's the time for trying
The golden age of junk
Toys are Us
Drunken joys
In Bacchus we trust
God of wine and
Divine giver of ecstacy
Read: Sugar and strychnine
Surging forward
Urging persistence
To the pineapple
Of our existence
We satisfy and gratify
Our senses
Fraid we're made in the '60s
Born to live and love
Not to push and shove
Here to give hope and
Rise above
All the bullshit and all the crap
'cause we got it like that
CHORUS

I give no reasons I got no time

Celebrating being young

I'd like to think I'm an adventurous chicken...

Instead of listening to the don'ts,

I wish I was teenage
Instead I am your grandad
I thought when I reached 27
I'd be either in hell or heaven,
Had a heart attack and went epileptic,
Almost prophetic as it was pathetic.
I looked grim,
Shook the cold hand of panic,
Said, ""Have a nice death.""
But I'm no Titanic
And now I'm riding like the Headless Horseman,
On the run! On the run! On the run, yeah!

To tell you nothing but lies

Yeah you want the big one, you'll have to queue and if you do you're gonna get some
This is, this is, this is Cape Connection

London Town is traffic hell, it's freeze frame in 3D
Drunken and pedestrian, taken from behind
Welcomes me so willingly
She calls my name coming baby coming

[Chorus]

This is, this is, this is Cape Connection
This is, this is, this is Cape Connection",Cape Connection [TransGlobal Underground Cossack in UFO Enounter Confus,1995
Pop Will Eat Itself,"Is everybody happy? 
Everbody's happy now! 
Everybody's singing! 
Everbody's happy, maahn! 
We're bulletproof! 

You + I! 
Unify! 
You + I! 
Unify! 
You + I! 
Unify!",Bulletproof,1995
Pop Will Eat Itself,"Get up! It's time! 
Get up and make it snappy! 

Dance like a psycho 
A sight like nothing on earth 
Keep a wide berth 
>From anyone you might know 
So no first night nerves 
All first serves! All aces! 
Straight home bases 
Sweating like a pig doing the jig 
At the gig of the century 
Because we'll never be 
Told by the old school 
Sold the old rules 
Tho' we're no fools 
Downbeats down to earth 
You down with me? 
Clowning round the town 
Step easy 
Cooking up new tricks 
Looking for a new kick 
Found a new sound 
Found that it sticks 

Heard about the bird 
'Bout the plane and 
The superman? 
Word is: We can outlast anyone 
Supercede the superfly guys 
Who will concede 
They are dying flies 
This range of suss 
Could be dangerous 
Let's test! At best it's religious 
At worst a thirst 
Bursting for the next rhyme 
All times sacred 
Even stripped naked 
This damned nation 
Needing salvation 
Reach out! 
Teach in musical elation 
Shout! Get out of it get within it 
Get out of it get within it 

All the way mad and bad 
All the way hyped 
Play it mad DJ! Play it bad DJ 
All the way mad and bad 
All the way hyped 

Are you with me 
Are you with it? 

A musical nasty 
Fast as it has to be 
A catastrophe 
Heavy duty chaos 
'cause I'm all attitude 
The dude to kickstart 
The party mood 
Cue the truth: 
Sleuths are never sober 
The proof of youth 
So move over rover 
Hey! Disco King 
You've stopped dancing 

Best admit 
This hit's an obsession 
Lost in lust 
Better listen to the lessons 
Bright lights big city 
Broad minds 
Bored pretty easily 
Busted just for justice sake 
They can't control a soul 
Ther's an outbreak 
Of outrageous love 
It's contageous and 
It's here to save us 
Some say: 
""Now way DJ don't play 
The laterst the greatest 
The mad and bad way."" 
If it ain't music use it abuse it 
Call it a wall of noise 
But don't refuse it 

This damned nation 
Needing salvation 
Reach out! 
Teach in musical elation 
Shout! Get out of it get within it 
Get out of it get within it 
Dedicated to all the bores 
All the whores 
Who forced the laws 
You thought 
We'd stop dancing and 
You were wrong 

1-2-3-4-5-6-7 
Kiss my ass and go to heaven 
Y.O.U. spells you",Dance of the Mad,1996
Pop Will Eat Itself,"Escaping the twilight, drinking till sunrise
I never thought a head like this would persist
I could be dead at 33 like Belushi
Drain myself away like Hancock in Sydney

Who knows? Who cares?
Who'll remember anyway?

Welcome to hell
Spend your time in hell
I could try to change it but it suits me too well
A not so private hell

You feed my hunger but drown all my senses
In the satisfaction stakes, it's like sitting on the number nine bus
I can't stop me, you can't stop me, I can't stop me, you can't stop me
One's too many, ten's not enough

Welcome to hell
Spend your time in hell
I could try to change it but it suits me too well
A not so private hell, welcome to hell

Feels good to be back with Charlie and Hattie and my memory lapse
Welcome to hell, welcome to hell, welcome to hell
","Eat Me, Drink Me, Love Me, Kill Me",1996
Pop Will Eat Itself,"Here to sing, by request, 
Here we bring England's finest! 
By request, England's finest
PWEI",England's Finest,1996
Pop Will Eat Itself,"In 1991 got glassed
Cousin got murdered, friend got attacked
House next door to ours got ransacked again

But seeing is believing, hearing is receiving
Deaf and blind world, I don't believe in
Blinded by light, flattened by sound
Over and out-underground

Down here, talk to us, we'll here, the future is here
Walk with us from here
In 1993, I will be three O years inside this body
I don't know what's going on outside me

But seeing is believing, hearing is receiving
A deaf and blind world, I don't believe in
Blinded by light, flattened by sound
Over and out-underground

Down here, talk to us
We'll hear, the future will heal
Walk with us from here
",Harry Dean Stanton,1996
