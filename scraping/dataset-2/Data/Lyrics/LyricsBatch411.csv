Only two for tea, dear

No more blue songs

You've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight

If there's anything at all

All I'll ever be I'll owe you

Makes me sure enough of me

Thanks for everything we did
Everything that's past, every thing's that's over too fast
None of it was wasted, all of it will last
Everything that's here and now and us together

It was marvelous to know you and it's really through
Crazy business this, this life we live in
Can't complain about the time we're given
With so little to be sure of in this world

Jane Siberry,"I reached the desert as the sun was rising
On the day that you were passing through
The caravan you travelled in was crowded
I didn't like the people around you 

Those people hushed me when I tried to call you
The pushed me back and would not let me through
And these thin arms weren't strong enough to part them
So back into the roadside rocks I withdrew 

Sometimes I am nervous when the night comes
I hear so many noises that are new
But I try not to think of you too often
I try not to use the beads you threw 

Oh babe I conjured you up by mistake
I know that I'm supposed to wait
But when will I see you again 

In daytime I do dances for the tourists
I strike a pose I hope they can't ignore
My hope is to attract your caravan to me
And then beat them to your side before they know 

Oh babe I'm really sitting by the road
I hug my knees and hope that I'll see you
I made up that bit about the dances
But it keeps me from using the beads you threw 

Oh babe I conjured you up by mistake
I know that I'm supposed to wait
But when will I see you again 

Your caravan told me I was not one of them
Because the way I talked was not part of their school
I made too much fun of California
Well--I made too much fun of paper tools 

You yourself--you told me not to join them
You said I would do better where I was
But is this really true--I get so lonely
The only wine that fills me up is you 

Oh babe I conjured you up by mistake
I know that I'm supposed to wait
But when will I see you again 

I am not as nervous when the night comes
And darkness falls among these desert rocks
Even though I still touch your beads and wish for you
Waiting becomes easier than not 

Oh babe I conjured you up by mistake
I know that I'm supposed to wait
I just wanted to see you again
But when will I see you again
When?

",The Magic Beads,1981
Jane Siberry,"How did I ever get into this mess
I fell in the river and I wrecked my dress
I wanted to look good because he's coming tonight
And he's bringing me things that I like

Oh Marco, I'm shallow
But I don't want you to think
That you're buying my love
With these things

The last place you wrote from was Constantinople
I am not impressed Marco I've been around
Well, anyways I told our friends and we'll meet you at the warehouse
Down by the docks tonight

Oh Marco, I'm shallow
But I don't want you to think
That you're buying my love
With these frivolous things

But I'm dying for dresses
And I've run out of perfume
And I'm pining for a wine
That is halfway decent

Please don't think I'm forward but I made a reservation
At our favorite restaurant tonight for two
And if you need a place to stay I mean if all the hotels are full
Well, my room-mate is gone for the weekend

Oh Marco, I'm shallow
But I don't want you to think
That you're buying my love

Jane Siberry,"Ogwen--Bessie's gone
Bessie's gone away 

I looked in the high meadow for her
I think she's gone
I looked down by the river
And I looked behind the barn 

Ogwen--Bessie's gone
Bessie's gone away 

I saw this girl down by the fence
In the morning mist
She was telling things to Bessie
It looked strange--I wonder if... 

Ogwen--Bessie's gone
Bessie's gone away 

Well, maybe it's a blessing
What with winter coming on
Because the man who owns this farm
Was going to sell her to the yards 

Oh, I hope she really got away
Ogwen--we are old
I guess nothing is ever ours
So much that we don't know 

Ogwen--Bessie's gone
Bessie's gone away

",The Mystery at Ogwen's Farm,1981
Jane Siberry,"We're going to the seashore
Gonna burst upon the brine
From a car that's full of babies
And dogs and food and wine
Sand in our suits and salt in our hair
And everyone feeling so fine 

The sky is so blue
You can see right through
My heart is so big
I can't get through the door
That's what I'm here for 

We're going to the country
And we're gonna plant some wheat
We're gonna steal some cow corn
And drive across the fields
Dance around the scarecrows
And do whatever we please 

We're going to the country
In our little deux-chevaux
We're gonna put the top down
Crank the radio up full
Honk at all the cars we meet
And let them know we know 

The sky is so blue... 

We're going to the mountains
If there's still a little snow
Gonna do some spring-skiing
Go as fast as we can go
Give instructions from the chairlift
And tell all those tourists to go for it 

See the shorts and t-shirts
Go whizzing through the trees
With their Hollywood sunglasses
And the scratches on their knees
Yodelling on the mountainside
And cutting the air like chickadees 

The sky is so blue... 

We're going to the cliffs now
To see if we can fly
I think I could do better
With your wing out of my eye
You can see for miles up here
Open heart in open sky 

The sky is so blue
You can see right through
Our hearts they are so big
We can't get through the door
That's what we're here for

",The Sky Is So Blue,1981
Jane Siberry,"One time I saw Canada fall through a hole in the sky
I do not know if I was really sad to see her go
For in her place there was a herd of early morning cows
They moved in one direction
They knew where, when, how, why not 

There is a strange well I go to
And each time
I lean, I look
I learn, I leave
I go back to town
Saying things I don't believe 

My words they're just pebbles under water
They rise like flocks of birds
They are discontinued because the well has overhead and said
Are your opinions not confirmed until you tell them to someone
And is this the lonely night not real until it has been framed as one 

There is a strange well I go to... 

I spoke about the rosewood proud and I said this river is wise
And I said these mountains are all-seeing
Said the well--you must realize
That once again your words have pulled the universe out of place
To exist it need not have a human face 

There is a strange well I go to... 

And sometimes when I go there and my heart is clear
There are no visions--there are no sounds to hear
Oh strange well--does your voice rise and fall
When I am away
And do your watercolours run like they're doing today 

There is a strange well I go to
And each time
I lean, I look
I learn, I leave
I go back to town
Saying things I don't believe 

",The Strange Well,1981
Jane Siberry,"It is very quiet here--so still
I don't live here--I live down the hill
On this winter's afternoon
The distant sun--it slowly swings the room around
This room hangs on a golden chain
Suspended
Frozen
Frozen in time since you went away 

Walking through your rooms I though your things
Fitting--these aren't fingers these are wings
It says April on your calendar
It's winter now--I wonder where you are
I hope it's warm and sunny--or cold and windy
As long as you're fine 

Your house is as tumble-down as mine
Crumpled papers everywhere like mine
This one says ""I'll write no more""
That one says ""don't lock the door""
Writers are a funny breed
I should know 

You said someday when we're pure and high
We won't need to capture and describe
The things we see or don't see
We'll let things be
Let things be
That's when you'd leave 

And that is why I had to come today
My mad scribbling crumpled, crippled, fey
Tossing words from ledges that erode
From ledges--I am not a goat
I am not a piece of chalk
I just want to do it right like you 

And now I stand here in your house
Everything's so still
I wonder if I'll write again
Or let things be
Writers are a funny breed 

",Writers Are a Funny Breed,1981
Jane Siberry,"I like to take a dancing class each year
It helps myself to keep in touch with me
And the girls I meet are different than the ones I meet at work
And there's always at least one sensitive guy

There is a girl I like to pair up with, she comes from Germany
She's beautiful and I like the way she dresses
And I like the way she moves
We never speak, we only acquiesce

There is a mirror in the locker room
And sometimes after class, we stay and dance
And she always shows me new steps
And I try to follow her, follow her
Berlin is far away

I must stay, I must stay in shape
I must try, I must try new steps
Must perfect, must perfect each move
That's harder

I will try that then but sometimes, sometimes I have fears
A strange and, a strange and dark force is trying
Trying to pry me, pry me from, pry me from myself
This is why, this is why I move, this is why, this is why I dance
Must protect, must perfect each step
I must try, I must dance faster

This is the last dancing class I'll have
The announcement came tonight after the class
She said you're two hundred years old now
There's no one left to hold you, this is the last dancing class you'll have

Like flies, like little flies
Blowing like a grouper fish
Floating through the reefs

His card says executive
But it mumbles just a salesman
He's not sure just who you are
But you might be a good connection

Extra executives with a general desire
Extra executives with a general desire
General desire, general desire
He took a course in sales
He's never been the same

A certain way to do things
Respect for expectations
His bank gets a promotion
But his brain gets a vacation

He's looking over your shoulder
At the party for a person
Who will change his life
Reward him somehow
Hey, I'm talking to you

Extra executives with a general desire
Extra executives with a general desire
General desire, general desire
He took a course in sales
He's never been the same

One time

Everything's an exercise
For the extra executive
He's not sure just who you are
But you might be a good connection

Blowing kisses off his face
Like flies, like little flies
Blowing like a grouper fish
Floating through the reefs

Waiting for that special deal in the sky
That he never has to trade in

The telephone call that never comes
The letter's not in the letter box
The handshake that will close the deal
The telegram that will change his life

Jane Siberry,"I want you to love the things you love and even more
Follow me, follow me less gives less and more gives more
Is your love sweeter now than it was before?
Cross purpose love it never flies true love's pure
It magnifies follow me, follow me

It always surprises me when I make you laugh
When you laugh at me follow me,follow me
Makes me want to do it more I like your laugh
It pleases me I see the lake behind the trees
Flashing in ones and twos and threes follow me, follow me

There is nothing you need that you don't have or can't do
I have love and so I stay I have none so I go away
Follow me, follow me you have no love, you need me now
So I go away I free you now I'll see you later on my love
Got to go down to rise above follow me, follow me

You would love to see me now, you'd love to be with me
Follow me, follow me hold me close and don't let go

Jane Siberry,"My baby
I know I make him feel so good
He's prostrate on the highest cloud
I love to be with him
With him I love to be
Of him I wish to muse aloud 

and I know what he's thinking
I know what he's saying
I know what he's doing 

when he's waking down the street
He smiles at all the girls
The girls --- they smile at him
I fill my baby up
I fill him up with so much love
He falls in love with them 

and I know... 

...and I feel so fine
And I feel so good
Feel so fine... 

everything looks beautiful to him especially girls
He wants to be with them
And if he wants to be
With all the girls he meets
It's 'cause I make him feel so good

And there's a beautiful fire
And you're looking out the window
(At the snow and the winter streets below)
But your eyes keep returning to the fire

This is what I'm thinking
The reason your eyes keep returning to the fire
Is because it divides your sight
Into left and right, and dark and light and dark
Like a fine dividing wire

Here's another thing
That I noticed last night
When he kissed me over there
He usually kissed me over here, too

I must have known it in my heart
And with my inner sense of art
Because when I kiss him over there
I never kiss him over here

It's the way of the world
People do it everywhere
If you're going to do it over here
Then usually they do it over there too

Symmetry is the way things have to be
Symmetry is the way things have to be

Or say you're at a table
And you have your forks and knives
Do you move them around
'Til you get them just right?
(This is while you're talking to someone)

Or you work in a nightclub
And you notice that
Even though you try to seat everyone on one side of the room
They always spread themselves out evenly from this side to that
Like atoms in a model

It's the way of the world
People do it everywhere
If you're going to do it over here
Then usually they do it over there too

Symmetry is the way things have to be
Symmetry is the way things have to be

Or say you're in an air show
And you're flying with two other pilots
And you want to do it right
Because you like to do it right

And one guy is flying
At the tip of your left wing
And the other guy's off
Doing his own thing
Would it bother you?
It bothers me

And it heaves once
And then it sighs once
And then there's nothing more 

so I walk on through the marshes
And my cheeks are burning white
And my hood is your rejection
And my pain is your connection
And a bird I don't recall
Called don't recall
Called don't recall
And I know you must be there
Because people stop to talk to you 

you don't need... 

and the wind howls cross the ice floes
And the frozen furrows quicken
As I stumble to the tundra
And the tundra is my lover
And I lie here
And I wait here
And I raise one arm unto the sky
And if I raise it high enough
And hold it long enough
Will the snow pull me back through? 

and it's Beddgelert and frozen dirt

I'm coming back in 500 years
And the first thing I'm gonna do
When I get back here
Is to see these things I love
And they'd better be here, better be here
Better be here

And first I'm going to find a forest
And stand there in the trees
And kiss the fragrant forest floor
And lie down in the leaves
And listen to the birds sing

And lie down in the flowers
And then I'm going to find a guitar
And play, play, play for hours
And then I'm going to find a river

Of light upon the land

Something about this old Earth
And the way it looks from up above

Something about satellites
Something about down below
Something about the hissing of that old steam iron

Across the world from town to town
Most of the time when I'm walking the line
I'm looking at the ground

Every time I hear that whistle blowing
And every time I hear that old black crow
Every time I hear that whistle blowing

Something about love
When things go wrong
When you can't find the one that you love
You keep movin' on

You walk the line alone

And the cry is sent up from this earth
Into the silent sky

You live in the valleys
And all that you know are those blackbirds
Yoou rise every morning
Wondering what in the world will the world bring today
Will it bring you joy or will it take it away
And every step you take is guided by
The love of the light on the land and the blackbird's cry
You will walk in good company

The valley is dark
The burgeoning holding
The stillness obscured by their judging
You walk through the shadows
Uncertain and surely hurting
Deserted by the blackbirds and the staccato of the staff
And though you trust the light towards which you wend your way
Sometimes you feel all that you wanted has been taken away
You will walk in good company

I love the best of you
You love the best of me
Though it is not always easy
Lovely? lovely?
We will walk in good company

Jane Siberry,"I went out with Wolf tonight, I had so many worries on my mind
I was feeling lost, feeling confused, feeling afraid--I wanted to hide
But when I got home after work Wolf would not let me stay inside
So I put on my heavy coat and kerchief and closed the door behind us 

I followed Wolf across the road,
He took a trail that leads up through the forest
I saw Wolf's shadow moving through the trees ahead of me
--don't go too fast Wolf
And finally we got to the other side
--it was so still, it was so bright and clear
For there stretched before us
Like a ballroom glove in the moonlight lay the snowfields 

It was a starry night
And the snow had stopped falling
And I feel that I heard someone singing 

Fly us to the moon
High above our upturned faces
Booming in the bright
Send some good things down on this earth tonight 

Wolf ran out into the glittering fields
--I stood and watched him from the treeline
The starry heavens danced down on the snow
Then up again like gateways gathering
Then somehow I was out there with Wolf
--I stared at him--he looked so different
Oh Wolf I can't stop laughing
But I feel somehow that everything is all right 

I don't know how many miles we traced across the snow--maybe a thousand
I followed Wolf in peace and I don't even know if we were breathing
And part of me never went home after that night--I think it stayed there
But it is in good care beneath the stars
Above the fields of snow that stretch there 

",Above the Tree Line,1992
Jane Siberry,"I was on a train
Somewhere in Spain
Sometime in the night
I drew up my knees
In second class
And watched in the blue light 

Strangers beside me
Strangers across from me
They've closed their eyes
So far away from home
The empty stations echo
As we go dreaming by 

I miss you like crazy
I wish that you were here
Holding me 

So many times
I see something
I want to show you
Like the crazy man
Crying on his violin
I game him two drachmas for you 

And every city square
Pigeons everywhere
Fountains and painters
I sit upon the step
My chin upon my knees
I watch lovers go by 

I miss you like crazy
I wish that you were here
Holding me
Because you give me peace
You give me hope
I love you 

Of course--there are other men 

Sharing in the sways and bends
Of Paris and Rome
And though I do not know
Exactly what the difference is
I never asked them home 

It made me realize
How beautiful and strange
Is the bird of love
It flies so differently
Cries so differently
From the bird of whatever the other 

",In the Blue Light,1992
Jane Siberry,"You watch the slow train moving through the city late at night
Adjusting back and forth against the darkness and street lights
I know that you're feeling bad but I'm glad you didn't lie
Easy to get caught up but you know you can always, you can always
You can always walk away

The life is the red wagon rolling along
The life is the red wagon simple and strong
The life is the red, is the red, oh, it's no big deal
But when the feet are dragging you pull for me
And I pull for you, you pull for me and I pull for you

Past the teeming marketplace and the blur of faces there
Past the silent dockyards and the darkness looming there
Maybe it won't work this time but that's the risk you take
And you want to take it and just as long as it feels right doesn't matter
Just as long as doesn't matter gotta feel good though you don't know why

The life is the red wagon rolling along
The life is the red wagon keeps the feet upon the ground
The life is the red, is the red, oh, it's no big deal
But when the feet are dragging you pull for me
And I pull for you, you pull for me and I pull for you

The life is the red wagon simple and strong
The life is the red wagon simple and strong
The life is the red wagon simple and strong

And everybody stares
They say take off that foolish hat
What man? I say

So I go down to the lobby
And everybody stares
They say take off that foolish hat
Put down that chair

So I go down to the lobby
And everyone's still there
And they say the snow is getting deeper
Don't go out there
You can't leave him like that
Go back upstairs

So I run down the fire-escape
I leap into the air
And I say, I thought I'd like to fly
I needed air

So I run down the main street
I knock some people down
And they say, I know their lips are moving
I hear no sound
Five geese flew down beside me
I ran along
I don't know what you're saying
I'm not unfair

So I go down to the lobby
And everyone's still there
And they say take off that foolish hat
Put down that chair
And they say this is your darkest hour
This is my finest moment
You can't leave him like that
He'll be okay

Jane Siberry,"I scan the horizon for you, Mimi
I scan for the both of us
I scan the horizon for you, Mimi
I stand and scan on the strand of sand
I stand and scan on the strand of sand

But first I'm sitting over here
See that giggle of guys and girls
A typical day at the beach
Well, typical 'til I make my speech

There is a girl out on the sea
Floating on a pink surfboard
With a picnic lunch and parasol
Sitting there like a typical girl

Well, this is not a locker room
And that's a surfboard, not a yacht
The arrangement's not quite, quite there

One girl laughs at skinny guys
Someone else points out a queer
Oh, they're all jocks, both guys and girls
Press the button, take your cue

And see the girl with perfect teeth
She picks up lonely guys in bars
Then she takes off when they've bought her drinks
Don't you have money? I ask
Of course I do

This is not a locker room here
And that's a surfboard, not a yacht
The arrangement's not quite, quite there

But the day was faultless in beauty pitched on tropical scenery
Stretched from white sand up to the open sky
Down to the shining sea again and then back to me
And Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach
Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi and me

Well, I'm still sitting over there
One guy just got up and brayed
They wag their words, they're all in heat
Well, I can ignore it, just don't steam up the view

And Mimi's still out on the sea
Floating on a pink surfboard
She's checking out her arms and legs
In case her casing's getting burnt

Well, this is not a locker room here
And that's a surfboard not a yacht
The arrangement's not quite, quite there

But the day was faultless in beauty pitched on tropical scenery
Stretched from white sand up to the open sky
Down to the shining sea again and then back to me
And Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach
Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi and me

You don't know me but I've been watching you all day
And I've come to the edge of the water now to have my say
The picnic lunch is off, Mimi, throw your parasol away
Put your belly to the board, Mimi and paddle out to sea
Then turn the board around, Mimi until you're facing me

Wait for the waves to start building, for the valleys to deepen
And the mountains to increase in height
When the right times comes, Mimi
You lift yourself up and stand there, Mimi
And see as far as you can see
Stand up, Mimi, stand up Mimi, stand up

I scan the horizon for you, Mimi
I scan for the both of us
I scan the horizon for you, Mimi
I stand and scan on the strand of sand
I stand and scan on the strand of sand

The great leveler is coming Mimi
And he's not going to stop to take your pulse
And he's not going to ask you why you're the way you are
And I think that's the worst part
You never get a chance to explain yourself

And he's going to take those mountains
And shove them into the valleys
Till there's nothing left except a vast expanse
And you'll float there, Mimi on the flat Sargasso Sea of your soul

And if they pull you away from your bleaching pink surfboard
And stretch you across the wind, you'll make no sound
Wet leaves on a dry map, nothing, nobody
The great leveler or the great escape?

But the day was faultless in beauty pitched on tropical scenery
Stretched from white sand up to the open sky
Down to the shining sea again and then back to me
And Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach

Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach, Mimi on the beach

Floating on a pink surfboard
A parasol floats nearby

Jane Siberry,"I could've been Miss Punta Blanca
I could've but I didn't want ta
I think I could've been a winner
If I'd gone dancing after dinner

I could've rhumba'd by the pool side
I could've samba'd with the tour guide
Instead I took a motorcycle ride
With my friend Mike, this guy I really like
He rents the motorbikes

So light me a cigar, my love
And tell me your name, I, I know your name
Let's pour me a drink now
Let's have a toast to who we really are

And I'll sing you a song right in your ear
On this beautiful Cuban moonlit night
Oh, I need another, another light

I could've been Miss Punta Blanca
I could've but I didn't want ta
I could've but I said no thank ya
I said I didn't want ta

Anyways, it was Ruby who won the contest
And two hours later she was passed out by the pool

Jane Siberry,"Red high heels is the way I feels
Got the sways and reels going home
Red high heels and the church bells peal
Cross the snowy fields going home

I walk down these aisles nobody's here just me
And the birds in the belfry
Murmuring murmuring
I took all your letters strung together
A white river of love and kneeling
Trailing trailing

Well, I don't know I'm on my own again
Start alone end alone
So my love maybe I'm glad
I met you on the way

I walk up these aisles nobody's here just me
And the doves up above me
Murmuring murmuring
Where could you be now? Could you be that far?
Are you still thinking of me
Listening listening

Well, I don't care if I'm on my own again
Start alone end alone
So my love I guess I'm glad
I met you on the way

Red high heels is the way I feels
Got the sways and reels going home
Red high heels and the church bells peal
Cross the snowy fields going home

I walk down these aisles nobody's here trust me
Is it already gone now?
And the bells start to ring
Better get outside before they arrive excuse me
Merry Christmas and easter snow
Falling falling

Well, I don't care if I'm on my own again
Start alone end alone
So my love I guess I'm glad
I met you on the way

Red high heels is the way I feels
Got the sways and reels going home
Red high heels and the church bells peal
And the children steal going home

Red high heels is the way I feels
And I teeter off cross the parking lot
I could steal your heart
But I don't know who
I could make you mine
Such a tall street light

Love is what I say
It won't go away
Maybe I'll lie down here
And watch the stars awhile
And these red high heels
I can still see them
They're the only thing that's real
In these frozen fields
Yeah yeah

An endless stream of endless dreams
That wheel and roll just past my shoulder
The waiting and constantly
An endless shift of sifting through the facts
The fey you never know for sure

I was sure until they asked me

All I know is something touched me
Shadows lift my fingers
Don't let the cold
Every now and then things become clear

There is nothing that will change this fact
There is nothing that I will take back
I know, I know, this is a fact

That way nothing's ever boring
Even when they turn and say, ?You lied?

Or maybe snow, I'm cold, I'm not sure
Someone yelled at me, I don't know why

Just let me know

If you want someone to love you
Then don't just go

There is nothing that I will take back

Before there were waves
We'd sit in our boats
We'd float there all day

And there weren't any waves
'Cause there wasn't any wind
'Cause there wasn't any sun
We were waitin for the world to begin

We were waiting in the darkness

Each in our own boat
Each in our own thoughts
Sometimes you could hear people talking amongst themselves but...
(someone had a boat with wheels and I said
You're a bit early but I know how you feel)
But mostly it was just silence

And the silence was only broken by
The absence of the clinking of the masts
And every now and then a bird would not fly by
And someone would look up and say - what wasn't that?

We were waiting in the darkness

And one night (or was it day?)
I was awoken from a dream
I was dreaming of someplace like I'd never been
And I heard someone say
Someone's fallen in and they can't swim
So I leaned out and I pulled them in
And he was holding his head
And it was HUGE and shaped like a fish
And he slid down to the crook of the keel
And when I was sure he'd fallen asleep 
I fell back to my reverie

We were waiting waiting waiting
Waiting in the darkness

And you know what I miss most about that time? 
Was the quality of the blackness
It was soft somehow in the absence of fear
You could take it into your mouth 
And send it out through your teeth
(my dear)

But the silence
Oh, if I could go back to those times
I'd take that silence there
I'd take it into myself and bring it back to you 
And this is what I'd say

Waiting in the darkness

At the beginning of time
Before there were waves
We'd sit in our boats
We'd float there all day
(or was it night?)

And there weren't any waves
'Cause there wasn't any wind
'Cause there wasn't any sun

To ev'ry home",Carol of the Bells,1994
Jane Siberry,"On the sixth day
When the word came
We began our journey
We would not break the promise

Lonely, hasten to the shoreline
Just in time to see them sail away
All the times when we lay sleepless
And the weather made no sense

Challenge your hands
To capture these landscapes
Holy days, landscapes
Of dunes and red skies

There is only one horizon
Rolling thunder this wilderness
So lonely tangled up forever
Hold me for a while

My love, I can hardly hear you
Heal me, feel my love

So I find your breast against mine
Is this the slow tango
I have no regrets, my love
I let you press

I forget the rest
But I feel it like the rushing dove
That beats against the hands of time
With pounding heart again

Is this the slow tango?
I have no regrets, my love

",Begat Begat,1995
Jane Siberry,"O - it was a snowy night 
The caravan traveling across the desert land 
The stars were hanging heavy in the absence of light 
And you were there and I 
And something in our hearts told us to keep moving 
Because there was something about that star 
That Star ...  
 
How far is the nearest place to kneel? 
How far is the nearest throne? 
How far how far can you go with only a dream?  
With only a hope? 
You take the vision and you hold it steady 
Right ahead of you across the ranges across the plains 
The desert land the gaze of strangers 
That is how ... Hold It Steady  
 
There was always someone who would 
Take the children and keep them entertained 
There was always someone who would 
Lay down their work to play the children`s games 
There was always someone who would  
know how things worked 
They`d say ...THERE. Where? OVER THERE.  
 
And now as we sit on the steps  
at the side of the square 
There are three wise men  
sitting in their chairs 
If anyone wants to know  
which way any of us should go 
They will hold they will contain  
they will cup the refrain 
Hold It Steady - take the vision - Hold It Steady 
right ahead of you right between the eyes.  
THAT is how.  
 
O - It was a snowy night  
and our caravan moved along 
through this yet unholy land -  
you were there and I was there 
two desert boys - we did not understand 
we only knew that something grand was happening 
that Star ... that night

If you remind me of my dog
We'll probably git along little doggie
Git along git along little doggie git a

Smiling at strangers reminds me of my dog
Better let them know you're friendly
The way people dress reminds me too
Pissing on their favourite tree
Sad things remind me of my dog
Cockroaches and other insects
Remind me too, don't eat them
The blank expression of the little boy
With thick glasses who picks
Himself up from the sidewalk
And stands there blinking in the sun
Ho oh

Like the man on the subway
Sitting across from me
And every time I looked at him he smiled
And by the time
I got to the end of the subway line
I 'd given him at least oh 25 cookies

Guys in bars remind me of my dog
The way it takes you so long
To choose the perfect table

If you remind me of my dog
We'll probably git along little doggie
Git along git along little doggie git a

Me and my ferocious dog
We're walking down the street
And everyone we meet says
""Ach yer a goot doogie
""Ach yer a goot doogie
""Ach yer a goot doogie

To get the Sunday paper
I stand there and read the headlines
He reads the wind
Sometimes he hits a funny smell and laughs
I hate it when he does that- I feel so dumb
What? what? I say

Beautiful things
Sunsets remind me of my dog

Einstein reminds me of me dog
I want to pat his fluffy head
This whole world reminds me of my dog

Do I remind you of a dog? thump thump
I do? faster thump thump
Skyscrapers remind me of my dog
Sitting in the tall grass waiting for a rabbit

Guys in red cameros too
It's getting to be a habit
Artists remind me of my dog
Staking out their originality on the nearest tree
Old folks remind me of my dog
My dog reminds old people of their dogs
Barfy, Ruffo, Beanhead
Gina says I remind her of the dog
The that way I just did that
Golfers teeing off remind me of my dog
The way he sits by me and shifts on his front paws

Do you want me to dial the number for you?

In the light of the morning sun
Perhaps within the jug I draw
I'll find the bliss of yesterday 

Oh fill my jug up for me

Fill it with happiness
Oh fill it to the brim
The flocks have quenched their thirst
Now quench mine 

I am as the lonely palm
In the hills of Canaan
My heart calls out
But only the south wind responds


",Shir Amami,1996
Jane Siberry,"The hounds are running in the alley-way below
Underlining all her sins 

across the alley
There is a rented room
There is a girl
I watch I watch her 

yellow cotton curtains
The tiles are black and white
Why are you home early?
Is this another one of those nights? 

straighten up the lilacs
Straighten up your hair
Over to the mirror
What do you see there? 

you know why he is living
On a separate street away from you
Usually you can forget
But tonight the hounds they get to you 

the hounds are running in the alley-way below....
Underlining all her sins 

magnets in the mirror
Usually you croon
But tonight you are no beauty
In your rented room 

he knows why he is living
On a separate street away from you
Usually he can forget
But tonight the hounds they get to him 

the mirror shows a man in a chair
She sees him sway
He's falling to the floor
His lines they crack away
Who is this man?
You know him you know him you know him 

his being is your being
His scent is on your skin
His mind is on your mind
His breathing is your breathing 

so she goes to her own chair
I see her sway
She's falling to the floor
Her lines they crack away
She shatters on the tiles
Like the mirror that she shatters
Like the mirror that she shadows 

the street it's night it's dark
I cannot see too well
But a fog descended on her room
That much I can tell 

and every drop of water
Drew salts across her soul, Lord
And every bead of water
Made the beaded bodies roll 

a cat stopped by to listen
'til her breathing ceased to toil
And on a separate street
Well, that man he ceased to mohel 

yellow dawn is yellowing
Now I can see the girl
Now I can see her face
On the tiles I see her curled 

breeze - it blows the curtains
Across the wayward tiles
Across the sleeping ones
On separate streets - I have to smile 

they still will not understand
Why they awaken so new
But their sleep was close to...holy

across the alley
There is a rented room
There is a girl
I watch I watch her
I watch I watch her
We watch We watch her 

",Angel Voyeur,1996
Jane Siberry,"I'm going to take a rope
And put it over her shoulders
And head for the river
And practice on boulders
And when she's real good
I'm going to build a big ramp
And me and that bovine
Gonna vacate this camp 

fly now
Across the hills
Everyone's watching
Gonna give them a thrill 

so pound up that ramp
Your hooves sound like thunder
I'm Zeus - you're Pegasus
We're a six-legged wonder
It's our key to success
We'll be famous world over
I'll make lots of money
And you'll have sweet clover 

fly now
Across the sky
Fetlocks a-flappin'
It's just you and I 

and I won't tell the airforce about my schemes
I know they'd abuse you for their flying machines
And the farmers will curse me
When their cows take off from the fields
No meat for their markets
No milk for their meals 

fly now
Across the hills
Everyone's watching
Gonna give them a thrill 

so don't let me down
Oh, bovine be risen
Come on, sweet Bessie
Be just like my vision
Don't back away Bessie
If you pull I'll push
And we'll weave a nice sine wave
Up over the bush

Moon shine on the snow shine on my face
Winter birds go in and out the stars
Okanagan arrowheads under lace
My shining skates still on the ground 

silver web go across the mountain top
Mountains lift the hem of the horizon
Pinholes in the black
Some call them stars
Call a little louder - they will answer you 

my shining skates burst into stars
It is a long pirouette
That sends me through
This shining night 

sun shine on the moon shine on the lake
Velvet comes when all the edges are erased
Hang out the night it is much rounder here
Roll off the night onto the ice
My shining skates still on the ground 

crease the earth- the snow fall out of sight
Soft midnight herds go cross the valley
Valley deepen so there comes a lake
Lake go to ice so I can skate

That brings me through
This shining night

",The Long Pirouette,1996
Jane Siberry,"Oh my sister
What did you say to them
You've got to use a little tact
Leave out words like ""bombs"" , ""gurus"", or ""India""

You are so critical
How did you ever get this hard
He only wanted to kiss you
And when he couldn't ""score""
He told his friends
And now all the boys are afraid of you 

of us all you were most modest
Even though you were last to lower your hem
Throw your jeans out the window
Put them on behind the fence

Into your indifference

You don't know why I love you it could be
The untouchable innocence
That I see in you sometimes
Or the loss that I feel
When you pass through my mind
Or maybe because I'm supposed to

Where are you living now
You left ""nirvana"" as your forwarding address

Than get caught up on every issue

Of love or hate or anything dramatic
Not jealousy or pride
You said you'd set these things aside

To miss you when you go away
To be indignant when you stay away
To worry about things the proper length of time

Until you have a man in mind
Second booth the King's Head
Leave the ordinary men behind
Go ask them to play
All the glorious love songs they can find

That the searching never stops
Until you have a drink in hand
Drinking to your gloom
In the slow-whirl licensed room
Ah, yes - she was lovely
You told us (many times)
'neath the moon 

the squirrel crossed the road
Like a ribbon on a fan... 

oh Madam
Now I understand
That the searching never stops
Until things are out of hand
Then you jump up to heaven
Pull down the wrath of God
You're alive when men are falling down
Suspended when they're not 

and oh Thomas
Now I understand
That the searching never stops
Until you are a man
Whether early morning hunting deer
Or women in the sand
That measured raging overdrive
Makes you feel alive
A man

Like a ribbon on a fan... 

oh Sal
Now I understand
That the searching never stops
Until you're in a foreign land
Haunting yourself at Delphi
Or melting in Lausanne
Or good times in Marbella
(yes - you have a lovely tan) 

and Oh Little One
Now I understand
That your searching never stops
Until you leave your head
You want peace
Thank God you laugh at what your friends said
They said - barefoot in the Himalayas
He'll just find his feet have spread
But in you I have greatest faith

Like a ribbon on a fan
And the afternoon cicada
Threw a spell across this land
And the waves rolled off the Georgian rocks
And threw a friend upon the sand

And look this way?

And ferns at the side of the pond
Weaving 13 magic flaxen shirts
For 13 brother swans
And never once in your sweet thoughts
Do you ever think maybe you might fail
In your unknowing way your love is strong
Me - I fear the 13 brother swans are going
Me - I curse them when they've gone
But you will never know for we will rearrange
The ferns and fronds to re-surround you
The devil makes us see more
And you don't see more
But somehow you go beyond

Of stars that twinkle on the Christmas tree

But if ever from this beautiful pond you should fly
The reason would be...the reason would be
You were loved too much by them by I

Tell old man to ring the bell
Climb the steps up from the sea
Strange and dark and very tall 

Can you see who it might be?
Visitors - they are so few
Head so proud but curls so free
Looks like someone I once knew 

David - of the Viking heart
Glitter of the sea
It couldn't
It wouldn't
It daren't be 

The men they see him up the coast
At the drinking house of Morley Arms
Hails the sea with every toast
And he hails the ladies with his charms 

All the ladies he does love
Each day I saw his bosom swell
He's not like me - I love but one
And I love that one and I know him well 

Ah - but all the love
In the world was not enough
So I couldn't
I wouldn't
I daren't say no 

David - how you made me feel
Every crack in every wall
Climb above the traps of man
Shout above the sirens call 

But now the siren's all you hear
Shamed and dizzy you can't stop
All the things we used to fear
Are you spinning - little top? 

The strangeness of it all
Is you know yourself so well
But you couldn't
You wouldn't
You daren't say no 

Signs of you - they disappeared
Poems and candles - I don't need
Flowers that you brought to me
Fell into a book I never read 

I cut my hair off like a man
Too much trouble and what's more
It was tarnished by your hand
Gone my hair...into a drawer 

I said - should you leave?
And you - you just agreed
So we couldn't
We wouldn't
We daren't say no 

now I have been a woman true
Taking all that life does send
I thought I could love just you
But the heart does sway and the body does bend 

tales of you sometimes they come
I smile and nod quite naturally
My thoughts so rarely to you run
I watch the glitter of the sea

can you see who it might be?

Climb the steps up from the sea
I cannot see - I know him well

And all I dream to do
With half-smiles

Do I try not to feel

I fail with my anger
And with my sympathy

To view the purple heather and flowers gay
Who should I spy but my own true lover
As she sat under yon willow tree

I took off my hat and I did salute her
I did salute her most courageously
When she turned around and the tears fell from her eyes
Saying, ""False young man, you have deluded me""

Three diamond rings for love I gave you
Three diamond rings to wear on your right hand
But the vows you made, love, you went and broke them
And married the lassie that had the land

If I married the lassie that had the land, my love
'Tis that I'll rue until the day I die
But when fortune calls few men can shun it
I was a blind fool was I

Now at night when I go to my bed of slumber
The thoughts of my true love run in my mind
When I turned around to embrace my darling
Instead of gold 'tis brass I find

And I wish the Queen would call home her armies
From the West Indies, America and Spain
And every man to his homeland would run
And I in hope that we'd meet again

As I roved out one bright May morning
To view the purple heather and flowers gay
Who should I spy but my own true lover

Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people

From his hands as he walks from the grave

Jane Tyrrell,"""My dearest Grandma"" was the way he always started the letter,
It wasn't the only occasion he wrote to keep it together,
""Thank you for the birthday present, it'll really come in handy
I'm writing quietly, 'cause I hope you're not angry,
Mum and Dad are yelling at each other, like every night,
Like every night, I end up locking my door and I write.
Would you please be able to visit, and maybe make 'em make up?
I'd hate to think that it was me that made my parents break up.
Next year I'll be in high school, I'm pretty nervous, actually,
Though I know it's common, I don't want no broken family.
It's my fault, and I don't like it here,
And it's my fault, and now my little brother's in tears,
And Gran, I hope you're not mad, I swear I'll try to be good,
Cause Mum and Dad'll get along much better when I'm being good""
Signin' it, ""Love, your Grandson"", quietly he stored it in the cupboard
With the others, and tightly held his brother, he was...

[Chorus]
Under pressure, I'm heating up.
Under pressure, calm, but it's all front.
Under pressure, boiling point has come

Fast forward twelve years, and he's been out of home for seven,
Never really understood the way he carried it all with him,
Even years later, he hated things gettin' too heated,
Whole section of his history he tried to delete.
New school, new city, reason justified his leaving,
He couldn't leave his guilt seeing his mother's spirit beaten,
She was bleeding, eyes streaming, he had to depart,
Frightened sunken-eyed kid became the life of the party,
Only been in town a term, social life like a soap star,
Still wrote his grandmother the occasional postcard,
""Doin' fine, working hard"", he thought that she'd be relieved,
And perhaps a little proud of all the things he'd achieved.
HD's and team captain, a prize in his class,
A string of love affairs, but never close enough to see the scars,
Kept the cards to his chest, stressed to less and conflict,
Between the lines, his Grandma, only one who heard his bomb tick, he was...

[Chorus]

""Child, I miss you greatly, haven't got many letters lately,
I just wrote to let you know that it's OK to show when you're under pressure.
Though I never really needed to explain this is true,
I see a lot of your dear father when I'm looking at you.
He worked hard, and enjoyed inebriation,
And really, that's a trait that doesn't skip a generation.
Once removed, I see clearer than most, dear boy,
I see though your illusions, boy,
All life's lessons are under pressure.""

Now he's old enough to know better, looking through those old letters,
That he's never sent, he's sure the past is omnipresent,
He won't resent the sum total of experience,
From delirious days, to some so serious.
""Never got those letters, but be sure that I'm hearing this"".
They're really just signposts, landmarks, clippings,
Some repetitive themes, like record players skipping.
He has torn off the layers and always found something different
Inside him, tiny sparks like stars colliding,
And they let him live again, he's never giving in,
And without those few friends that always meant well,
It might have never got to ""all's well that ends well"",
Pen fell, swiftly, why he's writing now is still a mystery,
Has the feeling history forgotten tends to repeat,
So some nights before sleep, he writes to keep it in his sights,
And when it's close enough to touch, he lets fly,
Just to get by, by any means, to walk the path of many dreams,
The penny seems to fall at the very last moment,
The ability to love is like the vast ocean,
And with lead-lidded focus, he writes the last lines of this one,
And signs off, ""With love, your Grandson"".",Under Pressure,2005

Jane Wiedlin,"She left Ohio, bound for NYC,
She broke her ties, she lost touch with me.
That place wasn't big enough for a girl with her kind of dream,
Thumbed across the East coast to a squat between A and C.
Got a job as a stripper, breathing fire on all the men,
She liked the money, she liked the power she had over them.

Get rid of everything... she breathes fire,
Get rid of society... she breathes fire.
Don't need anything... she breathes fire.

I started getting postcards, she was dancing in New Orleans,
Or sparing change in FLA, every year it was a different scene.
She conquered Texas, fell in love in Santa Fe,
Maybe she'd finally found a place where she could finally stay.

Get rid of everything... she breathes fire,
Get rid of society... she breathes fire.
Don't need anything... she breathes fire.

Get rid of the family... she breathes fire,
Get rid of the memories... she breathes fire.
Don't need anything... she breathes fire.

She painted fires of the bridges that she burned,
Tearing out the pages from the book that said to take her turn.

Now she's right back where she started,
At home with Mom and Dad.
Watch it burn and blow away,
What happened to the dream she had?

She's back to everything... she breathes fire,
She's back in society... she breathes fire.
Given up on everything... she breathes fire.

She's back to the family... she breathes fire,
She's back in the memories…she breathes fire.
Giving up on anything... she breathes fire.

She breathes fire, she breathes fire.
She breathes fire, she breathes fire.
She breathes fire, she breathes fire.

Within them a soft flame gently glows
The breath of the night wind is filled with the scent of the rose
Oh, love while I live, I will always enshrine
Your love in the heart of a rose

I have a dream of you
Fashioned of starlight
Perfume of roses and dew

Our paths may sever
But I'll remember forever

I'll always dream of you

I've waited a lifetime for someone to say
The things you are saying to me
And darling, believe every word that I say
Just look in my eyes and you'll see
You smile and my tears have all melted away
My worries were all false and naught

It looks like the start of a beautiful day
Just holding you here in my arms
With you every day's a beautiful day
As long as I'm here in your arms

He sits a-rockin' in his rockin' chair
But now he's got a smile that he can't lose 
Grandma's sittin' knittin' baby shoes

From eatin' black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread
Makes you live so long you wish you were dead
You add some yogurt and you'll be well fed
With black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread

I gave up cherry pie and T-bone steak
Chicken fricassee and ice cream cake
I don't need vitamins or pills at all 
I even mix it with my Hadacol

I'm eatin' black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread
Makes you live so long you wish you were dead
You add some yogurt and you'll be well fed
With black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread

My nerves were jumpy and I'd walk the floor
I never got to sleep till after four
But since I'm eatin' right I feel okay
I'm sleepin' every night and half the day

From eatin' black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread
Makes you live so long you wish you were dead
You add some yogurt and you'll be well fed
With black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread

Now I was thinner than a pencil line
Had no muscles and I had no spine
But now I'm friskier than a pup 
All you have do is prop me up

Just feed me black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread
Makes you live so long you wish you were dead
You add some yogurt and you'll be well fed
With black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread

I know a fella who is ninety-two
Doctors told the guy that he was through
But now that the doctor has been proven wrong
He's got more hop in him than Hopalong

I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith

Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
What's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
I shouted out,
""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all
It was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

Hope you guessed my name
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game

And all the sinners, saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer

So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

Nevím, co mě tak vábí?
Chodím na břeh každý den
Mám být hodnou dcerou svého táty
Ale sem se vždycky vrátím
Na břeh k vodě, k vodě jen
 
Ať jdu tam či sem, skončím před mořem
Když jdu po stopách, které mizí v tmách
Všechny vedou zpět tam, kam nesmím jet!
A kde toužím být
 
Nebe, pás vodu dál objímá a vábí
Jak poznat mám, co je tam dál?
Když mi dá vítr plout nad vodou s lodí útlou
Jak rozeznám, kam až dál se dá nad pěnivou vodou plout?
 
Já vím Každý, kdo je tady doma, je tak šťastný z toho, co má
Všechno je tak, jak má být
Já vím Každý, kdo je tady doma, dělá vždycky jenom, co má
Tak snad bych mohla taky já
 
Můžu hrdě vést, jak mi velí čest
Najít vlastní byt, Žít, jak má se žít
Jenže vnitřní hlas mluví zas a zas
Co jen má to být?!
 
Nebe, pás vodu dál objímá a láká
A kdopak ví, co je tam dál?
A to vím, že to budu zrovna já, koho vábí!
Tak řekni víc!
Mám jet s lodí svou tam, kde za vodou

I ten pás nebe dál objímá a vábí!
Jak poznat mám, co je tam dál?
Když mi dá vítr plout nad vodou s lodí útlou!
Snad rozeznám, kam doplout mám?!",How Far I'll Go,2016
Janelle,"﻿첫 번째 앨범은 시큰둥
두 번째는 대중들의 작은 집중 뿐
세 네 번째 부터
이 썩은 scene의 귀중품
새빨간 19금 딱지가 붙었지만
still 진실만을 썼다
음악은 나의 길
심의실에서 평가 불능한 appeal
득과 실 벌써 decade
Still mic를 check 해
Like JK형 밝은 미래 in my arms
실낱 꿈 풍파와 입맞춤
가사를 쓸 때마다
혼자가 아니야 in my room
내게 숨 같던
친구들의 반이 하늘나라
내가 대신 꾸는 꿈 속에서
편히 잠을 자라
맺힌 내 땀을 봐라
I\'m a damn 괴물
Made an independent label
cause I won\'t ever settle
at your level
Like Bob Dylan
I\'m Not There\' in this 폐허
레어 성서

Till I see God up there
높이 솟아올라

처음엔 지루한
학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다
모든 걸 고통 없이
원한다면 해답은 없다
내가 해냈으면 너도
충분히 할 수 있으니 believe

한 계단씩 걸어

I\'m insane in the brain
like I\'m Cypress Hill
Cypher\'s killed when I rap
얼굴 찌푸리면서
Like a drummer in the back
너넨 뒷북이나 쳐
마음이 뒤틀린
낙서 가득 기운이 앞서
누구나 깎아내는
조각가들 신물이 났어
차라리 신문이나 펴
요즘의 경제면처럼 마땅한
대안 없는 음악 믿음이 안 서
착실한 기반 닦은 확실한 상품
어설픈 화가들의 막 칠한 작품
둘 중 하나를 분명히 해
이력서를 써
결과야 뭐 어떻던 미련은 못써
If I can you can
If I can you can

Like a bone lost deep inside

But not that type of guy

you got my clouds on fire
We're tightrope walking
And the world's the wire
Remember kissing on Broadway
You'll die
I was bein' your baby
And ticking your tock in yo' clock
See we done jumped the broom
And now you're no good
And I was dreaming about children 
Emily and, oh darling baby
With the daddy's eyes
And it meant so much to me 
(It meant so much to me)
And I needed your good love
Baby how could you just go
And change it all
You turned my spring to fall
I needed you, you know

It's time to go

If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone

We was only in our teens
Our dreams was simplistic
Jumped the broom
But it seems I tripped 
I must have slipped
After exchanging of the rings
These things, you give me lip
But not the kissing of the bride
The dipping of the groom
The shit that make a nigga
Up and leave up out a room
More like ""boohoo"" then Boo
""Fuck who?"" then ""fuck you too""
(Fucking bitch) kids, cover them ears
It appears that your mama want drama We need a comma
Or some space between words
For better or for worse
This is not what I deserve
The worst that I can take
Actually I want the cake and eat it too And plus your plate
But wait now,
Don't you get the house kids cars
Everything we built together was ours
Now it's all yours!
That's hard it's all yours,
Good God!

I mean I'm in between sunset and sunrise
As its on type of nigga for the home invasion surprise
Mother fucker pow-pow lay the fuck down now
Now no, don't try to talk your way out
Because I'm usually non violent, positively vibing
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you,
Why? I don't know, I don't even understand it
But it's simply overstood how you really suppose to handle it,
Pardon me one moment I just went off on a tangent

Where he stand is where he lay, aye

I'm gonna give your ass a gangsta's pill,
That's a little piece of lead, taken to the head
That nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead

Done like dishes, this a wrap like Christmas

And everybody trying to figure they way out

And day to day we live in a daze

We march all around til' the sun goes down night children
Broken dreams, no sunshine, endless crimes, we long for freedom (for freedom)
You're free but in your mind, your freedom's in a bind

Oh make it rain, ain't a thing in the sky to fall
(The silver bullet's in your hand and the war's heating up)
And when the truth goes bang the shouts splatter out
(Revolutionize your lives and find a way out)
And when you're growing down instead of growing up
(You gotta ooo ah ah like a panther)
Tell me are you bold enough to reach for love?

He lived in sector ten
He had a friend named Benjamin
Sail away, sail away Susan

So strong for so long
All I wanna do is sing my simple song
Square or round, rich or poor
At the end of day and night all we want is more
I keep my feet on solid ground and use my wings when storms come around
I keep my feet on solid ground for freedom
You're free but in your mind, your freedom's in a bind

Oh make it rain, ain't a thing in the sky to fall
(The silver bullet's in your hand and the war's heating up)
And when the truth goes bang the shouts splatter out

And when you're growing down instead of growing up

I'm happy to announce we have a star crossed winner in todays sweepstakes
Android number 57821 otherwise known as Cyndi Mayweather
Has fallen madly in love with a human Anthony Greendown
And you know the rules shes now scheduled fro immediate disassembly
Bounty hunters, you can find her in the neon valley street district
On the fourth floor in the leopard plaza apartment complex
The droid control marshals are full of fun rules today
No phases only chainsaws and electro-daggers
Remember only card carrying hunters can join our chase today
And as usual there will be no reward until her cyber-soul
Is turned into the star commission, happy hunting!",March of the Wolfmasters,2007

Some gone off to their fall, lord have mercy on them
One, two, three, four, your cousins is round' here sellin' dope
While they're daddies, your uncle is walking round' strung out
Babies with babies, and their tears keep burning, while their dreams go down the drain now

Are we really living or just walking dead now?
Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels
The way we live
The way we die
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified
Day dreamers please wake up, we can't sleep no more

Love don't make no sense, ask your neighbor
The winds have changed; it seems they have abandoned us
The truth hurts, and so does yesterday
What good is love if it burns bright, and explodes in flames
(I thought every little thing had love but uh)

I've seen them shootin' up funerals in they Sunday clothes
Spending money on spinners but won't pay college loans
And all you gangsters and bangers rollin' dice and taking lives, in a Smokey dark

The little girls just broken Queen, confusing bling for soul
Danger, there's danger when you take off your clothes, all your dreams go down the drain girl

A book is worth more than a bomb any day
And remember a mirror to africa

Use your heart and not your pride
We can’t go on and keep pretending

Where’s all the money you spent,
Food is fallin low
And they have nowhere to go,
Quit slowin me down.

I ask you to have mercy on us father,
You think we know the rules by now,
We can’t go starting wars with hearts of hatred
Out nations greed won’t make it better
Or quiet the fears in our hearts

Don’t you see the hurt in their eyes?
So much disappointment in all of their faces
Use your heart and not your pride

Eat 'em like an urr-ange, orange
So when they on the verge of leavin' it don't get borin'
Foreign trips are taken
Just to see your smiley faces, time's a-wastin'
And I don't like to waste no time
You can be down or, yeah

Be wise my dear, you must, learn to just be still
Until you really really know
Show me you're right, shine your light
I wonder when will I know

I love bein' in love (bein' in love)
Then you let me down, turned my heart around
Givin' up on love, makes my ocean drown
You lived in my heart
Secret melodies haunt me at night
Maybe lies and lullabies
This is my last farewell
You let me down

Be still young heart
Never will you fall apart

Grip this wood, slide around real slow
Just thinkin', mind blown
As I glare through the smoke tinted windows
And be still

Be still young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be still young heart
Never will you fall apart

Janelle Monáe,"The only love my heart approaches
Your tender eyes fill mine with roses
I drink your wine
And never will my heart dry inside

Walking like a lonely fool in Prague
Singing a love song and the words I wrote
I wrote for two

Gentle as a lullaby at night
I hear you humming private melodies
You're near

Babopbyeya
Where are you my darling?
My babopbyeya
Can you hear me calling?

Rewind the clock, our time's approaching
Give us the eyes to guide us most when
We have no light to see throughout all our darkest days
And troubled ways

Meet me at the door by the garden
Meet me at the door by the garden
Meet me at the door by the garden
I'll be at the door, Babopbyeya

Danger all about you
Babopbyeya
I won't leave without you

Ojos miran hacia la luna
Evitan un mundo tan triste
Dominado bajo el odio
Donde el amor no existe
Dame en su reino refugio
De la oscuridad peligrosa
Espero en la esquina, querida
Busco la llamanda amorosa

Like a lonely matador at night
Fighting in the darkness for the light
I won't stop until I hear the call of love

And when I'm alone, you are near to me
You have made a home in my memory
There you will abide for forever
And I will keep you warm in the night

Ojos miran hacia la luna, busco la llamanda amorosa

I heed echos of your laughter in the corners of my mind
While I memorize each detail of your intricate design
In your hair there is a symphony
Your lips, a string quartet
They tell stories of a Neon Valley Street
Where we first met
Now somewhere time pursues us
As we love in Technicolor
But I dwell in silence on your words
Which move me like none other
This time I shall be unafraid
And violence will not move me
This time we will relax
This time we will stay in our movie

I see beyond tomorrow
This life of strife and sorrow
My freedom calls and I must go
I must go
I must go
I must go",BabopbyeYa,2010
Janelle Monáe,"So you think that I'm alone
But being alone is the only way to be

Do you know what you're fighting for

If you want to be free
Feet on the ground is the only place to be

You spend time running from depravity

You better know what you're fighting for

And bring grace to the strong
Make our legal stumble as it applies in the world
All the tripes come and the mighty will crumble
We must brave this night
And have faith in the world

I'm trying to find my peace
I was made to believe there's something wrong with me
And it hurts my heart
Lord have mercy ain't it plain to see

That's when I come alive like a schizo running wild
That's when I come alive now let's go wild

We're kicking at your window and keeping you up
And if you come to find me I'll color you red
We're dancing in the dungeon every Monday night

That's when we come alive like a schizo running wild
That's when I come alive now let's go wild

You want to see me crazy taking my meds
And wipe away the noises you think I'm a mess
Take me six feet under, but while your roses died, I came alive

You better leave the town I'm coming for you
Call the Tommy up and tell him come help you out
I'm getting wild on you you better go and call the law

Janelle Monáe,"Cyborg, android, d-boy, decoy, water, wisdom
Tightrope, vision, insight, stronghold, heartless
Ice cold, mystery, mastery, solar, battery

Some will pull the gun because they want to be stars
Snatching up your life into the blink of an eye
And if you see your cloning on a street walking by
Keep you running for your life cause only one will survive
War is in the streets and it's an eye for an eye
Run on for your life or you can dance you can die
She's praying in the sand like she's the last samurai
It's a stick up stick up and a pick up pick up

Telling lies and telling lies will put your face on fire
Run and tell your friends to never dream, never win
Ghettos keep a crying out to streets full of zombies
Kids are killing kids and then the kids join the army
Rising and a waking, yes sir here comes the sun
March into the war and with the kick of the drum
The wiser simians have got the bombs and the guns
So you might as well keep dancing if you're not gonna run

A long long way to find the one
We'll keep on dancing 'til she comes
These dreams are forever
Oh these dreams are forever
And if you wanna wake the sun
Just keep on marching to the drums
These dreams are forever
Oh these dreams are forever

Now I'm not saying it's better to bailar
You can pull the trigger or you can build you an ark
My words are rather kind you keep them held in contempt
Looking for a nine and then a droid you can tempt
Zombie, zombie, zombie, where do dreams come from?
A little bird is chirping and she's singing a song
She's shaking 'em and waking 'em and giving 'em mas
As the clock tick tocks and the bodies drop

I'm gonna lay myself so far way down right in your chops
Modern day example of the wolf vs flock
Freedom necessary and it's by any means
Frozen they were stolen all the kings and queens
Sudanese and congolese who put the roll in the rock
From here to sudan, metropolis to iraq
It's a minute to the dawn and yet the sun ain't back
It's a war in all the stress and yes freaks will dance or die

And if you wanna wake the sun
Just keep on marching to the drums

Oh these dreams are forever

Angel, blossom, gunshot, dodging, dream, bright, beat
Light, breathe, live, help, give, focus, trance, wake up, dance!

I'm praying for the man sitting without much time
May he understand the clock will never rewind
Wisen him and sharpen him and give him a motto
Hate no more, said he must hate no more
You see the daylight comes into the kingdom
But the kingdom's full of ignorant men
Just keep rebelling away, you gotta dream it away
Because the weatherman you seein' ain't creating the weather

This man wants to see another jubilation
And that man wants us in emancipation
And then there is the man who wants a stronger nation
You see we really got to and I think that we ought to
Protect the mind from degradation
Sow in the seeds of education
They run from us, are we that dangerous?
There's a war in all the streets and yes the freaks must dance or die!

Beautiful smile and rosy cheeks

Blueberry Mary, and she's crazy about me

She's wild man, she's wild!

Cause they can't tip on the scene
They just talk about it, t-t-t-talk bout it
When you get elevated
They love it or they hate it
You dance up on them haters
Keep getting funky on the scene
While they jumpin' round ya
They trying to take all of your dreams
But you can't allow it

I'm a special mind, yeah, a special kind
Conceived in the South at a special time
Covered in leaves of gold
Scripture written in scrolls
Spoken so clearly in tongues
So my children would come
Look around
Can't you see
The industry: they look like me

I don't wear the clothes you wear
I'm just different and I don't care
It's kind of sad and it's a shame
Everyone wants to be the same
If you are listening here and now
I'm sure I can show you how
It's okay to be afraid
Don't you want to be special

I'm so special, boy
Try to went stupid, dawg
I eat nuclear waste and spit atomic bombs
Plutonium explodes, that's my trademark
Mushroom clouds inside, call 'em brain farts
Gamma rays torch my system, now I'm going green
G-force in my veins, pump hydrozine

Was I quote, unquote special or was there something wrong
My skin was black, my heart was gold, and my tongue was silver
And the fact that I could talk already, that was a thriller
And I fear what I don't understand, so let me warn you
Especially when nigga make too much noise about being normal
Unusual but beautiful, the bondin' blessing
Summa Cum Laude, School of Exceptional Youth

Let me put something poetic into plain English
I'd rather die than to not be distinguished
The outsiders have no desires to be equal
When V.I.P. stands for ""Very Insecure People""

Don't need a co-sign
T-Mo is on the grind, he about to let it shine
Off in the skyline, don't worry 'bout mine
I can handle lies and watching third eyes
I make 'em go blind, I don't deserve to rhyme

I don't wear the clothes you wear
I'm just different and I don't care
It's kind of sad and it's a shame
Everyone wants to be the same
If you are listening here and now
I'm sure I can show you how
It's okay to be afraid
Don't you want to be special",Special Education,2013
Janelle Monáe,"Girl, this is craziness
Let me tell you

I can't believe all of the things they say about me
Walk in the room they throwing shade left to right
They be like, ""Ooh, she serving face""
And I just tell 'em cut me up and get down
They call us dirty 'cause we break all your rules down
And we just came to act a fool, is that alright?
(Girl, that's alright)
They be like, ""Ooh, let them eat cake.""
But we eat wings and throw them bones on the ground

Am I a freak for dancing around?
Am I a freak for getting down?
I'm coming up, don't cut me down
Yeah I wanna be, wanna be

Is it peculiar that she twerk in the mirror?
And am I weird to dance alone late at night?
And is it true we're all insane?
And I just tell 'em, ""No we ain't"" and get down

I heard this life is just a play with no rehearsal
I wonder will this be my final act tonight
And tell me what's the price of fame?
Am I a sinner with my skirt on the ground?

Am I a freak for dancing around?
Am I a freak for getting down?
I'm coming up, don't cut me down
Yeah I wanna be, wanna be

Hey brother can you save my soul from the devil?
Say is it weird to like the way she wear her tights?
And is it rude to wear my shades?
Am I a freak because I love watching Mary? (Maybe)

Hey sister am I good enough for your heaven?
Say will your God accept me in my black and white?
Will he approve the way I'm made?
Or should I reprogram the programming and get down?

Am I a freak for dancing around?
Am I a freak for getting down?
I'm coming up, don't cut me down
Yeah I wanna be, wanna be

Even if it makes others uncomfortable
I wanna love who I am
Even if it makes other uncomfortable
I will love who I am

Shake 'til the break of dawn
Don't mean a thing, so duh
I can't take it no more
Baby, we in tuxedo groove
Monae and E. Badu
Crazy in the black and white
We got the drums so tight
Baby, here comes the freedom song
Too strong we moving on
Baby there's melody
Show you another way
This joints for fight unknown
Come home and sing your song
But you gotta testify
Because the booty don't lie

No, no, the booty don't lie
Oh no, the booty don't lie

Yeah
Yeah, let's flip it
I don't think they understand what I'm trying to say

I asked a question like this
""Are we a lost generation of our people?
Add us to equations but they'll never make us equal.
She who writes the movie owns the script and the sequel.
So why ain't the stealing of my rights made illegal?
They keep us underground working hard for the greedy,
But when it's time pay they turn around and call us needy.
My crown too heavy like the Queen Nefertiti
Gimme back my pyramid, I'm trying to free Kansas City.

Mixing masterminds like your name Bernie Grundman.
Well I'm gonna keep leading like a young Harriet Tubman
You can take my wings but I'm still goin' fly
And even when you edit me the booty don't lie
Yeah, keep singing and I'mma keep writing songs
I'm tired of Marvin asking me, ""What's Going On?
March to the streets 'cause I'm willing and I'm able
Categorize me, I defy every label
And while you're selling dope, we're gonna keep selling hope
We rising up now, you gotta deal you gotta cope
Will you be electric sheep?
Electric ladies, will you sleep?
Or will you preach?""",Q.U.E.E.N.,2013

I see you working night to morning light yet no one cares
Carry on Ghetto Woman
Cause even though they laugh and talk about the clothes
You wear
I wish they could just realize
That all you’ve ever needed was someone to free your
Mind
Carry on Ghetto Woman
Cause even in your darkest hours I still see your light

And when you cry don’t you know that I am crying with
You?
When people put you down, yeah way down and you feel
Like you’re alone
Let love be your guide
You were built to last through any weather
Oh Ghetto Woman hold on to your dreams
And all your great philosophies
You’re the reason I believe in me, for real

Carry on Ghetto Woman
When you doubt if you’re a star, just know we still believe
Carry on Ghetto Woman
Even when the news portrays you less than you could be
I wish they could just realize
All you ever needed was someone to free your mind
Carry on Ghetto Woman
You’re the 7th wonder reigning over us at night

When you cry, don’t you know we’re right there crying with
You
People put you down, yeah way down and you feel like
You’re alone
Let love be your guide
You were built to last through any weather
Oh Ghetto Woman hold on to your dreams and all your
Great philosophies
You’re the reason I believe in me, for real

Some say this ghetto land will take you down and poison
You
Some say she can do all the things a man can do
Who said the ghetto’s just a place where queens dance
Naked on the moon?
We say a woman came to change the face of each and every room

When I was just a baby my momma dropped out of school
It was only second semester the baby due
The doctor said “December the first your due date”
The daddy he was gone off to college he couldn’t wait
Only just a teen with dreams to be on TV
And living with a mom and my grandma who used to feed
Me
We would move around in the city place to place
The landlord come for the rent face to face
Her eyes too heavy from working nights as a janitor
She’d keep it to herself and nobody could understand her
Even when she thought that she couldn’t she carried on
She couldn’t imagine both of her daughters here all alone
Before the tuxedos and black and white every day
Used to watch my momma get down on her knees and
Pray
She’s the reason that I’m even writing this song
Ghetto Woman no it won’t be long, now sing along

Let it use you
Let it use you
When the love is strong
It won’t let you be alone
Let it use you
Just let the spirit lead you",Ghetto Woman,2013

I wish the tears would roll back in my eyes
Will I rise?

If loving you means fighting till the end
Then I'll fight harder baby just to win
And if tomorrow shall come to me
I'll count your every kiss as a victory

Cause to be victorious
You must find glory in the little things
To be victorious
You must find glory in the little things

Surrounded by the schemes and senseless lives
And blaming others, feeling victimized
Oh tomorrow, one day they'll know
To win you'll have to lose all the things you know
Trying to light the fire deep inside
Father take all the fears and sorrow from my life
Cause when the rain falls
My seed will grow
I'll be further to my dreams tomorrow

Cause to be victorious
You must find glory in the little things
To be victorious
You must find glory in the little things

There's a greater love
In the little things (oh the little things)

Whoaaa!
Another day (adabadee, nigga)
I take your pain away

Some people talk about ya like they know all about ya
When you get down they doubt ya
And when you tip it on the scene, yeah they talkin' bout it
Cause they can't tip on the scene
They just talk about it, t-t-t-talk bout it
When you get elevated
They love it or they hate it
You dance up on them haters
Keep getting funky on the scene
While they jumpin' round ya
They trying to take all of your dreams
But you can't allow it
Cause baby whether you're high or low
Whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
Baby, baby, baby, whether you're high or low (high or low)
Baby whether you're high or low (high or low)
You got to tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
Now let me see you do the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
And I'm still tippin' on it

See I'm not walkin' on it
Or tryin to run around it
This ain't no acrobatics
You either follow or you lead, yeah
I'm talkin' bout ya
Keep on blaming the machine, yeah
I'm talkin' bout it
T-t-t-talkin' bout it
I can't complain about it
I gotta keep my balance
And just keep dancin on it
We gettin funky on the scene
Yeah you know about it
Like a star on the screen
Watch me tip all on it

Then baby whether I'm high or low (high or low)
Baby whether you're high or low (high or low)
You gotta tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
Yeah, tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
Baby, baby, baby
Whether you're high or low (high or low)
Baby whether you're high or low (high or low)
Tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
Baby let me see you tight rope (tip, tip on it)
And I'm still tippin' on it 

You gotta keep your balance
Or you fall into the gap
It's a challenge but I manage
Cause I'm cautious with the strap
Do damage to your cabbage that
A doctor cannot patch
Why you don't want no friction
Like the back of a matchbook
Daddy Fat Sax will fold you
And your MacBook
Close shows, shut you down
Before we go-go backwards
Act up, and whether we high or low
We gonna get back-up
Like the Dow Jones and NASDAQ
Sorta like a thong in an ass crack
Come on

I tip on alligators and little rattlesnakers
But I'm another flavor
Something like a terminator
Ain't no equivocating
I fight for what I believe
Why you talkin' 'bout it
J-j-just talkin' 'bout it
Some callin' me a sinner
Some callin' me a winner
I'm callin' you to dinner
And you know exactly what I mean
Yeah I'm talkin bout you
You can rock or you can leave
Watch me tip without you

N-n-now whether I'm high or low
(High or low)
Whether I'm high or low
(High or low)
I'm gonna tip on the tightrope
(Tip, tip on it)
Mmm
(Tip, tip on it)

Baby, baby, baby
Whether I'm high or low
(High or low)
High or low
(High or low)
I got to tip on the tightrope
(Tip, tip on it)
Now baby tip on the tightrope

You can't get too high
(You can't get too high)
I said you can't get too low
(We can't get too low)
Cause you get too high
(You can't get too high)
No, you'll surely be low
(No, you'll surely be low)

Janelle Sadler,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2003
Janelle Sadler,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love,2003
Janesville,"I am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

[Chorus]
Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

[Chorus]

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother

Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

As one through the years we're gonna stay

And oh, just one more thing
You can count on me to always be forever yours

I'll stay forever yours

Just knowin' that you're near

Love and my best friend
Nothin' better can be found
To make the world go 'round

We keep each other's secrets hid
Go on to talk for hours
Never tiring of the closeness
Only friends can share

We cross our hearts hoping to die
If fate should separate us 
But we have on never change
Nothing can compare to

For some help and understanding
When the world gets too demanding

Support me when I'm right

Because I care for

The magic is working, I'm falling in love
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
You were sent from heaven above

All of my life
I hoped to find someone like you
So sweet and so kind
Never thought I'd love again
Thought my life had come to an end

There you were filling my heart
You captured me and
Stood there like a knight in shining armor
You changed my life (you changed my life)
You're such a charmer

Stepped right of out of my dream
Shoot through my life with everything

Fireworks in every kiss
Feels so good, I feel alive
My heart and soul, have been revived

They say the streets are paved with gold
But it sure looks kind of cold outside

Steppin' on the sidewalk with the stars beneath her feet
Just a handful of tourists, is all she's bound to meet
So tough to find a room and it takes more than a day
And it's not too nice and the price is high

Somehow she can't help but cry

It's about the fiction, the odds won't go with her on

Her colleague smiles at her through the wrinkles of her face
She came here too, with the self-same goals
She never got out of this place

She makes her mind up, she's gonna leave that very night
It's been so long now since she's felt that good inside
She calls the service line, there's a message in there for her

Of the one thing we all need in life

",The Knowledge,1989
Janet Jackson,"Feeling so alone and deserted
With people standing all around you
Should I trust someone
Should I stay off to myself
Alone with no one to talk to 
It's such a helpless feeling

So any time you feel the need
Call me when your lonely
Cause everybody needs a friend
To be there when they're lonely

So don't isolate yourself
Every time that I come around
A person all alone 
Is an unhappy one
We need somebody near to love us

Someone who cares 
Living life all by yourselves
Impossible to do and I'll be there for you

Anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
Cause everybody needs a friend
And I'll be yours if you are lonely

(And your all alone)

If you're all alone 
And a friend you need 
Like a river flows 
You hurt; I'll bleed
If you trust in me
We can find away
Take away the pain
Time heals all things
Even a lonely state of mind
'cause happiness is oh so hard to find

If your lonely I will be there

So anytime you feel the need 
Call me when your lonely
Cause everybody needs a friend
To be there when they're lonely

And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again

Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Lookin for your own
Here it is I know what I'm sayin
But the klan ain't playin at the range
Gotta step it up us to discuss a must
It ain't nothin but an us thang
Rewind back to the time
Where the color of our mother
Had 'em call it a crime
Brother what in the world?
And the world says where is the black man
Support the woman and children
Time to step it up, step it up, it's playoff time

Don't you worry
You just sleep my love
And I'll stroke your hair
Oh the sunlight on your face
As the day begins to break

When you wake
And your smile meets mine ah
My day begins
You're my inspiration
Seeing your face glow
Is the nicest of hellos

Five till noon
You sneak up from behind
Kiss and caress me
Make love to my mind
A whisper and a kiss from you
Warms my heart
Means so much, making love our way
Begins early in the day

You walk in the room
In a sunset sort of mood
My emotions light up
'Cause of you
Now that evening's come
We're dress for us my love
Wine and candles puts us in a sexy mood

That's when we get to it
Close our eyes
Feel our our way through it
I can't wait to groove ya
'Cause you sure know how to move it
You've made love to my mind
Now you gotta take me from behind
Just like in the movies
When the action begins

Let's put on a show
And we'll take it nice and slow
Oh here we go
Tell me do you want the blindfold
Tell me what you like
Baby should I do it once or twice
I know that we get naughty
But I know you like it like that

Now that we felt this warm explosion
I know you're satisfied
I see it in your eyes
Relax
Be still my love
Let your heart slow down
'Cause I'm no through my dear
Don't stop

Janet Jackson,"Buscando en mi cajon, tu carta aparecio
Querias tiempo para ti, ya el tiempo paso

Bridge:
Di mi vida entera, para que volvieras a mi
Mi alma agonizaba, al no poderte olvidar

Chorus:
Vuelve a mi, no me hagas sufrir
Vuelve a mi, te lo suplico
Vuelve a mi, te quiero a morir
Vuelve a mi

Dios sabe que intente, mi vida reponer
Me dice que hay que luchar, que mis penas no duraran
Como hacer que entienda, mi triste corazon
Este amor que tengo por ti, no puede mas

Repeat chorus

Vuelve a mi, vuelve (vuelve pronto)
Vuelve a mi, vuelve (te lo suplico)
Vuelve a mi, vuelve
Por favor vuelve a mi, te extrano tanto
Donde quiera que estes, te amo

But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
Cuz every time I see your face
My heart does begin to race everytime

One half wants me to go
One half wants me to stay
I just get so all confused

I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
Cuz every time I fall in love
It seems to never last

I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
Cuz everytime I fall in love
It seems to never last

But every time your love is near

My heart does begin to race everytime

And every time I'm filled with fear

My heart does begin to race everytime

It's everytime
It's everytime
Cuz. . .

Everytime your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
Cuz every time I see your face
Could it be that this will be the one that lasts?

Tellin truths and not your old lies
Seems to me that you care
And I know that you're runnin out of time

See ya can't get away
I'll be here forever and again

Do believe cause you know you cannot win

Spent most your life pretending not to be
The one you are but who you choose to see
Learned to survive in your fictitious world
Does what they think of you determine your worth?

If special's what you feel when you're with them
Taken away you feel 'less than' again

No you cannot change it right away
Gotta make a try
And with time it'll start to go away

I'll be here when you need
That one to sit and cry to
Cause I'm the you you forgot
The only one you know you cannot lie to

Bitter you'll be if you don't change your ways
When you hate you you hate everyone that day

Unleash this scared child that you've grown into
You cannot run for you can't hide from you
Can't hide from you

'Bout a little friend 
Never felt good enough 
Had a heart to mend 

Never felt pretty 
Learned to just pretend 
Wished someone had listened 
To her cries of pain 

Maybe I'm the lucky one 
Maybe the forgotten one 
Maybe, but I know 
I'm not God's stepchild 

Didn't want to burden 
Mother had enough stress 
So often I'd talk to you 
Through my four legged friends 

Always there to listen 
Though I felt so all alone 
And in my times of trouble 
I know 

You saw my smile of pain 
Maybe I'm the lucky one 
Maybe the forgotten one 
Maybe, but I know 

I'm not God's stepchild 
Maybe I'm the lucky one 
Maybe the forgotten one 
Maybe, but I know I'm not God's stepchild 

Now that I am older 
Gone through so much pain 
I learned that I should love me 
No more feeling ashamed 

I've seen the great illusions 
I've seen the rough terrain 
I've walked through my own journey 
And my love for you remains 

Maybe I'm the lucky one 
Maybe the forgotten one 
Maybe, but I know 
I'm not God's stepchild 

Maybe I'm the lucky one

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of twist in my fate
But I know the truth and it haunts me
I learned it a little too late

I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
I learned it a little too late

People have faith in me
I think I once did too
I promise whoever has a hold on our lives
I'll see the bad times through

This should have been my time
It's over, it never began
Facing a world, for once not on my side
I simply turned and ran

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of shift in the stars
But I know the truth and it haunts me
It's flown just a little too far

Janet Jackson,"You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on playette
Play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

[Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like Acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me straight up
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly bitch, you don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
(well)
I think about the girl all the time (well, well)

East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

[1] - I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
[Repeat 1 (3x)]

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound,
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching feelings is a no,
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You got to pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Repeat 1 (4x)]

[2] - Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo, that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on playette
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
You're my kind of girl, no diggity
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey

Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfucking thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I predicted so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kicking game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is born, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I'll be sitting in car, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

Janet Jackson,"Wilson, Wilson
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Don't try to be all clever, cute, or even shy
Don't have to work that hard
Just be useful and let that be your guide
So you do what you gonna do
Come on and talk to me
Promise you won't even have an attitude
I'll let you sit right next to me
Don't join the list with all the other fools
That ain't the way to be
Yes, it's cool
Yes, I'm in the mood
Intimidations got that mind
All for you
Tell me you're the only one
Soon we'll be having fun
Come over here and get some",All for You [Thunderpuss Club Mix],2001
Janet Jackson,"You tell me you love me
You tell me you care
But when I'm around you
It's like I'm not there

I need a reminder
Something you can see
Something on my finger
Shining so brightly

Don't you know
Diamonds are a
Girl's best friend
When you go, they stay
With me until the end

Don't you know
Diamonds are a girl's
Best, best friend
When you go, they stay

Don't want your money
Don't want your key
Diamonds
Love don't come for free

You sent me some roses
But roses do die
You gave me some candy
It melted, nice try

I'm not that demanding
I have simple taste
I just want a token
That can't go to waste

Yo, check this out you greedy motha f******
I changed all my credit cards,
And switched all the locks to all my doors
You thought my heart would be destroyed
Look around 'cause I'm chillin' boy
Whatcha goin' get your lawyer for?
I makes my dough and just for sure you know
Your lawyers should have let you know, you know,
When you sue me you gonna be broke, you know,
Ain't no way you gonna bring me down easy
Any chick that you stick is real sleazy
Before I need you, I bet you gonna need me
You ain't want me, anyway you wanted to be me. 
What made you think I wanted to keep you around
While I work my a** off while you just lounge around, huh?
You slump, bum, son of a gun,
And uh, How much you worth? I think negative, done

A baby gigolo, a sex pistol
Hollerin' at everything that walks
No substance, just small talk

Workin' your work until you find
Who's goin' home with you tonight.

Stupid b**** in my beach house

Walkin' 'round, like you're down, you don't give a?
But you don't really want to be forgot into the streets,
I'm a lover, not a fighter, but I crack your teeth
Boy I plead please, no, don't bother me.
'Cause when you had me you ain't know how to chill wit' me
You want to be in the streets with the freak-nies
But now you all up on them knees, still joggin' me.
But I'm gonna say it real, real, keep it real, 
What the deal? How you feel? Is it real? Is you sick?
'Cause I'm the deal, still here, what the feelin' 
Is real, don't front, 'cause boy I'm the?
I'm doin' better without you, playa, and I'm happy without you,playa,
This song is about you, playa
Motha f***** son of a gun, Janet!

Got a chip upon your shoulder, I just knocked it off,
Show me what you're gonna do, I ain't ?bout to run,

Janet Jackson,"I close my eyes and fantasize
And I just imagine
A tropical island
We're all alone
Our pagers and cell phones shut off
Hot sunny heat
Cool ocean breeze
The sand beneath our feet
The crashing waves are like music
Found a place to sleep
Passion fruit to eat
Use all our energy
Under the moonlight making love

I don't think nothing can compare
Nothing better than
(Time)
Nothing better than
(Or anywhere)
Nothing better than
(Cause I'm)
Spending time with you
Nothing better than
(As friend)
Nothing better than
(I'm so content)
Nothing better than
(Cause I'm)
Spending time with you

You are my angel
Heaven is close
My favorite place is where you are
So we don't have to do nothing special
Don't want to run
It's always fun to chill at home
Monday through Friday
Sexy Saturday
Easy Sunday
Cause every day's a special one
Just like a holiday
Vacation getaway
After the foreplay
Go room to room making sweet love

I need time
Morning, noon and night
Just keep it coming, baby
Just keep me coming, baby

I swear that I was straight with you
I wasn't looking for nobody new
I just needed someone to talk to
You said you were cool and understood
But now you caught feelings like I knew you would
And you sitting there with a broken heart
Cause I have you my body and not my heart

When I'm holding you late at night
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
When I'm kissing you and look at you
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart

Baby I have to be
Unselfish and true to me
Cause I'm not where I really want to be
And It's nothing with you
It's all me
I toss and turn all night when I sleep
Want and reaching for someone who use to be
Said it must be some karma thing
Cause I can't seem to let go and love again

When I lay with you I close my eyes
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When I'm touching you gently
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
When I'm listing to music I'm thinking' 'bout my ex
In a bubble bath with the candles lit
I'm thinking 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart

You're beautiful
I don't wanna take the space from someone else
So let me go
And do a little soul searchin' for myself
I'm so sorry that
I pulled you in and let it get this far
You know I never meant to break your heart

At the shopping mall or movies
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
At the restaurant while I'm eating
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
While you talk to me I drift away
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex

Would you change your attitude
Could your love still be true
Would it always feel brand new

Rubbing on your leg
Slide a little further up

Breathing on your chest
So anxious to touch it

Remember when I snuck through your window at night,
Bringing you flowers and candy,
Me and you sipping on brandy, plus I appreciate the love on sight,
Huggin' me holdin' me fixed dinner so polite, 
Even when these trippin' pigs was tryin' to sue me 
Forget about friends and family you the one that knew me. 
The way you smile at me keep me feelin' alright, this ain't about fur, fancy cars or ice
So I'm dedicating this to my female friend,

I can't stay inside

But it's already been too long

The touch of your body
But that's not all
No that's not all

Is right on page fifty two
You see what you like
Reading bout what I like
When I'm all alone in the zone with a man
Now would you be ready if I stepped off these pages
And told you that that man was you
Or would you turn out to have some great conversation
But didn't know what to do
Once you got a look at

Actually made a niggas jaw drop
Man she was F I N E head to toe
Six page spread
Baddest thang I ever seen before
Stuck in the store dreaming
Can't even get to the register
Girl behind the counter
Talking but I'm like the hell with her
Cause I swear I deserve this girl
Talking to the pages
Telling me what she like
And how she like it
In different places
What she eat to keep her body tight
Definition of Mr. Right
I fit that description to the T
To the T
All the shit that she don't like
Live for a late night
It sound like she's talking right to me
Especially when she said

Oddly enough I crave for it to remain purely
More authentic than I've been used to
Surely this can't be something that's taboo 'cause you...

Got it like I like it, and I feel the need to say
Baby, it's forever, and I really mean to
Make you feel as special as I see you, baby
Never have I ever been around someone
Who makes life so free and life so fun
And as crazy as it may sound; I ain't joking, baby

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm in those arms of yours
I'm so gone
The things I like
Can't tell me it's not right
When I'm with you
I lose myself and no one
Can make me do
What I can't wait to do when I'm with you

Really, I get inspired off you, baby
Truly, I feel alive from you
And you're the only
No one else can duplicate you
I'd leave the one I have; I know
It's sad but, damn, you...

[Chorus]

The times that we've shared together
Are some of the best times of my life
I wish you were the one
I could be with forever

'Cause when I'm with you
I don't want tomorrow to come
And if I had my way
I'd spend every day and night in your arms
So let me lay here
And feel what happiness feels like
And wish for it to last because
Tomorrow - it's back to real life

Until then
I'll just keep dreaming

(Piano intro)

Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

When weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you mold me
When lost will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Hold me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)

In our darkest hour
In my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?

In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence
In my turbulence

Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow

I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart",Scream [Single Version],2008

There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you

Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer

When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor to stay together
We made our very first promise
To love, to share and be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Let's wait awhile before it's too late
Let's wait awhile, our love will be great
Let's wait awhile before we go too far
I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
to save some for later so our love will be greater

You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing too
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because I'll never give up on you

Whatever happens whatever may come
Whatever may be its cool
I got it covered beloved from A to Z,
I'm the overweight lover, heavy
Bum-diddle-lee-dee D
And you can flip on a trip but
It's alright with me.
If things were meant to be, to be meant
And what I am here to represent is excellence
If you need any help open your
Eyes and its Heavy D that you
Will see cause you're alright with me.

Seeing that your love's true
Never I'll doubt you
My heart belongs to you
That's alright with me
Worlds could end around me
So in love that I can't see
You and me were meant to be
That's alright with me

Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin
I'll love you till the end
You know it's true my friend
You're alright with me

Catch a fallin' star that shines
Make a wish clap 3 times
Dreams come true it's in the mind
That's alright with me
Your wish is my command
Never thought I'd fall in love again
Again with my best friend
That's alright with me

Now be it thick as a milkshake
Or thin as a cornflake
I love you to death but I ain't
Pressed with a heartbreak
And anyway who cares about what
Other people talk about
I rather hear it from the horse's mouth
See I believe in, being believed in
No love life for low ties is all paper thin
But watch for the trickery,
Some people are slippery
They appear making history
Disappear like a mystery
It ain't your fault

Something that I've been holding back
Can't let it go another day
Let me start by saying that

Nothing, nothing,
Nothing, means more than the truth.

And truth is that I realize, love is fading from your eyes
Don't know how it came to this, but we gonna get it fixed tonight
Cus nothing, nothing,
Nothing, is worth losing you

Tell me what could the problem be, that's got you drinking way too much
What could it be 'bout us
Don't you tell me not right now, I can't let it go
(I can't let it go, no I can't let it go, Oh nooo)

What can I do to help you see,
That there's no need for jealousy or insecurities
I'll do anything you want
You can even have the password to my phone

Because nothing, nothing
Should come between us
Trust in me
Trust in me

We should cherish every moment like it's the last
Trust in me
Trust in me

If your issues is with trust, hear me when I tell you this
No one else has shared my love, no one else has had your kiss

Nothing, nothing,
Nothing, can make me forget.

(Noooo)

Forget that you're a good man and I know that you've had it hard
Cus you're more than adequate, you're more than I wish for

Nothing, nothing,
Nothing, can make you any less.

Tell me what could the problem be, the past is something I can't change
It's a brand new day
Don't you tell me not right now, I can't let it go
(I can't let it go, no I can't let it go, Oh nooo)

We've got to fix this, fix this right this minute
Only pure love can calm the noise
Cus baby when we give pure love
Pure love will never come back to us void

Should come between us

Trust in me

We should cherish every moment like it's the last

Soaring above all of your boundaries

Believe you're free to do whatever you want
No no more room #4

To the beautiful people who have been ignored
With blind eyes and cold shoulders attacking them
Invisible people they won't let in
Let's open our eyes to the true barrier
Stereotypical things are the worst
Stand face to face with the real ugly truth
How would you feel if that was you?
Because every life matters
(We all need to do better)
So we all should try
(We all need to do better)
A smile or kind word
Or extending a hand
Helping someone to feel human again

Janet Jackson,"I woke up in heaven in the morning
With the biggest smile upon my face

Cross the other side of bliss
I proof that Heaven does exist

For what is meant to be
Is 'bout to break through

Love is taking over
Like a tidal wave
Our universe is aligned
Feeling the love tonight
Love is taking over
Showing us the way
Darkness starts to fade
After the love tonight
I woke up in heaven in the morning
With the biggest smile upon my face

Way beyond the highest high
I feel love pumping through your body
Gonna redefine our attitudes
Like you better be good to me
And I better be good to you

So even with a million miles distance between us
I know you'll be there to help me escape

Take me away from here
Just somewhere where we disappear
Take me away from here

My intimate danger
But who's playin' my mind, I'm about to lose it
But you're the game changer

It still turns me on, it keeps getting stronger

And the dream we shared fell apart
Now I'm all alone in the night wind
Wind that brought the blues to my heart

Yesterday my arms were around you
And your lips revealed you were mine
Then the angry wind came and found you
Came to end the moment divine

Oh the night wind seems to haunt me
Seems to taunt me now that you don't want me

Stars no longer shine up above

Janet Klein,"Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'd the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me.",The Physician,2002

Cause I can?t get away

Paints a picture of me

Every word they wrote spelling

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Janet Metz,"Joseph's coat annoyed his brothers
Brothers
But what makes us mad
Are the things that Joseph tells us of the
Dream's he often had

I dreamed that in the fields one day,
The corn gave me sign
Your eleven sheaves of corn
All turned and bowed to mine
My sheaf was was quite a sight to see
A golden sheaf and tall
Yours were green and second-rate
And really rather small

This is not the kind of thing
We brothers like to hear
It seems to us that Joseph and his
Dreams should disappear

I dreamed I saw eleven stars,
The sun the moon and sky
Bowing down before my star,
It made me wonder why
Could it be that I was born
For higher thing than you?
A post in someone's government,
A ministry or two

The dreams of our dear brother are
The decade's biggest yawn
His talk of stars and golden sheaves
Is just a load of corn
Not only is he tactless but
He's also rather dim
For there's eleven of us and
There's only one of him
The dreams of course will not come true
That is, we think they won't come true
That is, we hope they won't come true
What if he's right all along?

The dreams are more than crystal clear,
The writing on the wall
Means that Joseph some day soon
Will rise above us all
The accuracy of the dreams
We brothers do not know
But one thing we are sure about
The dreamer
Has to go",Joseph's Dreams,1993

And now His face I see,

Those whose lives have been redeemed,
Broken homes that He has mended,
Those from prison He has freed,
Little children and the aged
Hand in hand stand all aglow,
Who were crippled, broken, ruined,
Clad in garments white as snow.

And now His face I see,

I can see the marching throng,
The flurry of God's trumpets
Spells the end of sin and wrong:

Heaven's grandstand's all in place,
Heaven's choir now assembled,
Start to sing ""Amazing Grace!""

And high above

I'm so lonely

I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

And while I'm waiting here

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you

But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man

And no hero out of books

I'll go away, When I know

If I could just get away 
With my man

For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Searchin', been lookin', everywhere now I need someone to guide me deep within
Seachin' but after all these years, still undiscovered inside me they won't win

As I await my unborn fate, I trust the insecure
But no matter what I give, they all want more

they all awake, but always late, possessions keep the score,
I look for love, but now my eyes are sore, I wanna feel the love so I go

All the wisdom you possess, where is the love you wear to hide your inside like a dress
You never were sincere,

All the time I gave you, I guess

Janet Stubbs,"She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee
Her dress has got a tear
She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair
I even heard her singing in the abbey

She's always late for chapel
But her penitence is real
She's always late for everything
Except for every meal
I hate to have to say it
But I very firmly feel
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

I'd like to say a word in her behalf
Maria makes me laugh

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find a word that means Maria?
A flibbertijibbet! 
A will-o'-the wisp! 
A clown!

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather
She's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!

She'd out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle! She is wild!
She's a riddle! She's a child!
She's a headache! She's an angel!
She's a girl!

Janet Waldo,"On the first of May, it is moving day
Spring is here, so blow your job
Throw your job away
Now's the time to trust
To your wanderlust
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait

In a mountain greenery
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together
While you love your lover
Let blue skies, be your coverlet
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather
And if you're good, I'll search for wood
So you can cook, while I stand looking
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home

Simple cooking means
More than French Cuisines
I've a banquet planned which is
Sandwiches and beans
Coffee's just as grand
With a little sand
Eat and you'll grow fatter, boy
S'matter, boy?
Huh, huh, 'atta boy

In a mountain greenery
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together
How-how-how-how-how we love sequestering
Where no pests are pestering
No dear momma holds us in tether
Mosquitoes here
Won't bite you dear
I'll let them sting, me on the finger
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery
Far from life's machinery
Bless our mountain greenery home

Janet Waldo,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"". 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top! 
You're a hot tamale. 
You're an angel, you, 
Simply too, too, too diveen, 
You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon, 
Over Mae West's shoulder, 
I'm the nominee of the G.O.P. 

Or GOP! 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a Waldorf salad. 
You're the top! 
You're a Berlin ballad. 
You're the boats that glide 
On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia, 
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher, 
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop, 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top!",You're the Top,1998
Janet Waldo,"A fine romance, with no kisses.
A fine romance, my friend, this is.
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes.
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes.
A fine romance, you won't nestle.
A fine romance, you won't wrestle.
I've never mussed a crease in your blue serge pants.
I never had the chance.
This is a fine romance. 
A fine romance, my good fellow.
You take romance. I'll take jello.
You calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean.
At least they flap their fins to express emotion.
A fine romance, with no quarrels,
With no insults, and all the morals.
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France.
I never get the chance.
This is a fine romance.

A fine romance, with no kisses.
A fine romance, my friend, this is.
True love should have the thrills that a healthy crime has.
We don't have half the thrills that ""The March of Time"" has.
A fine romance, with no clinches.
A fine romance, with no pinches.
You never give the orchids I send a glance.
No, you like cactus plants.
This is a fine romance.",A Fine Romance,1998
Janet Waldo,"It's the wonder of the world,
It's a rocket to the moon;
It gets you high, it gets you low,
But once you get that glow!

Here's to my best romance,
Here's to my worst romance,
Here's to my first romance,
Ages ago!

Here's to the boys I've kissed,
And to complete the list,
Here's to the boys who said,
""No!"".

Love, love, hooray for love!
Who was ever too proud, say, for love?
Make this a night for love,
If we have to fight, let's fight for love!

Some sigh and cry for love,
Ah, but in Paree they die for love!
Some waste away for love;
Just the same, hooray for love!

It's a rocket to yhe moon,
With a touch of ""Clare De Lune""!
It gets you high, it gets you low,
But once you get that glow, oh!

Some trust to fate for love,
Others have to take off weight for love!
Some go berserk for love,
Lovers even go to work for love!

Sad songs are sobbed for love,
People have their noses bobbed for love!
some say we pay for love,
Just the same, hooray for love!",Hooray for Love [*],1998
Janet Waldo,"I've never met you, yet never doubt, dear;
I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
while all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
and if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
it's a duty that we owe to dear old France.

Janet Wilson,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

Love had its day
That day is past

I'm so lonely

I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

And no other man in the world",One Kiss,2002
Janet Wilson,"My heart is aching for someone
And you are that someone
You know the truth of my story
You must believe what you see

I, too, may someday love someone
From somewhere there'll come one
One who will hear the same story
That you're telling me.

Wanting you, every day I am wanting you
Every night I am longing to
Hold you close to my eager breast

Wanting love, in that heaven I'm dreaming of
Makes that heaven seem far above
Any hope that I'll gain my quest

Dreams are vain, but I cling to the
Merest chance that you may hear me
Dreams are vain, for whenever I wake
I never find you near me

In this world you are all that I adore,
All I adore.",Wanting You,2002
Janette Carter,"We saw houses falling from the sky 
Where the mountains lean down to the sand 
We saw blackbirds circling 'round an old castle keep 
And I stood on the cliff and held your hand

We walked troubles brooding wind swept hills 
And we loved and we laughed the pain away 
At the end of the journey, when our last song is sung 
Will you meet me in Heaven someday

Can't be sure of how's it's going to be 
When we walk into the light across the bar 
But I'll know you and you'll know me 
Out there beyond the stars

We've seen the secret things revealed by God 
And we heard what the angels had to say 
Should you go first, or if you follow me 
Will you meet me in Heaven someday
 
Living in a mansion on the streets of gold 
At the corner of Grace and Rapture Way 
And sweet ecstasy while the ages roll 
Will you meet me in Heaven someday

In sweet ecstasy while the ages roll 
Will you meet in Heaven someday",Meet Me in Heaven,2002

Here she comes, full blast and top down

Jani Lane,"Ooh it must be magic
How inside your eyes
I see my destiny
Every time we kiss
I feel you breathe your love so deep inside of me
If the moon and stars should fall
They'd be easy to replace
I would lift you up to heaven
And you would take their place

Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red when I closed the door

I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore

Everyday I wake up
I thank God that you are still a part of me
We've opened up the door to which
So many people never find the key
And if the sun should ever fail to send its light
We would burn a thousand candles
And make everything alright

Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red when I closed the door

Me and Uncle Tom were fishin' it was gettin'
Pretty late
Out on a cypress limb above the wishin' well
Where they say is got no bottom say it take
You down to Hell.
Over in the bushes and off to the right
Come two men talking; in the pale moonlight
Sheriff John Brady and Deputiy Hedge
Haulin' two limp bodies down to the water's edge
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin oh yea
I know a secret that I just can't tell
They didn't see me and Tom in the tree
Neither one believin' what the other could see
Tossed in the bodies let 'em sink on down
To the bottom of the well
Where'd they never be bound

I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know who put the bodies in the wishin' well
Soon as they were gone me and Tom got down
Prayin' real hard that we wouldn't make a sound
Runnin; through the woods back to Uncle Tom' shack
Where the full moon shines throught the roof tile cracks
Oh my God Tom who re we gonna tell
The sheriff belongs in a prison cell
Keep your mouth shut that's what we're gonna do
Unless you wanna wind up in the wishin' well too.

Janice Leca,"prends ces paroles comme si elles venaient de ton meilleur ami
certains courent apres le bonheur toute leur vie
et ne l'effleurent que de temps en temps

je ne compte plus les fois ou je l'ai echappe belle a des heures tardives
j'ai commence l'annee avec 3 parabellums braques en direction de mon pare - brise
en sursis a l'abri de rien, des longues marques sur un chemin perilleux
avec un parfum de violence, ca tient a rien
des menottes aux poignets ou un boule au pied
vulnerable jusqu'aux funerailles,
faut que tu l'acceptes comme la disparition de proches qui m'affecte
ou de voir mes neveux dans un ascenseur infect
tout jeune j'etais pas plus con qu'un autre
au milieu des autres a creer des liens impossibles a rompre
en bas des tours passifs, sur les traces des voyous qui nous fascinent
j'ai compris tout jeune que ca n'allait pas etre facile
je ne detestais pas l'ecole mais je ne voyais pas en elle une issue
trop de gens sur mon parcours scolaire m'ont decu, dechu, foutu d'apres les sondages
l'ete a la piscine municipale, toute l'annee avec un mental de sauvage
dans tous les coups a toi d'avoir l'imagination
assez large sans voir venir les soucis qui m'attendaient au virage
au tournant – d'innombrables – car chez nous le mal est palpable

refrain
sois conscient, combien d'epreuves au tournant
trop souvent, en silence ca nous tourmente

je suis curieux de savoir ou tout ca nous mene
au tournant, certains ne sont l'ombre que d'eux - memes
tu vois des potes sortir rentrer, les memes sortir rentrer,
une chance minime de se reinserer
les dents serrees, acerees devant la grisaille de nos batiments
le moral egratigne ca devient vite fatigant, captivant parfois, capture parfois
c'est plus complexe que ca, ce qui est difficile, c'est de durer
les regards froids une fois la majorite passee, voir les fourgons passer, repasser
au jour le jour vivre chaque minute avec compassion, les actions bonnes ou mauvaises
dure a mettre en application ce qu'on nous a appris et pour s'en echapper il y a un prix
faut - il le payer de nos vies ?
dure a comprendre donc dans la solitude, notre fortune est dans notre ame et celui - ci se consume
doucement a chaque epreuve qui nous attend – au tournant –

refrain

au tournant avec un brun de folie, avec ce qu'il faut sous le lit, insoumis
insomniaque on manque de tact
ca devient mauvais d'etre emotif
on a un parpaing au milieu des arteres
la rue t'emmene a commettre l'acte a ne pas faire
entre deux arrivages, deux orages
en attendant de courir dans la mauvaise direction
de tomber sur la mauvaise brigade, au virage et tellement peu bavards
meme au plus judicieux mais rien n'arrive au hasard
en embuscade meme tard la nuit
drogue douce, (whi)sky pour noyer les soucis sur les hauteurs de la ville
gamberger, on a l'age du meurtre
l'age ou on pense a se caser avec l'impression que c'etait hier qu'on se faisait bercer
nos parents s'inquietaient pour nous, maintenant les roles sont inverses
le temps presse, je pourrai me faire renverser
d'etre prier de me coucher a terre, d'etre encercler
c'est un cercle vicieux, un engrenage pour les coups de lame
et les larmes versees et les actes controverses
a dieu et ma famille, je dis merci d'etre encore la
chez nous dormir c'est perdre du temps
apres chaque nuit c'est tout ce qui t'attend

au tournant

je repense a ceux qui me manquent, au tournant

au tournant la famille, ca tourmente

I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see 
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she, coming to me nearly here?

I know on Friday night, he'll do it all again

I'll know, I'll never have to share it with any other man
I'm so glad you introduced us and I'll do the best I can
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand

And the clean a house and cooking for him is not her kind of bag
She said he needed someone who'd love and understand
Then she left him with that bottle in his hand

And the only thing I can count on now is this bottle in my hand

Just tell me a lie

Ooh, tell me a lie
When our night is almost over
And make believe that it's for real
The way you want me to
Come on, tell me a lie
When you're lying close beside me
And whisper when you hold me
Sweet words, ""I love you""

Tell me a lie
When you take me home

Janie Fricke,"You followed me to Texas
You followed me to Utah
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

You went with me to Alabama
And things looked good in Birmingham
We didn't find it there
So, we moved on

I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams

You had my child in Memphis
Then I heard of work in Nashville
But we didn't find it there
So we moved on

To a small farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

Now we've left Alaska
Cause there was no gold there
But this time
Only two of us moved on

Now all we have is each other,
And a little memory to cling to
Still you won't let me go
Go on alone

You watched me lose, you watched me win
You picked me up off of the ground
You never one time let me down

And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly

I was drowning in the sea of make believe
As helpless as a falling leaf
You gave your hand to me that day
And you did it, 'cause you're made that way

And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly

You always seem to let your feelings show
You love me and you let me know

Send a letter that I can show my heart
I'll be somewhere between ""I love you"" and what you're feeling now
Lookin' for a place to fall apart

The call that turned my world around

To deserve even one

Help me Jesus I know what I am

Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song
Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong
Faithless love will find you
And the misery entwine you

That's the way it sometimes goes
Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems

Thrown its chilly arms around me
