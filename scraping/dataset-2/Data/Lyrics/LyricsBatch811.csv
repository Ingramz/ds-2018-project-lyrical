Paddy O'Connor,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2006
Paddy O'Connor,"There's a spot in my heart,
Which no colleen may own.
There's a depth in my soul,
Never sounded or known;

There's a place in my mem'ry,
My life, that you fill,
No other can take it,
No one ever will.

[Chorus]
Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

[Chorus]

Paddy O'Sullivan,"If I should fall from grace with god
Where no doctor can relieve me
If I'm buried 'neath the sod
But the angels won't receive me

Let me go, boys
Let me go, boys
Let me go down in the mud
Where the rivers all run dry

This land was always ours
Was the proud land of our fathers
It belongs to us and them
Not to any of the others

Let them go, boys
Let them go, boys
Let them go down in the mud
Where the rivers all run dry

Bury me at sea
Where no murdered ghost can haunt me
If I rock upon the waves
Then no corpse can lie upon me

It's coming up threes, boys
Keeps coming up threes, boys
Let them go down in the mud
Where the rivers all run dry

If I should fall from grace with god
Where no doctor can relieve me
If I'm buried 'neath the sod
But the angels won't receive me

Let me go, boys
Let me go, boys
Let me go down in the mud
Where the rivers all run dry",If I Should Fall From Grace With God,
Paddy Reilly,"But a lonely prison wall, 
I heard a young girl calling 
Michael they have taken you away,
For you stole trevelyn's corn
So the young might see the morn,
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay

Low lie, The Fields Of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing, 
Its so lonely round the Fields of Athenry

By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young man calling
'Nothing matters Mary, when you're free'
Against the famine and the crown, 
I rebelled, they brought me down 
Now its lonely round the Fields of Athenry

By a lonely harbour wall
She watched the last star falling 
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
Sure she'll live in hope and pray
For her love in Botney Bay 
Its so lonely round the Fields Of Athenry",Fields of Athenry,1985
Paddy Tunney,"The Lowlands of Holland
The love that I have chosen was to my heart's content.
The salt sea shall be frozen before that I repent.
Repent it I shall never until the day I die

But the lowlands of Holland have parted my love and I.
The very night we got married and lay upon our bed
A pressgang came to my bedside and stood at my bedhead
Saying, Arise arise you new married man and come along with me,

To the lowlands of Holland to face your (fight the) enemy.
But Holland is a cold place, a place where grows no green
But Holland is a cold place for my love to wander in *
Though money had been so plentiful as leaves grow on the tree

Yet before I'd time to turn myself my love was stolen from me
Be still, be still, my daughter what makes you to lament
Is there ne'er a lad in our town can give your heart content?
There's lads enough in our town but ne'er a one for me

For I never had but one true love and he was pressed from me
*or (It's a wild inhabitation for my true love to be in)
There shall no mantle cross my back, no comb go through my hair
No firelight nor candlelight shall ease my heart's despair

And I will never married be until the day I die
For the lowlands of Holland have parted my love and me
Recorded by Patrick Galvin and (I think) Clancys",The Lowlands of Holland,1955
Padi,"Setiap perkataan yang menjatuhkan tak lagi ku dengar dengan sungguh
Juga tutur kata yang mencela tak lagi kucerna di dalam jiwa
Aku bukanlah seorang yang mengerti tentang kelihaian membaca hati
Aku cuma pemimpi kecil yang berangan tuk merubah nasibnya
Oh bukankah ku pernah melihat bintang Senyum menghiasi sang malam
Yang berkilau bagai permata
Menghibur yg lelah jiwanya?
Ku gerak kan langkah kaki
Dimana cinta akan bertumbuh
Kulayangkan jauh mata memandang
Tuk melanjutkan mimpi yang terputus
Masih kucoba.. mengejar rinduku
Meski peluh membasahi tanah
Letih, penat tak menghalangiku
Tuk temukan bahagia
Oh bukankah ku pernah melihat bintang
Senyum menghiasi sang malam
Yang berkilau bagai permata
Menghibur yg lelah jiwanya
Bukankah hidup ada perhentian
Tak harus kencang terus berlari
Kuhela kan nafas panjang
Tuk siap berlari kembali
(Bagai bintang yang bersinar menghibur yang lelah jiwanya, bagai
Bintang yang berpijar menghibur yang sedih hatinya)

Padre Marcelo Rossi,"So this is Christmas and what have you done,
Another year over, a new one just begun.

And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun,
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.

And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong,
The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long.

And so happy Christmas for black and for white
For the yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights.

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear.

And so this is Christmas and what have we done
Another year over, a new one just begun.

Padre Marcelo Rossi,"Se acontecer um barulho perto de você
É um anjo chegando para receber
Suas orações e levá-las a Deus

Então abra o coração e comece a louvar
Sinta o gosto do céu que se derrama no altar
Que um anjo já vem com a benção nas mãos

Tem anjos voando neste lugar
No meio do povo e em cima do altar
Subindo e descendo em todas as direções
Não sei se a igreja subiu ou se o céu desceu
Só sei que está cheio de anjos de Deus
Porque o próprio Deus está aqui 

Quando os anjos passeiam a igreja se alegra
Ela canta, ela chora, ela ri e congrega
Abala o inferno e dissipa o mal
Sinta o vento das asas dos anjos agora
Confia irmão pois é a tua hora
A benção chegou e você vai levar
Tem anjos voando

Paez,"En un café se vieron por casualidad
Cansados en el alma de tanto andar
Ella tenía un clavel en la mano

Llegaba a la ventana en puntas de pie
Y la llevó a caminar por corrientes
¡miren todos! ellos solos
Pueden más que el amor

Y son más fuertes que el olimpo
Se escondieron en el centro
Y en el baño de un bar sellaron todo con un beso
Durante un mes vendieron rosas en la paz
Presiento que no importaba nada más

Jamás conquisté mi corazón

Tan mezquino y criminal

Vengo de un barrio

Dónde estabas cuando pasó lo que pasó
Hablándote al espejo sola?

Que celebro la experiencia feliz
La estupidez del mundo 
Nunca pudo y nunca podrá
Arrebatar la sensualidad
Busco mi piedra filosofal

En el cadáver exquisito
En no tener piedad

Hoy los tiempos
Van a mil y tu extraño corazon
Ya no capta como antes

Las pulsiones del amor
Y yo te digo que dar es dar
Dar y amar
Mira nena hacelo fácil
Dar es dar
Dar lo que tengo
Todo me da, da, da, da

No cuento el vuelto
Siempre es de mas da, da
Dar es dar
Es solamente
Una manera de andar
Dar es dar
Lo que recibes
Es también libertad

Cuando estoy perdido
Un poco loco por ahí
Siempre hay alguien
Con tus ojos
Esperándome a sufrir
Porque dar es dar
Dar y amar
Gracias nena por tu vida
Una vez mas

Dar es dar
Dar lo que tengo
Todo me da da, da
No cuento el vuelto
Siempre es de mas da, da
Estar de menos
O estar de mas da, da
Cielo o infierno

Lo mismo da ,da, da
Dar es dar
Dar es dar
Dar es dar
Dar es dar
Es encontrar en alguien
Lo que nunca encuentras",Dar Es Dar,1997
Paez,"Nací en el '63, con Kennedy a la cabeza
Una melodía en la nariz, creo que el aire estaba raro, mediaba marzo
El mundo me hizo crecer entre zanahoria y carnes
El '69 me encontró viendo a ese hombre en esa luna televisada

Y vino el colegio, y vino Vietnam
Los yanquis juraban amar el napalm
Jobim me dormía en la noche cuando todo era calma

Tocaba folklore, después rock and roll
Y ahí llegó Lennon hablando de amor
¿Qué pasa en la Tierra que el cielo es cada vez más chico?
¿Qué pasa en la Tierra que el cielo es cada vez más chico?

El barrio está igual que ayer
Voltearon la casa de al lado
La gente está igual que ayer
Con un par de añitos encima

Después empecé a fumar en cada rincón oscuro
Ya corría el '76, no se puede andar solo en
La calle sin un revolver

Y así tuve una mujer en el medio de mis piernas
Como la marea, un día se fue
Como bicicleta andaba el mundo, apresurado

Recuerdo lugares de mi ciudad
Recuerdo aquel beso en el medio del cine
Recuerdo al guardián en la plaza con su palo de escoba

Hoy mataron a un hombre de pie en Nueva York
Comienza otra década a todo motor
El viento me toca la cara, marca un cambio de rumbo
El viento me toca la cara, marca un cambio de rumbo

El barrio está igual que ayer
Voltearon la casa de al lado
La gente está igual que ayer
Con un par de añitos encima

Y así empecé el '83, son casi 20 años de historia
El siglo se muere y no cambia más
Está agonizando en cualquier hospital

Nosotros tenemos la culpa y hay que solucionarlo
Llamemos al débil y al orador, al mozo, al poeta
Al músico, al peón
Llamemos a todos los hombres, que el banquete está listo

",Del '63,1997
Paez,"Todas las mañanas que viví 
Todas las calles donde me escondí 
El encantamiento de un amor 
El sacrificio de mis madres 
Los zapatos de charol 
Los domingos en el club 
Salvo que cristo sigue allí en la cruz 
Las columnas de la catedral y la tribuna 
Grita gol el lunes por la capital 

Todos yiran y yiran 
Todos bajo el sol 
Se proyecta la vida 
Mariposa technicolor 
Cada vez que me miras 
Cada sensación 
Se proyecta la vida 
Mariposa technicolor 

Vi sus caras de resignación 
Los vi felices llenos de dolor 
Ellas cocinaban el arroz 
Se levantaba sus principios 
De sutil emperador 

Todo al fin se sucedió 
Sólo que el tiempo no los esperó 
La melancolia de morir en este mundo 
Y de vivir sin una estúpida razón 

Todos yiran y yiran 
Todos bajo el sol 
Se proyecta la vida 
Mariposa technicolor 
Cada vez que me miras 
Cada sensación 
Se proyecta la vida 
Mariposa technicolor 

Yo te conozco de antes 
Desde antes del ayer 
Yo te conozco de antes 
Cuando me fui 
No me alejé 
Llevo la voz cantante 
Llevo la luz del tren 
Llevo un destino errante 
Llevo tus marcas en mi piel 
Y hoy solo te vuelvo a ver",Mariposa Tecknicolor,1997
Paez,"Lo pensó dos veces y se marchó 
Como una frutilla su corazón 
Siempre el mismo rollo 
Con los parientes
Me dejó unos discos en el placard 
Un reloj de plata y un samurai 
Todo detallado en un expediente
Y allí va, parte del aire 
Y allí va en libertad
Música de grillos del paraná 
Cada enero nuevo se hacía escuchar 
Como un buen presagio de las comadres
El amó una estrella en su soledad 
Y una noche antes de navidad 

Recortó los cables con un diamante 
Y allí van parte del aire 
Y allí van en libertad 
El amor más grande que conocí 
Sin querer un día pasó por mí 
Por la vía láctea se encontrarán 
En algún planeta, en algún lugar
Donde va la gente y su corazón 
Donde van los años y este dolor 
Y donde voy yo no me importa ya 
Vengo de ríos que dan al mar
Parte del aire 
Ya allí van solo solo 
En libertad",Parte del Aire,1997
Paez,"Soñé que encarnaba en ella 
Escapando del zar

Siete vidas espero por un taxi boy solo para verme mal 

Todo lo que fui fue también ruta libre

Rayo de amor, cáliz de amor 
Entre las piedras solo de amor 
Hombres de amor, guerras de amor 
Solo veo locas de amor

Sombras de amor, labios de amor 
Entre la gente, un cable de amor

Solo veo piernas de amor

Paez,"Los barcos viajan de país en país 
La luna no siempre es la misma 
Y vos te vas a ir, solo en la habitación 
Tu mamá se fue a marruecos sin alhajas
Es algo así como cansarse de todo 
Todo sigue dando vueltas
Estoy abriéndome, estoy cansándome
Mi nación no tiene cruces ni banderas
No es que no te crea 
Es que las cosas han cambiado un poco
Es mi corazón quien decide entre el mar y la arena
Necesito verte antes que sea demasiado tarde
Casi son las tres, tres agujas tengo en la cabeza
No, creo que nunca es tarde
Una válvula de escape 
Se transforme en un acorde 
No, es que yo no quiero más nadar en piletas

Están partiendo el mundo por la mitad, están
Quemándose las velas
Están usándome, están riéndose
Y mi canción es un antídoto liviano 
No es que no te crea
Es que las cosas han cambiado un poco
Es mi corazón quien decide entre el mar y la arena
Necesito verte antes que sea demasiado tarde
Casi son las tres, tres agujas tengo en la cabeza

Oh! mi amor, estoy tranquilo pero herido",Tres Agujas,1997
Paez,"Tu amor abrió una herida 
Porque todo lo que te hace bien 
Siempre te hace mal 
Tu amor cambió mi vida como un rayo 
Para siempre, para lo que fue y ser  
 
La bola sobre el piano la mañana aquella 
Que dejamos de cantar  
Llegó la muerte un día y arrasó con todo,  
Todo, todo, todo un vendaval,  
Y fue un fuerte vendaval  
 
Algo de vos llega hasta mí 
Cae la lluvia sobre París 
Pero me escapé hacia otra ciudad 
Y no sirvió de nada,  
Porque todo el tiempo estabas dando vueltas 
Y más vueltas que pegué en la vida para tratar de reaccionar 
Un tango al mango revoleando la cabeza como un loco 
De aquí para allá, de aquí para allá  
 
Después vinieron días de misterio y frío,  
Casi como todos los demás 
Lo bueno que tenemos dentro es un brillante,  
Es una luz que no dejar? escapar jamás  
 
Algo de vos llega hasta mí,  
Cuando era pibe tuve un jardín 
Pero me escapé hacia otra ciudad 
Y no sirvió de nada,  
Porque todo el tiempo estaba yo en un mismo lugar,  
Y bajo una misma piel y en la misma ceremonia 
Yo te pido un favor, que no me dejes caer  
En las tumbas de la gloria",Tumbas de la Gloria,1997
Paez,"Epifanico silencio a la hora del amar
Tus ensueños ya se hicieron a la mar
Un extracto del perfume del dolor
Tus muñecas boca arriba y hacia el sol
Tus regalos deberian de llegar
Los elefantes locos, el vestido, el ajuar
Caminando en la neblina que disipa el corazon
Los milagos en cuerpo ya seran
Las violetas de tu sangre viviran 
Sobre un rio enamorado, y en su andar
Tus regalos deberian de llegar
Las velas, las vajillas y tu felicidad
Y no sabes si detenerte o llover
Y parada sobre el mundo a tu pies
Tu sonrisa que nos hace temblar
Tiempla el mundo que no entiende al final
Ese beso de la vida, la sutil melancolia
El momento cuando piras, los espacios donde miras
Y las gotas de tu lluvia se iran

Y otra vez en la secuencia de lo petalos que caen
Se decubren los misterios de azar 
Y las manos que se encuentran en la flor
La bestial naturaleza del amor
Tus regalos deberian de llegar
Si todo se termina todo vuelve a empezar
La mañana que se vienes es una extraña sensacion 
Que refleja en los espejos del tiempo
Y la niña acurrucada en el rincon 
Es la chica contra la furia de dios
Tus regalos deberian de llegar
No es mucho lo que tengo para darte, mirá
Y no sabes si detenerte o llover
Y parada sobre el mundo a tus pies
Tu sonrisa que nos hace temblar
Tiemba el mundo que no entiende al final

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I wonder why I didn't see it there before

She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be
True, that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

Well, who'd have thought?
Well, bless my soul
Well, who'd have known?
Well, who indeed?

And who'd have guessed They'd come together on their own?
It's so peculiar

Paige O'Hara,"The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Glories stream from heaven afar

Paige O'Hara,"What child is this, who, laid to rest,
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The babe, the son of Mary

Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and donkeys are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,
The cross be borne for me, for you
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
The Babe, the Son of Mary

So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king, to own him
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone him
Raise, raise a song on high,
The virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born,
The babe, the Son of Mary",What Child Is This?,1997

Ah, Belle
Good Morning. I've come to return the book I borrowed
Finished already
Oh, I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new
Ha Ha! Not since yesterday
That's all right. I'll borrow, this one
That one? But you've read it twice
Well, it's my favorite! Far off places, daring sword fights
magic spells, a prince in disguise
If you like it all that much, it's yours
But sir
I insist
Well, thank you. Thank you very much

Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three

Now it's no wonder that her name means ""beauty""
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle

Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston, You're the greatest
hunter in the whole world!

No beast alive stands a chance against you. Ha ha ha and
no girl, for that matter.
It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sights set on that one

She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry
But she's
The most beautiful girl in town.
I know, but
That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best
Well, of course! I mean you do, but

Who is beautiful as me

Die die, I'll fuck you up
You want me on my knees but I'm not going down

Die die, it is your choice
No time for games so just leave me the fuck alone

Important thing you can learn is this:
To submit to the will of the man upstairs
And don't get too wrapped up in yourself
And so I guess this is kind of an amateur prayer
For people trying to find their own way,
Or a request for strength and a reminder to resist
What the well-meaning naysayers say when they say

Where a wedding has been, lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps
In a jar by the door, who is it for?

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people

That no one will hear, no one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night
When there's nobody there, what does he care?

And was buried along with her name, nobody came

As he walks from the grave, no one was saved

You catch me instead of 'it wasn't me'
I'm gonna say 'where you get a key from?'

is worth me asking my doctor why my nuts itches
If they see how the Rolls Royce smell

Talking 'bout I used to fuck with they 3rd cousin

walk with me
And see the world I see
It is our home
It's where we all belong

life is flair
A brittle dress we wear
A fleeting sigh
But though pointless it may seem...
Live as death were but a dream

you don't have to walk their way
You don't have to watch the show
You don't have to play their game
And you don't have to die to leave entropia

all remains...
Forgotten smiles in frames
Two fleeting lives cut down to pocket-size

walk with me
And change the world we see
We'll cease to be
Just people passing by
Home is where we all get by

you don't have to cry for more
You don't have to have it all
You don't have to win a war
If death is but a dream
Then don't let me...

...fall asleep

Now when I stand at the end of the line, I cling to life when I should
Decline. I always thought I would welcome this day, but now when it's here
Could there be a heaven behind that gate? 
Love or hate? 

Wait by my side. count the seconds till I die. 
Hold my hand. 
Smile and tell me that you care, 'cause I'm scared now.

Decline. I always thought I would welcome this day, but now I can see:

I turn to thee you've got to tell me what will become of me? 

Why shall I die?

'In time of war the first casualty is truth.' 'What broke in a man when he
Could bring himself to kill another?'

We've seen it before but safe on our suburb screens
Now I am here in the flesh
A witness of war in this godforsaken scene
Far from those grey walls
See children with guns hatred and fear in their eyes
They shoot to release their pain
A conflict to solve no matter if someone dies
Protecting our interests...
Look around, soon there'll be but ruins to be found
Winner will be the last that stands
Lethal moves in a game of chess for the depraved
King or Pawn? Are you worth to save?
(What is the prize for this game we play?)
(And who are the ones that finally pay?)

If we eat more we'll get a handful of nothing
We'll be swallowing dirt
If we push more we'll get a fistful of enough
We'll be swallowing blood

They told me that we could actually save human lives
That armies would preserve the peace
And my work would save, solve and build bonds
Only lies!
And I fed their wallets...

It's strange how we speak of civilised views
While we buy that media warface they sell
A makeup for ""Them"" so we can decide who's to die
Cause we love it easy:

Here they are - take a good look at the beasts of war!
Let the rain wash that paint away:
Deep inside everyone's a mothers little child
Longing home, lost and led astray
And we prey on this decay!

If we eat more we'll get a handful of nothing
We'll be left with the dirt
If we push more we'll get a fistful of enough
I leave this machine...

I left my life to ease my pain
But I cannot find that cleansing rain...
Look around soon there'll be but ruins to be found
We can change - it's all in our minds...
[-D. Gildenlow]

Step by step hate controls every heart every soul
Every gun pointed at those we paint as Enemies
We provide what they need to let the game proceed
Stuck in machines somewhere we build the cross they bear
Arm to solve, kill to save... God I've felt how it smells!
""My land's my home"" - we're blind!
I'm sick of the blood I find!
Step by step greed controls every heart every soul
Arm to kill, kill to live - God how could I believe...

The ""knowing-right-from-wrong side""
Our home is inside!

I've travelled the world around
In search for some Grail of mine
How could I be so blind?
It was always here:inside
I have only some weeks to give
But at last I live

Life's just a line of situations
A matter of occasions
And mystic correlations
The work of a Machine!

Here in a world split to nations
We fail to see the relations
Between the Wheel and the Machine
And of the scars we're leaving...

Inside!
I swear there's someone inside
Fighting to get outside
Just give it all an hour
By the Concrete Lake!

'I dread the day my children will ask me why. I dread the day when I will
have to explain to them that people thought it was acceptable to destroy
the environment so that we could have jobs. I dread the day I will have to
explain to my bright-eyed Joshua, who talks to dogs and listens to the
grass screaming, that we were all to busy driving fast cars, rushing our
children off to day-care, and finding seniors' homes to our grandparents
and listening to the ringing of cash registers.

We were all too busy to hear the grass screaming.'",Inside Out,1999
Pain of Salvation,"[Music: D.Gildenlow]

'Only the tame birds have a longing. The wild ones fly.'

So once again
Another New Year's Eve will ease our pain
Faith for the few
And rites that will make us so brave
So new
We laugh and we cheer for a Happy New Year
Happy?

Candles burn down
And in the darkness future comes around
We smile - all aware
But never speaking of the masks we wear
Blind!

Turning mirrors upside down
Won't make dust fall off the ground
Hiding wounds won't ease the pain
Sleep won't make you whole again

Change the inside!
...drink the rain...

Dressing our words
Seeing the dirt and flaws inside us hurts
One final glass
A sour taste from our promises
I bid farewell and crawl out of my shell

I'm awake!
I see the mistakes I make
Hiding wounds won't ease the pain
Sleep won't make you whole again
Change the inside...

Today I found a seed of sorrow
The harvest leaves a soil of shame
Now I undress and face tomorrow
And brave I walk to meet the blame

I'll search my home outside these borders
I'll run to meet up with the past
A Resolution for the New Life
This time I know it's gonna last

And I will...
Change the inside
Drink the rain
Open my wounds to heal the pain

Learn the work of The Machine...

",New Year's Eve,1999
Pain of Salvation,"[Music: D.Gildenlow]

'In fire, we can see our past and our coming. For, as with us and our time,
These flames are solely born through the complete and utterly consumption
Of its surroundings. By which, the fire itself is also condemned to be
Destroyed. Demanding, beautiful and very lethal, it lives itself to death...'

The higher I am reaching - the closer to the sun
The more I learn the less I know for sure
For each machine I'm leaving I find a bigger one
For each step I turn wiser than before
But it's burning me...
Pilgrim, where are you going?
Pilgrim, your roads turning bleak
Pilgrim, true to your knowing
But what will you pay for the Grail that you seek?

Though these roads seem endless
And life seems out of reach
The roads I left were better off unwalked
If I had just been stronger
If I had dared to see
Maybe I would not have had to go this far
But still I won't give in...

Pilgrim, where are you going?
Pilgrim, your roads turning bleak
Pilgrim, This quest is your calling
...the curtains are falling...
Pilgrim, where are you going?
And who sets the price on the answers you seek?

In this hot, 
Desolate timeglass I met this man, 
Wearing a worn old flyer's cap. 
Every day he had to dig 10 feet down for his daily ration of water 
One poor gallon. 
And so he did 
Singing while doing it!

10 feet of sand for the thirst
But he gave me half of what he was given for a day
All for thirst and sanity use
While we use up hundred times more:
What do we do with it?
Pipes and bathtubs, sprinklers and fountains!
Freshwater used as a dump for oil and nuclear waste!
""Desert people turns humble"" he said
They know what they have
But do they know what they lose when we flush?

But yet, sadly, 
He looked up to me. 
Felt a need for our greed: 
Our ""freedom"". 
Said all he really wanted was a car and a radio. 
He too failed to see the relation 
Between our lives
And his starvation

We hit and we scratched to make in her a hole
Glares and eyes, whispers and notes
Attached to her every pose

For the collection of her voices
I was too weak to collect
But so, it turned out, was she
Both paid in soul for the cutting of that loss

Their ugly truth
Outnumbered by far her beautiful dream
And I closed my eyes

Sweat, skin, a pulse divine to balance this restless mind - it seemed so wonderfully physical
Oh the blood, the lust, the bodies that color the world: all drugs to die for! won't you share my fire? 
How can love make that world a minefield of forbidden ground? 
A map of untouchable skin and silenced desire? 

And love was there in vain, profound and deep but traced with pain - too early for a child of ten
Loving the pure and sane he sought the goddess unstained - watching them turn to flesh again
Hungry for both the purity and sin
Life seemed to him merely like a gallery of how to be
And he was always much more human than he wished to be

And then after all it lead me here to wake up again
Seeking a love that might make me feel free in myself but then it proves to be
Something that hurts inside when we touch, so I move on, I lose my way
Astray I'm trying too much to feel unchained, to burn out this sense of feeling cold
And every day I seek my prey: someone to taste and to hold
I feel alive during the split second when they smile and meet my eyes
But I could cry 'cause I feel broken inside! 
Come and drown with me- the undertow will sweep us away! 
And you will see that I'm addicted to my honesty
Trust! 'cause after all my sense of truth once brought me here
But I've lost control and I don't know if I am true to my soul
I've lost control and I don't know if I am true to my soul
Losing control and I don't know if I am true at all

And we were always much more human than we wished to be...

And all those years of being faithful to you despite the hunger flowing through my veins
And I have always tried to calm things down - swallow down swallow down
""It's just another small thorn in my crown""
But suddenly one day there was too much blood in my eyes, and I had to take this walk down
Remedy lane of when's and whys

I imagine eternity would have that effect, because a certain amount of drifting, like omni presence, would demand omni absence.

I rule rage rod and rattling of bones

I am on my own
I am all alone
Everything is gone
Stuck forever here
Already cold

I'm never crossing that line
Leaving this world behind
I will stay on my own
On this bloodstained throne? 

I'm never crossing that line
Leaving this world behind
I will stay on my own
On this bloodstained throne

And the rattling of bones
Ruler of ruin

Pain of Salvation,"A scene in brown and yellow:
At first I don't know why your presence fills me with unease
Though I've missed you more than life itself
I freeze
It's like you've been lost and now you're glad to see my face
But as you sit down my confusion turns to distress
Not knowing how to let you know that you are
Dead
(I wake up sweating)

They tell me you are better off
Where you are now
Well, I don't care
They tell me that your pain is gone
Where you are now
Well, you left it here
See, I need to be strong
Need to be brave
I need to put faith in something
How could I live on
Not hoping we will meet
Again?

A scene in white and grey:
Under the icon's weight the old thoughts lay
Under the cross so still and pale
The flowers usher the stale breath of death away
And someone tries to sing
But the bird of song has lost its wings
Now it twitches
Rips the stitches of a chest where tears are torn
And where all loss begins

Life seems too small when death takes its toll
I need something to blame for this pain

A scene in amber - flawed:
And have you ever had that dream
Where one you love passes away?
And you wake up crying to a world
Where she's long since gone
But you feel the pain
So close
As if she'd died today
But I need to be strong
I need to be brave
I need to put faith in something
How could I live on
Not hoping we will meet
Again
Some day?

Earth to earth, dust to dust
A verse we know too well
Like a nursery rhyme
Just in reverse
'cause we are all the little tin man
With hearts like little tin cans
And as we line them down with tears
Over the years
They inevitably turn
To rust

Life seems too small when death takes its toll
I need something to blame for this pain
I try, I fail, I fall, like anyone you know
I break, I bleed, like anyone you know

A scene in blood on white:
Where the linen's changed just for tonight
And somehow we beat her to this sight
This ghostly room of exit
That she enters by the flicker of candle light
And in her breast
A desert storm is taking form
An old thirst that can never be quenched or killed
Sweeps over the cold
Broken but thousandfold

Hear me

Some things will never change 
Touch me

Mankind remains the same 

Oceans

Now everything bears our name 
While earth is bleeding 
Nothing will remain 
Nothing prevails 

We were stuck in this world of change 
Expecting it to remain 
Now nothing is left unstained 

No! 

When there's nothing more that we can trade 
Own 
Steal 
Or sell 

When there's nothing whole because we took it apart 
And 
Just left

When there's nothing left for us to break 
Use 
Abuse 
Or rape 

Then you're free to count how much you saved 

I can see the ways we fail 
I can see us fall so easily 
A structure far too frail 
I can see 40,000 years of knowledge and history 
Invested in this child 
Spoiled and stained by proud divinity 
Gaining at best the perspective and wisdom 
Of not even a fleeting century 

We have now reached the final ten thousandth of a second 
Of our evolutionary year, as we hit 2,000 at a birth rate 
Of 250 people a minute 

Tell me 
How are we supposed to survive? 
If we're acting like fools 
All dropping dead to stay alive? 
Someone tell me 
Please just show me 
If there's nothing to do, god we'll turn to you 
But if we're an image of you 
I reckon you are just as puzzled and ugly too 

You think we have developed fast; that we're civilized and intelligent 
I'll let you in on a secret: we have developed things! 
The rest is simply knowledge passed on 
(I can see us drain this world 
I can see us buying loss too cheap 
Terra sterilia washing its bronken hand of us now 
Creation's blackest sheep! ) 
Hell, 99% of humanity couldn't put together a simple light bulb if you put a gun to their heads! 
And the intellect rubs off on fear

2,050 ad: 9,104 million people 

I can see us read the signs 
But spell them out in backward travesty 
I see us close our eyes 
To all the wounds that we inflict to this world by being ""free"" 
We love this world to death 
Purchasing our lifestyles with our lives 
Defending our momentarily nations 
With the loss of our priceless earthly home 

It's not hard to reach the top 
It's not hard not knowing when to stop 
It's not hard to take all 
Not very difficult to fly if you settle for a fall 
It's not hard to cross a line 
It's not hard to push and go to far 
Some creatures cannot climb 
Then there are us who cannot even learn how to stay alive 

I'm sorry! 
For the things we did and did not do 
Forgive us; the fools that rushed ahead without a clue 
I am sorry 
Please forgive us

And without thinking he will cover up his naked hand

It's all sick
We're all sick, you are making me sick

Soup of the season hitting ground",Scarsick,2007
Pain of Salvation,"We saw you every day with your hands on your crotch and so much to say
You went from bouncing toy cars with golden motors to neon striped 
BMWs and a court of drugged up nodders and quoters
Namefucking fame on all photos, all cheered on and applauded by even richer promoters
Now when you're a star, 
When you've reached this far and the world really knows who you are (really?) 
You show off your six black Mercedeses 
And drink Cristal like they all do
And the poor outside your gates appall you, and the only hood you see is the one on your car
Do you even know who you are?
Bro I don't think so
I mean Mercedes, man what a stiff old dull fart's republican shit car
Sick of hearing you preach to the poor like before, 
Only now you're a coward, only letting TV through your door
Getting older, take a bow and just go
The rage on the stage getting colder like your hits on the chart, 
But then the talk shows can still get you hard
Doin' rhymes on your prime time fistfights 
And spittin' grime in the limelight like a star gets a chip off your shoulder, 
A boulder that rolls and rolls over and over and over

There's nothing like a broken childhood
There's nothing like a broken home
There's nothing like a tale from your hood
There's nothing like a record of restriction orders
Outspoken borderline disorders, a violent long way to the top
The longer that you fought yourself up, the longer the spitfall

You're so fucking lost that with all of the costs 
You still don't see that in reality the one thing you fail to buy yourself is a personality
You're trapped in a mould of the rap, you sell but you're sold
I mean, can't believe that you're paying all that gold 
To some home decorator that hands you buckets of conformity
Seems you're losing your way together with your policy man, 
Ending up with a new definition of poverty, it's a joke
Like those you make in every video to reach the kids with the dough, 
With every copied ""aha yo"" and worn out ""bro""
Guess what we need is yet another clown 
Who can feed our breed with another look and hooker hook
Now when ""bitch"" is mundane you take the lead with ""wassup ho"" 
And let TV blur your mouth once more
Just what we need in every store, thus quote the craving: ""forever more!""
You're so right, a shiny knight on a white steed, truly a hero
Yeah right
Fuck you, fuck you right down to the core
You know what? You're just another Parental Advisory bore

There's nothing like a broken childhood
There's nothing like a broken home
There's nothing like a tale from your hood
There's nothing like a record of restriction orders
Outspoken borderline disorders, a violent long way to the top
The longer that you fought yourself up, the longer the spitfall...
When you're rappin' your shit y'all

Yo, I guess when you're that loaded 
You'd better empty the barrel every chance you get, is that so?
Empty your word and pose magazine, in magazine after magazine, 
Let every shot go, let the shit flow
'Cause the show must go on and on and on, you're it bro
But it's sad to know, when your star implodes, 
All that shit hits the fans, just like your words back when you shone
But it's getting late in the game, trapped in repeating your name, 
Again and again, like you're scared we'll forget it
Can't blame you, apart from that name you're all embarrassingly the same, 
It's so lame, can't you get it?
And perhaps you are right in that fear, 
More sane than you appear in your self deploring cock obsessive koks delirium
But I say, to me you just redefine the old romans' vomatorium

There's nothing like a broken childhood
There's nothing like a broken home
There's nothing like a tale from your hood
There's nothing like a record of restriction orders
Outspoken borderline disorders, a violent long way to the top
The longer that you claim that you have fought yourself up, the longer the spitfall

You're a man of the masses, took all the classes
Their asses are yours
All those bores who are paying the bills for your palace uphills
And your pills that will help you proceed in your greed
You are free of the chains that you need on your fans to adore, 
To kneel down before you, more precious to you than your brains and your hands
They live for you
If you could just see this old tree, this patriarchic hierarchy, 
Up where you want to be, you need miles of roots to lick your boots
Don't you see?
You're a man of the masses, you need all those asses, 
Their fate to relate to the one that you were
Do you know who you are? Who are you? Not the one in your words that they buy
They concur that you conquer, though a natural flunker, 
And you need them to stay, not to fly, to obey like the dogs 
That they are, the cogs under the hood of your Mercedes car
They will pay for your trip to the stiff upper lip
You're a man of the masses, your trip is a journey through classes
You are high, they are low, and you need it to be so
See, without them you'd be nothing more than before, and you know that's not much
It's just or unjust such: just a sad little man with his hand on his crotch

There's nothing like a broken childhood
There's nothing like a broken home
There's nothing like a tale from your hood
There's nothing like a record of restriction orders
Outspoken borderline disorders, a violent long way to the top
The longer that you fought yourself up, the longer the spitfall
The longer the spit falls
When you're rappin' your shit y'all

You're just another Parental Advisory sticker surfing beach boy

Pain Teens,"You only live twice, or so it seems
One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on

Pain Teens,"I'm dying in the morning
Have seen what I've wanted and I'm done
I've given up the battle
I know that I never could have won

I've got an invitation, I don't know if I dare
I've got an invitation, I don't know if I dare
I've got an invitation
To go where I never will have to care

I've thrown away the pieces
The puzzle will never be complete

I put my trust in my belief

Paint by Numbers,"So this is the way we say thank you for staying so close
To my side for all these years
I've watched you slip as we grow old
And the walls are stained with memories to each his own

My favorite is the time I held you
Off the edge then let go
Don't close your eyes and everything will be just fine
You carry disease, I carry the only remedy

And once you ingest the side effects are permanent
This is how they found you
The same way that I left you
Your body holds the evidence

The obvious is put on display again
Actions have spoken loud, words have begun to fail
You never gave a thought to help
So help yourself, I know you will

And you're very proud I envy your seasoned skill
A scratch of the surface seemed so small
But take a look what's revealed
Just close your eyes
And I will make everything alright",Friends,2005

Tried to live the simple life.

So what's left? 
I've got a head like a trainwreck. 
Who's keeping count of the casualties? 

Fatigue thrusts it's jackhammer fists into my eyes, but I'm afraid to lie down. Afraid to slow down. Afraid to go home. It's gonna catch up to me...

No, no, no... no, no.. that's right
Don't even trip.. here's the song

Everybody want to live lavish
But it's not possible unless you really got cabbage
Me, I'm a savage, so I'm gonna have it
Everybody wants V.I.P. wit the baggage
Me, plus one (No!) me, plus two (No!)
Me, plus three, can you get us in the door? (No!)
When I was a patron, all I got was hatin'
Now, everybody want to smile in my face, but...

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Not everyone can be V.I.P
Some of why'all just can't ride wit me
Don't even trip when we hit the do'
And if you act funny, better give 'em some dough

When I step up in the place, people recognize my face
They don't even check to see if there's a weapon on my waist
And remember.. I'm doin' what I told you before
Man, I ain't waitin' in this line, I'm bout to go through the door
Now, I don't mind sippin' Mo, but I love the 'Yac
Mami, the line here is long and the club is packed
I'm breakin' the dress code while sippin' the X-O
Now I'm ready to unload, come on, ma, let's go, whoa

Lifestyles, kinda crazy, lazy
Chicken heads see me, actin' like I'm Jay-Z
Change the game, say my name, platinum chain
Can't wait in line, plus you know it's bout to rain
Ask the man at the door, is it cool?
And if not, slide him this, you know just what to do
But uh, I don't trip, it ain't all about me
'Cause not everyone can be V.I.P

[Chorus: Repeat 2X)]

When I'm at the club, fools want to be like me
Spendin' they rent dough, just to match my cheese
Hennessey, Hennessey, Long Island iced tea
If you buy one mo', you'll be out on the streets
I'm Playa Lo, baby, and that's the gang
I'm V.I.P. status just because of my name
I steps right in wit a devilish grin
I told you cats last time I like to stay on cloud ten
Sippin' bumpy face water, at the club freakin' ya daughter
If she takes one mo' drink, sorry, man, I got her
I'm wearin' Prada, sike, nigga, I ain't
But the clothes that I wear just might make ya faint
I'm iced out, rollin' candy paint
Hey, put me on the list, dog! Naw, dog, I ain't!
Paid him a couple dollars and getcho ass in
If you ain't got no gold, there goes ya girlfriend, I'm a playa!

I came to get a hoe, I rock that big ice
My name is Livio, I got to live life
I got this thick chain, I kick that sick game
I make my own ends, I ride on chrome rims
A bunch of chicken heads outside kickin' eggs
My dogs is feelin' hungry, that's why we gettin' fed
Believe it, I run this, you cannot be by me
And don't even bump this if ya not V.I.P., woo

So many chicken heads, we can't get you in, we can't get you in
So many chicken heads, we can't get you in, we can't get you in

And roped real good
And tried to get his ranch out in the clear

The grass grows now where none used to be
His roping got him started
Cattle prices made it better
And he's trying to get his ranch out in the clear

Five years ago September, he bought more steers and hung up all his
Ropes
But he often tells the stories about the rodeos he won and cowboy jokes
Well it's funny that the first big roping that he won some thirty years
Ago
Was the same day that I sang on the stage of the Grand Old Opry show

Toting hay
And branding the Y.O.
And his hired hand's there to help him

They built their ranch together
And listening to the kids sing through the years

I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation

We can ride it together, 
Making love with each other

That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever

Her dates heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag 
So she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note

Keep getting me in every confrontation

We keep getting twisted up in wicked games

It’ll bring me back when we were more alive

How am I ever gonna trust again?
Why do I stay on the roads that keep leading me right back through the hell I've been?
There’s a difference between giving up
And knowing when you've had enough
Maybe I'm addicted to you because the best kinds of drugs are other people like us

So confident in what you don't know
The only truth is that you're still unknown

If these walls could speak
Would they mention your name, the attention you seek?
So blind and alone you are

At least I'm breathing in something but smoke
From the burning debris of a faint memory
Watch the flames take the place of a home

Pallas,"Domes of crystal, spires of light reach out
Symbols of attainment once aspired
A quest for knowledge fuelled by love of peace
People never burned by fired of war
The people of the East
Grew tired of peace
Now mistrust and fear
Are new to us here
Storm clouds gather
Mistrust turns to hate
A confrontation none could forsee
Machines of peace melt down for tools of war
One thousand years of peace destroyed
The people of the West
Though war they detest
Had nowhere to run
So the killing began
Three score and four years
Battle raged on high
Once proud and mighty
Prepare now to die
Destroyed by corruption
Pretention and greed
Atlantean achievements
Dispersed as dry seeds
Blown by the winds of change
Long fell the shadows
Across their land now bare
In ruins lay the towers
That crowned an island fair
Laid low in death throes
A race once true and right
Their power now their ruin
Their downfall their might
Narrator:
Gathering together the treasures of
Their wisdom and culture
The guardians constructed a vast see
Omputer
Protected by an awesome and terrible device
Shrouded in a silicate crystalline dome.
The Sentinel
The ultimate keeper of the Peace
Too late to save their own
Put there to guide a future race
Survivor:
By my own hand, and the hands of others,
A nation on its knees
No brothers, sisters, friends, lovers,
No mountains, rivers, trees
Forgive us for we know not what we have done
Narrator:
And storms raged over the barren wastelands
Of the once fertile plains of Atlantis
And the sea cras
He'd upon the shores
And the land crumbled upon itself
The vast dome, the only remaining structure
On the dying continent, shuddered and sank
Slowly to the depths of the ocean...

Of life before the final war
Breaks the waves of sea and air
To save us from a deadly fall
Coming up from far below
Ocean floors unknown to man

Until the time was right again
Civilization's seeds
Sown so very long ago
Almost ripened to their peak
But how were they supposed to know
Nurtured very carefully
Guided on their preset path
The Sentinel waited silently
But his experiment went wrong
The eyes of the world looked in fright
To the seas ablaze with light
And it moved ever closer
Round the World
Machines they all stood still
Fingers reaching out as one
Poised in fear obliged to kill
Continents united
Against the common foe
The fist and last occasion
But the fools would never know
Alpha and omega
The first-born and the last
The vast dome of Atlantis
Cracked and shuddered beneath the blast
Sinking back to whence they came
The young could not realize
The original plan would now succeed
Due to their selfless sacrifice

As Atlantis descends to its place far below
Now the World has joined hands as one
All the World now
Join their hands as one

Hearing words that I have never heard

Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy lamb of god
On England's pleasant pastures seen?

And did the countenance divine,
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark satanic mills?

Bring me my bow of burning gold!
Bring me my arrows of desire!
Bring me my spear, oh clouds unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire!

Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand

Theater kings on silver wings
Fly beyond reason
From the flight of the seagull
Come the spread claws of the eagle
Only fear breaks the silence
As we all kneel pray for guidance

Tread the road cross the abyss
Take a look down at the madness
On the streets of the city
Only specters still have pity

Childhood themes of nights alone,
Wipe away endless years,
Childhood tears as dry as stone.

From seeds of confusion,
Illusions darks blossoms have grown.
Even now in furrows of sorrow
The dance still is sung.

My life's course is guided
Decided by limits drawn
On charts of my past days
And pathways since I was born.

I carry the dust of a journey
That cannot be shaken away
It lives deep within me
For I breathe it every day.

You and I are yesterday's answers,
The earth of the past came to flesh,
Eroded by Time's rivers
To the shapes we now possess.

Come share of my breath and my substance,
And mingle our stream and our times.
In bright, infinite moments,
Our reasons are lost in our rhymes.

Doubles faces dark defense
Talk too loud but talk no sense
Yeah I see those smiling eyes
Butter us up with smiling lies

Talk to creatures raise the dead
Fate you know sure got fed
Trained apart from houses of stone
Hour of horses pick the bone

Come forth, from love spire
Born in life's fire, 
Born in life's fire. 
Come forth, from love's spire

In the burning, all are yearning,
For life to be.
And the pain will (must) be gain,
New life!

Stirring in, salty streams
And dark hidden seams
Where the fossil sun gleams.

They were, sent from (to) the gates
Ride the tides of fate,
Ride the tides of fate.
They were, sent from (to) the gates

In the burning of our yearning,
For life to be.

The dimples in your cheeks
I forgot to thank you for things
Cos I hadn't seen you in weeks

And forced me to believe
Knocked down too soon

Paloma Faith,"30 minute love affair
All in the blink of an eye
There you were standing there
I heard an angel cry
Runaway lover
I soon discovered
It was best when we left it
I'll never forget it
Our 30 minute love affair

The city lead me out one night
Through lonely streets and neon light
Searching again
I met a stranger singing songs
Sat in that doorway I belonged
With him
Just talking.

He was so beautiful there in my dreams
I left my heart and my memories

30 minute love affair
All in the blink of an eye
There you were standing there
I heard an angel cry
Runaway lover
I soon discovered
It was best when we left it
I'll never forget it
Our 30 minute love affair

He told me he'd be there tomorrow
I knew where he led I would follow
I flew
And he knew
When I went back he had disappeared
My hopeful smile had turned to tears
Let down
No sight nor sound

Sometimes it's better just to let them go
Cause your illusion's more than what you could know

30 minute love affair
All in the blink of an eye
There you were standing there
I heard an angel cry
Runaway lover
I soon discovered
It was best when we left it
I'll never forget it
Our 30 minute love affair

Falling from the sky for him I'll never
Regret it
He took my breath away
And although it was the shortest time
I'll never forget it
He gave me such a beautiful lie
Oh my

30 minute love affair
All in the blink of an eye
There you were standing there
I heard an angel cry
Runaway lover
I soon discovered
It was best when we left it
Now I'll never forget it
It was best when we left it
Now I'll never forget it

Press your hands against my body
You'll be my sorrow

Push me

Shake this

This is agony
But it's still a thrill for me
This could end in tragedy

Lets fall from grace

Save me with your kisses

Paloma Faith,"I miss you in the mornings
Been up all night
Delicately whisper
I'll be alright
Maybe someone else'll bring a passion
Out of you that I never saw
I am torn and raw.

I miss you in the moments
When it all stops
Listen to the silence 
That hurts my heart
Maybe someday we will meet again
And not turn back
Now our love turns to black.

So I write this letter 
That I'll never send
Just so I remember
The beauty of the end
And I write this letter
To my long lost friend
So it stays with me forever,
The beauty of the end.
Falling never hurts but landing does.

I miss you when I'm laughing
You're very near
But then I open up my eyes
And you're not here.
Maybe one day you will understand
That I had to
I did it all for you.

So I write this letter 
That I'll never send
Just so I remember
The beauty of the end
And I write this letter
To my long lost friend
So it stays with me forever,
The beauty of the end.
Falling never hurts but landing does.

And I'm just as scarred as you about
This freedom
But I need to run with the wind
And I know right now you think there
Is no reason
But you'll see
Nothing in life is easy

So I write this letter 
That I'll never send

Paloma Faith,"I know a man who fills his emptiness
With strangers
I know a girl who drinks herself to
Sleep at night
You can't change her
I know people who use chat rooms as
Confessionals
I know down and outs who once were,
Once they were professionals
Wipe it off your sleeve
Your superiority
Don't roll your eyes my sweet

I know a single mother who loses
Her mind
On weekends
She pleads with lady luck on scratch
Cards with money lent to her
By old friends
I know people who take midnight
Drives for head space
I know they'd give for just one
Loving embraces
Wipe it off your sleeve
Your superiority
Don't roll your eyes my sweet

We all get desperate sometimes
Feeling black and blue
I know you'll find it hard
To accept it sometimes
We all feel black and we feel blue

Don't roll your eyes my sweet

I know a rich man who has everything
You could wish for
But children
I know an old lady who talks a lot but
Could teach you
If you listen
I know people who believe in gods and demons
I know ones who think there's nothing
There at all

Paloma Faith,"Oh, it's okay to be
A little broken and beat
But I'm alright with that
You're with me, relax
And you call it weak
Baby, you're just unique
Come out of the black
Never hold it back

You got such sad eyes, turn blue to grey
And it hurts me to see you hurt this way

Oh, go on and cry, baby, crybaby
'Cause you don't have to keep it inside (just cry, just cry)
Go on and cry, baby, crybaby
And there's no reason you got to hide (just cry, just cry)
A real man shows his feelings
Tears they can be healing
And I can be your savior tonight
So go on and cry, baby, crybaby
Just cry

You keep coming home drunk
And I don't know what's up
You can talk to me
Spare those whiskey dreams
Don't have to man up
That phrase kinda sucks
Let yourself be free
And open up to me

You got such sad eyes, turn blue to grey
And it hurts me to see you hurt this way

Oh, go on and cry, baby, crybaby
'Cause you don't have to keep it inside (just cry, just cry)
Go on and cry, baby, crybaby
And there's no reason you got to hide (just cry, just cry)
A real man shows his feelings
Tears they can be healing
And I can be your savior tonight
So go on and cry, baby, crybaby
Just cry, oh

Nothing's the end of the world
Feeling this pain and it's gonna be alright
One day you'll look back and know
It wasn't worth all the heartache
This could be the making of you
So let it all out, let it fall down, yeah

Oh, go on and cry, baby, crybaby (let me see you cry)
'Cause you don't have to keep it inside (just cry, just cry)
Go on and cry, baby, crybaby (let me see you cry)
And there's no reason you got to hide (just cry, just cry)
A real man shows his feelings
Tears they can be healing
And I can be your savior tonight

Just cry, oh

Paloma Faith,"There is a beauty in the distant sound of a weeping man
There's wonder in your child's eyes, or maybe your future child's eyes
And many things you may remember that you had
That you lost, that you let slip through your fingers
So cherish them all

You are the poor, the refugee, the bloody victim
You are the power, the winner and the fighter
Breathe in, you're lucky to

Be the beauty, the memory, the past, the past, the present and the future, be infinite
Do something, say something, believe in something
But most of all, know you can change things
Yes, you
What are you waiting for? 
Do not be fearful of evolution
The time is now",Evolution,2017
Paloma Faith,"I've been a criminal, I made a mistake
Believed in the fictional
Then let everything slip away
I can't accept my faith
Thought the alternative looks so crystal clear
Drowned in the muddy waters
And I'm living in my worst fears
Begging you back through tears

You had this picture of me
And now I have shattered your dreams
I know the drill and I know the truth
And it kills me

Yeah, I'm guilty
Don't come near me
The one thing I'm good at is messing up somebody else
Baby, I'm guilty
I'm turning sweet love into poison
And I got the scars, if you're talking 'bout hurt in this love
Baby, I'm guilty as hell

I sit here all alone, my defence is down
Wishing I could be home
But I'm locked out and it's my fault
Grazes with added salt
Thought I would be okay without you and I
Now that I realize it was all just an awful lie
Take me back, I might die

Yeah, yeah

Puttin' on a brave face, I wipe the tears away with no trace

Paloma Faith,"I remember in the day, I was just a girl
Thinking how cool this is
My man is calling from jail
I know I was naïve, a fool in love
And looking back it was doomed to fail, life was too tough

Feels like a million years ago
But I don't look back, 'cause I wanna go forward
Crazies and stolen out of home
We were so young

We could have been kings and queens
We could have been anything
We could have hung from the world, when I was your girl
Two diamonds from the gutter
We could have been kings and queens
We could have lived all our dreams
If I could have set you free, I would, believe me
But we didn't get it right this time

Maybe in another life
Maybe in another life
Maybe in another life
Maybe in another life

Come to your mama's house, I'd stay too late
I get in trouble and they're sending out the search party
I think you ended it, 'bout fourteen times
Just for the thrill of gettin' back together after the fight

Feels like a million years ago
But I don't look back, 'cause I wanna go forward
Crazies and stolen out of home
We were so young

We could have been kings and queens

And I don't look back, 'cause I wanna go forward
But I hope you're well, got what you wanted
You still cross my mind, are you OK?
I pray you'll get it right next time

Maybe we'll be better next time

Reaching out

Been talking to myself for several hours
And I keep on calling for a higher power
I put another song on this record player
Dance 'til I'm drunk on a midnight prayer
Reaching out, but nobody comes

The girl who everyone knew
Is now the one they look through
And oh oh oh oh oh

Say another prayer for the lost and lonely
Reaching out
Don't look away, stay and watch me slowly
Give it up
I feel myself falling away in silence
Freaking out
I know I can't do this alone anymore
Won't you take my hand, 'cause we could be amazing

amazing

What good are my memories, if I'm by myself?
Jumping in the hallway, think I'm needing help
I had dreams, yeah I watched somebody

You know me better than no one who read all my scars

Was a blessing in disguise

And I learnt 
When everything has been said and done
And I know that you're the only one, it was worth it 
Yeah so worth it

I realize that I get out of the hand
I don't even ask for you to understand

I'm over-compromising
