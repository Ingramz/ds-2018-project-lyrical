Warren Vaché,"It was written in the stars
What was written in the stars shall be
It was written in the skies
That the heart and not the eyes shall see
 
And so whether it bring joy
Whether it bring woe
It shall be done
Now suddenly I know
You are the one
 
Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows
In your hands
 
It was written high above
That I have to have your love
Or I'll never be free
And cloudy though the day be
Crazy though I may be
What the stars foretold shall be
 
Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows
In your hands
 
It was written high above
That I have to have your love
Or I'll never be free
And cloudy though the day be
Crazy though I may be
What the stars foretold shall be
 
And so shall it be",It Was Written in the Stars,2006
Warren Vache & Bill Charlap,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude To A Kiss,2001
Warren Vache & Bill Charlap,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2001
Warren Vaché Quartet,"Love makes me treat you

The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you

There's nothing in this whole world too good
For a boy so sweet and true
Gee, baby ain't I good to you

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas
Diamond ring
Big Cadillac car and everything
What makes me treat you
The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you","Gee Baby, Ain't I Good to You",
Warren Vaché Quartet,"Sky, so vast is the sky, with far away clouds just wandering by
Where do they go? Oh I don't know, don't know
Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes
Stories of love belong to you and to me

Oh, Dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see when you're with me, oh my Dindi
Oh Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is
Singing Dindi, happy Dindi, when you're with me

I love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do
I'd let you go away, if you take me with you

Don't you know, Dindi, I'd be running and searching for you like a river that
Can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my Dindi
Can't find the sea that would be me without you Dindi

Like a river that can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my Dindi",Dindi,2008
Warren Vaché Quintet,"Our love affair is a wondrous thing
That we'll rejoice in remembering
Our love was born with our first embrace
And a page was torn out of time and space
Our love affair, may it always be
A flame to burn through eternity
So, take my hand with a fervent prayer
That we may live and we may share
A love affair to remember
 
Our love affair is a wondrous thing
That we'll rejoice in remembering
Our love was born with our first embrace

That we may live and we may share",An Affair to Remember,1997
Warren Vaché Quintet,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,1997
Warren Vaché Quintet,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,1997
Warren Vaché Quintet,"I don't care what the weatherman says
When the weatherman says it's raining
You'll never hear me complaining
I'm certain the sun will shine

I don't care how the weather vane points
When the weather vane points to gloomy
It's gotta be sunny to me
When your eyes look into mine

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those eyes?
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get so lit up?
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get that size?

Golly gee, when you turn those heaters on
Woe is me, got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize!
Where'd ya get those eyes?",Jeepers Creepers,1997
Warren Vaché Sextette,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,1986
Warren Wiebe,"Hey, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Well, the first time I saw you
Was the first time I lost you
And the first time I kissed you
Was the first time I missed you

There were times when we tried to
Get by with some love too
But the things that we went through
Were so cold, don't let me remind you

It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you'll take my love
And just walk away

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Are the games that we're playing
Simply our way of entertaining

Since the start you don't seem to
Realize what I've been through
Since the start I have tried to
Make you see that I need you

It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you'll take my love
And just walk away

And at times when we drift to
Our knees but forgot to
Leave behind all the past fun
Sometimes I find it hard to comfort
Wonder why we're not one

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Is it love that we're missing

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Tell me is it love that we're missing

I tried so hard to make it work
But it seems to me, only got hurt

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Is it love that we're missing

Leave behind all the past fun
[Incomprehensible]

Is it love that we're missing

Warren Zanes,"The tubes that get turned on for the red guitar that you
Learned on the records you left me the

Cookbooks the ten-inch TV that radio you found the thing couldn't reach
Downtown I think I've had my fill so if you want the stuff still you're
Gonna see it in a sidewalk sale old

Boxes and broken chairs strangers can take this stuff away you're gonna
See it in a sidewalk sale on the lawn, a sunny day you're gonna see it
In a sidewalk sale someday

Your face when you'd wake up schemes that you'd always take up the way
That you stood on the pedestal you were put on the moons you brought
Around the stars that you

Pulled down the spaces that you fill and though I want the stuff still
You're gonna see it in a sidewalk sale if every room that I walk through
In this place could be packed up

Box by box I'd have a pile that reaches into space you're gonna see it
In a sidewalk sale and I'll be taking the money there strangers can take
This stuff away",Sidewalk Sale,2002
Warren Zanes,"There's times you holler and I get scared that there's a hundred watt
Amp in you somewhere you wear a gold dog collar and sometimes speak of love

There's times you're talking and no one's there and folks start looking
But you don't care and when you're asked to leave it seems you sometimes
Stay but hey, everybody

Loves you that way everybody loves you you walk through rooms like a
Movie star but with a ten-foot cape and a tin foil bra and say that
You're amazed at all the world but

When you stop and hold a frame of gold around your saddest face you're
Like a sixteenth century saint that hangs in France but hey, everybody
Loves you that way everybody

Loves you oh, when she's around there's such a light, it'd make you drop
Drop down to your knees hold the phone let her speak I got a hellhound
Following me and she's the

One who could come, and finally set me free I think the same thing
Everyday everybody loves you that way everybody loves you there's nine
Hundred numbers and cheap

Massage celebrities drop down from the stars but when I'm lonely you're
The only way I've been to ten years of college and big state fairs seen
The world's shortest woman

And three wise men but nothing as profound as all you say but hey,
Everybody loves you that way everybody loves you you've got the
Strangest pets I've ever seen a

Rhinestone cat with rabbit ears the kind of beasts that come when they
Are called last night when you pulled away I kinda wished you'd come and
Stayed sometimes I feel

Quite sure I'm meant for you but hey everybody loves you that way",Everybody Loves You,2002
Warren Zanes,"In our apartment house we're as quiet as we've ever
Been down the

Hallway a girl with honey eyes has moved in when we walked by she just
Smiled but there and then I realized I could drift so far from you and
When you're standing by my

Side just like you said don't want to lose before I've tried maybe we
Can remember all the things we planned where we began and when the words
Come let's clear the

Strip and let 'em land while we still can my old man has brought half a
Dozen wives into the world I met him last year after twenty years or so
With no words what a strange

Look in his eye-I thought he knew just what it's like to walk out out
Out of the blue leave behind him every trace of those he knew he made me
See all I could lose with you

Maybe we can remember all the things we planned but I wandered through
The weeds slept in the satin sheets got wasted in the heat but I
Can't dream of how I'd feel if

You'd forgotten me lost me in the leaves maybe we can remember all the
Things we planned where we began and when the words come let's clear the
Strip and let 'em land

While we still can a girl with honey eyes has moved in I remember I was
Walking with you",Where We Began,2003
Warren Zevon,"So much to do, there's plenty on the farm
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Saturday night I like to raise a little harm
I'll sleep when I'm dead

I'll sleep when I'm dead
Straight from the bottle, twisted again
I'll sleep when I'm dead

Well, I take this medicine as prescribed
I'll sleep when I'm dead

I'll sleep when I'm dead

You, who always sang and played while the green vespers rang
In the heart of the hillside

You and me, sweet and slightly out of key
Like the sound of a running down calliope

With the sun behind my hair
My music filled the air with symbols and lightning

Oh Tule, now can't you see I'm changing like the seasons?
My hair is growing dark
And there's no room left in the ark for a lark with a broken wing

It's a sad song we always seem to be singing to each other

To meet that very evening, and get away somehow

It's never too late for love

How I hate to hear you use that word
Every time it hurts
You say you're tired
How I hate to hear you use that word
Everybody hurts

Things go wrong
The days are long
You think you've had enough
You feel discouraged
Rest assured
It's never too late for love

You say you're tired
How I hate to hear you use that word
Every time it hurts
You say you're tired
How I hate to hear you use that word
Everybody hurts

Who am I to say
I know the way you feel
I've felt your pain
And I know your sorrow
You could try to let the past slip away
Live for today
Don't stop believing in tomorrow

You've come so far
The way is dark

Warren Zevon,"I had a little girl, now
We crossed the state line 
It was more than just an overdraft
We were looking at time
If I do say so I can't let go 
And I don't take no for an answer
If I do say so I can't let go 
And I don't take no for an answer
We had to leave in a hurry, now
No time to hesitate 
It was worse than misunderstanding 
I had to ask her not to call it fate
If I do say so I can't let go

She's the Queen of Downtown
She gets around town

You're getting tired of me
And it's the final act
Of our little tragedy
So don't feign indignation
It's a fait accompli
You can screw everybody I've ever known
But I still won't talk to you on the phone
It's a hopeless cause--there's no use crying
And I can die, you can die
We can die trying
Thanks anyway, no use hangin' around
You try to put the finishing touches on me

You say it's all my fault
Who's keeping score?
Some people like to be punished
They keep coming back for more
But I'm sick & tired
And my cock is sore
You can screw everybody
I've ever known
But I still won't talk to you on the phone

Learning all my holy moves doing some research
Which led me to a cash box labelled ""Children's Fund""
I'd leave the change and tuck the bills inside my cummerbund
I got a part-time job at my father's carpet store
Laying tactless stripping and housewives by the score
I loaded up their furniture and took it to Spokane
Auctioned off every last Naugahyde divan
I'm very well acquainted with the seven deadly sins
I keep a busy schedule trying to fit them in
I'm proud to be a glutton and I don't have time for sloth
I'm greedy and I'm angry and I don't care who I cross

I like to have a good time and I don't care who gets hurt
I'm, take a look at me

And counseled all my clients to plead insanity
Then worked in hair replacement swindling the bald
Where very few are chosen, fewer still are called
Then on to Monte Carlo play chemin de fer
I threw away the fortune I made transplanting hair
I put my last few francs down on a prostitute
Who took me up to her room to perform the flag salute
Whereupon I stole her passport and her wig
And headed for the airport and the midnight flight, you dig?
Fourteen hours later I was down in Adelaide
Looking through the want ads sipping Foster's in the shade
I opened up an agency somewhere down the line
To hire aboriginals to work the opal mines
But I attached their wages and took a whopping cut
And whisked away their workman's comp and pauperized the lot

Landed in Sri Lanka none the worse for wear

Don't it look kinda chewed-on like

Don't you feel like running from the dawn's early light

Quite ugly one morning
We all said goodnight
It came without a warning
Just a flash of light

Don't you feel kind of funny
Don't you feel kind of funny inside
When you feel like laughing
And everybody tells you you ought to be crying

It came without a warning
But it was quite all right
Quite ugly one morning

But it was quite all right

It's a long, long way
And it's a hollow triumph
When you make it to the bottom of another day
There's a fever rising
When the evening comes
And when the battle's over
There'll be nothing left but the sound of drums

Time marches on
Time stands still
Time on my hands
Time to kill
Blood on my hands
And my hands in the till
Down at the 7-11
Gentle rain
Falls on me
All life folds back
Into the sea
We contemplate eternity
Beneath the vast indifference of heaven

The past seems realer than the present to me now
I've got memories to last me
When the sky is gray
The way it is today
I remember the times when I was happy

Same old sun
Same old moon
It's the same old story
Same old tune
They all say
Someday soon
My sins will all be forgiven
Gentle rain
Falls on me
All life folds back
Into the sea
We contemplate eternity
Beneath the vast indifference of heaven

They say ""Everything's all right""
They say ""Better days are near""
They tell us ""These are the good times""
But they don't live around here
Billy and Christie don't--
Bruce and Patti don't--
They don't live around here

I had a girl
Now she's gone
She left town
Town burned down
Nothing left
But the sound
Of the front door closing forever

Softly falls the morning rain
Loneliness comes around again
And I sit and sing my song
'Though it never seems to matter
And it never fills the emptiness inside

Frozen notes hang suspended in the autumn air
While someone waits for someone to come somewhere
No one waits for me
'Cause I thought I wanted to be free
Now I'm wondering why I said goodbye
Looking through my window
At the dark and troubled sky
I think I see the ship of the brokenhearted passing by
And I turn away
From today
To where we used to lie
And I cry
Yes, I cry
And I cry
While softly falls the morning rain
Loneliness comes around again

Here behind my hand

You, who always sang and played while the green vespers rang
In the heart of the hillside

Like the sound of a running down calliope

With the sun behind my hair
My music filled the air with symbols and lightning

My hair is growing dark
And there's no room left in the ark for a lark with a broken wing

Don't let us get sick
Don't let us get old
Don't let us get stupid, all right?
Just make us be brave
And make us play nice
And let us be together tonight

The sky was on fire
When I walked to the mill
To take up the slack in the line
I thought of my friends
And the troubles they've had
To keep me from thinking of mine

Don't let us get sick
Don't let us get old
Don't let us get stupid, all right?
Just make us be brave
And make us play nice
And let us be together tonight

The moon has a face
And it smiles on the lake
And causes the ripples in Time
I'm lucky to be here
With someone I like
Who maketh my spirit to shine

You can dream the American Dream
But you sleep with the lights on
And wake up with a scream
You can hope against hope
That nothing will change
Grab a hold of that fistful of rain

Grab a hold, grab a hold, grab a hold
Grab a hold, grab a hold, grab a hold of that

When your grasp has exceeded your reach
And you put all your faith
In a figure of speech
You've heard all the answers
But the questions remain
Grab a hold of that fistful of rain

Grab a hold, grab a hold, grab a hold
Grab a hold, grab a hold, grab a hold of that

And when diamonds turn back into coal
Grab a hold, children, grab a hold
When the mountains crumble
And you're ready to rumble
And roll like a runaway train...

Why don't you go pick on someone your own size instead?
Go on without me, I'll just slow you down

He started playing hockey by the time he was nine
His dad took the hose and froze the back yard
And Little Buddy dreamed he was Rocket Richard
He grew up big and he grew up tough
He saw himself scoring for the Wings or Canucks
But he wasn't that good with a puck

Buddy's real talent was beating people up
His heart wasn't in it but the crowd ate it up
Through pee-wee's and juniors, midgets and mites
He must have racked up more than six hundred fights

Said, ""There's always room on our team for a goon
Son, we've always got room for a goon""

When Buddy the goon came over the boards
""Coach,"" he'd say, ""I wanna score goals""

Protect them, Buddy, that's what you're here for

Protection is what you're here for
Protection-it's the stars that score
Protection-kick somebody's ass
Protection-don't put the biscuit in the basket just

Blood on the ice ran down through the years
The king of the goons with a box for a throne
A thousand stitches and broken bones
He never lost a fight on his icy patrol
But deep inside, Buddy only dreamed of a goal
He just wanted one damn goal

Finns at the red

In his final season, on his final night
Buddy and a Finn goon were pegged for a fight
Thirty seconds left, the puck took a roll
And suddenly Buddy had a shot on goal

The goalie committed, Buddy picked his spot
Twenty years of waiting went into that shot
The fans jumped up, the Finn jumped too
And coldcocked Buddy on his follow through
The big man crumbled but he felt all right
'Cause the last thing he saw
was the flashing red light
He saw that heavenly light

She's essential to his purpoe and his mission
A good woman is a glory to her man
She never take the power, she'll just make him a better man
Every great man has a virtuous woman.

Woman you say you love me and never leave me lonely
You'll always be there for me, so need not worry
Woman to keep I strong, it is part of Jah plan
I'll leave my mom and dad, find a woman and be one

With a woman I make my bond, perfect combination
I am a black man so I love my black woman
Woman give me the sweet sweet love to hold anytime of day
Lots of hugs and kisses, I & I ah burn out the gay

[Chorus]

Woman I love and honor, the [unknown] of the light carrier
The empress omega, the mother of Rastafari's culture
Revises to the King and his empress Menin(?)
Who showed us the right and the true way of living

Woman could never cause sin, so listen as I sing
Mother woman of the earth, them ah joy bell ring ring ring
Equality in a Zion, by nature's law that's where he should go
For every man I know there is a woman, you meet the (?) that is all I know.

A wire fence where children play saw the bed where the body lay

Turned on to a knife edge view find some place where my friends don't go
And I was looking for a friend of mine

I walked round and round, no stomach, torn apart nail me to a train, had to think again
Trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get out trying to move away, had to move away and keep out
Four, twelve windows, ten in a row behind a wall I looked down low
The lights shine like a neon show inserted deep felt a warmer glow

Baby we're fallin' hard down
Out in the streets
Throw the books on the fire
Let them eat debt
While they starve on desire
Who's really runnin'
The place we call home
It's your religion
Believe in the gilded throne
From the top of the mountain
All doomed liars fall
From the top of the mountain
To where the people crawl
From the top of the mountain
To the hard ground below
To the ones you`ve forgotten
We'll dance on your tombs
Walk with me
To the heart of the city
To the purple mountains
Through the nation of death
That steals our future
Programs the child
Makes change through violence
While cries for freedom
It worships control
And speaks of hollow victories
Of the land it stole
From the top of the mountain
Baby were fallin' hard down

To the hard ground below

Gonna lock you up in the hole
'Cause the dea made a power play
And you're lookin' at 2 to 4

Got your stash up in the wall but there's a gun to your head
And you're gonna be dead
Unless ya cut a deal with the law

All ya want is what the rich people got
'Cause the people need power too
There's only lousy jobs run by slobs
And ya get paid crap for what ya do

Sellin' drugs, run with the thugs
And you're makin' it on the deal
But your regular man got hit with a gram
And the son of a bitch started to squeal

Salutations from the ghetto nation

Out on the lawn, ya strip the car down
And you're sippin' corn on the porch
If the neighbors complain, open up the 12-gauge
Shut your mouth or you're gonna get torched

Party tonight 'til the sun gets bright
Load the house up with sime whores
'Cause you're goin' away 700 days
Out on the killin' floor

Salutations from the ghetto nation

They never found the bank account and you're sittin' on 30 grand
But you don't mind doin' the time as long as your freedom day is at hand
Out on parole, ya take a stroll, ya kick another habit everyday
Ya got a new plan, super scam, livin' the American way

A wire fence where the children played
Saw the bed where the body lay,

And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.

Heard a noise just a car outside,
Metallic blue turned red with rust,
Pulled in close by the building's side,

Had to think, collect my senses now,
Are turned on to a knife edged view
Find some places where my friends don't know,
And I was looking for a friend of mine,
And had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.

Getting darker now, faces look the same,

To force a final ultimatum.
Thousand words are spoken loud,
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd.

Don't want to live dead and lose the fight

Free at last- from
Alcohol's daze
Free at last- from that P.C.P.
Free at last- from insanity
Free at last- From my fear
Free at last- from all the tears
Free at last- from the grave
Free at last- now I'm saved
So if I fall what will
You do?
Cause what I need's a friend in you
I wonder if you'll laugh at me
Or help me to stay drug-free
But if you coose to walk away
And come back another day
I'll be gone to a better place
On my own I'll win
The race
There are other friends who'll stick
By me
Side by side for
Eternity
But if I must be alone and do it all on my own
I'll win the fight and that's for sure
In my heart I'll stay pure

Fire burning in my soul

That day I'll always remember, yes I will
Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never had a chance to see him
Never heard nothing but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said: Son

Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Yeah, Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone, yeah

Where the hell are ya, daddy, that's what I'm sayin'

So I could feel like the other kids do
A young child but not complete as a whole
Before I was born you up and strolled
Mama was there but you was up in the wind
You never even knew my name, you didn't
You never wrote, called, let alone came by
As a youth it was hard to wonder why
But now I'm older and I don't dwell on self-pity
Thinkin' about the life you didn't give me
I remember when I used to tell lies
When people would ask I'd just fantasize
Makin' up stories to make you look good
But the real truth was you was never no good
People used to say I look just like you
But rest assured I don't act like you
I'm more than that, my mama raised me better
And you can best believe I'm much more together
So believe that

Hey mama, is it true what they say
That Papa never worked a day in his life
And mama, bad talk goin' 'round town said
Papa had three outside children and another wife

But that's not always true and it's sad
To find myself missing you when I did
Well, who knows the reasons you did what you did
I can't help but to wonder why
You lived your life as a big fat lie
You act like you had no responsibilities
Cause if you did it's a bet that you wouldn't be
Stealin', beggin', hustlin' and schemin'
You coulda got a job but did you know the meaning of work
I'm talkin' 'bout an honest day's pay
But you was too lazy to be that way

And make sure that I never sink so low
Cause I want my kids to grow up and know
That I was always there because I loved them so
And that's the least thing that I could do
But that's a lot more than I got from you

Don't want no revenge 
Ain't no pay back time 
It ain't called getting even 
Here comes the Reckoning Day 
I like the things that you try to fake 
And your face when I see you break 
And that you say you will pray for me 
You realize you are prey for me 
I like the way you stay on attack 
No matter what, I keep coming back 
And how you try to hold me down 
But you end up driven to the ground

Wildin' these streets, I'm playin' for keeps, avoidin the beast
To keep play the cemetery body, capisce

But quote for quote, more dough choke throats like inhale smoke
Forever ready like nine volt, batteries
Lost casualties, ricochet through ya anatomy

Watain,"Beyond gods pestilent grace
Obscured by light his spawner dwells
Hidden but soon to be found
Beyond shrouds of fading life
All fires leave reeking ashes
Not only glow that shines
And the dawns you've blessed shall be cursed
A thousand times

Clean the mirrors from the dust of God
And nothing shall be there
For you are to weak to turn the key
Chained to life by fear

Oh, as solitude awakes
Razorsharp it shines
Reflections in your gazing eyes
For the first time burnt by sun
Each dawn rising in plaugeous glory
And touches the withering ground
Shall feed your agony fires
For your truth has now been found

(Feel the power
Bow down like the servant you are
For great evil flows through your shells)

A fall from grace
Yet a rising in glorious ashes
The gate lies chrushed
And the key to life has melted
(A path will open
And wrath will enter
I rejoice in silence
Suffering is the key to the world of the beast)

Each dawn rising in plaugeous glory
And touches the withering ground
Shall feed your agony fires
For your truth has now been found





",Agony Fires,2000
Watain,"Feel the coming of a storm
Of wrath burning red as blood
Thundering forth
With poison in veins and death in the eyes
Under banners as mirrors reflecting
The darkness above and below
And the eye...
The eye that is him

Bonecrush, bloodlust
Behold the remains of jehova in the dust
Suffocate, Desecrate
For Satan's return - Angelrape

Warlust fill my veins
As bullets in the heart of humanity
Darkness drown me
As carnal shreds of light soaked in blood
Cursed to wander
And to eternally despise
Forever to stride
For evil never dies...

The passion of death
Immortalized
In your ashes

Behold the remains of jehova in the dust
Suffocate, Desecrate

",Angelrape,2000
Watain,"A pallid shape is floating
A lurid shroud of fading life
What ones was a place so glimmering and bright
Has ignited itself and burnt out of light
I canonize thee, lord of the odius
For enlightening the path to perpetual might
For guiding me on this voyage
With nothing but scornful mirages in sight

Devour me, oh immense shadow
This locus is cursed, shroud me forever
Damnation be my lodestar
For humanity carves my veins
I've been nailed to a cross of anguish
Crucified above to behold
The blind, the loathsome's strife in vain
The holyness of those who should suffer my pain

Lunar strains of morbid grace
Reflections of nocturnal mysteries
Eternally hidden for their eyes
As what awaits behind...

Branded by the unpure light
But still, You like I
Reaches for the dark
And even further...
As symbols of life we are fading
To were this twilight reaches night
A pallid shape is strangled
As my soul and his darkness unite

It won't shine through
Believe it, you're never to see
That my flesh is carved with spells
Of mankinds destiny
Blessed with contempt
For what has edged my strife
And through sacrilegous veils
I dethrone life





",Life Dethroned,2000
Watain,"Created by them
Yet reborn through Him
Blessed from life and lie
For the cunts that are licked
By your gentle tounges
Are raped and cursed to die
So far beyond
Your rottening grace
Yet trapped in smelling chains
For the bodies you caress
I have cursed
And put cancer in their veins

The blazes in the night called stars
Are reflections of your kind
Pallid and fading lifes
Spawned and guarded by darkness behind

For what dwells behind those flames
Is hidden for your eyes
And just one single glance
Would transform your smiles into cries

There is a war in my heart
While yours is thorned by my nails
For you are nothing but dead
Beneath those carnal veils

Rejoice as emptyness grow thicker
Feel it's grasp around your neck
The hour has come to release
And to welcome the razorsharp fate

Feel the jaws of the snake
Slaves under cosmic contempt
Mortem sibi consciscere
Your key to achievement





",Mortem Sibi Consciscere,2000

I demand you in the name of the horns
For I am the one
To bring the demise of the bearer of thorns
You who's father
So pityful upon the cross died
Behold it inverted
And burning under the nightsky

Inferior lord of heaven
Your might shall fade
Jesus has wept
On goathorns impaled

Unclean vermins, scum of the earth
Blow your heads for the dark ages birth

Black fire cast your flames high
Above the realms of light
Behorned father Satan
Show them all your might
Taste the blood
And the decayed flesh of his sons
Behold the desecration
Of the weaker and feeble ones

A cross burned black
Soaked in sacred blood
From all of us to all of you:
Go fuck your jewish god

A creation of the holy womb
Step aside for lord Sathanas
His fist so deep within
A servant am I and in flesh am I captured
Holy flesh and holy sin
Oh, the strength it does not take
To deny life's lying pleasure

Their wars stills my hunger
The tears in their eyes still my thirst
Yet their life's feeds my despite
...eternally to be cursed

As it opens for me
In darkest desolation I behold
My blood runs cold through my veins
Running in vain

Lands fall behind my eyes
And humanity is bleeding
And in my hand I hold the key
To all living holy glory
...and all that is evil

The womb of life is rotten black
The seed of light dried dead
The fist of Satan deep within
Behold the cunt of life in sin

Behold the purest evil
The creation of a higher force
Lurking within all of man
Stronger than every life and lie

Poison ? a nigga use to play and trade toys with a nigga
Now you gotta go to war with a nigga
Just because you got more than a nigga
Motherfucker Kamikaze you, they rather die then see you live fly
Crabs in a barrel, in ghetto America
Man, we just lucky that we make it out
See so much potential, lost some reputation, you would think eventually we will get it
They say you got it, they don't even want it
It just hurt so much for them to see you with it
What I know 'bout Satan, he patiently wait
To rob and steal and kill off greatness in the making
What we put together never let ‘em take it

You know when I met you, sitting in the car
Buck head in the mall, you was something special
He was just a young nigga,
Still he never got excited,
It was hard to overwhelm a fat nigga with a eye patch, swingin' hard
Reppin' role tide Alabama
You can tell he was kickin' too much flavour on a country nigga made 'em wanna kill him
Still to see him smiling shawty, he be chillin'
Nigga wish him dead, he ain't even feel it
At your video, I could feel the ?
We was at the club, nigga couldn't get it in, they was stuck outside
Start to look at you, and as you should you looked like ""fuck I 'posed to do?""
Asked you 'bout it then, said ""ay brah you cool?""
You said ""I ain't worry 'bout the lil dude""
Get they feelings hurt, got a attitude,
They'll come around in a year or two
Made you Hustle Gang, let you in the family
Said ""I get you rich"" you said ""you want a Grammy""
Showed you how to mix the Actavis
Candy, doin' 160 with me, he ain't panic
Called me yesterday, I say ""lil bro what's happening?
Working with Pharell, chillin' in Miami""
All you said was ""run it, book the flight I'm coming
'Fore I leave though, I gotta handle something""
I just said ""ok"" I hung up the phone
Couple hours later, damn my nigga gone

You was suppose to make it
You was suppose to make it
You was suppose to make it
You was suppose to make it

Devil's business, my brother gone
Supposed to be a living legend
Hating nigga sent you home
But when we see that guy, we gon' treat him like the sky
On the 4th of July
And light him up

So I faked fatherhood and drew her in

And it never has been mended 
But one night on my bed 
She told me something that she never told nobody 
And I just laid there cold as a stone and stared 
These are the confessions of a broken down man

She was wanting one and I gave in 
I swear I loved her and our home 
But a man has got to work to live 
And sometimes he can find himself out on the road alone 
And when I came back home

Thick yellow pencils with soft lead that smeared real easy

And she was beautiful
Everyone's beautiful
I smeared the picture and left it with her to appraise

I remember in junior high, half sick from fear on the hillside
Eddie wore braces and talked like he couldn't be beaten
Shawn had said Friday out back after school 
And Eddie was stumbling, blood mixed with drool
But a fight, is a fight, is a fight

Still they were beautiful
Everyone's beautiful
All of us crawling on hands and knees in need of you

I want to lift
My memory
Of them in the desert and set it on fire
And watch it burn
Watch it burn
Oh, how it changes
And hope that the smoke of the sins of my youth
Will sail to the base of the throne of a King

Crying cause his hands hurt

Go tell him 
I told him 
Go tell him 
He's welcome to come home 
Go tell him

That she really isn't silly but she's beautiful instead

He will come. He will come
He will comfort all that's hardened
change the deserts into gardens
and we all will see His face.
He will come. He will come.
He will soften all the starkness
Break the chambers of our darkness
and we'll all be overwhelmed

She spilled her coffee in her Chevy on the way to work at 8:05
She always thought that she was clumsy and she hated it andw ondered why

She can handle any tragedy that happens but not little things like this
So she keeps hoping that someday soon

Within the world of a girl, the words she hears they mean anawful lot
And the music in her mind when she gets older has the lyrics shewas taught

And He will look on her with favor

When you thought you could rest, but you found out you were wrong 
And there's another need another battle 
Another one more thing that comes along 

And on the inside 
You hear the fall but you hate the falling sound 
And on the inside 
You can't pick another broken piece up off the ground 
Well I know 

[Chorus]
Hush little baby don't say a word 
Daddy's gone and bought you a great big heaven to rest in 
He's bought it with blood and put the seal in your heart 
It'll give you the hope you need to get up and start again 

When all the things you thought you left behind are still hanging on 
And everything you try to do right ends up all wrong 

And on the inside everyone else seems basically fine 
But on the inside even they won't let go of the dead and cling to what's alive 
Well I AM",Hush,1999

But I'm still here 

Tell me a story that'll make me feel 
Something far flung but something real 
Something that's human but not depraved 
Somebody endangered, but somebody still saved

Waterdeep,"I spent too much time today
on things that don't mean much
The world around me groans under it's tyranny of touch
Every wasted thought
and every battle left unfought
All are testimony to my need of you

I'm a stranger in this land
Won't you take me by the hand
I can hear that distant band
But I'm still a stranger in this land

Some day's at the strangest times
I feel a sense of loss
A bite or two of stolen fruit
and we all suffer from the cost
But every longing for my home
Even when I'm not alone
Stands as testimony of the coming day

All I've got to do
is to believe on You
Then every struggle seems worthwhile
I can see the promise of Your smile",Stranger in This Land,1999

And our faith is in decline
We need a cause to stand behind,  love
We all want the way it feels
Time it comes and time it steals
What remains, what is real, love

There is love
There is forgiveness
There is love in times of need
When life is cold there is a promise
You will never go without
There is love

It heals the sick
Comforts the weak
Breaks the proud
Raises the meek
In this life no guarantees

Love will find a way
When we love one another

One reason to roam
One place I call home (all I need is one)
One tick on the clock
One trick up my sleeve
One thing to believe (all I need is one)
One person to love
One verse and one prayer
For one person who cares (all I need is one)
So put one hand in the air

It used to be I’d get afraid and I’d drive
Going forward’s always been the only place I can hide
With no direction I would speed a hundred miles down the coast
Until I lose the ghost that’s chasing me but never arrive
I know the night’s scary, but we’re alive and the pipe’s cherry
And I’ve got a stack of papers like a library
I’m driving seeking a beacon of light freakishly
All I needed was a speaker that might speak to me
But my CD system is so janky a cone dangles
And it dances on its chord like it’s Bo Jangles

But when the bass hits it grows tangled
Come on right speaker! I’ll take everything you give me

Sitting pretty I know
That I’m ready to go

You got a bad hip or even a bad temper

Put on that glass slipper, you ain’t no half stepper
This ain’t no last breath, it’s only one collapsed lung
We’re holding up the bank with nothing but a cap gun
Down to your last blank
Down to my last drop
Up in the gas tank

Time isn’t a sacred cow
And I’m willing to take it down to the final minute or second, milking my last one
Going up for a take and I’m itching for action

On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again

I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years

Because if we don’t build it who will?
I do things on a shoestring that you couldn’t do for a cool mil
I run with no laces, and when I fall I start
To build my Taj Mahal with shit I found at Dollarmart
This life’s our greatest project
The journey’s all an art
But I built my perfect nest, and it’s ‘bout to fall apart
Again and again and then I just I make it twice as high
And I give my tower teeth, and I watch it bite the sky
Because I might just cry if I don’t keep it moving
I focus on what I can make and not what just got ruined
‘Cause every stone will crumble down to dust, to dust, to dust
And I say love thy neighbor, and I say fuck thy hater
There’s nothing I can’t solve with duct tape and construction paper
I don’t want a Band-Aid, I’ll only rip it off, I’ll rip it off

Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again

I know someday I’ll pass, and maybe then rest
I’m laying on my back
Heaven’s my bench press
‘Cause my imagination is crazy as Glenn Beck
A cloud is floating by in the shape of a rent check
And when the world ends, that’s what I’ll plan towards
Then I’ll trust girlfriends and maybe landlords
'Cause I been played but I’m looking for more
I say, what would I gain if I took it to court
‘Cause if people were perfect then there wouldn’t be war
We stay pushing but once we get a foot in the door
We get our toes chopped off and a foot of manure
I still gotta believe people
Are good at the core
‘Cause if we weren’t, what’s at stake?
Why would we stay to break what we make
And create all these beautiful mistakes
When they blow our house down let’s draw on the walls, the walls, the walls

I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years

Watsky,"The first time I went back to homeroom from the hospital
I thought that being more embarrassed was impossible
But God, the second time it really turned my stomach
Now I’m the kid who collapses and then spazzes out in public
This time was a bowling alley, the first was in the yard
And kids in middle school just watched me trip and kicked me hard
Except this girl named Crissie Li, who flips around at her desk
And gives me the world’s biggest Disney card
Wrote “best wishes,” and “kisses” where she signed it
3 feet by 2 feet, I coulda hid behind it
I didn’t like the pity from Christina Li though
I’m thinking “Crissie, can’t you see I’m busy being emo?”
‘Cause I think I mighta heard she maybe sorta liked me
And since she wasn’t cool enough I guess I took it lightly
Had braces and glasses and wasn’t Ms. Popular
And so I didn’t really give a thought to her

[Chorus]
A heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping
It’s the notes of the song that’ll never happen
And the wind in the leaves is the sound of ghosts clapping
But a heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping

There’s holes in my memory- it isn’t photographic
There’s holes in my yearbook but the cut-out folks were plastic
Ten years pass, I don’t cross paths
With half the people from my class again 'til we meet at Crissie’s open casket
Those who chose to ask it probably knew
I could have dug in deeper if I’d wanted to
But you couldn’t tell a thing was off on the surface
And I didn’t know she was sick until I heard about her service
She was born with a heart defect, used to the cold knife
She’d been in and out of hospitals her whole life
She knew the whole time, and never said why
She felt my pain herself and helped me hold my head high
The nicest folks are those who know the throes of crisis
Though I know it’s crime to twist her life to fit my own devices
Why’s it so hard to mourn, and then try to learn by this
But lights that burn shortest
Are the lights that burn brightest

[Chorus]

Our 8th grade yearbook page for dedicating songs wasn’t long
Even in a school eleven hundred strong
The yearbook advertised for months, but when it’s said and done
Crissie bought six, the third most of anyone
Alvin got “Your Faith in Me” by Jessica Simpson
Pebbles got Richard Marx’s ballad “At the Beginning”
It feels like sloppy poetry the way her life would end
After sending Mariah Carrey’s “Any Time You Need a Friend""
But corniness is honesty that’s wrapped in cliché
And most slow jam lyrics aren’t shit I’m brave enough to say without a smirk
But before she went to dirt she left us finally
""I Will Remember You” to Geoff, Mike, Bry and me
You can plot if you must
Say it’s obviously fate, or explain that God is just
But all I know is that until my body’s dust
I will try to think of her as much as Crissie thought of us

This one goes out to Christina",Dedicated to Christina Li,2013

Swing, out of your shoes
And if you should lose this time
Keep on swinging and swinging and soon
When you connect
With all of your strength
Look up and you might see a dent in the moon

Yeah, you see them craters?
That was ‘cause a kid said there’d be none greater
In ten years Hammering Hank was at the plate launching balls into space saying see ya later
Skinny as a toothpick but he got a knack
Watch him swing a broomstick at a bottlecap
Watch him rinse and repeat till he’s on the map
Going from the cheap seats to the autographs
Papa put a bat in my hand and all he said was never ever, ever, ever rock a Dodger hat
And whether you win or you didn’t you gotta be getting dirty
And we better send your jersey to the laundromat
It was in the cards
I knew someday I’d be a big league star
Playing second base for the Giants wearing number 9 rocking knee-high socks
If I just worked hard

[Chorus]

We had our 6th grade baseball tryouts on the basketball courts
So a fastball—had hops
We didn’t have a grass field and so coach hit us grounders
Off the asphalt—I dropped
A lot and so he hit ‘em faster and I took ‘em off my ankles
Yelling that’s all you got?
And when I saw my name on the roster I went insane
Like I was sniffing bath salts, I’m not—here to play soft
I’ll go beastmode on a piñata and bite its motherfucking face off
Until it rains candy out of its neck-hole
I don’t go flexing my pecs, or get swole
I wasn’t the fastest
And when I moved it kinda looked like I was running through molasses—true
It’s silly to give a shit about a game but earth
Is a little ball that’s spinning on its axis—too

[Chorus]

I wasn’t cut out for the bigs, guess I been a fool
And middle school was just a bit of cruel ridicule
But when you step into the ranks of the man
It’s like they push you from the high dive to the kiddie pool (thanks)
It’s time to ballroom waltz that plank
We’re little minnows in a small shark tank
You try to swim without getting blood in the water
But you’re all heart and guts like a ballpark frank
Never an all-star
I had to keep score
If I were perfect I would quit and join the Peace Corp
I’m not a hero, if I didn’t try my doubts eat at me
Like I’m a carcass on the sea floor
So say this shit is too corny
It tastes better to me than, ‘ooh poor me’
I’m just trying to sing a different tune
And then fit into a world that didn’t have room for me

Till your abs get hard and your bone’s all soft

You gotta bring yourself your flowers now in show biz

Everybody get together with a study buddy
And then talk about the fuck that I don’t give
Because it’s so big and explosive
But a lotta people don’t live, they don’t ever get a motive
If you got a goal you gotta hold onto what hope is
If I didn’t have it I would ask you where the rope is

You’re on my nerves, but mark my words

Work until I’m black and yellow black and yellow, worker bee
I just work until I’m black and blue and burgundy
Burgundy, work until I earn that rich mahogany
Honestly, can’t you tell I’m working, bitch don’t bother me
Show some modesty, if you’re watching me
A bitch is anybody in my way it’s not misogyny
But if yer blockin’ me I will soon defeat you
I will build a bridge above you, or I’ll tunnel underneath you
I will eat you and excrete you and I’ll feed you to the flowers
If I need to I’ll go through you and absorb your fucking powers
I put in hour after hour let’s be crystal clear
I’m gonna get there if it takes a day or fifty years
I’ll fingerbang my fears, I’ll fucking punch a dragon
Even with the Himalayas in my way it’s gonna happen
‘Cause waiting doesn’t work, and praying may not come through
And hoping doesn’t work. So I will be the one to (work)

Turn on your love light
'Cause baby I’m coming on by
Send in that sunshine
Make everything right
'Cause there ain’t no suffering in life
That don’t ease with the passage of time

If stars died of old age
They wouldn’t explode, they’d burn out with a slow fade
But stars escape life with a gun shot
Which makes me think they stick a pistol in their sun spot
Bite the barrel, squeeze the trigger
Might have cared once, but the obstacles seem bigger
And they’re stuck behind a giant 8 ball
The milky way is star brains that are smeared across the space wall
You know the red giant in sector two?
Yeah, Hector, true, he was a depressing dude
I think he thought nobody thought about him
And now that I think about it, I’m liable to guess it’s true
Everybody wants the sun to come and cure their rough moods but suns need love too
I give out energy and don’t receive. I’m tired now, I’ll go to sleep
And when this is the coldest solstice, maybe folks’ll notice me

Goodbye Maggie, Goodbye Jules

Who am I to say a choice you made was stupid?
There’s a bunch of us who loved you
Fucking stuck here pointing fingers at ourselves for something you did
You you you you you packed your problems in a suitcase
You you you went away forever to a new place
You left behind a lot of blue faces and bouquets and loose ends like shoelaces

Fuck the soda, re-run it with just the cheesy fries

‘Cause even though my bank account is low or overdrawn
I’m down to mow yer lawn
I’m getting open I’m soaking up every moment
And so we should make a toast we won’t be sober till the BROKE of dawn

I’d rather be making the choices I’m proud of than chasing a mountain of money
But if that mountain comes to me, I’m climbing it
Got a brick and I’m laying it down
Got a shovel, I’m breaking this ground
Because I’m in the red, but it’s only a color that I will be painting this town
Because when I make it then I dedicate it to the friends I stayed with
Who would do me favors even lend me paper when I couldn’t pay for a little takeout
And to the fact
That whatever you think that it means
I be here and I’m living my dreams
And it’s ‘cause of the people I leaned on when I came apart at the seams
So gimme the moon
And gimme the spoon
I’m licking it clean
Until there just ain’t nothing left
But who would lend a hand ‘cause

Before he made us pretty things on which to drop bombs
Before the war crimes

Someone stabbed him in the heart, just a little poke
But he keeled over ‘cause he went into battle wearing chain mail made of jokes
Hey, you hear the one about the screenwriter who passed away?
He was giving elevator pitches and the elevator got stuck halfway
He ended up eating smushed sandwiches they pushed through a crack in the door
And repeating the same crappy screenplay idea about talking dogs 'til his last day
Hey, you hear the one about the fisherman who passed?
He didn’t jump off that ledge

Tapping through my mind at night
The same stupid tape loop of old sitcom dialogue
And tattered memories of a girl I got to grind on in high school
Filed carefully on rice paper
My heart is a colored pencil
But my brain is an eraser
I don’t want a real girl, I want to trace her from a catalogue
Truth be told I’m unlikely to hold you down

I’m smiling in Los Angeles like I’ve got fishhooks in the corners of my mouth

Because there are 7 billion 47 million people on the planet
And I have the audacity to think I matter
I know it’s a lie but I prefer it to the alternative
Because I’ve got a tourniquet tied at my elbow / I’ve got
A blunt wrap filled with compliments and I’m burnin it
You say to go to sleep but I been bouncing off my bedroom walls since I was hecka small
We’re every age at once and tucked inside ourselves like Russian nesting dolls
My mother is an 8 year old girl
My grandson is a 74 year old retiree whose kidneys just failed
And that’s the glue between me and you
That’s the screws and nails

And if you love me, I will love you till we go grey
So be my do-ray-me-fa-so-la-ti-do
We'll hit El Farolito, and get a bomb burrito
I try to kill my ego when your subject appears
But I still think of you when I had a couple of beers
I'll see you soon I got no use for a bucket of tears
It seemed unlucky how we'd orbit each other for years
We got our timing right and then I collided with you
The wait is worth it in the moment we finally do

What I told you maybe half was true
I know neither of us have a clue
I'm always coming back to you
Your boo, your boo, your boomerang
I know neither of us have the key
But I'm telling you, you have to see
How you're always coming back to me
My boo, my boo, my boomerang

You press my buttons like I were a Nintendo
Me and her up in a permanent limbo
It's like it’s nothing when we're burnin the indo
The streetlights like a blur in the window
I got no cause to feel I was betrayed
It's just a symptom of the of the game we played
We pull the hearts out of each others' chests, pull the pins out of the hearts
And toss em back and forth like they're grenades
Hot potato, hot potato, what did you do?
Blow my fuckin arm off and then kiss the booboo
Hit me with a shovel, and then say ""I dig you""
And be colder than an igloo
When you want me I don't want you, when I want you, you don't want me
When I sing a tune and you sing it too then it's ""womp womp"" in the wrong key
You always let me go and do my thang
But I'm always coming back again—boomerang

What I told you maybe half was true
I know neither of us have a clue

Watsky,"I don’t know what was wrong
But I wasn’t as strong
I’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them
But if this was a dream
I still know that I’ve seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

I’m so far from perfect
You still loved me when I so far from deserved it
If I’m so brave why does looking you in the eye take every ounce of my courage?
I hang my face to the linoleum and count the freckles on the floor
All of us, all of us are a galaxy of tiny little storms
The good and evil in me wage a bloody civil war
The missiles whistle through me then the rebel pistols roar
I shiver and the final slivers of my chivalry retreat my shriveled core
I can’t imagine the I’ll ever be happy like before
Before, before
We’re sitting in a field in Golden Gate Park off Fulton and 4th
And I’ve never felt less alone
Just a block from the home I’ve outgrown
Five feet and forty years to the right from where dad proposed
An inch above this casserole of stones, grass and mud
rusty needles, lost guitar picks, Indian tombs, and dinosaur bones
Everything happened all at once
And the world is spinning like a hubcap, and not just because of the drugs
We hugged and laid there in each others’ arms all night
Even when the sprinklers cried on us we didn’t mind
We had the rest of our lives to be dry
So we stayed until the edges of the sky turned light
I would have stay until our hair turned white
The mosquitoes arrived to feast on time
Got drunk at our expense, we didn’t mind
We let them bite, we kept on kissing and obliged
Say “bottoms up, you’ve only got til Tuesday so enjoy the ride!”
And I couldn’t imagine that I would ever be unhappy again
And I whispered in your ear that this moment is already a poem
That I just figured out my first tattoo was going to be of bug bites
Decided I’d commemorate their bloody drink by printing three circles on my ankle
Perfect and pink in permanent ink
The beautiful wounds that will keep me, you and this moment forever linked
To remind me when I fail myself, when I fail everyone around me
When I misfire and come tearing through your walls
When the cocktail of humiliation and pain poisons my veins
And this carnival of carnage, this mansion of garbage, this parking lot of carcasses
This heartbreak party drains the spirit that remains
That I have been a part of something worthwhile
To remind me of the pleasure your pulse
The measure of your breath
The rise and fall of our fortunes and our chests
These spectacular triumphs and flops
That even if that moment meant nothing to the universe,
It’s the closest thing to God I’ve got
I’m so far from perfect
So far it’s been worth it",Cannonball,2014
Watsky,"Here, take my career
Give her your health
Let me have the love you share
I've been alone for a long time
Picked the faint praise of strangers
Over one who truly cares
He keeps the faith in a dark room
Fingers twitching like moth wings
Hoping to matter
But he can't see how he matters to you
You can't drink wine or coffee
And you're stuck with a body
That fights each small request you make

I got that brown grass dogs come pee on
Your grass so bright it's neon
Green and tie-dye and grows a mile high
We'll be betrayed by the seeds that we sow
Tiny blades grow and stab the earth from below
Your dying dreams bleeding out in the snow
You with the crumbling hips
She sees strangers eat oranges and clenches her fists
In these miles of highway
You're the prettiest pileup that I've ever glimpsed
I’m lost in the awful withdrawals
Grass seems much greener beyond these old walls
But my worries so small
When I walk through those hospital halls

Here, take my career
Give her your health
Let me have the love you share

Watsky,"It's the American dream
But if you pull on the thread, it's gonna tear at the seam
See what I mean? We don't tend to scream
Baby, we just stare at the screen
Like it's a preacherman up at the pulpit
Some with the scars end up holding the bullwhip
Another angry kid unloading a full clip
And I could tie a pretty bow on this bullshit
But let's not lie for another second
We see the trouble, we're rubberneckin
No doublecheckin, if it's an issue we have to grapple
The words are caught in my Adam's apple
I make my body a happy chapel
'Cause every person's a tabernacle
But there's no feeling you gotta hide
So let's all pray to the God inside, say it now

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?
Still I wish I could break free
It’s that same old simple song I still believe
How many more do we need?
Before it’s hand over hand
Love over everything

That’s me with the long arm
Screaming at the top dog, spilling my blood on the cement
We willing to roll now, sick of getting mowed down
Fuck if I dope now, it’d kill me
'Cause I’d rather be known for the dealing
Than known to be hooked on the feeling
How many more gotta go now? How many more gotta go down?
I’ll stand in the rain witcha
Just to get a little bit of glimpse of the plain picture
People need a pinch just to get em to wake up
You’ll be in a ditch before I get you to wake up, say it bruh
Whoever said it wasn’t fair, they was telling the truth
I’d be a liar if I said there was nothing to prove

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?
Still I wish I could break free
It’s that same old simple song I still believe
How many more do we need?
Before it’s hand over hand
Love over everything

They say we gotta know our role
Kiss the bottom of the totem pole
Set goals, and then go for gold
But we hibernate and hide inside our gopher holes
I wanna smoke a bowl, a hand on my dick
While the other one is busy clicking the remote control
I'm no Dalai Lama of the sofa but I hear I gotta go to
Where the sinners face the roasting coals
You say that your heart ain't got no holes, well bitch please
Let's all admit that we got souls like Swiss cheese
But wishing isn't gonna fill this abyss
And no hand over hand over fisted riches is fixin what's missin
If I wanna kill this monotony
I know the answer is a light that I got in me
I got no university degree in philosophy
But I know that every baby's born with the lock and key

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?

Planet Earth, Planet Earth
Watch it spin, watch it spin

And yes, yes, let's let's let’s get some takeout
Press our hearts together like when kids make Barbies make out
Let's make out, no toothpaste
I only want to know how you taste
We don't need to tie no shoelace
And we don't need to pack no suitcase
To, to find a new place. Let our moment linger
We'll weave our hands together and then kiss this braid of fingers
Until the whisper, whisper of time's undying rivers
Come decorate our skin with crow’s feet, spider-veins and fissures
But we won't cry, we won't cry, we'll step into that cyclone
Together when we're blinded and our minds erode like limestone
And all we can remember is how we make each other feel, then

Why don’t we get high and watch Planet Earth?

Calmly eating my tamale
She followed me home from the diner
Now all day she be on me
On the other side of the street
You can see her through the blinds if you peek
With a book propped up on her knees and the blue hair
What do you care when I'm home what I do there?

You're creeping out my neighbors
When they grab the paper
You probably think I'm inside
Like some kind of savior
Solving world hunger
Working on Sudoku
And filling in the numbers
Polishing my halo
Ooh I bet you wonder

Life can be bogus
We all wanna be noticed
But we're the ones in the background fuzzy
When the ones in the front are in focus
And it's pretty difficult in general
When you really think a person is incredible
And I get it why you're setting em up on a pillar
But the bigger the tumble the bigger the pedestal

Frankly I am flattered
We all want to matter
Do you see when you pass by
That we let the grass die?
I'm late with the rent check
We park on the lawn
Like we're a bunch of fuckin rednecks
I'm just watching Netflix
Jerking off to porno
(I have a subscription!)
And I got a suspicion
You think my life is different
I get your confusion
But you got some delusions

Watsky,"I’ll never it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

'Cause it isn't the fashion, the cash
And isn't the trashing hotels
It's the pit of passion you feel
In the moment you crashed and you fell
Then get up and you're smashing it well 
Like it was a pistachio shell
And you gotta be gnashing your teeth, and be giving em hell
'Cause to love is a radical act, give your brother a pat on the back
And if you get a panic attack, feel like you're at the back of the pack
An opinion's exactly that. If they say that your magic is black
Just do what you do when you do what you do
Keep on pulling that rabbit from hat
You might think that you're ruined. 
You might think you're defeated
If you love what you're doing you've already succeeded
But there's gonna be bleeding, when another one bites that dust
So get ready to beat it, cause maybe it might be us, and I'm telling em
That the journey is oh so slow and we wanna say “no no no”
'Cause to make it is difficult, but we go go go
And my father was telling me that I better be ready ride on through
'Cause I know that it's tough, but it's gotta be somebody
So then why not you?

I’ll never it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

Carry the spark as we're marching into the darkness
I don't care if they're marking where they bury my carcass
I'm working in this circus and searching for purpose
Learning from the bird who's perched 
On top of the church and chirpin a sermon
You want that early worm? Be the determined sparrow
Flying in loops around the sternest scarecrow
Once cupid hit me with his burning arrow
He lit the lava in my churning marrow
So when I'm tested I remember I've been blessed
With that tender ember resting left of center in my chest
And yes, if you fuck with us you'll see my game face
'Cause no matter who you pray to when you say grace
And no matter where you come from in this great space
Every single person is escaping from the same place
So if you got a flame that's blazing hot within
Take a deep breath and feed it oxygen

I’ll never it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

So I was really interested and loved folk music
And then when I was in seventh grade, in the fall of 1963
I started getting interested in politics
This was about a year after my dad died
And I think it was a real way to connect with him
With my memories of him

I’ll never it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

Tore the pages from their Torahs. Hurled torches at their doors
So they departed Polish ports and boarded boats 
To court the green lady with that copper torch 
Who rose up gorgeous off the shore
Endured that stormy weather for me
Ellis Island, hellish journey
Maggots in the hard barley
Some shot off their own toes so they couldn't be forced 
To march in the Tsar's army
Bodies pitched in ditches, singed and bludgeoned
Burned the children in the ovens by the dozens
Burned the witches in New England by the coven
They burn the different ones, so clutch your cousins close
'Cause such is life, it's cuts and strife and
Stitches, punches, knives and hungry crows
Nothing guarantees survival
And we won’t stop this terror sticking flowers 
In the barrels of their rifles
We fight the hatred with the light
And when they think we'll fold and wave that bright rag
We won't surrender
We'll wipe the blood up with the white flag",Never Let It Die,2014

We're not shocked when they're cheaters
These days we're shocked when they're not
Are they the person you thought?
If they're perfect and hot
Often we blame the victim scoff and they deserve what they got
Actors sweep it under the rug and resume with the plot
But they're amateurs and we can see the boom in the shot
If perception is reality then this could be a shocker
I've done my share of fucked up things that didn't get on Gawker
Lots of tiny indiscretions way beyond the public eye
That if you saw would probably out me as a complicated guy
Mike says you got to separate the person from the art
But if the arts about that person you can't pull them apart
So you better watch the choices that you're making now because
They are something that matter, they're the only thing that does

Everything they say conflicts with everything I do
But I must admit I did it so I guess it might be true",Ink Don't Bleed,2014
Watsky,"It’s hard to be living
You gotta play the cards you were given
You think it’s simple but it goddamn isn’t
It’s tougher now than breaking out of Shawshank prison
And as you’re hittin your prime
People say you been committing a crime
But I won’t quit till I’m home
I’ll chip the limestone a bit at a time
Wait! I’m a pale ass pale middle-class straight white male
I won’t have an alibi the day I fail
Cause if I ever went to jail, Mom would pay my bail
In a heartbeat
Mom and Dad have given me a lot more than a pat on the back
And I gotta thank ‘em for loving me
From the moment I was strapped in a Volvo car seat
When I needed a pep talk
I couldn’t remember to wreck shop
Writer’s block, staring at my laptop desktop
Or sleeping in my rental in a turnpike rest stop
Shit in storage, living from a suitcase
Thinking “this is how a silver spoon tastes?”
Cause you can make a dream possible
But it’ll never be easy, no matter what you chase
If you wanna poke fun then do so
I’ll do it for you, it’s no crime
I’m like if the dude from Juno grew a Jewfro and liked to rhyme
So tell me that I’m not a rapper
Tell Rudolph he can’t pull sleighs
Tell pluto it’s not a planet
And he’ll probably keep spinning in the same old way
On and on, every day
Right around the sun, wanna feel the rays
You do it ‘cause you love it like nothing else in the universe
And fuck it, it’s embedded in your DNA",Fireworks,2014

I'm getting naked and I'm hopping on a wrecking ball
So hot I got the mother fucker a la flambé
I go to Miley's house, I see that Miley's home
I play Miley's ribcage with my dick, like it's a Xylie-phone
Yes, that was highly fucked up, but my skills are highly honed
And if I was highly hyphy, I might be more widely-known
C'est la vie, better pay my fee

They get it in the Bay in a plain white tee
Hey mami! You a P.Y.T (P.Y.T)
You wanna see me speak, then I go, go, go, go, go
Every time I get a beat, I know I gotta beat it up
I bend it, then I break it, then I chop it, then I eat it up
And PETA would never approve of the way I've been treating the music
I bleed it, I bruise it, I kick it to the curb
And then I'm sipping on my bourbon, I be freaking it doing it, keeping it moving
I'm picking apart the muscle when I'm thinking about the hustle

I jump the freeway median, I'm savage
Cause my mode is that I'm meaner than the average

I thought I was an atheist until I realized I'm a God!
It could hurt a bit when I murder shit
In a moment I'll be tying off a tourniquet
When I burn them and I hit them in the sternum
I don't even got to enter, but I'm gonna win the tournament
That's what I'm all about
I do what I got to do and never gonna pout
And I hope that it would have been the end of it and I'm out
But they never tend to give me the benefit of the doubt
Ever since I was a little kid
I know that I've been looking for the hot, hot spotlight
And if you really wonder what I think about the competition
They were not-not-not tight
I've been reading my scripture
Every photo bomber wanna be in my picture
And you better bet I'm living every single day
like it's the motherfucking Catalina Wine Mixer
Bada bing, bada boom!
When I walk in, I'm the king of the room
And I get it locked in, like the king in a tomb
When I spit a toxin and they cough on the fumes
Cause I'm back in the nick of time
And I'm attacking the fickle mind
I'm a jackal, I'll rip his hide
I'ma tackle him, pick a fight
I be Dracula set to bite
In the black of the bitter night and I'm out! (poof)

My tears dropping on the grey carpet on the top step
Pops giving me his best guess
Me confessing the burning question stressing  and concerning me and
Turning me to a wet mess
It's probably nothing
I get it, I'm aware
I know it's probably stupid to be scared
But these days are flying past us and nobody seems to care
It's like we're sprinting towards a brick wall we're pretending isn't there
What happens when we hit it?
Do we split into a million bits
Or do we come back as a bullfrog and talk in ribbits?
What is it?  What is it? What is it?
You got the answer so give it, so give it, so give it
Don't lie, what happens when we die?
Dad says, Georgie I'm just guessing from what I've been told
Probably thinking, ""How'd I raise this emo fucking nine-year old?""
Since I'm sorta really not religious it's a crapshoot
I roll a pair of dice
Although the thought of paradise is very nice
In my heart I know I don't believe in magic
So I'm thinking maybe death is like eternal TV static
Or returning to the state before your birth
Absorbed into the earth
The fewer hours left the more they're worth
I admit that it's difficult to think about
I think everybody got a little bit of doubt
You don't get to hide from it even if you shout
Not a soul on the planet gets to wiggle out

Made the mistake of blinking, twenty years passed
Now I'm sitting in my living room in Brooklyn with father
We don't bother doing Christmas in the Bay any longer
It's first time that we've had this conversation
He says ""It's tough to take in
I know we're not quite ancient
But we've reached age where we should probably talk arrangements
We could take it several routes
We could sell the house
We can't work forever, eventually money will run out
That's a spot taking a loan would help  us cover
Which would make it tougher to leave something for you and your brother""
Stop, can't you see?
Every meal that you paid for me
All this power to chase a dream
All this privilege not to crave riches
But it's plain to me the key fact is it's easy to act like cash means jack shit if
You never lacked it
And the greatest honor I could have is to make a buck  and pass back a
Fraction of all the happiness you gave to me
And I will never make you live where you don't aim to be
Age is just data
We paint our story A to Z then dip out
R.I.P. rip out, we tear out the pages
Tear up the stage and we take a seat

Famous or not, we fade from the plot
Every day when a new night falls
I ride around the sun on this big blue ball
I get a bit further from the kid called Paul
And I get a bit closer to the big brick wall
But since inching up to that fence
I can run my fingers against all the bricks and mortar and sense
That it's not so cold and so dense
And although I'm mournful I've known that I'm not immortal
I'm not banging into stone but I'm more heading through this portal
We're born to return to home we're all born to be mincemeat

And to clench the iron first inside the velvet glove
To learn to whisper and to scream
(the whisper justifies the scream)
To let each yearning finger breathe

To metamorphasize the twisted rope unto an alphabet
To lay the lazy C upon the shabby wooden floor to rest
To send the end across the top and bend the C into an S
To curve the tail beneath the S to turn the tangle to a B
To hug the wretched root around the fibers suffocatingly
To wrap again to wrap again to give the coil seven loops
To penetrate the yawning hoop
To tug the loose appendage through
To yank the knot until it's ready for the job it's got to do
To toss the braid above the ceiling beam and to affix the noose

As stars die and a night sky is grieving
As man sees what he has when it's leaving
You gone is as asthma to breathing
That's how much I need you in my life
I'm never gonna ever leave you in my lifetime
Cause every time I hear line  that shows me I'm not alone it's saving me
Cause I know that that's a lifeline
Like minds—this is our home and they won't ruin it easily
Cause the wolf is gonna blow until he's blue in the cheek
And me and you and the crew can go take a snooze in the street
And the bulldozer can come chew on our feet
We never let em through
We'll build a levy
Limit the river's level
Steady the flood and begin with a pebble
Lend me one syllable
Come if you're ready to shovel
Run if you're shaking
But I know that today is not my Waterloo

You've made a place where I'm welcome
And although I give voice to it seldom
Know I love you
Nobody's above you
And if you love someone then you tell them

Every day the planet's losing IQ points
But people still bumping Ice Cube joints
So I've got hope
And every day I'm seeking my true voice  and looking up at a bright new choice
Cause everybody's got a hustle and everyone's trying to push it
It's tricky to find the kush hiking up a mountain of bullshit
And there's another mountain of bullshit next to it littered with glitter, money
And strippers they're selling as good shit
It's nothing new up at the core though
Everything same as it's always been only more so
Of course so same token, while there's life there is truth
While there's truth it demands to be spoken
And someone's gonna speak it
It's really  not a secret
You just need to search it
You just need to seek it
And though we like to worship a genius in a coffin
We often forget that there's prophets among us walking
And I know because I hear em when I am in the clouds
And I got my music up and jamming it loud
And dammit whatever I am or could ever become  I'm positive that I will
Always be a fan in the crowd

Nothing you ever said was funny, man the punchline's you
One time for the palm trees and the sunshine
Two times for the two-timers being unkind
Confined to a small mind, but the fault's mine
I always keep on crawling back across the San Andreas faultline
I keep on climbing underground to sweat out all my principles in darkness with you in this salt mine
Where we're all blind, I should fall back, I know all signs say that I should halt

(Is it money?) are you the paper you chase?
(Kinda funny) You said that I've been playing safe
If you got the bravest voice say that to my face
(is it your career?) pretty shitty to hear
But I took a difficult look in the mirror, and I checked in the rearview
Objects are never what they appear
The past tends to look crooked from here
The mask— that I put on out of fear, the tracks that I didn't put out
The facts that I kept out of my ear
The slack that I cut people who didn't deserve it is tragically clear
No no no not this year
I'm not done changing yet. I'll get these old knees checked
I can't bend over for someone I don't respect

Watsky,"One day you opened up your eyes inside of you 
Inside a world inside a universe you didn’t get to choose
You didn’t get to pick the rules or pick the past or set the pace 
Or cast the cast and crew you didn’t get to pick your starting place
And though it was a race you didn’t understand
You simply lined up on the blocks and when the pistol popped you ran
And when you tripped and dropped you picked yourself up off the ground 
And picked your scabs you knew you had to pick a plan to end what you began
As you got older there were days of cold surrender
Days of shrugged whatevers folded in with days of shocking splendor
But as time advanced the lovely days were covered up from view
By an advancing melancholy haze that hovered near the dew
Yet there were moments 
There were these pure arresting moments when you stepped outside your head
Outside your pain outside control, outside the bullshit, out of body, out of rage
Outside the need to get it, get it, you will never get it, that’s okay

Had a lot to say
But wound up talking to yourself?

Wanna shove it to the bottom but a trouble gonna bubble to the top
Then the bubble gonna pop and the hustle never ever gonna stop
Cause you get up in the morning get ahead then get to bed and then you do it all again until the moment that you drop

That ticking clock lets you know that bitch you got these situations witchu 
Issues someone fit to quick should sit you should down to talk
Ever wonder who’s the crazy the one, people walking to work as if nothing is off
But if a person really got it they would be cracking a bottle on somebody’s head and looting from shops
Are there times you’re alone now when nobody’s home but you walk around muttering under your breath second shit saying goddammit goddammit goddammit just whispering soft
Do you ever get lost, deep in your thoughts, tripping when you think about the cost of seeing this through
When you tie your stomach into knots that you don’t know how to undo
But do you ever have another moment after that, when you can see
There’s no one way this has to be? Or maybe that’s just me",Talking to Myself,2016

I'm helpless 'til you come back to me
Helpless in this world of grieve
I need your words of confidence
I need those happy times we spent
I'm in a hopeless feel confusion
And your love is your solution

It's my fault
And I won't search for you no longer
As I go home alone
Needing you to stop

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
And my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Loneliness deep inside keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In a helpless situation
And I need your consolation

Or the king of the mountain gonna knock him off
Revolt, but y'all niggas here too soft
Bubblegum, just popping off
At the mouth like the nigga got all the hoes
Got all the dough and all the women
Boy, what you gon' do in the penitentiary
Got a lot of money, can't take it with me
I can't take it with me, I wish they could send me
To the moon and back with a cure for cancer
And save the lives of my great grand-mama and my great gran-daddy

But they make money of the medicine
Leaving us all stuck in elections

Pictures say a million words, so I just let my photos talk

When everybody stayed
Getting tired of living in a lie
Different nights, same town
Say goodbyes, but we tried
Cause we know there's no getting out
And when the pawns are playing themselves
I just lay and wait and straighten myself

Bring them back to life, give them mouth to mouth

In silence, I hear the wings of a black crow flappin

Very sleek in physique, stood about six feet 
Dispute was jet black I had to step back 
His dimeanor wasn't pure, I knew this for sure 
He had a diseased look that the world couldn't cure 
I'm forzen, the fear returned to my body

I wake up in a cold sweat, wifey sleepin on my left sound asleep 
I peep around the room then I make a sudden jest

Was it a sign from God to repute for the things that I did in my lifetime 
Now my soul's on the line

Then I take a fall in hell it's the cancer

Pull up the blinds there sits the crow

Open my eyes up, I'm layin on the dark street 
Leaves blowin in the breezes, Jesus 
I on the street like a nightmare 
I take flight, a bird through the air 
While I'm wingin it I see all sorts of chaos 
Dead bodies, burned buildings turned over cars 
Uh-uh, seein visions of an all out war 
Territory factors, picture escape from New York 
Gun fire, blomb flowin, nerve gas a-flowin 
Just imagine whole race of Harlem gaurds showin 
Realizin I was havin out-of-body experience

Wax,"I'm just riding through the valley on my bicycle
Just pedalin' pedalin' pedalin' pedalin' pedalin' along
I'm headed to the studio by Sherman and Coldwater
And when I get there I'm gonna sing this song

I'm gonna sing oh yeah, oh-my-my
I don't give a f*ck about a DUI
You can take away my license
But you can't take away my pride
I'm singing oh yeah, oh-my-my
I'm a keep drinking until the day I die
Two wheels is the way I ride

I got my backpack strapped on my back real tight
Inside of it got a cord and a mic
And a couple tall cans, coors and bud light
That I found in my refrigerator drawer from the night before
I take flight out the door with my bike
Its such a Californian sight
Small breeze got the palm trees swaying back and forth in the light
Melodies in my head I'm gonna record em' the night man
I start pedalin' I start smilin'
I'm in the bike lane freestylin'
I make a quick pit stop on the corner
To pet a little dog and chat with its owner
It's the type of day you just can't feel bad
The same type of day Ice Cube once had
Trying to make it to the lab but I don't pedal fast
I sit back and watch as the rose pedals pass

I'm gonna sing oh yeah, oh-my-my
I don't give a fuck about a DUI
You can take away my license
But you can't take away my pride
I'm singing oh yeah, oh-my-my
I'm a keep drinking until the day I die
Two wheels is the way I ride

Cruising down Sherman a couple blocks left
Rhymes in my head and they're all kinda' deaf
Man, I can't wait to lay em down but my first venture
Is to the store for a couple more thirst quenchers
I pick em up and then add them to the contents
Of my heavy ass bag then I paddle fast no nonsense
Hit the studio with no delayin'
I give a dap to my homie Bailey on the way in
I start drinkin' I start recordin'
Three hours later I'm out the damn door again
Gotta pedal to the store again
I'm feeling festive this require captain Morgan
Another bike ride, staring at a night sky
Trying not to swerve cars fly right by
I stay fresh like fucking bag salad
And I don't give a damn if my license ain't valid

I'm gonna sing oh yeah, oh-my-my
I don't give a f*ck about a DUI

You can hunt for company tonight

To those years, they were yours and mine only
Man there was nobody
Part of me wants to get on with it
I've seen days like these before and there so long
I don't want them anymore I'm leaving them off

Whining maybe, Love you definitely
I'm sorry. I don't know why I get like this so often
I'm killing myself - I'm killing us both
I can't afford not to take these risks

The well is running dry
Nothing can buy back the time
Waste no more tonight
Lay down here by my side
Pick up your horn
Blow out your lungs
Let the truth be heard, and I won't worry anymore
About everything that I could never control anyway
Let it go, its a weight that I've wasted my life on

Some things have to be left behind
And when you found me it was just in time
I knew these things couldn't go on much longer
I remember when we were such sweet kids
And I was the type I always tried really hard - too hard
And you always knew it
I feel my arms breaking, I can't carry everything
I never wanted to let you down
Maybe I'll wake up someday and know that's never
What you wanted anyway, and I'll learn to let go",[Untitled Track],2002
Waxwing,"You are not alone my brother
I have always been with you,
Have we eaten something deadly
Something poisonous consumed.
I just longed for days that were simple
When books still held the golden keys,
But I know that to be an illusion
Know that they were never that way.
I'm not a God Damn machine man
I've got two arms and two eyes,
Guess this is what we lost sight of
Swallowed it with no reply.
Will what this world's made of me
Bring only venting of hatred on my family
Fruit of my labor the desecration of everything sacred to me.
Victims of this great temper, the pent up frustration living has buried in me,
Brought down upon the ones that I love and those who I sing these songs for.
I just long for days that were simple
When books still held the golden keys,
But I know that to be an illusion
Know that they were never that way.
It's been years since I screamed out at the sky
Like my father, a choice to make the decision was mine
Every son can blame this.
I'm not that man, drop it repeat,
It's not what happens it's how it's dealt with.
Your not that man drop it repeat
There's only so much that's in our hands.
The casing for this powerful spirit
Tires but is strengthened by what's been put before
Everyone must spend their due time
Feeling sick, so sick inside
There's a certain sense of violence
In the way a family takes place.",Industry,2002

These teardrops that fall for the kids you know they're really not all for the kids
But I know you don't care and the only love there
Is the love that'd be shared for the kids
Find a new love you should for the kids and I hope that he's good for the kids
And though I'm now out of singht if he don't treat them right
I'll be right back and I'll fight for the kids
But I see you don't care the home that we shared
All our hopes and our prayers for the kids

Waylon Jennings,"Don't get no attention from the people on street
They don't even see us they just step right on our feet
Just two unnoticed people in this great big world are we

To give and keep on giving I have learned

There's no way but yours where you're concerned
I tried till finally I lost my own identity and somewhere along the way I lost me

Waylon Jennings,"The years creep slowly by, Lorena,
The snow is on the grass again,
The sun's low down the sky, Lorena,
The frost gleams where the flowers have been.
But my heart beats on as warmly now,
As when the summer days were nigh,
The sun can never dip so low,
Or down affections cloudless sky.

A hundred months have passed, Lorena,
Since last I held that hand in mine,
And felt the pulse beat fast, Lorena,
Though mine beat faster far than thine.
A hundred months, 'twas flowery may,
When up the hilly slope we climbed,
To watch the dying of the day,
And hear the distant church bells chime.

We loved each other then, Lorena,
More than we ever dared to tell,
And what we might have been, Lorena,
Had but our lovings prospered well.
But then, 'tis past, the years are gone,
I'll not call up their shadowy forms,
I'll say to them, ""lost years, sleep on!
Sleep on! nor heed life's pelting storms.""

The story of that past, Lorena,
Alas! I care not to repeat,
The hopes that could not last, Lorena,
They lived, but only lived to cheat.
I would not cause e'en one regret
To rankle in your bosom now,
For ""if we try, we may forget,""
Were words of thine long years ago.

Yes, these were words of thine, Lorena,
They burn within my memory yet,
They touched some tender chords, Lorena,
Which thrill and tremble with regret.
'twas not thy woman's heart that spoke,
Thy heart was always true to me:
A duty, stern and pressing, broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee.

It matters little now, Lorena,
The past is in the eternal past,
Our heads will soon lie low, Lorena,
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast.
There is a future! o, thank god!
Of life this is so small a part!
'tis dust to dust beneath the sod,
But there, up there, 'tis heart to heart.",Lorena,1969

Of another love she wishes was there.

That the love I have could beckon her command
Instead of laughing endlessly
And pushin' back advances with her hands.

And it leaves a granite statue
In a man with a pain that lingers on.

The girlish giggle of her sweet hello
But tonight I've made my crumbled mind up
That I'll never, ever let her go.

By shifting all her weight from hip to hip
And with her hands brush back the falling strands
That cover up her satin lips.

Are calling out for more
But she leaves 'em stranded helplessly
And exits to her dressing room door.

Tonight I'm gonna take her

But she just hurries by me
Carrying all those scanty costumes that she wore.

Waylon Jennings,"It was winter time in Nashville down on Music City Row
I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul
And keep the chilly winds off my guitar

My thirsty wanted whiskey and my hunger needed beans
But I guess it'd been a month of payday since I heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar

Actually I guess you'd call it a tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling sawdust on the floor friendly shadows
I saw that there was just an old man sittin' at the bar
In the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar

He said come up here boy show us what you are I said I'm dry he bought me a beer
He nodded at my guitar said it's a tough life ain't it I just looked at him
And he said you ain't makin' any money are you I said you been readin' my mail
He just smiled and said let me see that guitar

I got somethin' you oughta hear then he laid it on me
If you waste your time a talkin' to the people who don't listen
To the things that you are sayin' who do you thinks gonna hear
And if you should die explainin' how the thing they complain about

Or the things they could be changing who do you thinks gonna care
There were lots of other singers in the world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
Now their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time

And the truth remains that no one wants to know
Well the old man was a stranger but I'd've heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
No one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor

And lonesome was more than a state of mind
You see the devil haunts a hungry man
And if you don't want to join him well he's gotta figure out someway to beat him
And I ain't sayin' I beat the devil but I drink his beer for nothin'

And then I stole his song
You can still hear me singin' to the people who don't listen
To the things that I am sayin' prayin' someone's gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about

Are things they could be changin' hopin' someone's gonna care
I was born to be a singer and I'm bound to die the same
But I've got to feed this hunger in my soul
If I never have a nickel I won't even die in shame
'Cause I don't believe that no one wants to know",To Beat the Devil,1972
Waylon Jennings,"Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (the cotton was growin' fine)
But that was another place and another time",Willie and Laura Mae Jones,1972
Waylon Jennings,"[Chorus]
I know that you've been foolin' 'round on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring, and I'll take back my heart
When you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me

I wasn't foolin' 'round the day I said I'd do
Many a night I wished that I've been foolin' too
I know it's foolish, taking all this misery
When it's you, a fool I'll always be

Honey, fool around; you'll know right where I'm at

Waylon Jennings,"Heartache number one was when you left me I never knew that I could hurt this way
Heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back but never meant to stay

I've got heartaches by the numbers a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end

While my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
But for now I'm just lonesome all the time

So take all the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine

Waylon Jennings,"Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was ameetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
 
She's forty one and her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
'Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand
Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man
 
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride

You can afford to fly
But it might as well be the moon,
Lord, when you're as broke as I.

Here I sit with my head in my hands
Watching the trains roll by
Lord, the Helping Hand Mission man warned me
That the nights here got cold.

When you're cold there's nothing as welcome as sunshine
When you're dry there's nothing as welcome as rain
When you're alone there's nothing as slow as passin' time
When you're afoot Lord there's nothing as fast as a train.

Old Frisco's a mighty rich city
Now that ain't no lie
Well, they have some buildings
That reach nearly a mile in the sky.

Everyone's so busy they can't tell me the reason why
Here's a world full of people so damn many people alone
When you're alone life just don't seem worth living
While you're alive gotta learn to live with the pain.

You've been grown for so long
There's no one left who'll forgive
You find yourself searching your mind
For the links to the chain.

But the things she don't know I'll teach her when I go
She's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.

I think it's time she learned
Love can't live when love is not returned
She thought that I would always stand by

Waylon Jennings,"Somewhere in Vietnam a 19-year-old soldier walked out of a barroom
And he said I must be seeing things that bourbon hit me like a baseball bat
In Belfast Ireland a little lady dropped her shovel in her garden
She raced across the yard and ask her neighbor Mrs Clancy what was that
In Memphis Tennessee a teacher raised the window closest the river
And the children in her classroom swore they'd heard a choir singing down the street
In Washington DC a private secretary's lips began to quiver
And the President just put aside his papers and rose quickly to his feet
I lay in a cheap motel in the arms of someone else's woman
When a loud explosion rocked the room and turned the morning into night
I jumped out of bed and ran into the street with hardly any clothes on
As the sky lit up my heart stood still and I could feel my face was turnin' white
All at once the clouds rolled back and there stood Jesus Christ in all his glory
And I realized the saddest eyes I'd ever seen were lookin' straight at me
I guess I was awakened by the penetrating sounds of my own screamin'
And it didn't take me long to stumble out of bed and fall down on my knees
As tears rolled down my face I cried dear God I'm thankful I was only dreamin'

Emily Jane would run to meet me she'd smile at papa kinda nervous
All the people came from miles around I can still hear the sound
As they sang thanks to the Lord for the sun up in the sky
For the corn that's growing high and for the child that didn't die
Thanks to the Lord for the crops and for the farm
For the strength in my right arm and for keepin' us from harm

Waylon Jennings,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

And it's knowing I'm not shacked
By forgotten words and boons
And the ink stains
That have dried upon some line

That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted
On their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowing that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory

And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us

And some other woman 's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy, might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind

But not to where I cannot see you
Walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands round a tin
Can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever you're just gentle on my mind

Waylon Jennings,"They said in her younger days
Her beauty was enough to drive men wild
But the hunger in her body then
Was not the hunger of some lonely child.

Like a butterfly in springtime
Searching every field for loving's sweetest rose
The embrace of many strangers
Still could not release her from the hold.

In the backstreets and the bedrooms
All she's found is disappointments bitterly
While the love that she's too often found
Was enough to satisfy her needs.

She's older than the years she holds
And ageing fast with each day passing by
On a downhill run to nowhere
'Cause the hunger never can be satisfied.

The reflection in her mirror's not the image
She remembers in her mind
Her beauty has been eaten by the hunger
And the acid winds of time.

She has danced the tune her demons played
And payed the piper dearly for his song
Empty now of all her pride but still inside
Her hunger's just as strong.

They said in her younger days
Her beauty was enough to drive men wild
But the hunger in her body then
Was not the hunger of some lonely child",The Hunger,1974
Waylon Jennings,"You know I can't stand to be around you cause you know I'm still in love with you
And my arms keep reaching to do what my thoughts do all the time
I just can't keep my hands off of you
Cause it's like looking at heaven while I'm standing in hell
We shared something precious for a while
You look just like a baby in a cradle to me I just can't keep my hands off of you
Woman you've got the man inside my body trembling the way only you know how to
And I guess that's just one of a million reasons I just can't keep my hands off of you
Cause it's like looking at heaven...",I Can't Keep My Hands Off of You,1974

Fancy shoes that dance in time 
Oh, the secrets of her dark eyes 
They did sing a gypsy rhyme. 

Yellow clover entangled blossoms 
In a meadow silky green 
Where she held me to her bosom 
Just a boy of seventeen. 

I recall a gypsy woman 
Silver spangles in her eyes 
Ivory skin against the moonlight 
And the taste of life's sweet wine. 

Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows 
Stir the darkness in my mind 
Oh, gentle woman you sleep beside me 
And little know who haunts my mind. 

Gypsy lady I hear your laughter 
And it dances in my head 
While my tender wife and babies 
Slumber softly in their bed.

Ivory skin against the moonlight

On a long lonesome highway in an old pickup truck
Crossed Texas like a hot dusty wind
He was all around cowboy back in1949 from the top it's been long way down
Since the whiskey and the women started winnin' his time
They rode him high and hard to the ground
He remembers the thrill of bein' a winner in the days of his first rodeo
But there's somethin' about winning that didn't last forever
Maybe tomorrow things'll get better if devil lets loose of his soul
He'll be be the all around cowboy again

Whipes the whiskers that cover his chin
And he grins as he dreams of old rodeo he's the all around cowboy again
