Imagine if i told you that i want you
And imagine if it all came true
Tell me what you do with me
Would you tell me that you feel the same
Imagine if i told you that i need you
Would you say baby i need you to
No matter what you do i know, that you should be in love with me

Sometimes i find myself locked in two
Secret thoughts hoping they'd come true
Sometimes at night I'd feel you lying next to me baby, 
But these are things that i could never tell you, 
Can't imagine what you would do, after all your so far away from me, baby

Sometimes it feels just like a fantasy 
and i don't know what to do, 'cause it's always been 
like a dream to me to find a love so true, 
But i know it's only make believe when I'm picturing 
me and you but one day i know that 
you'll be the one that makes my dreams come true

Imagine if i told you that i want you
And imagine if it all came true
Tell me what you do with me
Would you tell me that you feel the same
Imagine if i told you that i need you
Would you say baby i need you too
No matter what you do i know, that you should be in love with me

There's a feeling so deep inside telling me 
we are meant to be, praying that some day 
you will come for me, for me, 
but till then I'm just day dreaming thinking 
bout the way that things could be but 
it don't matter 'cause your still so far from me, baby

Sometimes it feels just like a fantasy 
and i don't know what to do, 'cause it's always been

Would you say baby i need you too
No matter what you do i know, that you should be in love with me

How can you be so far from me yeah
How can i, keep loving you endlessly
How can we be so far out of reach
It's just not the way that i hoped it would be

Your smile I keep on file

Little man I'm endlessly proud of you
In such a short time span
You've filled my heart with joy

Watching my mistakes
Memorize where I've gone wrong

If they fall way
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as do
Trust me and you'll see
All I want is what is best for you

Little man your head is full of dreams
If only I could spend one day touring
Your imagination
If I live longer you'll grow faster
At recognizing the traps that cause
Me such frustration

With all them dope fiends to regale
But what if you trade one needle for another?
And a lotta them more 'cause I'm your brother
Don't gotta look through rose colored glasses
To see about the shadows risin' out the ashes
Me and you, let's spin it in a different mode
All we gotta do is crack the code

Forget blank pages I wanna live my life amazin', outrageous
It's short but when I step on the stage, woah
Then my head flew off the page
What you want from me?
Can't you see what I could be?

Ezequiel Fainguersch,"Ahí va la tempestad
Ya parece un paisaje habitual
Un árbol color sodio
Y la caída de un ángel eléctrico

Tengo estática y no querría lastimarte de nuevo
Volví solo y cargado por la caída de otro ángel eléctrico

Enredado en cables 
Estoy al filo de la resignación
Debe ser el hábito
De esperar que algo quiebre el unísono

Aún tengo al sol para besar tu sombra
Hoy caí al dejarte sola
Ya pagué por quebrar la calma",Angel Eléctrico,1996

Con otro hombre se casaba

Over at the counter
Where the spanish boys are talking loud
And hiking up their trousers proud
She feels herself expiring
Like the ticket on her windscreen

While Janni sits there all alone
All alone with his Walkman on
And he taps the rhythm gently
With his fingers on the table
And he's trying not to sing along
Sing along to his favourite song

That he can make her body tremble
He's sure she'd make his fingers tingle
Every time they touched her skin

He just wants to lay down next to her
He just wants to go deeper
Deeper than any boy has been

And anyway he knows

And I was sitting in a bar
With all the other angels,
You were smoking a cigar
One hand on your hip
And one foot on a chair
And a golden ostrich feather
That was planted in your hair

And if I really were an angel,
I'd float over your bed
Each night a different dream of me
I'd plant inside your head
And if I were an angel,
I tell you what I'd do
I'd appear in a vision
And I'd give my wings to you

And I'd say ""come closer
Fly into the light
And please, please don't be stupid
Let me sleep tonight
And please don't be stupid
Let me sleep tonight""

I dreamt you were a Jinni
And I found you in the sand
And you were trapped inside a bottle
And I held you in my hand
And you said you'd grant me wishes
If you were ever freed
I said ""an empty head when I go to bed
Is all I ever need""

So I, of course, released you, hoping you would keep your word
And you laughed the cruellest laught that I had ever heard
And you said ""about these wishes, it's too late to decide""
But I remembered that it was my dream, so I put you back inside

I dreamt I was a pirate
Aboard a pirate ship
And for a hand I had a hook
And for a heart I had a whip
And you were trapped inside your bottle
And I kept you down below
And you begged me to release you
But I would not let you go

One night I was awoken
While we were out at sea
By a floating appartion
Glowing incadescently
And I could see you clearly
As all around was black
And you tore off both your wings, said
""Hey now you can have them back!""

And you said ""come closer

And please, please don't be stupid
Let me sleep tonight""

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,

You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

There is nothing for me but to love you,

Ezra Furman,"You know I love you so bad
I don't believe in love
You know I love you so bad, so bad
You know I love you so bad
Like the kid in the back of the classroom
Who can't do the math 'cause he can't see the blackboard, so bad

You know I love you so bad
Like the kid skipping class in the bathrooms
Sneaking cigarettes underneath the football bleachers baby, so bad
You know I love you so bad
Like the kids growing up to be criminals
Tearing pages out the back of the hymnals
Love notes baby, so bad
Still remember so bad

The nights mom got drunker than dad did
She told me, ""never hang out with the bad kids""
Well what can you say to that?
I always knew I was bad
Always dreaming so they called me the Spaceman
You first kissed me in your parent's blue basement
I wanted you baby so bad
Sometimes we got out of hand
We bought drugs from a parking attendant
But sober nights in your car were transcendent
I loved you baby so bad
You know I loved you so bad

Somehow you got yourself accepted to college
You said there had to be a way out of all this
Garbage small town rat trap
You moved away that was that
You still send me the occasional email
I got a dumb job working in retail
I miss you baby so bad, so bad
I drew your name in the sand
Came to the beach 'cause we used to go here
I watched the blue wave cover it over
And do what the ocean does best
I know the past is the past
Then again, the present's nothing without it
I feel fine, don't even feel sad about it
I just love you baby so, so bad
So bad so bad",Love You So Bad,2018
Ezra Furman,"Those long afternoons
When nobody was home but me
Sun is shining but I dwell in shadow
Maraschino-red dress, $8.99 at Goodwill
I was looking over my shoulder
At the register trying not to be seen
Looking over my shoulder at all

I had appointments today, errands to run
I watch the hours drain away
I watch the hours drain away

Mid-grade bourbon sitting in the cabinet
This day's shot anyway
And a couple of beers left from two nights ago
I am hideous and no-one can ever know
When the sun gets low-down, bloody and red
I tie a little knot at the centre of my head
I don't think I'll be showing up
At synagogue at quarter past seven

Sometimes you go through hell and you
Never get to heaven
Sometimes you go through hell and you
Never get to heaven

Ezra Furman,"I found out on a Monday
The city I love doesn't love me
In fact fuck that
It would rather see me dead
I hesitated for a minute
But I packed my bag that evening

I didn't tell you I was leaving
I didn't feel safe staying here
So I just left

Got in my red Camaro
In my head no tomorrow
Realized it had all been borrowed time
That I was living on 'til now
The sun came up less friendly
My sense of safety dead before the
Red sky gave way to cold blue
I wonder who I might be now

From the wrong road, miles from no place
From the road I call and call
This whole world is no place
This world is no place at all

No place for a creature like me
So if you like me indeed
Meet me somewhere way out
On the outer outskirts of town
At the BP diesel station
In my sick imagination
You're already on your way to take my
Hand and hold me up so I don't drown

I just pray you get this letter
I hid it in your sweater drawer
So the authorities could never see the
Plan that I put down
But all the warming weather
May mean that you don't ever
Reach into the secret drawer, and maybe
You'd inform the landlord anyway
Let me say it again, in a better way

I need a pile of rubble
To call my domicile
Far from the violent rabble
And could I trouble you to come along?
And listen to me babble
How long will we babble on in exile?
Babble on in exile
And something tells me I may be
Singing this song a long, long while
But I'll be bringing along a big broad smile
To wear as I walk that final long mile
Back to the city 
Where they broke my heart wide open bleeding on the marble tile

From the wrong road, miles from no place
From the road I call and call
This whole world is no place
This world is no place at all",No Place,2018
Ezra Furman,"I eat an orange every morning
And I take my time with the peel
It's my beginner's meditation
To start my little journey on an even keel

I will sail, as the hours roll by
In my twentieth-century automobile
And a hotel employee
Will sweep up the orange remnants
Leaving no trace of this moment
So sweet and so real

Ah ah good God

I am sailing
I am driving toward the end of my own need to drive
This is February 7th 2017
I am shattered, I am bleeding, but God damn it I'm alive
I am pulled, I am tossed
Back and forth across this country, like garbage with the tide

I am citrus: peel back my skin
Open me and expose the soft wet inside

Ah, I -oh hell yeah",Peel My Orange Every Morning,2018
Ezra Furman,"She said
If you need to find a door inside of your head
That leads to somewhere else I'll show it to you
She told us all about Psalm 151
And what comes after Hallelujah

She said
I'll feed you in the morning, eggs on rye bread
But you're sleeping on the floor
Don't come to my bed
It's too soon for you to see me
With my wings spread

But I've seen her wet with moonlight
Praying in the street
Feathers at her feet
And I saw the small harp hanging
That she never plays
Waiting for the day
When it all comes falling down
And words fail me now

Skipped meals
We'll stay in Kansas city 'til the wound heals
The government went bad, we got a raw deal
A transangelic exodus on four wheels
 
I've seen the broken halo
That she never wears
Hanging by the stairs
Angel, I'll be your guardian if you'll be mine
Authorities are trailing right behind
I'm not afraid, we read the Psalms at night
Clear through Nebraska with just one headlight",Psalm 151,2018
Ezra Furman,"I woke up bleeding in the crock of a tree
TV blaring on the wall above the coffee machine
Car wash waiting room outside Pasadena
I'm sitting waiting for my deus ex machina

And I'm forever changed by this chemical burn
Skin on my fingers peeling, making way for my new form
I grip the steering wheel and picture my angel
Climbing out the hospital window
Leaving tubes in a tangle

Blood on my angel's lips blends in with his make up
He's off the premises before his brain's had time to wake up
Peeling off bandages to unfold his wings
The doctors said they'd have to stay on for another three weeks
Fuck it baby, let 'em bruise, let 'em break
But bleed, let 'em bleed

And I'm doing ninety, got to get there and hold him
If we can make it across the state line then baby, we're golden
Let the law pronounce its' petty assertions
They've been outsmarted by a couple of urchins
And they hurt you bad, man
They hurt me too
But I'm not about to sit here and watch as they
Suck the blood from my wound
They suck the blood from my wound
Suck the blood from my wound
Suck the blood from my wound
Ohh man

Wrap half the money in your hospital garment
We'll stash the rest inside the red Camaro's secret compartment
Even the deepest wounds will heal over time
I'll run my fingers over your scars and yours over mine
They'll never find us if we turn off our phones
We're off the grid, we're off our meds
We're finally out on our own
Now I see color coming back in your cheeks
Angel, don't fight it
To them you know we'll always be freaks
To them we'll always be freaks
We'll always

Park for the night north west of Baton Rouge
Across the parking lot you're stretching the one wing you can move
I let you walk as long as fear will allow
I never loved you more than I love you now
And then we're back on the road before the sun's even up
We're making time, we're making progress
But progress towards what?
Your fallen feathers fill up two shopping bags
The future's breathing down the neck of the past
And the sun throws a shit-eating shine on the moon
And I'm not about to wait for them to come
Suck the blood from my wound
Suck the blood from my wound
Suck the blood from my wound
Suck the blood from my wound

Ezra Koenig,"C’était pendant les vacances d’été dans la cité
À l’époque j’étais à peine ado ; il y a donc déjà quelques années
Dans la rue je rêvais, assis sur mon vieux vélo cross
Et de temps en temps regardais à  gauche et à droite en attendant les autres
J’étais toujours à l’heure lorsqu’on se filait des rencards 
J’étais le plus jeune et le plus sérieux c’était en puissance tout le drame de mon histoire
Les autres arrivèrent donc sans se presser chacun sur son cheval à deux roues
Ils me regardèrent comme si j’étais fou alors Mustaaf pour me rassurer il m’a dit que c’était
                                                                              Eux pas moi qu’étaient chelou 
Après s’être copieusement insulté pour se convaincre qu’on s’aimait
Comme un essaim d’abeilles on s’est tous envolé
Je pédalais sur l’asphalte de mon destin 
Comme un poisson dans l’eau qui se rêve requin
Mon frère aîné était là aussi mais ça l’ennuyait que je sois de la partie
C’était qu’une réticence passagère selon moi et le temps allait confirmer mon avis
Quand la roue s’est désolidarisée de la fourche de mon vélo je l’ai regardé rouler x3
 Et quelques secondes après l’accident mon frère m’a pris dans ses bras et on a pleuré x3

Refrain
Tout le temps qui passe qui c’est écoulé
Et les moments que j’arrive pas a à oublier x2

Le surlendemain après-midi devant la JEEP le centre de prévention du quartier
Je jouais au ping-pong sur la table bétonnée 
J’avais des pansements de partout à cause de l’accident alors par pitié on me laissait gagner
Majid était là comme mon petit frère et moi comme son frère aîné
Qui pouvait se douter que dans quelques années le destin allait nous trier
Les mecs autour de la table ils gueulaient « J’prends le gagnant, j’prends le gagnant ! »
C’étaient nos raquettes et nos balles mais on leur a laissé tellement que c’était plus marrant
On est allé ensuite dans la cave de mon immeuble pour récupérer nos vélos
L’entrée était encombrée par des grands qui pompaient de la colle et ça nous faisait flipper grave même s’ils étaient tous K.O
On a récupéré tant bien que mal  nos motos sans moteur
Et on a roulé comme des fous jusqu’au Parc Schumeister
Juste avant de prendre le pont on s’est dit vient on fait la course
C’est là que le pied de Majid il a glissé de la pédale et qu’il est tombé à mi-course
Je me suis arrêté catastrophé et je l’ai regardé rouler x3 
Et quelques secondes après son accident je l’ai pris dans mes bras et on a pleuré x3

Refrain

Le week-end d’après tellement qu’il faisait soif
On a décidé d’aller se baigner au Lac Achard
Avant qu’on y aille deux amis qui sont mort depuis 
Se sont mis à me vanner devant la bande parce que le respect n’a pas de prix
Ils étaient plus grands que moi alors j’ai rien dit
Mustaaf il a bien vu que j’étais dégoûté alors il m’a dit :
« Je te prends à l’arrière de mon vélo comme ça t’auras pas à pédaler 
Vu qu’ tes plaies elles sont pas encore vraiment cicatrisées ! »
Je voulais refuser par fierté mais je me suis dit “Mahlich“
Dans ce contexte ça voulait dire vas –y c’est pas grave je m’en fiche
Alors on s’est tous mis en mouvement et on est parti en gueulant
Quelque part entre “ La horde sauvage “ et “La guerre des boutons“
C’était à l’époque…que dis-je, à la grande époque de Bernard Hinault
Ça faisait vraiment classe en ce temps-là de faire du vélo
On était plus de cinquante sur la route t’imagine
Têtes d’enfants déjà cassées et gueules citadines
Je sais plus trop d’où est venue la queue-de-poisson
Un coup de poisse en plein milieu du peloton
Je ne sais ni pourquoi, ni comment mais je suis le seul à être tombé et à avoir roulé x3
Et quelques secondes après mon accident on s’est tous pris dans les bras et on a pleuré x3

Ezra Miller,"Let's drive.
Ow!

I don't know if I will have the time to write anymore letters
Because I might be too busy trying to participate.
So if this does end up being the last letter,
I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school
And you helped me.

Even if you didn't know what I was talking about
Or know someone who's gone through it.
You made me not feel alone.

Because I know there are people who say all these things don't happen.
And there are people who forget what it's like to be sixteen when they turn seventeen.
And know these will all be stories someday
And our pictures will become old photographs
And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad.
But right now these moments are not stories.

This is happening.
I am here and I am looking at her
And she is so beautiful.
I can see it.
This one moment when you know you're not a sad story,
You are alive.
And you stand up and see the lights on buildings
And everything that makes you wonder,
When you were listening to that song
On that drive with the people you love most in this world.

And in this moment, I swear, we are infinite.",Charlie's Last Letter,2012

It's hard to stop a runaway love, ooh baby

Runaway love, runaway love, feels good without a doubt
Runaway love, has to stop before it turns me out

Change, take me, take me, take me higher
I know you can do it, take me higher
Take me higher, take me higher, take me

Runaway love, runaway love, feels good without a doubt
Runaway love, has to stop before it turns me out

Runaway love, like a train on broken tracks
Runaway love, it's too hard to turn it back now

Ci sta la notte cruccia e assassina
E in mezzo al prato c'è una contadina

Venuti al mondo come conigli
Partiti al mondo come soldati
E non ancora tornati
 
Generale dietro la stazione
Lo vedi il treno che portava al sole
Non fa più fermate neanche per pisciare
Si va dritti a casa senza più pensare
Che la guerra è bella anche se fa male
Che torneremo ancora a cantare
E a farci fare l'amore, l'amore dalle infermiere
 
Generale la guerra è finita
Il nemico è scappato, è vinto, è battuto
Dietro la collina non c'è più nessuno
Solo aghi di pino e silenzio e funghi
Buoni da mangiare buoni da seccare
Da farci il sugo quando viene Natale
Quando I bambini piangono
E a dormire non ci vogliono andare
 
Generale queste cinque stelle
Queste cinque lacrime sulla mia pelle
Che senso hanno dentro al rumore di questo treno
Che è mezzo vuoto e mezzo pieno
E va veloce verso il ritorno
Tra due minuti è quasi giorno, è quasi casa, è quasi amore",Generale,2002
F. De Gregori,"Un guanto precipitò da una mano desiderata
A toccare il pavimento del mondo in una pista affollata.
Un gentiluomo, un infedele lo seguì con lo sguardo.
E stava quasi per raggiungerlo, ma già troppo in ritardo,
E stava quasi per raggiungerlo, ma troppo in ritardo.
Era scomparsa quella mano e tutta la compagnia
E chissà se era mai esistita.
Era scomparsa quella mano e restava la nostalgia
E il guanto e la sua padrona scivolavano via
E il guanto e la sua padrona pattinavano via.
Sotto un albero senza fiori si struggeva l'amore amato.
Il guanto era a pochi passi, irraggiungibile e consumato.
In quella grande tempesta d'erba, non era estate, nè primavera. 
E non sembrava nemmeno autunno però l'inverno non esisteva.
E non sembrava nemmeno autunno perché l'inverno non esisteva.
Quando un uomo da una piccola barca con un mezzo marinaio
Vide qualcosa biancheggiare.
Un uomo da una piccola barca, sporgendosi sul mare:
Era il guanto che rischiava di annegare,
Era il guanto che rischiava di affondare.
Fu un trionfo di conghiglie, un omaggio di fiori
Per il guanto restituito alla banalità dei cuori,
Ad una spiaggia senza sabbia, a una passione intravista
Ad una gabbia senza chiave, ad una stanza senza vista,
Ad una gabbia senza chiave, ad una vita senza vista.
E intanto milioni di rose rifluivano sul bagnasciuga.
E chissà se si può capire.
Che milioni di rose non profumano mica
Se non sono i tuoi fiori a fiorire,
Se i tuoi occhi non mi fanno più dormire.
 
Era la notte di quel brutto giorno, i guanti erano sconfinati,
Come l'incubo di un assassino o i desideri dei condannati.
Dietro al guanto maggiore la luna era crescente
E piccoli guanti risalivano la corrente
E piccoli guanti risalivano la corrente.
Fino al Capo dei sogni e alla riva
Del letto dell'innocente che dormiva.
Un mostro sconosciuto osservava non osservato
Sopra a un tavolo il guanto incriminato
Sopra al tavolo un guanto immacolato.
 
E il guanto fu rapito in una notte d'inchiostro
Da quel mistero chiamato amore
Da quell'amore che sembrava un mostro.
Inutilmente due nude mani si protesero a trattenerlo.
Il guanto era già nascosto dove nessuno può più vederlo,
Il guanto era già lontano quanto nessuno può più saperlo.
Oltre la pista di pattinaggio e le passioni al dì di festa
E le onde di tutti i mari.
E il trionfo nella tempesta e le rose nella schiuma.
Il guanto era volato più alto della luna.
Il guanto era volato più leggero di una piuma.
 
Oltre il luogo e all'azione e al tempo consentito,
E all'amore e le sue pene.
Il guanto si era già posato in quel quadro infinito
Dove Psiche e Cupido governano insieme
Dove Psiche e Cupido sorridono insieme",Un Guanto,2002

F. Kabango,"I try to hold some hope in my heart for these African youths
Coming up where I'm from many traps to elude
Surrounded by mostly white and affluent dudes
And somehow, you expected to have

Mastered this smooth, swagger and move
With the right walk, the right talk, fashion and crews
Souls subtly attacked and abused
And what's funny's being black wasn't cool

Where I'm from 'til suddenly
You started hearing rap in the school
Hallways admist this madness I grew
With knack for amusing through this little skill

For rappin' at dudes an' we all like to laugh at the truth
But when you young and same facts
Pertain to who you rappin' 'em to
Well, I opted not to bring that to the booth

But after a while, it sort of starts naggin' at you
The crazed infatuation with blackness
That trash that gets viewed and the fact that
The tube only showed blacks actin' the fool and I was watching

Saturated with negative images and a limited range of
Possibilities is strange

And it's sad 'cause that naturally do
Sort of condition your mind and over time
That's what's attractive to you
So young blacks don't see themselves in

Scholastic pursuits or the more practical routes
It's makin' tracks or it's hoops or God-forbid movin' packs for the loot
Even with this music we so limited, it's rap or produce
And that narrow conception of what's black isn't true

Of course, still we feel forced to adapt to this view
Like there's something that you're havin' to prove
Now add that to the slew of justification the capitalists use
For the new blaxploitation many actions excused

In the name of getting cash, that's adversely impactin' our youth
With mental slavery, the shackles is loose
And it's hard to cut chains when they attached at the roots
So what the new black activists do

For our freedom is just being them
Do what you're passionate to
Not confined by a sense that you have to disprove
Any stereotypes, so-called facts to refute

Or match any image of blackness
They've established as true
Perhaps we'll break through the glass ceilings
Shatter the roof and emerge

From these boxes that they have us in cooped
And grow to smash the bold that they casted of you
I'll keep watching

F.L.A.J.,"Chorus (Flaj)
What we see [what we see] everyday [everyday]
Livin' in the ghetto this is where I stay
[What we do] what we do [to get by] to get by
Live or die, the world is a ghetto

(Scarface)
Lets take a journey to the other side
Where many people learn to live with their handicaps
While others die
Where muthafuckas had no money spots
And if they did then they ass went insane 
When all the money stops

I'm from the ghetto so I'm used to that
Look on your muthafuckin map and find Texas
And see where Houston at
Its on the borderline of hard times
And it's seldom that your hear niggas breakin' and givin' God time
That's why your ass (????) and pray for me
Because I know that even I got to die 
And he got a day for me
And every morning I wake up I'm kinda glad to be alive
Cause thousands of my homeboys died
And very few died of old age
In most cases the incident covered up the whole page
From Amsterdam to Amarillo
It ain't no secret
The world is a ghetto

Chorus (Flaj)
(Bushwick Bill)
Five hundred niggas died in guerilla warfare
In a village in Africa, but didn't nobody care
They just called up the goddamn gravedigga
And said come get these muthafuckin niggas
Just like they do in the 5th Ward
In the South Park and The Bronx and the Watts
You know they got crooked cops
Working for the system
Makin' po muthafuckas out of victims
Don't nobody give a fuck about the po
It's double jeopardy if your black or latino
They got muthafuckin drugs in the slums
Got us killing one another over crumbs
Think I'm lying? Well muthafucka I got proof
Name a section in your city where minorities group
And I'ma show you prostitutes, dope and hard times
And a murder rate that never declines
And little babies sittin on the porch smellin' smelly
Cryin cause they ain't got no food in they bellies
They call my neighbourhood a jungle
And me an animal, like they do the people in Rawanda
Fools fleeing their countries to come here black
But see the same bullshit and head right back
They find out what others already know
The world is a ghetto

(Willie D)
What's up outta towner? Southern nigga downer
I wish you would bring your muthafuckin ass around here
With that hip shit shit from your block 
You fuck around and get shipped back home to ya momma in a pine box
Cause we don't play that shit in 5th Ward
We got killas and hustlas and playas to so nigga disregard
What your seeing on them western movies
cause yo! I ain't never rode a horse before
Ho, think we slow? Smash the gas
And watch how fast I'll put these hands on yo' bitch ass
Try to load them dice, you'll meet the gravedigga
Cause game recognize game scheisty ass nigga
See I done seen fools die for less
Than a goddamn cigarette butt, for fuckin' wit my set
So get that frown off your face busta
Cause you ghetto ain't no harder than mine

(Bun B) 

I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin 

had to find my place 

But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue 

had to dodge a case 

Had to dodge a bullet 

And the nigga that tried to pull it 

The streets is throwed 

If I don't get lean and blowed everyday 

I feel just like I'ma explode on overload and overdrive 

All my life this drive I tried 

I seen a lot of good niggas die 

Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched 

Or somebody's a bitch 

I wish I could change the past 

But I gots to live in the present and pray 

that tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast 

Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me 

But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself 

I found out she had to told me 

Just to show me just how good I had it 

I guess I couldn't see it 

Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it 

But that was just the way we used to G it 

One of the wrongest niggas I see 

Or one of the strongest niggas I know 

Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know 

So I put weed in the bong and I blow 

Stay cool calm and collected a neglected 

Child that grew into a man that's widely respected 

Too real

I feel no pain 

I can't complain 

Stuck in the game 

Tryin to maintain 

Cause I'm so real

We blow big everyday 

But that don't stop our pain 

Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game 

Got niggas doin 40 

When you 25 that's life 

I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price 

These bitch ass niggas shife 

Niggas might snitch out they momma 

That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama 

Cause we ain't promised tomorrow 

But nigga you promised to die 

Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry 

At night I talk to God and try to understand 

How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man 

I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back 

So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks 

I still love my piece of change, wood grain and big head ones 

But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun 

I guess that's true for some 

But them hoes will never win 

Out here just hustlin and grindin 

Tryin to change from niggas to men

My nigga you a ho to me 

Boy you done went off on me 

Runnin round with the fakin and hatin 

I'ma blast if you run up on me 

I'ma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch 

This matter coulda been resolved 

if you woulda came clean and paid my shit 

See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last 

Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass 

And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up 

No respect for your family that's dead 

don't write yo peoples locked up 

Damn I miss my dog he was hog to this game 

Unlike bustas these days that talk down on your name

",Intro,2006
F.L.O.W.,"Yeah, after Dah Shinin, it all became clear to me
I knew things would be different son
I knew it'd come time for a change
Seems like the time is now

Jah! Rastafarai

Greetings to my soldiers and soldierettes

Jewel on the world, make the earth sink
On the brink of divinity, defying gravity
Reachin' for infinity
Can he be incarcerated by the limits
Stuck, they can't function
Caught up in the scrimage
This game called life only lasts minutes
Once you in it, be in it to win it to the finish

As the sun heats, I put my feet to the concrete
Hard to sleep so I take it to the streets
Hold my head up, try to keep it movin'
Fed up with losin'
I need some air
I think I take a cruise with you
I'm using, what little know how I possess
To keep our familia down to rest
Now I stress defensive tactics
'Cause police seem active
Got me in the crib sleepin' with heat under the mattress


In case of home intrusion:
First the dogs go ""bark""
Then about five sparks bringin' light to the dark
Like ? does his movement when he's dealin' with math
Or the boss tell his workers where he's keepin' the stash
When that gun blast, better have Jah on your side
Or an act of devine intervention from the most high
I know guys that get a thrill from the kill
And other niggaz, who hold the greed to sling ?frills?

Chorus
Demon's tryin' to take my soul away
But they won't get my soul today
Will I get locked up or blown away?
Just stayin' strong is a price to pay
(Repeat)

Damn I haven't worked since I was 'bout 17
They had time busy hangin' out being a drama fiend
I had to run the streets, see what the night brought out
Sneak in the crib
Hear my moms prayin' to God that I sprout
Take all responsibilities like a man would do
'Cause she know that the streets can bring the worst out of you
She told me concentrate on school but what I do about loot?
I want to push the fat ride, have bitches sweatin' me too
But you know you need dough so you can do the do
And going to class everyday don't bring in no loot
Plus I just been told that I was cold by club bouncers
Standing there hot headed ?bout to set it while they denounce us
Crab niggaz still beggin? for CD?s
While brothaz? careers is stuck on halt and freeze
About to face extinction ?pockets dead is thinkin??
Something ain't peace and suicide?s part of my thinkin?
Even God don't hear my prayer or him just not care
Got a son in this world, stressed out losin? my hair

Chorus

It?s time to take the struggle to the pavement
Let the people know the mayor sent the OK for enslavement
Orders from the government
Official stubborn men with egos runnin? shit
They put the hit out on whoever try to get out
And they are the directors who are dead and ?
Even down south in Atlanta
Police play the pawn for their master
It?s a disaster, practicing who can kill us faster
For less than nothin? like they did Bobby Huton
Corruption got me clutchin? my rifle for gun bustin?
Somethin?s cookin?
Look at the way some faces be lookin?
Cross the bank rock on to Brooklyn, Texas
Even in Houston P?s be shootin? us like sitting ducks in groups
And I can't trust who or what
That will explain the way I watch you, plus,
I know the chosen are few
Many come around to proclaim things they know not
Let alone maintain
Shame, some of my worst enemies
Live right around me and look just like me
I see that its time to intensify the movements in front of my eyes
can't rely on a seeing dog they got me
Or lay and wait for the devil to surprise me, nah G

Chorus (twice)
 It only takes a line to make the mind think
Drop a jewel on the world make the earth sink
I'm on the brink of divinity, defying gravity
Reaching for infinity
Plenty be incarcerated by the limits
Stuck they can't function caught up in the scrimage
This game called life only lasts minutes
Once you in it, be in it to win it ?till the finish

To the first light 
While our hearts beat as one

Dream - and the stars will guide your way
Through the darkness 
While our hearts beat as one

Lie down and close your eyes
Right here by my side
Our shadows paint the walls - tonight

We walk across the moon 
Right here inside this room 
Imagination rules - tonight

Sleep - in the shelter of my arms
I will hold you 
While you take me away

Dream - hideaway inside your mind
When I hold you
Life is easy and kind

There´s something in the air 
Delicate and unaware
A feeling that we share - tonight

Invisible but real 
Is everything we feel
And time is standing still - tonight

Sleep - when the moon is full and bright
To the first light 
While our hearts beat as one

DTP nigga!

I started with ten mack tens
And ten clips and ten pens
Got ten times richer in the span of ten years
Bitch I'm ten times two on a scale of one to ten
I'll battle ten crews with the strength of ten men

At nine, I was into crime, sex, and drugs
Pushin' an '89 Box Chevy sittin' on dubs
Nine thugs all ski masks, black suited with gloves
Break the imprinted chest with at least nine slugs

Man I ate eight clips with eight chicks
Watching eight flicks
You's 8-6 if you ate pussy with fake lips
I figure eight when my mind goes in circles
Did I do that or was it Mystikal and Urkel?

On to 7 AK 47, so what?
I got seven hoes stoppin' by at seven to fuck
Then put seven in your chest seven days a week
And add a foot for good measure you'll be seven feet deep

It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score

I got six hoes distributing on six blocks
It's blistering from cops tryin' to stop these rocks from distributing
Six gun shots left
One pint of Vodka before this pimp will hit
It's street justice, now it's six hole in your casket

Give me a high five and I'll put that nine lower than your esophagus
Then smack you so hard that you have to come with 2Pacalypse
Five stars, twenty rims, five cars
I'd add more but I had to subtract one from five bars

I got four forty-fours on a rip on the floor
For you niggas talkin' shit
I'm fixin' to show you what for
I did four months in the bing instead of a hearst
Now it's DTP for life, dog for better or worse

I fuck three best friends
Ran on all three the same game
In these streets I'm a murderer
I got three alias names
I'm three times insane
Three shots will cave your brain
On 3 fire and ready, cock back and aim

It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score

I'm packing two twenty-twos and twice the ammunition
But at Friday the 13th
What's up now superstition?
I'm a two timer with a couple of twins
Double jeopardy
With a pair of two deuces in the two seater Benz

I got one motto get dough till your gone
I got one main lady the rest of y'all is hoes
I'm numero uno with one more before I go
If you think I ain't the one bitch you too slow

And all you zero ass niggas ain't nothin' to me
Because I chop up O's, move dro', and chop keys
0-6 is my clique along with PC
Pretty Rick, Calil, V-Slim and Shondrez

It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1
Ludacris, Fake Feeze, and that nigga I-Twain
It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1

All this drinking going catch up
And all this smoking going catch up
But some niggas just really don't give a fuck
But some niggas just really don't give a fuck
And all this drinking going catch up
And all this smoking going catch up
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck

Now let me be quite Frank
Cause I'm that crazy nigga Luda
Always got a drink
And I'm steady smoking buddah
I do the
Evil that'll bend you when I get you
I'ma sit you down
Then take it to the mental and essential and clown
Every chance I get
Bitch I'm hit
Not by no bullet or no pellet 
But the smoke from the can a beer shit
I might just be too high
Then I put my middle finger up when I'm ridin' by
And say hi to plenty liquors and I know it's a sin
And if ya tell me stop drinking I'll just do it again
So when I get old I'ma rock, roll, shake, and shiver
With some blacked out lungs and a fucked up liver

[Chorus]

Hey yo I do this for bluntheads and whinos 
Steward Ave. Homes
Niggas from G-Ro committed to slanging blow
Doublin' dough 24-7
Fuck po-po's I'm blowin' dro out the Ac Legend
Running wit 2 strike felons
And I pack 4-4's like Hank Aaron
Then'll smoke a L
Bust shells
And dare ya to tell
Walk up in the club
Pretty thug
Fucked up off head shots
Sippin' Courvousier watchin' hoes drop it like it's hot
Shaking tits and twats
Placing big face 20's and cock
Loading clips and glocks
Knowing we got the haters hot
The ballin' don't stop
Just drop more G's on drink and drugs
Live it up young nigga cause it's gon' catch up

[Chorus]

Now wit the help of Hen and Coke
I grab my pen and pad and wrote
Something that I knew was dope
And represent for my kinfolk
Pimp a hoe until she broke
Wit mo lines than chopped coke
Hey yo it's 2-0 I'm Eastside's King
But I'm a writer with a twist of Amaretto
My shit even come out better
Grab a blunt put it together
What a nigga really need
Run up in the club and blow a motherfucker til he
bleed
Could it be an Icehouse put his lights out
Or the club get closed out
If it's hoes out I show out
Call Tyheed get Dro'd out
There's no doubt I love my life
Love the light
Love to write
Love the mic
So take a drag
Grab a bag and match up
Hennessey and bad weed
Believe me it catch up

Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South
To reach the sky, how far would a star go
To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out

Y'en a qu'ont tracé leur avenir, d'autre l'ont tracé dans la blanche
Juste pour jouer les paros, mais ça devient veugra
Avant ils tiraient sur des garrots, maintenant ils l'ont autour du bras
Juste pour faire le ssiste-gro, en effet
Avant t'en connaissais le tarot, maintenant t'en connais les effets
Juste pour l'honneur certains on sorti le matériel

Pour balancer un 16 lourd, j'ai manqué l'Eden trop d'fois
Pour payer ses études, elle a dut faire le trottoir

Juste pour un manque de respect, ratata rafale

Dans mon ghetto y'a pas de ""mi amor"" mais rien qu'ça nique à mort
Y'a pas de Cupidon c'est toi qui t'fait des films
On dit qu'l'amour rend aveugle j'te dis qu'la trahison se dessine
Mariage égal divorce, aux miens moi j'ferai pas d'discours

T'façon les ""je t'aime"" on s'en tape, hein?
J'pourrais parler d'amour à un cadavre ou bien une tapin, ouais j'pars pas loin
L'amour avant la guerre, donc j'pleure des larmes de missile
À l'heure des violons j'm'esquive, baby girl I miss you
Ça sent le crime passionnel pas loin du périmètre
Le corps d'une femme se vend bah donc l'amour s'achète

C'est les reproches qui nous font stagner, fuck l'amour
C'est pour nos sœurs et leurs cœurs brisés, fuck l'amour
Mes ghettos youth m'ont dit d'en parler, fuck l'amour

Fuck l'amour, devant toute la foule j'l'ai dit
Tellement d'putes, qu'on devient possessif et parano baby!
Si l'amour c'est un monument, moi j'compte y venir en touriste
Dans mes histoires t'entends des chœurs mais j'avais pas demandé de choristes
Aucune confiance envers la gente féminine
J'oublie pas qu'en caressant une rose j'aurai à faire à des épines
Sur la A4 de la fidélité y a qu'les chiens qui tombent en panne

Il t'a trompé une fois, quand il sort tu dors pas
Ton pardon a ses raisons qu'ta meilleure pote comprend pas

Aux meufs, aux mecs, aux SMS avec des petits cœurs

Sur le terrain de l'amitié, faire confiance au dernier but

J'ferais en sorte d'être celle que tu attends
Personne n'est parfait et Dieu nous entend
J'ferais en sorte d'être celle qui t'attends
Construire un avenir et faire des enfants

J'aime bien avoir raison, faut pas t'énerver
Si tu nages en plein doute, c'est qu'mon amour t'as submergé
Dis c'qui t'ronges, dis moi c'qui s'passe
Si l'amour nous électrocute, c'est qu'le courant passe
""Fuck L'Amour"" devant toute la foule j'l'ai dit
Tellement trahi qu'j'parle tout seul, donc j'en deviens tout débile
J'te crierais pas d'ssus, pas l'temps d'te faire d'la peine
Moi j'te traiterais comme une princesse, j'suis élevé par une Reine
On va pas s'mentir tout l'temps, comme ça ça va durer
Dans les ruelles d'la trahison, j'ai vu des couples se déchirer
J'lirais entre les lignes tes blessures, pour comprendre ton histoire
Si l'amour rend aveugle, j'me crèverais les yeux juste pour te revoir

J'ferais en sorte d'être celle que tu attends
Personne n'est parfait et Dieu nous entend
J'ferais en sorte d'être celle qui t'attends
Construire un avenir et faire des enfants

Sur le chemin de l'amour les cœurs de pierre nous retardent
Plus on marche droit, et moins on s'égare
J'ai trébuché parfois mais quand je tombe je me relève
Je suivais ta voie, plus rien ne nous sépare
On m'jugera et, condamnera mais
La peine sera moins lourde que ce qu'il nous montre du doigt

J'ferais en sorte d'être celle que tu attends
Personne n'est parfait et Dieu nous entend
J'ferais en sorte d'être celle qui t'attends

Les petits ont insulté les chtars, j'cautionne pas mais j'comprends
Médiateurs et psychologues, eux ils ont mit trop de temps
Mes blessures sont réelles, suis-je un rappeur conscient?
J'ferai jamais confiance aux femmes, fuck l'amour c'est constant
Des coups de fouets sur mon cahier, j'suis un fils de nègre, de renois
Quand le passé refait surface bah le présent se noie
Quand mon destin a plus d'inspi', le mektoub improvise
Un bonheur imparfait vaut mieux qu'un amour impossible
Tu veux ma peau, prends une arme les représailles ne blaguent pas
Maman sèche tes larmes j'prendrai la place à papa
On s'regarde de travers vu qu'on s'apprécie pas
Si on vient pas du même quartier c'est sur qu'on s'mettra 6 balles

Les traces sur mes ancêtres me laissent des p'tites marques
La trahison des miens me laisse des stigmates
La trahison des miens me laisse des stigmates

L'acharnement policier me laisse des stigmates
L'acharnement policier me laisse des stigmates

C'est mes punchlines tristes qui t'aideront à penser
À cause du nerf de la guerre on s'ouvre les veines devant le banquier
Condamné à vivre comme un noir, appelle Martin dit lui que j'rêve plus
Mes grossistes et Hulot, eux rêvent encore de verdures
J'aime être seul j'met une distance avec mes potes
Si tu t'suicides devant l'église, le Paradis t'ouvre pas ses portes
Personne m'rackette non, l'Afrique parle d'endettement
Du sang sur mon vêtement, F.A.B est dead, non
Partir en mission vu qu'on a des armes de pointes
Paupières sous perfusion, vu qu'on pleure des larmes de sang
J'ai aimé des femmes, j'ai aimé des flammes ouais
Des dou'aa pas des armes, pour sauver mon âme ouais

Les traces sur mes ancêtres me laissent des p'tites marques

La symphonie des chargeurs, sur le piano est posé le Glock
D'après la balistique, j'peux partir sur une fausse note
Un contentieux réglé au fusil à pompe
Comme le banquier, je m'étais pas trompé sur ton compte
Des mains faites pour l'odo', du sang entre les phalanges
Des rumeurs sur moi, comment dire bien, j'm'en balance
Quand t'as besoin de soutien, c'est mieux de ramener du monde
Après ""La symphonie des chargeurs"" viendra ""La force du nombre""",Stigmates,2011
Fababy,"T’as l'choix ou t’as l'droit, d'être précis ou d'rafaler
À cause de toutes ces balles qui sifflent on s'entend même plus parler
Histoires de guns à cause d'un mec qui paye pas
Si l'illicite du pays hausse, bah c'est la faute du Pays-Bas
It is F.A.Baby, symphonie des chargeurs, que seul ton index peut connaître
On t'loge une balle sous la pommette, 93 93 Ou ja konet!
Les sanguinaires s'finissent aux coup d'shlass, le commencement d'un coup d'crosse
La scène du meurtre est atroce, en passant laisse l'avenue propre
Dis-moi avec qui tu traînes, j'te dirais si tu vas mal finir
Les avertissements commencent toujours par une balle dans l'fémur
Les balles perdues traversent ta fenêtre, rentrent dans ta jambe
Nettoie l'canon pour mieux te détendre, traîne qu'avec des mecs déters'
Délinquant et fier de l'être, ne jamais compter sur l'autre
Et si on t'a loupé cette nuit, sois sûr qu'on reviendra à l'aube
T'étais un bandit trop gourmand la juge t'a fourni l'dessert

Binôme on s'en fout qu'tu sois bilingue, une bastos parle n'importe quelle langue
La Triade qui t'exécute, fusillade les douilles discutent
Le récital d'un son qui tue, la balistique me récupère

Tu sais où il habite celui qui t’as carotte, prends l'périph' a 2.40
Compte lui faire gouter le carrelage, oublie l’heure d'la salat
Pourtant t’as bien entendu Haya ala Salât, Haya ala Salât
Mais toi tu t'en bas les couilles tu veux juste rafaler
T'es sur les nerfs regard farouche, donne le feu vert crève au feu rouge
La foule ahurie et apeurée s'met à pleurer, putain
Es-tu conscient de tes limites? 
Du sang t'en perds en millilitre
C'est juste une question de minutes, ici les armes sont militaires
La mort est sur les lieux du drame, souvent les plus gentils qu'on cane

Des gars à moi on touché l'fond avant d'finir la bouteille
J'perd des potes j'suis plus heureux d'être célèbre
Les croissants d'lunes nourissent aucun rêve
Quand les lumières s'éteignent j'suis parano et bizzare
Pour avoir l'biff de Hazard on écoute même plus Eden
Mariè à la rue j'ai engendré la poisse
J'ai beau écrire des litres l'Afrique a toujours soif
L'écriture c'est pas innée
Dit au public qu'j'ai fé-ta
Baby je sais pas où j'suis né mais je sais que je mourrais quelque part
Ah nan certain me regarde bizzarement
J'ai des frères morts violemment
Histoire de rue mise à l'amande baby
J'dure comme Snoop j'rappe comme j'souffre
J'rap dans l'trou j'rappe dans l'flou j'raconte tout
Soit personne ne m'aime soit personne me le montre
En même temps que les cadavres les remors remontent
Big up à mes sœurs et notre lit superposée
Si l'épreuve d'amour est inflammable ma mère serait sur un bûcher
Et en punchline j'ai tout fait
L'impression d'étouffer
Même si le soleil se lève certain veulent rester couché
Priez pour moi j'irai peut-être en enfer
Un délit j'irai peut-etre à Nanterre
Défendu tellement d'causes
Au mic dit tellement d'choses
Tu risques de t'faire refroidir le flingue est sous l'manteau
Décision, finition, punition
Dieu pardonne mais pas nos munitions
Ce sont des sous-sols ou des sous sales
Ouais c'est vrai j'suis beaucoup plus fort quand j'rappe tout seul
Nan nan nan j'ai toujours pas sommeil

Fababy,"On soigne nos blessures car nos douleurs sont récentes
J'ai fait semblant d'mourir pour voir qui m'aimait vraiment
Dites à l'imam de plus revenir maintenant

J'dois prendre le large sinon
Comme la mère de Bambi, ils m'tueront devant mes enfants
La nuit j'vois des démons

Dernier coup d'plume avant mon dernier soupir
J'me ferai tué par un noir avant d'avoir pu tout dire
Tu veux pas m'tendre la main, fais moi au moins un sourire
Aimer d'amour, le meilleur moyen d'souffrir
Avoir un air de Rythm & Blues
Leur pardonner, j'sais pas si ça va suffire

Elle me fait des signes et puis j'm'arrête pour me garer
Elle me dit ""What's up?"", j'crois qu'elle parle en anglais
Donc j'ai pris son number, elle m'a dit ""Call me later""
Direction Google et puis j'allume mon traducteur

Elle veut graille un McDo, j'lui dis qu'j'suis une re-sta
Elle m'dit ""Tu te la pètes"", you know, Baby est comme ça
Quand j'lui d'mande elle part quand, elle m'répond ""I don't know""
Elle me dit ""Where you're from?"", j'lui réponds ""Mon ghetto""

Ma musique elle parle aux jeunes chômeurs, taulards et puristes

Même les manchots mettent leur garde parce leur vie est violente
Deux motos sur un terrain vague pour surfer sur la violence
Arrête de faire le fou, si on t'allume gros tu vas rien faire
Une arme pour la guerre, une rose pour le pardon sincère

In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

Like a melody can?

Dimension côté obscur, force de l'énergie pure
Les voix de la souffrance durent
Ma rime originale marque déposée assure mon revenu
Je mets mon cerveau à l'épreuve et nous sommes entendus
De par le globe, ma verbalistique flotte dans l'air du temps
Réfléchir avant d'écrire, le principal élément
Ça paraît si simple à faire, pourtant mon écoute est claire
À part quelques groupes qui carburent nous kiffons peu les concerts
L'enfer, mais quelle est leur motivation première?
Prennent-ils plaisir à tchatcher? Est-ce la crème, le billet vert?
J'opère dans les bas fonds, cerbère du dernier bastion
Mes vers pour le Double H expression de l'opinion
Une partie de la jeunesse n'a presque rien ou si peu
Quand tu retournes tes poches la poussière te pique les yeux
C'est clair, l'avenir ne nous réserve rien de bon
Vivant au jour le jour pour nous c'est la même de toute façon
Nous sommes toujours à l'heure, vivement le troisième round

Ce soir baston à mains nues pas de gros dégâts
Les gars sortent pour jouer des kentos
Dégainent des pointeaux, frappent, lacèrent, ciao crève, à bientôt
Personne ne bouge, il demeurent sur leurs gardes
Tendus, au cas où un gadjo les regarde de travers
C'est l'enfer, cycle amer, trop pervers
Deux-trois coups par derrière, embrouille? Pow! Revolver
Pour le plaisir, mais le plaisir, n'est-il pas de rire?
Un bon délire avec son équipe, ça fait frémir
J'ai besoin d'un break, cette fois-ci c'est clair
Quel est leur but, leur guerre, leur motivation première?
D'ailleurs, mes mœurs s'assortent pas avec ces railleurs
Assis en tailleur, je suis bien meilleur, un vrai seigneur
La violence m'exaspère, ces types me sont antipathiques
Surtout quand elle est gratuite
Un homme est un homme avec ou sans le chrome
Se battre pour la réputation, c'est se battre contre des fantômes
Sûr, frère, tes agissements sont terre-à-terre
Faire parler les poings à chaque sortie, sans arrêt, c'est

Une justice qui glisse comme le vice sur nos enfants
Plantant d'autres enfants prenant du bon temps
Distancé, jamais à temps, d'ici gars j'entends
Des sirènes, pas celles de la Seine
La police, coulisses du vice, délices du délit
Du préjudice, des gars qui courent, des complices, fils
Des cons tout court, qui font tout pour qu'ici la vie ici ce soit
Chacun pour soi et Dieu pour tous
Rac-Chi, pourquoi tu tousses? C'est toi qui pousse
Mes frères à bout j'arrive à la rescousse
Pousse-toi de là, je fais mes affaires c'est dur à faire
Par là et je parle à mes scars-la
Ce que j'ai à faire sur la Terre frère c'est la guerre aux stéréotypes
Je flaire pas, mon but c'est de pas rester terre-par
Là je fais ce que je peux avec ce que j'ai
Donc de plus en plus je rate des bus
Mais pas ma vie quand je donne mon avis
Je modère mes envies et j'avise toujours en quête de réalité

Il est déjà à la fenêtre quand le réveil sonne
Il regarde la cour mais il n'y a encore personne
Pourtant dans quelques heures, le silence ne règnera plus
Beaucoup de jeunes y viendront passer une journée de plus
Vaincus par l'oisiveté ou las d'aller pointer
Pour rien certains iront dealer
Devant les plus jeunes émerveillés par tant de billets
Le genre de gâteaux qu'ils se languissent de goûter
Déjà résignés à suivre le chemin qui leur est tracé
Ils ne pensent même pas à lutter
La vie est un film où tout le monde a un rôle à jouer
Le problème, c'est qu'il y a trop de séries B
Trop de seconds rôles croulant sous le poids du premier
Trop de modèles sur lequel ils vont calquer
De leur démarche jusqu'à leur manière d'être
Ainsi ils ont l'impression d'ouvrir une fenêtre
Quelle est leur motivation première, je n'en sais rien
Peut-être aiment-ils vivre le purgatoire au quotidien
D'un regard extérieur, il se dit, c'est pas de leur faute
Cette fois il a raison, l'Enfer, c'est les autres",L' Enfer,1997

Porque siento que en tu ausencia
Todo, todo es soledad.
Me pregunto si es que no te has dado cuenta
Que la historia que vivimos
No fue por casualidad.

Porque siento en la distancia que estás cerca,
Yo no escucho aquellas lenguas que hablan sólo por hablar,
Porque veo que en tus ojos va mi huella,
Que mi vida es la frontera que no atreves a cruzar.

Déjame que nunca es tarde,
Déjame mostrarte que estoy hecho para amarte.

Que no estás en la casa o que tienes que estudiar.

Fabian,"Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...
He never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade,
Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

His mama told him someday he would be a man,
And he would be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around
To hear him play his music when the sun go down
Maybe someday his name would be in lights

Empezamos ahora!

Yeah Bigflo, Oli
Tu connais non?
Tiens

Désolé maman, ce texte sera pas pour toi
Je suis discret en vrai mais en musique il faut que je parle
Sa voix vibrait dans mon oreille quand j'étais dans ses bras
Les chansons à la guitare, les bisous avec la barbe
Il parle de l'époque du lycée avec mélancolie
Je m'endormais sur le canapé, je me réveillais dans mon lit
Il m'a laissé veiller devant les films que j'aimais bien
Il m'engueule jamais, le pire c'est quand il dit rien
On fait des matchs et je prie pour que ça dure
Il prend de l'âge, je l'ai lu dans ses courbatures
Les jambes tremblent quand on se fâche par moments
Plus ensemble, mais il me demande toujours pour maman
Il m'a transmis son charme et sa poésie
Mais j'ai aussi hérité de sa calvitie
C'est mon idole, avec lui rien est impossible
C'est un peu mon avocat, mon cuistot, mon taxi
Ses histoires et ses blagues quand il picole
Ses vieux pulls et ses chemises à auréoles
Maintenant c'est bon, et bêtement on en rigole
Mais j'étais con et j'avais honte devant l'école
L'odeur du café le matin, la voiture, les souvenirs
Les au revoirs, les câlins, ses blessures, ses soupirs
Ça sera toujours mon père et je reste son gamin
Et quand j'en aurais un je lui parlerais du mien

Celle-là c'est pour nos pères, nos padre
Ceux qui disent ""je t'aime"" sans même parler
Pour ceux qu'on regrette, ceux qui sont pas passés
Mais si t'es papa, tu sais que t'es pas parfait
Celle-là c'est pour nos pères, nos padre
Ceux qui disent ""je t'aime"" sans même parler
Pour ceux qu'on regrette, ceux qui sont pas passés
Mais si t'es papa, tu sais que t'es pas parfait

Y ya sé que soy viejo
Nunca te olvidaré
Cuando miro el espejo
Son mis hijos que veo
Me acuerdo del mío
Y cuando se fue
Aprendí que la vida
No vale más que el Papá, papá
Papá, papá
Papa, papa
Papa, papa

Derrière moi depuis mes tout premiers pas
Tous mes amis le trouvent vraiment très sympa
Ils les invitent à partager les repas
Mon père c'est le meilleur mais ça se compare pas
Il est ridé, la jeunesse l'a quitté
Comme tous les pères il a l'air déprimé
Pensif dans le salon, je le vois à chaque fois
Je crois qu'il regrette l'époque où il était pas papa
Mon père c'est mon boss, mon roi, mon héros
Moi, je suis son gosse, son minot, su hijo
Quoi? Il tourne tous mes problèmes en dérision
Je suis une des raisons pour lesquelles il peut finir en prison
Quoiqu'il arrive il accomplit sa mission
La berceuse du soir et les bisous qui piquent
Devant la télévision, le sport devient une religion
La sueur des joueurs de foot devient de l'eau bénite
Si ton père n'est pas là, tu sais, ne soit pas triste
Tu évites les engueulades pour le bouchon du dentifrice
Et j'appréhende déjà le jour des grands adieux
Y a pas de bons pères, y a que des hommes qui font de leur mieux

Celle-là c'est pour nos pères, nos padre
Ceux qui disent ""je t'aime"" sans même parler
Pour ceux qu'on regrette, ceux qui sont pas passés
Mais si t'es papa, tu sais que t'es pas parfait

Hoje eu chorei em meu quarto
ao ver seu retrato lindo
Na parede, é tanta saudade
Que meu peito invade, amor
Grito o seu nome
Tento disfarçar
Mas não sei como fugir
Sem você não dá
Onde você se esconde?
Chego do trabalho
Tomo banho e saio à noite,
Novamente
A te procurar
Prometo te dar amor
Eternamente
Quero te falar
Que eu já me decidi
Com você vou ser feliz
É com você que eu vou viver essa paixão
Eu sou completamente louco por você
Eu não consigo nem pensar em solidão.
Eu só penso em você, iê iê.
Eu só sei amar você, iê, iê.",Retrato,2010
Fabiano,"Diretamente do espaço sideral
Viemos juntos numa nave espacial
E nos perdemos numa grande colisão
Com um cometa coisa sem explicação
Milhões de anos de saudade de você
Somente em sonhos sei que você vem me ver
Seja loucura, seja coisa do além
Só sei que mesmo sem dormir sonho também
Ei iê iê
Sentimento que nem o tempo apagou
Ôoo, tão distante estou procurando esse amor

Esse amor",Espaço Sideral,2009
Fabiano,"Nas incertezas de um caminho 
Que é tão doído sem você 
Eu já me encontrava tão sozinha 
Antes de adeus você dizer 
Na mágoa de um sonho que acabou 
Dia a dia sentia você partir 
Sem rumo perdida, vou ficando aqui 

Sem você, sem você 
Nem o tempo me faz companhia 
Não me arranque essa agonia de viver 
Sem você, sem você 
O silêncio dessas horas frias 
São palavras que não sei dizer 
Ainda amo você",Sem Você,2009

Fabio Concato,"Tu dove sarai, in questo istante mentre canto cosa fai? 
Stai preparandoti un caffè con gli occhi chiusi
Sarà la primavera e non ti svegli mai
Invece io che sono un grillo 
Su questo piccolo giardino sopra il mare 

Mi son svegliato così presto e mi mancavi 
E più ti penso e più vien voglia di cantare 
E canterò che mi ami così forte
Stai attento che ti sdraio 
Posso amarti fino alla morte
Invece questa è vita ed è un piacere 

Ma vieni più vicina che possa vedere 
E com'è bello anche per un ometto 
Farsi corteggiare un po'
E tu cosa farai, metti una gonna che non te la metti mai 
E proprio adesso sento che mi stai pensando 
Davanti a quello specchio so che riderai 
Come sarà quel tuo bel viso 
Quel naso così affascinante 
Quel sorriso

Lo sai una volta l'ho confuso con la neve 
In un viaggio fatto tanto tempo fa 
Vengo da te, metterò una maglia fresca 
Quel profumo che ti piace, oggi non lavoro, è festa
Sarà un po' lungo, stai così lontano
Mi godo il viaggio, sai che guido piano 
Adesso guarda dalla tua finestra, non ci credi? Sono qua",E' Festa,1993
Fabio Concato,"Oggi vado a ritirare la mia macchina 
Ma ci credi che non ho dormito mai
Sento già quel profumino della plastica 
Ti ho aspettata tanto, tu come sarai? 
E mi batte forte il cuore mentre luccica 
E mi batte un po' di più perché è automatica 
E quest'uomo che mi dice come fare 
E non ti posso salutare
Posso fare quel che voglio nella macchina
Sopra tutto posso stare un po' con me 
E ascoltare questa musica romantica
È la stessa che piaceva tanto a te 
E mi guardo intorno è piena d'elettronica 
Ma che meraviglia quest'aerodinamica
Me la godo come un matto la mia macchina 
Me la godo senza te, ma dove posso andare? 
Ci proverò a scappare, per non vederti più
Via, via, attraversiamo il mondo
Ci metterò un secondo 
Non ti ricordo più
Ci sono due ragazzi ad un semaforo 
E si danno tanti baci che confondono 
È una specie di casetta quella macchina 
C'è molta intimità
Oggi è sabato, siamo tutti in giro in macchina 
Ma nessuno sa di certo dove andrà 
Forse è proprio questo il bello che mi affascina 
E che mi da' un po' il senso della libertà 
Posso ridere e pensare, posso piangere 
Mi dicevi ""ma che grande solitudine""
Non m'importano le tue teorie analitiche
Viaggio bene senza te ma non so dove andare
Non mi è servito a niente, stai sempre dentro me

Ascoltavo un signore che aveva una voce così 
Non capivo che lingua parlasse ma mi era simpatica 
E riempiva la stanza di note e di poesia 
Tu eri lì con me che cercavi d'insegnarmela 
Mi dicevi hai le mani ancora piccole 
Ma che accordi complicati il Sud America 
Certo che a vedere te sembrava facile 
Era il tempo in cui cominciavo a sentire musica 
Insieme a te

Ti ricordi quella velina sopra il pettine 
Ci cantavo e venivano suoni un po' kasoo 
Tu suonavi Bill Evans dicendo ""quest'uomo è un fenomeno 
certamente, ma qui ce n'è un altro e sei proprio tu"" 
E stavi lì, con me a giocare con la musica 
E pensavo, la mia vita forse è questa qui 
Ma tu giurami che un giorno suonerò così

ma un po' ti aspettavo siediti qui
Ma da quando tu sei partito non c'è più musica 
Sta tranquillo, lo so che col tempo mi passerà
Scrivo molto ma quello che scrivo e' cosi malinconico 
Come questa canzone, chissò se ti piacerà 
Dimmi dove sei 
Suoni ancora ma per gli angeli

Ma poi mi siedo lì vicino mentre parla e viene voglia di cantare
Quando arriverà
Mio bel mistero io t'aspetterò 
Non sembra vero ma ti bloccherò 
Prima che voli via, come magia 
Quando arriverà mi piace sempre 
E se non ti conosce il mondo non fa niente 
Ma mi confondo quando sento che quacuno in strada ti fischietterà
Quando arriverà
Quando arriverà
Succede sempre, mi emozionerà
Perchè non so che cosa mi dirai 
Da dove vieni non lo dice mai
Forse arriva dal mio cuore 
Che a volte è allegro e a volte no 
E quando sento dentro che nasce o che muore qualcosa 
Io t'aspetterò 
Quando arriverà sarà col sole 
O in una notte sotto l'acqua busserà
Ti faccio entrare, forse nasce una canzone e c'è chi la fischietterà
Quando arriverà
Quando arriverà 
È come adesso e mi emoziono già
Perchè per me è lo stesso 
È come allora e come arrivi mi sorprende ancora
Certo arriva dal mio cuore 
Che a volte è grande e a volte no 
Ma quando sento dentro che nasce o che muore qualcosa 
Io ti canterò",Quando Arriverà,2001

vedrai sarà più dolce dirsi ti amo
faremo un giro in barca

e fingere di essere sul mare.

partire quando Milano dorme ancora
vederla sonnecchiare
e accorgermi che è bella
prima che cominci a correre e ad urlare.
Che domenica bestiale
la domenica con te
ogni tanto mangio un fiore
lo confondo col tuo amore
com'è bella la natura e com'è
bello il tuo cuore.
Che meraviglia stare sotto il sole
sentirsi come un bimbo ad una gita
hai voglia di giocare,
che belli i tuoi complimenti
è strano non ho più voglia di pescare.
Amore mio che fame spaventosa
dev'essere quest'aria innaturale
è bello parlare d'amore
tra un fritto e un'insalata
e dirti che fortuna averti incontrata.

Fábio de Melo,"Maria cheia de raça
Não teve de graça o que recebeu
Quando alguém é um rio que gera um oceano
Não há nenhum tirano que arranque o que é seu

Um ventre quando se transforma em um santuário
É revolucionário ao meu modo de ver
Ninguém vai do parto ao santo sudário
Sem saber porque

Tem que ter a luz da humildade
Cumplicidade, amor e revelia
Ninguém se torna mãe da cristandade
Sem a santa ousadia
Olhos que velaram pelo sono de Adonai
Clareai o mundo, mãe, iluminai
Cada vez que um de nós se vê tentado
Pela insana covardia

You mean the world to me baby you know its the truth.
But I don't know who I love more you or the booth.
These are just the things I need to get off my chest.
Sometimes I feel like all I can give you is sex.
I'm sorry

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life.
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life.
I've had my ups, my downs,I paid my dues.
Learned my stripes.
Love........?

I ain't gone lie, baby this life is addicting.
The fame, the money, ecspecially these bitches.
I've been around it all, I've seen them ball.
Seen them fall, go broke and lose it all.
That's why I work hard, 365.
24-7, baby that's my life.
I bleed, I feed, I sleep,I shit this.
I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list.
I know its hard to understand, 
But its outta my hands, 
This is God's plan.
I came, I saw, I conquered.
I apoligise, but this game is a monster.


I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life.
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life.
I've had my ups, my downs,I paid my dues.
Learned my stripes.
Love.......?

Even though I know how men be talkin'
I just know that nigga wanna be me
Came in here and fell in love with a bad bitch
Back then she ain't have shit

Wanna know where she got that ass at

Said, ""French, take me to Paris""
Dominican mami from Cali
I said, ""Gon' bend it over, let me grab it""
I said, ""Gon' bend it over, make it nasty""
Walked up in the club, rollin', Stevie Wonder glasses
I ain't lookin' at you niggas, lookin' way past you
Young, fly, G's up, pocket full of cash
You know where to find me, you know when you need me

Pull up with my niggas, make a move
Red light, green light, no it ain't Gucci
Used to walk up in the store, couldn't afford that
Now I walk up in the store, buyin' all that
Drink it to the head, man, nigga feelin' woozy
Pull up in the old school, boy I'm on some new shit
Red to the head, man we gettin' all that
And shorty phone answers, she don't ever call back
And I can see why these niggas hate me
Pull up in a drop and the watch 80
Pull up to the front but a nigga faded
Got a new crib and the shit gated
Came from the bottom, watch a nigga ball out
Drink it to the head, smoke 'til you fall out
Countin' up this money, nigga, keep the door locked
All my niggas gettin' to this money, no lie

I was born in the Field raised in Atlanta
Pop busted a *** here so I was made in Atlanta
Mat Lew died so I stayed in Atlanta
Had a plug on the squares got paid in Atlanta

Twenty-two?s on the 2-door it sits so right
Ice tray on my wrist yeah, it shines so bright
Make moves in the day and I ball by night
9/11 Porsche I was on that flight

Five nine, six one I call 'em the twin towers
Had them on the triple stack, hit 'em both in the shower
Pedal to the medal 'bout a buck 85
Mr. 17-5 slow head well I drive, what's up

I got the streets on lock, Atlanta on my back
I do it for the hood, you got a problem with that

Frozen down wit diamond bolders all in the crown

Soakin' you down wit the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and put your corpse in force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk in the ghetto
Even spark your metal and get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than kung fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

I fuck wit clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood

That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the president is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get hed too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, go head boo
Thugged out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, cam'ron and punisher too
And the beats are usually done by duro and clue

Who in the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign
Far from being borin'
My style is hard like cancer without mccorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like aids cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a street fighter like jean claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the desert storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in porches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit
I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of canibus that's side effectless
The type of shit that get the question-mark man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on mcs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, clueminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call swat
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the national guard
Ready or not like the fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what clueminati did to you
The maximum lyrical
Nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you ??

When that blowing red suit hits your hips so right
It's like de de de de, de de de de de de damn

Benzs, Bentleys and they don't got lids
Meet me then you can say you know a roller
I don't tak to chicks unless it's through Motorola's
Plus the kid ain't the one to be playin' with either
Look at me and tell I have trouble stayin' with fevas
I be layin' with divas, and I don't like nothin' but
And not the one that be playing with beavas
It's something about the way your switch it shakes
The airbags almost came out when I hit the brakes

It's so funny how I suit the women
They know I'm still spendin' show money from ""Superwoman""
They like ""where'd he get those twenties?""
And ""I didn't know that's a color that the coupe could come in, damnit man""
All I say to the heffers is ""Jesus""

I know you want to sip Proof

Somebody call Silvia and tell her ship larger amounts
This playa make 'em scream a scheme
My closest look like I keep gettin' traded from team to team
Look sleezy, it's difficult but me and Tim the only ones that make pimpin
Look easy
Tell me how I'm gonna make my album cleaner
With bitches suckin' me up like vacuum cleaners

That's what it's all about?
That's what we work so hard for Fabolous?
So they can point their fucking fingers
and call me the fucking bad guy?

[Verse 1]
I guess I'm the bad guy
The fingers is pointing
Nigga, I don't go in no clubs without bringing my joint in
They be asking fellas why (why?)

It's cause the streets is watching
With an envious ear, jealous eye
You know how William H. Bonnie's rockin
I keep the home ??? two way contact for Johnny Cochran

Be the same dudes, testing your patience
In them hospitals, resting like patients, confessing to agents
You smell me, you gotta spray the Wesson like fragrance
And you pay your way out arrests and arraignments

These playas been playin' foul
And I done learned my lesson with flagrants
Nigga, this how I live it ain't just entertainment

Bitches think all they gotta do is say the child is yours
Quit they job and live off the child support
How could you stand there, smile in court
I'm a just settle, fly back to them Cayman Isle resorts

You better sign a pre-nup
You catch me instead of 'it wasn't me'
I'm gonna say 'where you get a key from?'
I love the way your butt swishes

But non of these slut bitches
is worth me asking my doctor why my nuts itches
If they see how the Rolls Royce smell
All day I be emptying my in box and my whole voice mail

I'll be ready to light the weed and pull it
Now every chick want to make me come faster than a speeding bullet
But I ain't into coaching birds like Tony LaRussa
I done had the thickest chickens to the boniest roosters

Who have trouble getting the kid like me to spend
Ma you'll never see a bad guy like me again, for real

So say goodnight to the bad guy, come on
It's the last time you're gonna hear a bad guy ???
You better make way, it's a bad guy coming through

[Verse 3]
Come on
What type of bad guy give fellas ???, females hugs
I making my business, my kids won't have to retail drugs
I get threats over the two way from email thugs

I ride with ratchets, clips under the CL rugs
Think I'm liking you? Wrong
'Cause even if I get locked
My money won't let me stay unrighteous for wrong

Case dismissed, the DA even liking the song
Right back to the P's, latest pair of Michael's shoes on
When you holla in the club it's cool
But don't change the subject fool

And start askin if I remember you from public school
You know I done heard dozens, of these birds buzzing
Talking 'bout I used to fuck with they 3rd cousin
FYI, stay the fuck from 'round me

I don't care what other haters do
But if you think I'm loved for saving you

How I'm goin' push it unless it's a v-12
From S's to CL's, I request is
In the head rests his TV's dwell
They heard how many albums I presses for retail
And they can't get a dime unless it's a weed sale
And lets be real, catch me at the bar wit them crispy bills 
Getting Cris' re-fills, my wrist be chilled
And my wardrobe look like I got an Ice Berg History deal

And I don't even know what they real names have been

I'm right behind Wilt Chamberlin

Cause I ain't giving you any see-notes

Hundred and something with two skinny deep throats
Winter hit, I'm in a new finny ski coat
See the screens? ain't gotta use any remotes
No more shopping sprees I'm rough wit the ends
Keep honeys on their knees, scuffin' they shins
I deal wit nothing but tens
I be the club king wit diamonds shuffling your friends
Chickens get keys, scuffing the Benz
Cause they want to lock me down like I'm Puff in the pens
Snatch any chink blond who feel my link long view

Hope tricking ain't one of the things you think John do

Breaking day on the grind, I used to be so drained
But ain't a Saturday I wasn't up to see Soul Train
Sometimes I ain't see no gain
'Cause I was runnin to Ralphies everytime my trees showed stains

I was lucky I ain't seized or maim

But now shit with these skios changed

I just want some peace of mind
Nigga's will risk havin cuffs on their wrists for this masterpiece on mine
Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined

But on a small island, too far for police to find
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined
I gotta make sure my niece is fine
She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time

Some be like ""At least you signed""
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime
And I be gettin Nikes before they even get released sometime

Youngsters, don't let these videos geese your mind
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine
And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time

[Chorus]

Sometimes I wish I could go way back when
I could walk through and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson
Everything was OK back then
Now everybody playin a cool role and I know they actin

I gotta go back through my ol' way packin
These wolves know my jewels is filled with O shade Jacksons
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin
But these niggas with me be eager to show they Mack 10s

And I'm the one the PO's stay trackin
Plus I got all these ducks around the ol' way quackin
These hoes may crack grins
But I swear to God I won't never take O.J's actions

If I would've let this flow stay packed in
I'd probably be with Nick and 'Rome, spending my whole day shacked in
For now I just roll on those eight Jacksons till Clue and Duro brings those 
Gray plaques in 
Yeah

And jewels that give you cataracts, bitch who you foolin'

And eight darts nigga, no one to leave

Stop, drop, roll out the booth

It's time to separate the oil from the cut and gotten the pot
So when the flame rise niggas gon' respect what's hot
Four chain glock on em' with no warning
Leave ya hood like a circle with no corners
Made dough with the pot, heatin' and raisin'
Been around more pies than sweet potatoes

So I'ma just lay eight and etch the bodies

And that's why I'm the only bitch on this shit

Yeah, now basketball is my favorite sport
I love the way they dribble up and down the court
I keep it so fresh on the microphone
I like no interruption when the game is on
I like slam dunk, to take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll
I like the give-and-go

I'm throwing dime passes like J. Kidd
Taking cats to the rack
And I'm dunking on them like T. Mac
When I'm in the paint I play with that Alonzo style
I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles

Don't too many players get offers like me
Back and forth, I'll likely
Shake the checks off your Nikes
They almost had me in a suit at the draft
And it look like a free throw when I be shooting from half
The first step like Iverson - blow past you
Usually nothing but net, but I can go blast too
When I'm in the paint the defense so shook
They don't know if I'ma put up a slow hook, or dish off a no-look
See my game consist of a whole lotta
Moves you would think I learned from the Harlem Globetrotters
J.D. gon lead us to a ring
Fab and Bow Wow the only players that make cheerleaders want to sing

Now tell me were you in the joint
The night MJ scored 63 points
When the Lakers won titles back to back

Ain't a thing in the world that ain't culpable so so

Type shape real live niggas appreciate
To the utmost I pack toast, keep the gat closed
Run niggas to the island I pack most
After the gun burst quench my blood thirst
We will be leavin' you much worse so one hearse
Yo, now we embellish fuck the jealous
And they mark on niggas now what you gon' tell us

And give it the niggas because we got the fire!

And while we blow the spot and keep it hot

Why you grabbin' it, my flow is immaculate
Passionate when it comes to the fire that you have to get
Then I tackle it and kill like we Jackal and Jaffolit
Rob niggas and give it to the church so they can raffle it
Now you can distinguish how
Afro-English flowin' broke in English
Witness how we stay hot and how we keep us goslin'

Re-evaluate the shit off so we retaliate
Marinate, when I give the hustle and carry weight
And bust up niggas like you would have the Bleat Estate
It's the niggas like y'all I hits for only when it counts
Black on the set and make motherfuckers bounce
Connected the raw types of shit
To make your bitch bug and make niggas pull out cake
Hey I think it's whack yo, I stack dough, and pack a rap show

Somebody get these niggas some wheelchairs or somethin'

Goin' to war is still a scary issue
But in my hood they train to kill wit every pistol
Like a military issue
Guess you a star if you sell a million every disc two
Catch a gun case an' bounce, still they'll barely frisk you
'cause, I proved I move the retail
Make the smoothest grooves wit female
And I remove the rules on V12's
You never ain't never seen it move this smooth on Sprewell's
I'm a hustler, he's just a middle man to me
The way I pass the rock, could make Jason Kidd a fan of me
Just cop one joint, I'm a one point somethin'
Still I had you at gunpoint, with one joint dumpin'
So watch what you say to them, crackers
I'll put a couple g's on yer head, like you play for the packers
I'm rap's Labron James, I quickly see baskets
These scrubs wouldn't make it to the Mickey-D's classics
You got some sticky weed, pass it
If not put it out, I'm pushin' it before they put it out
Wit the dash, wooded out, Shaq O'Neal, footed out
Blastin' a do-did-it, first before they put it out, clue

Maybe wouldn't be a million kids wit they faces on containers
If cops pursue the same way they chase us entertainers
In the hood, a few big faces and a chain-a
Get metal in ya mouth, like braces and retainers
Even the young bucks be scheming on somebody change
Tryin' a sell somebody 'cain, before they even potty trained
You can smooth talk your way into a hottie brain
Have her suckin' long enough to leave a nigga body drained
I wasn't taught, I learned from watchin' stupid people
That'll run up shootin' in front of a group of people
I lay in a cut, the same way the troopers peep you
Ride up on yer Coupe creep you
Why you let a groupie deep you?
'cause even if you reppin' like a man of steel
You gon' still need a weapon when you land a deal
One for watch you slippin' like you steppin' on banana peels
Think a nigga ain't gon' pull a weapon 'cause you scanned a mil'?
I crept in and got handed meals
Now the white and black rides look like salt, pepper on a bannon grill
Think I wouldn't hold a Pepsi in my hand for mil's?
You must be fuckin' stupid, nigga

Your hatred only made me wanna cake ya, fuck you
Wherever I see you nigga I'ma buck you
And put a hole in your chest that's big enough to drive a truck through

I bring the drama back where you lives, flatter your wiz
Reload and then point the Mag at your kids
So what I sound remorse, the records I still peep guns on me
But the difference now is only Deserts

If I talk it's gonna be reckless, I'm ready to die
So when I apply pressure, niggaz gon' respect it
Tote guns to rob niggaz, I told 'em to use
And leave enemies of friends that like broken and bruised

They ain't crazy, they just broke and confused, cross me
And they'll be talks of how they found the man smoked on the news
I'ma career crook they used a mug shot from my graduation picture
And my junior high school yearbook

Paul Cain never appear shook
Yeah, I might talk to my enemies but never police
You wanna converse it better be brief, you ain't gotta say much
Show me the money and the cheddar'll speak

If it ain't involvin' bread, I ain't with it
I don't need D's on me, I'm already dodgin' Feds
When the shots from the revolver spread
Duck, I don't discriminate, leave CEO's and artists dead

Make slugs a part of his head
Vanish then pop up in a SL double nickel, scarlet red
Fuck you I'm tryna get my cash right

When I pulled the 5 out, I kinda expected
For the back stabbers, to be standin' behind me, wit they knives out
Then the Range, wit the fins drove in
I wasn't shocked to see my foes, dressed in friends clothin'

But I still pull through the sty, wit handguns
As big as the one, Robocop pulled from his thigh
You prolly heard about the bullets I buy and how it look like
I'm throwin' batteries, when the bullets shoot by

So what, you wear a vest, why would I care
If I aim for ya chest, that be a good idea
Nigga, it's nothing to clap ya but I'm more worried
Bout the groupie cops, who wanna put they cuffs on a rappa

That's why I'm limpin' off wit a freak and a lawyer
Who woulda got O.J. Simpson off in a week
I could show you how to blow up on ya own in a Benz
That'll hit a buck and make the windows go up on they own

Wit a stash box compartment for a handgun
That make holes the size of peep holes, on apartment doors
My closet look like department stores and you wonder why
Ya girl's comin' home, wit a cigar sip for

'Cause I just dump the light Dutch, mash the guts
You won't believe how much ass I touch
Who else struts pass the sluts, and a chain wit so much
Ash and cuts, that it hangs much pass the nuts

That's why I get followed by broads wit deeper throats
Then the people at the circus, that be swallowin' swords
Y'all hopin' that the Don fall off but my money's long enough
To keep shootin' ya bank until, ya arms fall off

I'm eatin', and I ain't have to use someone's utinsels
And when you clean as me, you know that every bum is against you
But please don't let someone convince you to test the kid
And get hit wit slugs as long, as a No. 2 Pencil, fucka

I see ya faggot ass schemin', fuck you
Bitch you don't wanna swallow semen, fuck you
No you hate the way I'm street dreamin', fuck you
That's why I ridin', clappin', wit the .40 Cal screamin', fuck you

Who can make em' blush the same when I ask,

""What's my name"" and they yell, 
F-A-be	-Ohh 
You shouldn't have even brought her my direction,
Unless she was handcuffed with an order of protection, Yeah.
I'm talkin wreckless now,
'Cause I'm the reason that your girlfriends are your ex's now..nigga

[Mike Shorey]
I'm the fella that keep em yellin, and its nuttin to get em,
I don't sweat em', its what I tell em',
And they quickly forget em',
And I bet em' I get them to forget the day that they met em'

And I let em', cause I can spend em'
And its more then the denim,
But I've been
Born to move, while you dudes be sleeping,

The coupe on 22's keep the Shorey sneaking,
And she won't tell the truth, she too used to creepin 
The mic is in the booth, it's the truth I'm speaking

[Fabolous]
Any girl I gave it to.. 
can't even go love another man,
I give it to em' like no other brother can,
She say my man can barely move me,

Before you made me scream, like a scary movie,
On top of that,
I'm smoother then the rest of the gangsters,
And I knew that dude you met, was a wanksta

Oh.
Damn homie,
Your girl is with the street Fab. Homie,
And she ain't fuckin with you

[Mike Shorey]
It's a shame, you lames
Can't even maintain your thangs,
And its insane the way, that she gave me brain
I pimp things the same, don't forget the name

And when chicks peep the chain, they just can't restrain
Shorty don't try to fake it,
Just up and face it,
Your time is being wasted, your mans a basic

See it all in his face, that he's cheap and tasteless,
But life is what you make it, just watch the bracelet

[Fabolous]
I bet your man can't do it like me,
His veins don't pump pimp fluid like me,
He's nowhere near or like me,
And he probably think keeping you in check,

Is buying you a pair of Nike's 
Why wouldn't I.. get dough from her,
When the digits on my checks, look like phone numbers
Fuck It,

You might as well tell that buster skid addle,
Not even Catherine can help him in his custody battle
Yeah.

[Mike Shorey]
You can catch me in the club, with a case of bub
And a thick chick to rub, niggas hate because
When they sit in the truck, they be quick to fuck
When I'm getting a nut, they just lick it up

I'm in favor if, bust a flow is dangerous,
I don't aim to give shortys our relationships,
But they crave the chips, how many the range can fit
She just changed a bit, since I got the hang of it

Some niggas thug and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas'll rob and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got shit, some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time and some live as a snitch

Now some niggas like to pull out and talk, some niggas pop off
Some niggas found they way to the top, some niggas got lost
Some niggas keep it thorough in jail, some niggas got soft
Some niggas ride hard top Coupe, I pull the top off

And quick to speed off on the jake
Quick to back, any nigga gettin' money, come up off of the safe
Fuck the city, I'm extortin' the state
I'm like O, from the 'Wire', walk wit a sawed-off and a .8
When I was taught, never talk wit a snake

When you kill a nigga you love, you pay for the coffin' and weight
Get you wrapped up and tossed in a lake
If you can't get the whole pie, just take ya portion and skate
Don't fuck wit niggas, if they soft or they fake

Only jail cats and niggas going back and forth
To court could relate, fuck wit me and I'ma alter ya fate
Send some wolves after ya girl
I specialize in torture and rape

Some niggas thug and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas rob and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got nothin', some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time and some live as a snitch

These niggas act like, I ain't sling the clip at the last lane
And ran to the cops to bring the tips of the last names
(Nigga)
Like I ain't bring the shipments and past caine
And sticky that'll leave ya finger tips wit the grass stains
(Nigga)

Like I don't swing and zip through the fast lane
Would you believe, this ringer chipped me a fast range?
(Nigga)
Like I ain't sling on stips, till my past fame
And stacked it up, like the Pringle chips, when the cash came
(Nigga)

Like I ain't fling and dip, when the task came
I knew these niggas sing like pits, so I stash change
The singles chipped in my ass changed
But this player never pay for, them rings and whips, just to gas dance

I'm why you stay in touch wit ya writer
Even made you pick up ya pen and start clutchin' it tighter
I ain't much of a fighter but I know, everything
About rollin' up, like a Dutch in a Spyder
My dope is much more than whiter

One hit'll have the fiends yellin' out
They need crutches and lighters
The Fed's can't touch us indict us
And the hoes can't even get numbers
They wanna stay in touch, they could write us, nigga

Some niggas do the time and some live as a snitch

Listen, listen, I lived that life, of click-clack life
The kidnap life, the kid's the wise, I did that twice
You prolly see that through ya bitch ass eyes
Still I'm that nigga that you get at why

Man forget that they knew me, remember me thug
I'm from that same block, rips snorkle on ja dip in a Lucy
'Member they back you down, when knives was out
.45 was out, scully ya eyes come out

But now could you hear nigga all in this place
That when you see him in the streets, you gettin' all in his face
More you give a nigga, the more that he takes and you wanna beef
Knowin' I'm slower than do so, 'cause I got much more at stake

Huh, that's why I'm ignorin' ya page
I can't respect you no more, you's a fraud and a snake
But you noticed that's the hate that I love
You see me eating off rat, that same feat you think you capable of

Don't get me worng, I would like to get it
But you acting like, I ain't blow my show money on a rifle fetish
And my pop's voluntarily, surrendered to the Fed's
This is the wrong time to fuck wit my head

I'm tryna tell you, friends are ya worst enemies
So if I make friends wit my worst enemies
That'll maybe even things out
But one in ya dome is easy, get it on if need be
Chrome for sheezy, please, don't believe me

Fabolous,"Uh, they call me G H E T T O, nigga
Uh, uh, I'm back on that bullshit
Ha, ha, who could fuck around? Huh? Uh

I bet you look at things from a different perspective
When you see the size of the slugs, the fifth or the tech get
A couple'll lift a detective and make sure the legs
That he used to walked with is defective

All you niggas do is sit on blocks and jive
About who's the baddest bitch and if Pac's alive
Nigga, I'm in a aqua five with a button
That make the roof flip back like pocket knives

I can't knock ya drive, you feelin' like Rocky
Till you get a beatin' like he got in Rocky 5
The squad'll still hold toast and get these bitches
To open they legs wider than a field goal post

Broke niggas don't wanna stand my grind so they knock it
Think my jeans got Mickey D's signs on my pockets
The hydro combined with the chocolate have ya eyes
Lookin' like the tall dude who signed with the Rockets

The flow is so sick, sooner or later
These niggas gonna need barf bags bigger than golf bags
The coke get flew on planes monthly and cops search me
For weapons harder than they do in Hussein country

And any chick that get a view of the chain wit me
I guess that's what Jay meant by chain reactions
Bitch, it's nothin' to thumb off some notes
Fuck a dealer, I get 'em when they come off the boat, fucka

Yeah, ghetto, Fab, nigga, uh, uh, Street Family
Uh, pay attention, y'all, please, uh, yeah
You could love Fab, hate Fab, I don't care
Send ya clothes with the check or I don't wear

Fabolous,"Uh, you think I give a fuck about
What these niggas say man
They even talked about Jesus

I ain't mad at when it rain, 'cause I know the sun is somewhere shinin'
Sorta like some clear diamonds
I hardly see my moms, but she know her son is somewhere grindin'
Some where rhymin', or somewhere climbin'

Out of a pottable 760, inclasable very sticky
Wit a handgun, to send these cowards to Heaven quickly
I ain't pussy, so I won't allow you to ever dick me
I know these grease balls, wonder how could they ever stick me

But I move, like the President through town
Wit stones the size of earrings, in my Presidential crown
I put hollows from the Desert into clowns, 'cause the cometary
Is where most of the dudes, that are hesitant are found

So I take the time, of whatever the bench throws
The 4BM put down, in a seventy-two inch hole
Mean while getting adapted, to the fame has be hectic
But I'm fucking like I'm tryna take down Chamberlain's record

And the girls more than like you, when you running around
Doing world tours like Michael, but girl's sure don't like you
You going on like thirty-six, flowin' on some berry mix
The little money you get, you blowing on them dirty chicks

Tryna look young, so you throwing on the jersey quick
I'm on my second V-12, you going on ya thirty-six
You can look at this rider, and see I'm on the come-up
'Cause I pass the hitch-hikers, like I don't see 'em with they thumb up

I just turn the system up and keep boppin'
I never get, where I'm tryna go, if a nigga keep stoppin'
And I tell the cops, this joint is for protection
Don't they see when I come through

How these people point in my direction
That's why I poke out my jeans
Like my joint with a erection
Till I'm in a joint made for correction
And right now, the way rapper bi'ness spread
It wouldn't even surprise me
If one of these rappers is a Fed, nigga

Since I'm in the position to get rich, I'ma get it
Whether it come from rapping on blocks, flippin' and pitchin'
And fuck the stove, and the kitchen where I cook and prepare it
Nigga you know and don't try to act like the truth ain't apparent

I'm on a mission to get richer, it's as simple as that
I make it obvious, when I pick up a pencil and rap
Like a .40 Cal, spittin' on instrumentals I clap
And these verses, are like the hollow point I sent through yo back

I get you murdered if I think you a rat
'Cause if you don't show loyalty
Then that show me where ya principles at
And you don't know how much I been through, in fact

I never did like you, I ain't even gon' pretend wit you cats
And I'm the nicest, I ain't gotta say it twice and repeat it
I'm a lyrical genius, I never been beated, defeated
I'ma draw my weapon and squeeze it, you better believe it

Leave you parapaligic, I demand respect and I mean it
My Desert's the meanest, you probably dead if you seen it
Or spored out somewhere sick, you get red on the cement
And I blow off ya head for no reason and just when I'm leavin'
You don't know me ya owe me homie
But the spread make us even, blow

And the bad part about it is man
I'm only twenty years old man
And I'm just havin' fun
Man I ain't even tryin' man

Desert Storm's youngest and in charge man
Paul Cain, man
Yo Fab man, you ain't even gotta go hard man

And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put to on a show to get patience
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect ya gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the starting lineup ain't playing right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like I'm gassing ya
But it took time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creeping and sneaking
Just to keep it from leaking
We so deep in our freaking
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey
A little bit uptight
Wondering why he coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be alright

I really want to be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go
Your the one I want in my life (want in my life)
Already got a wife (got a wife)
Can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go

You ain't ever step out of line
Or get out a pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you telling the whole world I'm your new Allen Springer
At first you were something I denied
Something I would slide
Just do something in the ride
But shorty
There's something that you provide
Cause the entree ain't as good without something on the side

Fabolous,"You know what?
Everybody goes through some changes in life
Some people change for the better, some poeple change for the worse
But umm, some people need to make that change
You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes. You know?

Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold
They say I'm different 'cause I ride in a plat. Rolls
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole
And I ain't givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold
No pride, I ain't that old
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ??
It probably don't seem like a struggle
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?

[Chorus:]
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you

[Verse 2]
Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth
I'm speakin' the known truth
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites
I ain't blind from the limelite,
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler
One million customers, and I still bust at ya

[Chorus]

Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks
Known a few ?? and met a few locs
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then
Some have even became rivals instead of friends
Only two become liable for settlements
I grew up watchin the
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in
They know the family bring knives and barettas in
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd
How could my head be in the clouds?
It's strange, what the fame'll do
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you

[Chorus]

I'm the same nigga man
Same nigga, that ridin' with you

I'm still fuckin' with you niggas

Damn, it's the wife beater wish you were in the drop top two seater
Damn, I can't blame em' if he wasn't mine shit I would try and claim him,
Cause he's so fly and I'm so fly and you'll fool
Yourself if you try to deny him

I'm nothin' like them other brothers
I got no choice but to slut her
Cause I'm in a 10-6 with the vase up that look somethin' like a nutta butta dutta dutta
Mami you'll be in saint tropez
Ridin' jet skis and mopeds
Powderin' like dope heads
Paparazzi snappin' pictures they must think you J.Lopez (Bitch)
(ha-ha) lets roast some spinach
Find a club and just post up in it
What you mean are we there yet, I got Lear jets that get to the west coast in minutes
(ha-ha) I'm smoother than white vanilla fudge
With white vanilla studs
Cause if they witnessed how I'm killin' em out here these girls just might go tell the judge (i rest my case)

[Chorus]

You could be prancin' through ghettos
In a pair of fendi's or pants and stilettos
All you gotta do is swallow some kids like that witch did in Hansel and Gretel
Who's as handsome as ghetto
This mans earrings look transparent
And my Mitchell and Ness throwbacks be so old they could be somebody's grandparents
I want the kind of money athletes consume
I have to assume
I'm no fool, but I'm so cool, when I walk in feels like there's a draft in the room
(oh) I'm so sick I drive in reverse fast
Call me a nurse fast
Shorty just lay back in the Maybach it'll make you feel like you sittin' in first class
(Relax)

[Chorus]

They ask for it
So I put TV's in the headrest and the dashboard
And you gotta catch it on tape 
Cause when the truck stops rims still look like they on fast forward
I'm sippin' liquor the color of smurf's skin
As long as the earth spins
And you'll get sea sick,
Cause my waves be thick enough for them cali dudes to surf in
(cowabunga) ya low ridin' denims
Look like midgets is hidin' in em
They say I like it from the front 
They like it from the back but when the kid is slidin' in 'm
They be screamin'
The biggest dikes be
Switchin' for dudes with figures like me
And um I'm not braggin', 
But imagine that you could even fuck with a nigga like me

I carry pumps like I serve gasoline to these scrubs
Have you seen my Aston leaning on dubs
And they can't afford chrome so they putting Vaseline on they hubs
I'm looking for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub
Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub
These niggas hate I'm moving so much cash and cream in the club
And don't pass my green on my bub
But I'm a fly niggag that don't do much to pull her and dick her
Everyday I'm popping a tab and pulling a sticker
Everyday I'm switching the tags and pulling up sicker
Every ""K"" I'm loading the mags with bullets to flicker
And I ain't hesitating homie I'm pulling it quicker
So you can act tough After a few pulls on some liquor
Got em pullin on niggas
And they won't be goin nowhere for a while
They might as well pull out a snicker Ye-Ye-Yea

Forgive me father for I have sinned
But look at all this money that I spend
And look at all this jewelry that I'm in
And look at all the places that I've been
And look at all the women in those brims
Look at the blue flames that I'm in
I look at all the bullshit that there's been
And if I had another chance I'd do it again

Anywhere the kid move you know the hammers'll be with me
Poking out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty
I went on tour brought the samples of D wit me
Came back a month later bought a Lambo for three-fifty
Think I throw you grams if you read with me
Just because you see me on the camera with P. Diddy
Dammit we P-driddy? Now I got G with me
Along with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties
I keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam
But with the soap its gonna blam
The info put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham
That's why I'm watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam
Dope and hunn-ed (hundred) grams rope and hunn-ed grams
At the same time our artist get to open Summer Jam
Hope you understand or use better sense

With a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier
What I'm smokin'll have you aggie as your last supplier

Getting stressed by these hotties is regular
I got a magazine to press to your body like editors
Test me somebody I'm begging ya
I got the Gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator
I'm a hustler I don't sling no rocks to the fiends now
Got dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds
Any other dude who dish rocks want beef
Cause I chop jobs bigger than Chris Rock front teef
I'm the nigga tearing the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup 
Of the Cris
And while you at probation filling a small cup full of piss

And you can see how clear the Pile Vase, and the Canaries be now
The top on the 5 series be down
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now
Although there was a time I would barely see fowls
But I'm gettin' a multi-million dollar yearly fee now
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds

My Teflons will have you screaming like Wyclef Jean (someone please call 9-1-1)
But if they ever get the watch on my left arm
I'ma have more bury than that guy Stephon
First they put that white seed over you brother
Then the newspapers put you all over the cover
Then you in a suit one hand cross over the other
Next you in the earth with the dirt over you brother
A tinted hearse is what most men leave in
Followed by a limo full of family and close friends greaving
When you pull the marijuana
I'ma want to kill you as bad as The Terminator wanted Sarah Connor
But I'm loosing my patience
Fuck it send me to the island I could use a vacation
Now it's easy for me to understand
How you could just kill a man

[Chorus]

I'd rather be judged by twelve
Than carried by the six
My gun ain't on my man, or carried by my chicks
My gun ain't in my crib or carried in the six
If I'm right here nigga, then this right here nigga
Picture me putting my hearse
Like I ain't gotta a clip full a hollow tips to put in these jerks
I might as well put in the work
Spit em up outta here and get em up outta here
I got the juice like bishop had wit him
That just don't give a fuck, semi
Like ol' dog had wit him
I'm saying prayers for my enemy
I hope god bless him before the fucker run into me
I dunno, what the fuck has got into me
But I know I don't want them slugs going into me
I'm just trying to live my life
So niggas better give me my respect or give me life

[Chorus]

Look what you made me do man
Look what you made me do man
I didn't want it to come to the right
But fuck it,
Niggas will push you to that point man
Niggas will play with you so much man
Aggravate you so much man
That you want to kill a nigga man

And a ""Fuck you, pay me"" attitude

So run when you hear, that gun noise! (Blat!)

The private jet ski's sick
The motors on the jet ski's quick
The clips in the sets be thick
And I done slipped more shots in then Gretzky's stick
I'm the one like Penny Hardaway's number
That's why dudes say it's hard to keep my broad away from ya
Once your bitch, get the god 2-way number
It'll be hard to get a Happy Father's Day from ya

Ain't no tellin' what this hip lowered do to me
I'm feelin' like I can do what I want now
Dip-low immunity
Shorty! just shake your hips slow and move wit me
Take a hit a this and sip slow and thoroughly
You're sneakin' out on your man, tip-toein' to the V
Cause I know you got him whipped though like wannabe
Let's put on a live strip show just you and me
But girl, I'm lookin' at them lips though like who is he?
They ain't never seen a whip, clothes or jewelry
So when I ask ""you want to leave the zip-code?""
Say ""sure"" and be me

[Chorus 1: Fabolous]
But this is my party
Stroll by if you want to
Or y'all can stay home
But why would you want to?

[Fabolous]
We gon' party, till we laid in graves
Sweat out our doobie braids and waves
Then scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""
That groupie made her wait
Cause when she seen the whips and chains
She started talking 'bout she ready to be made a slave, c'mon

[Chorus 2: x2]
This is my party
So get fly if you want to
Get high if you want to cause I know you want to
Put your hands up as high as you want to
And if it feels good scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""

[Fabolous] 
I don't know about y'all
But we doin' it over here
All the glasses got liquid that brewin' it over here
Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here
Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here
I can fit a few in a Rover's rear
We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this
You see why we asks is to see ID
Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access
Me I relax this (easy)
Cause I'm used to ballin'
You could tell that these guys need practice
But if it was a problem then I would confront you
You saying ""over"" bet ya I say ""you want to""
But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put
I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook
Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books

[Chorus 2] 

[Fabolous]
Oh yea! We's off the Richter Scale
Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell
For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well
And everybody, up north that's sick in jail
I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail
The Street Family speed off six SL's
To all them chicks at Yale ""hey-hey-hey-hey yo""
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell
And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view
Girl I know that these guys say they want you
If I wake up in the sand, clothes from yesterday
Same hoes from yesterday 
Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday
Her hang-overs yesterday
You ain't mistaken we in Benz's today
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday

I stay way ahead of the game
Ya know, catch me if you can nigga

Throwback this, throwback that
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at
I rock the reds pete rose when I'm in the 'natti
And [repeat: x4]
You cant see the semi-automatti
When I'm in the chi' you think they ain't that shocked
To see the kid roll through in the st. pats socks
So pull out the Chicago and the script to wear on soul train
The bulls, when mike had hair and a gold chain
I get the spirit in St. Louis, how could the god lose
I do back flips in the ozzie cardinals
They love me in Cleveland, every time I travel there
I'm in the Indians or that cavaliers
When I hit Minnesota, that kid from brooklyn wear
The vikings or the Timberwolves from Garnett's rookie year
And in Milwaukee I had to pimp it and go back
20 years with the bucks and brewers throw backs

[Chorus:]
Throwback this, throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at

I might charge through San Diego with the bolts on my shoulder
Rock the trailblazer warm-up, cause Portland gets colder
And even the pimps be jealous
When I'm in the floor seat at the forum in the m.p.l.s.
And they be askin' what teams on the kid chest
This the rams before they moved to the midwest
When I'm in the bay with it, I don't play with it
I'm in the athletics with the matchin' A's fitted
This ain't even for the minors
Cause they don't know nothin' bout the Joe Montana, 49ers
Seattle, probably heard different rumors
Either about the Payton or the Griffey Jr.
I come through Denver like 4th quarter with Elway
Or the nuggets that make them yell 
In phoenix I do the old suns
Cause the new jerseys is cool, but nothings really like the old ones
Ya know

[Chorus]

In new york what I wear the the club may vary
Mets or Yankees like the subway series
When I'm in Boston I melt the bean
In a hot red Soxs or Celtics green
In the city of Philly, I roll up on the biddes like feel these
In a size 56 Phillies
In jersey I got the nets on
That you can bet on
In d.c. I couldn't pull it
Without the bullets
When I stop in Atlanta I cant talk long
Them birds know I got the falcons or the hawks on
That peach Tampa bay don't hit the streets too often
Not even Miami could take the heat of dolphins
Ain't no complaints on
When I'm in New Orleans with the saints on
In Houston I pass hoes
In the Astros
In Dallas I always gotta have
The cowboys or the mavs
? to keep it coming, and I'ma keep it coming

I wanna take you where it feel like June in December, too
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter through

But young enough to not give a fuck

D-d-d-d-dammit man,
I'm in a throwback so old,
It'll make your grandma glance,
And everybody know, everybody go,
So please, call the stretch ambulance,
These dudes don't stand a chance,
When I pull up like the pamper brand,
Those in the Lambo slants,
With a madame from France,
With a ass so big,
You couldn't hide it in hammer pants,
Who else be in New York,
With Miami tans,
Got everybody doin' the street family dance,
I'm sure this hammer can,
Make you save that gangsta role for the camera man,
F-A-B, you preferably,
Don't wanna F wit me,
Please believe it,
I'm definitely, as responsible,
For gettin' the City High as 'Clef would be,
Believe it please

[Chorus]

I'm introduced to your women friends,
'Cause I buy double deuces to rent a Benz,
Like they boots made by Timbaland,
I have to remind, since I got drafted and signed,
Y'all playa's get used to the scrimagin'
Not one of the Jesus's got lemon gems?
Y'all lips get loose like y'all feminine,
I prove letting loose but the semi can boost my adrenaline,
You never had no use with that lem again,
Half my roots is Dominican,
Faboloso mi gusto Le bengamins,
This dude got the juice of a pimp in him,
Turn to stones like Medusa got a glimpse of them,
But right now you can lie and gossip too,
And later be the guy the dude spoke to,
And right now you can try to prosecute,
But later in you goin' die in the hospital

[Chorus]",Not Give a Fuck,2003
Fabolous,"And already, platinum posters and plaques
I don't write, I speak what I feel
And pop off po's dog, I don't need a reason to kill
I'm like two weeks from a deal, like two G's from a mil
Right hand, few feet from the steel

They wonder how I flow so strong
'Cause I live what I spit, my smallest hammer is a four four long
I spit pain rap, when Cain clap, duck for cover
Hot hanger, torch ya girl, and pluck ya mother

Always ready to clash wit Titans
And the princesses is in my watch, look like a flash of lightning
Same box, I got for the gun, you stash ya ice in
Make niggas sell they soul and cash they life in

In a strawberry Range, pie crust piping on the cheesecake seats
I'm known for hittin' women's soft spots 
With Princess cut Canaries the size of lemon cough drops

I'm right behind 'em in the Porsche drop
Linen soft top, sick chain with 20 point rocks
Take your bitch, why wouldn't I?
The whip got chrome shoes, cream leather seats with old wooden sides

Why wouldn't I pull up to the spot, yellow is all (ok)
Dressed in yellow linen, covered in Canaries never a flaw (uh huh)
Why shouldn't I wear this much ice
The Princesses in my hair, are clear and cut, right?
Why wouldn't I talk this slick (why not?)
With a watch and bracelet this flooded, and a cross this sick?
So why wouldn't I get it homes (I mean)
To a nigga gettin' money like myself, a little brain that's minimal (yeah)
Might talk but I live it though, sick chain glitter roll
Never sleep and don't stop gettin' that

[Fabolous]
Uh, hold up Cain, uh, why wouldn't I have samples of raw (uh huh)
And academic sample the laws (uh huh)
Hypnotic samples the poor (woo)
The European sample is all (yeah)
Will on the right side do with the wings stamped on the door
It's the street family boss, I land by the shores
Get pampered by whores, eat scampy and claws
The kid's been trampeled before by a tramp with no flaws 
That's up to they get cramps in they jaws
I keep kefs jammed in the four

You better breathe!

You niggas can't share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And I'm getting better year by year

Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through
And I pace myself
I know these money hungry bitches want to taste my wealth
But I keep em' on a diet
Embrace they health
Or either keep em' on a quiet
And space myself
And just take a deep breath
I got em' grabbin' they chest
'Cause it's hurtin' em' to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
They rather see me lay in the hearse than lay in the back
And I ain't just laying a verse
I'm saying the facts

Like havin' a asthma attack

That's the reason they signed me
It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut

When I saw you, and I stood by
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet
But only one thing could keep me off the street
And that's if you be my, be	-A-be	-why
I can be why you always be fly
And I'm from be	-Stuy, just like B.I...G. was, that's how F-A-be	 does
We can sip something 'til we both be buzzed
In a V-dub and that's only be-cause

[Chorus: Mike Shorey]
Need someone to be my (baby)
Kind of girl you find in the club rockin those (baby) Phat jeans
Gonna find someone to be my (baby)
..I see some ladies tonight that should be having my (baby, baby)

[Verse 2: Fab]
After the baby talk, the goo goo ga ga
You like this, that, you do bla bla
Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's, it's time to do you mama
First I'ma put you on your back
And make you scream out (baby)..just like I put you on the track

Then I'ma lay you on your side
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side
You know you get the keys any day you want to ride
And my baby know how to start me up
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills
I ask you 'cause I know you gonna gimme it real
It won't be fake, and don't we make a good couple
And won't we make a good...(baby)?

[Bridge: Mike Shorey]
Ooh, if I seem just a bit taken, pardon me
But you're so amazing
I just want us to do this exclusively
Say you'll be my baby

[Verse 3: Fab]
My baby's the only one I bring to the villa
That can get the bling and the scrilla
Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla
And still take a sting of Tequila, the way you swing is a thriller
I'm watchin that like the boxing match in the ring of Manila
I want to keep it comin like the singles of ""Thriller""
I mean if you still uh..my be	-A-be	-why

'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggas laid out, til my niggas lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me

[Fabolous]
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines
Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines
But at the same time we was on some different shit
'cause you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit
I told you sniff a bit and you could get a whif of it
But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes
And I'm your nigga so I tried to smell em wrong for ya
Wasn't there to take the fault for ya, But if you hear me
I dedicate this song for ya, He was setup in a stick up
By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side
I used to help him chop a brick up, They found him in his pickup
Pants down and dick up, leaning with one in his head
And one in his chest, One of the best at this husslin' shit
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
I remember selling three bricks of raw powder
Turn my man into a star in 24 hours
He didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours
On a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower
And a chain that had christ on it, a rollie with a lot of Ice on it
A pinky ring with a price on it, when he come around
Its likely that he blunted
With a pretty lady in them Nike's that you wanted
It's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone
If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone
He used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back
And now I'm black I wouldn't put it past him
The D's would Harass him, til he finally blacked out
They told my nigga to freeze, but he still backed out
Shots fired 'til his trigger finger got tired
All the newspapers said was 'Another Nigga Dead'
And it's fucked up

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
You can catch me in a cherry red 8-50 nice ass
Great titties, face pretty everybody know that she date smitty
A big time dealer that's doing a state biddin
Who did more than his share of dirt in the world
Enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl
So he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle
Away from the hassle to the day that he pass through
There's some enemies he might have who may want to blast you
She stayed for a few years, that's until a few pairs
Convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's
It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile
And she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial
Who started going on about how he moving on
About running with them same niggas Smitty had warned about
She slid off told her girl, she had to drop her kid off
They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off
And it's fucked up

I feel like the angel of God
All I gotta do is drive the Range through and nod
It's like I was put here to put layers in the air
Put squares in my ear, put squares in the chair
Put pairs in the rear
I even put 20 inch footwear in my spare
Lord knows I gotta stay on them spinners
Dis verse is like grace that you say on your dinners
Girls come wit me knowin that they gonna be sinners
But, I'ma sense of relief
And I ain't never been a trick kinda like its against my belief
If she got it from me then I'm convinced she a thief
But they say God giveth and He taketh away
And I can do the same thing when I shake with the 'K
If a nigga make a mistake wit the pay, Goddamit
At the club I get right in
So if heaven got a ghetto I should fit right in
God loves me

Are you a big ho, or a little ho? (Lil' teenie weenie)

You make the wrong moves when you come and you try for it

I'm spittin the gospel
I hit my apostle's wit the coke that'll heal a sick
soon as it get in they nostrils
A Dros Trios, bring the organs on ya
A 40-Caliber'll turn ya to a organ donor
And a day or two, you'll be a morgue aroma
While I go city to city fillin the pieu's up
I ask God to forgive me while I'm fillin the Uz' up
Demons won't let me see a man fillin my shoes up
I ease 'em wit a sermon, but that ain't hard
When I'm in the Beamer before they released 'em to the Germans
You prolly got the man you love wit you
But wouldn't you rather have the Man above wit you?
Can I get an Amen

Now some of ya'll are pimps, And some of ya'll are hoes
But the rest.. the rest of ya'll.. don't think I don't know
Ya just a hater.. They hate what you got
They put a black eye on on the game whenever they play
They piss in the pool, And they fart on the elevator
Then look you in the face, Like they think you did it
They hate change (They hate change)
And they hate progress
They hate me and they hate you
They hate they own momma
'cause they think its her fault that they ain't got shit
But I'm here to tell ya today
That if you a hater
Then you are the outter take or your own business (Amen)

How they take niggas dreams and write then off in their taxes

So holla at somebody real (cause i)
'cause I'm so real

[Fabolous]
(real love) I'm searching for a real love like j blige in 92
but I pray I will find you
And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you
The fake may try to blind you
That's why I stay fly like I do
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to
First I need a girl that may die as my boo
Then I may try the I do's
But, I refuse to be trick
Or used by a chick 
Who gets amusement of kicks
Out of abusing my dick
When its real I'm all in it
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it
(no) before it didn't matter who
Now I look for some with a little attitude
I could chitter chatter to, good looking
But witty and compatible
Long hair wit a fatty too
And that'll do

[Chorus:]

[Lil Mo]
No I'm not trying to pressure you 
But my loves to incredible
For to waste
In front of your face
Then I give you something you can feel 
To let you know your hollering at somebody real

[Fabolous]
I need to holla at somebody real could that be you
The feelings that I feel could that be true
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away
That's til somebody real sways my way
Then I might spend some days always
On a Asia bay
Eating food made the Cajun way
And sippin ga lil saki
Blowing a lil brocoli
But this world is full of fluzi's
And bullshit usually
I pull I'm choosy
And on this joint and at this point
I know I need to holla at somebody real
For real

When you grow up in my hood
Help don't show up in my hood
Gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in..my..hood
Feel like I'm trapped in my hood
Young kids get clapped in my hood
That's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in..my..hood
In..my..hood, in my hood, in my hood

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I'm always close to..
Feeling like a corner stander, stoop sitter, or hallway post-er
No matter where I go it's always 'posed to, feel just like I'm (in my hood)
Cops drive in it every 5 minutes, look at your faces, pat your waists'
Try to find the stash where the gats and base is, I can't say that they racist
But I know.. it ain't the same in they town
And as fucked up as it may sound (in my hood)
It's 2 ways to make it happen off the streets
Balling on the courts or rapping off the beats
You hear the shells tappin' off the 'crete, when they clappin' off the heat
Then the yellow tape's trappin off the street
But that's the way we was raised
Preying to God, hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays

[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Fabolous]
They drink 'til the cups dry, eat 'til the plate's clean
Niggaz be in state greens 'fore they turn 18
'Round here you never let the beef slide twice
Everybody raised on 4 wings and beef fried rice
Them mothers are getting younger today
Got one by the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way
We don't have role models
But we got them handguns that hold hollows (in my hood)
Ain't no diplomas or degrees
But you can get high from the aroma of the trees (in my hood)
I know it like navigation, and fuck having patience
I'ma get mine, you better get yours, 'cause everyday is a struggle
And One-Time ride through everyday just to bug you
That's how it is, 'cause your rights be wrong
And everybody got a white T on, when you're in..my..hood

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Fab]
We try to make the most of what we got
You either been hit, or been close to gettin shot (in my hood)
Any nigga that boast be getting got
And dopeheads fiend to get a dose of what we got
And young niggaz be like they slow
But you give them a blunt..bet they roll the weed like a pro
If you trick it's not a problem it gets you laid
But if you stick without a condom, it gets you AIDS
No Sesame Street, kids watch BET
Look up to niggaz that don't got a GED
I know a dude with the deadbeat tag
Kids don't got diapers but he ridin' in the red G-Wag'
In the hood, you and your beef is sure to bump heads
And everybody grew up sleepin on bunk beds
They telling me to vote..and I would
If it made a change in my hood..mu'fucka.

You're the kinda girl that has a little bit more fun

Cause' I never seen a ass so big with a waist as little as yours hun
And by the expressions on them hotties grills
I know they want to holla at somebody real
And I'm usually lookin' for somebody skilled
Enough to make a nigga say aye aye aye yo niggas get mad 'cause I may slay they hoe
But I don't want to let the a.k. spray so

Come through let we kick it 'til a morning light
If you want to roll with tha thugs tonight
Well its alright, baby its alright

I want you give me some of it because minute by minute
Temperature it all a rise because you thighs and all you hips, style
You shockin' it, you a rock it, you a kill it
And a one thing the Dutty Paul want to predict
Say by tha end of tha night you will be chillen' with tha click
Flossin' it, money we tossin' it

(Alright there ah buddy license and registration
Uh officer is there a problem man what's going on?
(Yeah, I had a report of a UFO
What's that?
(An unidentified Ferrari looking object flying by me on the highway
You know how fast you were going?)
Nah not at all man
(you must have been going pretty damn fast because my radar is over there smoking buddy
Keep your hands where I can fucking see 'em too
I heard about you in the paper, I know you got the toaster strudel 
Yeah I need some backup over here I've got two rap singers)

[Fabolous]
I wonder briefly
Could it be there's no roof above me
Or the 22's underneath me
That's keeping them sirens flashing on my ass
Should I get to pumping the brakes or mashing on the gas?
I'm naturally harassed
And I feel like I'm getting punked, but I don't see Ashton in the grass
Nor is there a camera stashed into the dash
It's a guy in a uniform and a passion that he has
For flashing wit his badge
And shining light in my face
Plus he keep his right hand right by his waist
The wrong move will get a gun right in my face
And they fighting for my life, I'm fighting the case
And I ain't trying to be the story they twist in the press
Like: the young man resisted arrest
Then he started reaching for something that looks like a pistol I guess
So I pulled on a nigga I mean I pulled on the trigger...figures

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I go around the corner what do I see?
Po Po's following me
Asking for my ID who's car I'm driving
Po Po's bothering me
Got me in a lineup, got my hands in cuffs
They don't want to set me free
Trying to bring me down, when they come around
Po Po's fucking with me

[Cain]
Awe shit the jakes are fucking with me again
They hate to see me rich, they'd rather see me stuck in the pen
Every time they walk or pull up beside me
Flash lights in my face asking for my registration and ID
I don't know the reason for the harassment
And the questions they asking
Or the ice grills they get when I'm passing
Or maybe its my fault
Cause I be out all times at night
Doing shit I know I shouldn't plus I don't be ridin right
Smokin' lye, no stash box for me to put the skit
Two warrants, no license and I ain't got insurance yet
I keep a hammer close because foes want to stick me up
But keep my movement swift because Po's want to frisk me up
Since '94 I've been told on by 50 descriptions
And in 10 years not once did they get a conviction
These pigs shouldn't provoke a rider
I'm so tired, they got one more time to fuck wit me before I open fire

[Nate Dogg]
Ones for the money and twos for the show
Three must be for the motherfucking po po'

Cause they can't see ask

Before I'm in the back with my knee bent
On my way back to the precinct
I'm back in the G-bent

Vanilla aroma to cover the back with the tree scent
The way I ride I know I'm in for a case
But the coupe do 200 so they in for a chase
When it comes to lawyers I got the man Puff uses
That's why you never seen my wrists with handcuff bruises
I got them hollow tips, to stick up in the are's
Detectors in the dash, to pick up on the radar
Stash box in it when I purchased the vehicle
So I don't have a problem wit you searching the vehicle
They probably want to scoop an arrest
I try to throw shots but its cool, I got a coupe like a vest
And 'em troopers will just feel stupid I guess
The slugs will bounce off like they hitting superman's chest, nigga

Shit man a nigga ain't even do shit awe shit here comes this dude right now

Look I don't be meaning to stunt, but I zip down like jeans in the front
In somethin' that you seen and you want
But otherwise I'm cool wit' it
They say only the ones who never had gon' get and act a fool wit' it
Everybody's gangsta through the promotion
Even if they raised in a house wit' a view of the ocean
The bangers is growin' upset
'cause' ya' ass is on t.v. throwin' up sets
And you know you ain't like that
But you'll say that you is
Go and rent a bunch a shit and and then say that its his

Ain't a baller 'cause' you wouldn't put spinners on hoopties

And the home look like the spot on the other side of the see's
When they ain't never been on the other side of the p's
I ca' see through em', ya tents are too light
Every sentence you write is far from the truth
You want to be that nigga you are in the booth
But you ain't got the heart, the scars, or the proof
And now you flash ya' shirt tag in our grill
But I'm hearin' you was a dirtbag before the deal
You walk around talkin' how every dime sucked
When they don't even speak to you, nevermind fucked you
Ya' hood sayin' don't come back
Step foot in here, and they gon' put you where you won't come back

You livin' in a closet and call it a condo

Just a little scrub ass ringer in the tournaments

Refuse to choose the, use the loser
Don't let the hydro moves confuse ya
And pass on a stunner to go wit a fronter
If you wanna do the kick it then go wit a punter

[Chorus]

[Verse - Fabolous]
You see the white's so bright it's hard to be polite
The yellow's so mellow I have to act ghetto
Hello, my name is - fuck that! I'm famous
Y'all ain't the same as, F-a to the B
I don't know what it be, baby girl could it be
You ain't see how good it be rolling wit me?
Like - get me on or get me gone
It's at least 22's that they sit me on
I'm in the Ice Cream shoes, nice gleam too
Crack the button up so the ice beam through
You could wake up wit regrets, or wake up in a jet
Fixing you hairdo in a Jacob wit baguettes girl

I'm wavin' the blade, I'm tellin' you back up
You empty your pockets, I'm pickin' your pack up
You can act stupid if you wanna

I'm out in New York or down in the south
I'm out in the trap with gold in my mouth

And two pussies they with, just make it a threesome

Matic spray magazines before they could read one

I birthed you niggas, I fed and I burped you niggas
Quick as that, I will earth you niggas
Clothed you niggas, wiped the snot from the nose of you niggas
Want not to expose you niggas, fist knife or razor fight
I got a year and a day, still played it like they gave me life
Can't walk through the jail without shackles and two cops
Throwin' shit on the warden outta the food slop
Got connects with pop, he boofin' the weed plants
Get my khakis washed, I'm pressed for the food stamps

Third gear I got lost to the million dollar law
J.G. with a fleet of bitches take your tops off
I'm a seven-figure nigga, paid the cost to be the boss
On the streets or behind the wall
Lift weights, get straight, 'til it's time to ball
Even if I never sell a million times at all
Dope boy trap niggas, I'll grind for y'all

With the light turned down and the beat down low

[Verse One: Fabolous]
Ma you better off coming with a Anna Nicole plan, tryna get ya hand on a old man
Maybe he's plannin' to romance, hand you a gold band and spend a couple grand on a po dance
...When it comes to splurgin chips, I'm tighter than virgin lips
If there's some who like to trick, who like a chick
And +come out the pocket like Michael Vick+
Or some who want a patient man
....or go with a payment plan
...wanna go to department stores
Then they want the keys to your apartment door
Nowadays a girl'll come with a price tag
And give it up for nice shoes and a nice bag
+they must have bumped their head, give them an ice bag+
And I ain't thirst, but show em.....

[Chorus: Fabolous]
All I got is hard dick and bubble gum
And guess what, I'm fresh out of bubble gum
But I happen to have a whole lotta dick and a whole lotta chicks
Who wanna get sum
Hurry up if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some

[Verse Two: Fabolous]
Now a chick who gold dig, look for a nigga who roll big
Rather than a nigga who hold gigs
Unless you bring her what you bringin home
Keep her finger with the bling and chrome
She try ta cling on everything you own
Even singin on them ringin tones
I rather be single and swing alone
+before you do me like ginger did sam+
+they catch you if they can like the ginger bread man+
But I know it's all about the benjamins mam
And maybe another man responds to you
At the most I could get you in the ???
Cause I'm not interested in buyin a chick
But you can call me about tryin ta dick
1-800-GIT-SUM....

All I got is hard dick and bubble gum

Come on, can I have this dance
Something as groovy as this, we got to dance

Am I holding you too tight'
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, excuse me
Ain't gonna get too close

When are you going to tell me your name'

(I wanna know your name)
I could love you, I could love you, I could love you
All night long, all night long, all night long

Listen, what about giving your phone number
And I call you one Saturday afternoon
Perhaps we can go in town, have a little bite to eat
And then maybe, go and take a movie

And afterwards, I'll just drop you at the, at the doorstep
And give you little kiss
Oh, I just, there's so many things
That we could do if you just tell me your name
I am not even married, are you married'

young money on the flo'

I roll through the block and the roof be low and the 22's couldnt be cleaner
they start yellin' out F-A-B-O
its the young boy with Syleena
they lookin with a flash light
in the daytime coz the cash right and the words may rhyme
some say i'm
the real talk of the city of New York
its the Diddy in the walk and the smooth in my style groove with a smile 'till they prove in the trail
that i move with the cow 40 that is shorty is his when she see's how icy the automo' is the game is
hypnotic summin' like the blue drink you see me on the hood frontin' with the blue mink stuntin' with the
new link ya like how

(You're my medicine) Oh, you take the pain away

If it feels good don't even fight it man
You know?
Yeah man
Real Talk Of New York

Its all eyes on me like Mr. Shakur
So they wanna (pause) the door
Chicks come around and put kisses on the jaw
So I ain't a player that need assistance to score
Any misses you saw
Climb on the couch kicked off the Christian Dior
I done popped 'till I sweat a Christ in a pore
But I do it again if you missed it before
Its no big deal
I'm so big wheel
In them little cars with those big wheels
With a little box full of those big steels
Pretty little chicks in those big heels
For me it never gets old
Most girls is diggers who ain't goin' never hit gold
I get under the sun when the weather get cold
8 ball five when the seven gets old

Hey hey stop that mama
Can't you see that I'm a East Coast stunna
Hey hey you must misunder-stand
I don't spend all to bend that over
Hey hey
Why you lookin' like that for?
I'm done you can run no need for conversation
Hey hey hey hey
No need for conversation

Now see you the type ta
Get too hyper
Maybe cause your chick like me
But I'm a black card swiper
That just pipe her
And you don't give a like me
They say I'm the sickest since Carter dropped
So girls jump to it with Vince Carters hops
Its the truck with the twenty inch startin' stops
That have 'em not knowin'
Whether they stayin' or goin'
They stare at the Airs and be sayin' it glowin'
And they like my style and the way I be flowin'
But that's when I bud in and say that I'm blowin'
Now you could make the choice if you stayin' or goin'
Girl
We could go any place in the world
And the jet hold twelve so theres space for ya girls
Nobody in the street gonna hear
That you givin' forty thousand feet in the air

Hey hey stop that mama
Can't you see that I'm a East Coast stunna
Hey hey you must misunder-stand
I don't spend all to bend that over
Hey hey
Why you lookin' like that for?
I'm done you can run no need for conversation
Hey hey hey hey
No need for conversation

Most of these tag a longs
Brag on songs
But can't keep it up like a Baget thong
Keep frontin' like you spend
While ya pockets get lighter and lighter like Michael's skin
On the other hand
I'm the kind of brother man
With fifty thou of ice just up on the hand
Bentley bright and rocky covered band
And a zone that'll tell the time in another land
Girls spread they legs same day I bagged 'em
Its the Mustard Gut, Mayo Magnum
In the twenty twos with the butter knife shine
That's why every body and they mother like mine
I rarely be
Where the willies be
There ain't been a dude this smooth since Billy D
Girl you need to make your move
The ego is what (pause) the Lakers groove

Hey hey stop that mama
Can't you see that I'm a East Coast stunna
Hey hey you must misunder-stand

It's not even funny they can't breathe!
The choke holds too tight

You know what? You right
These bitches can't breathe!
Look look, they hearts racin'
They start chasin'
But I'm so fast when I blow past
That they can't breathe!
In the presence of the man
Your future looks better than ya past if you present with the man
You better breathe!

You niggas can't share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And I'm getting better year by year
Like they say Juan do
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through
And I pace myself
I know these money hungry bitches want to taste my wealth
But I keep em' on a diet
Embrace they health
Or either keep em' on a quiet
And space myself
And just take a deep breath
I got em' grabbin' they chest
'Cause it's hurtin' em' to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
They rather see me lay in the hearse than lay in the back
And I ain't just laying a verse
I'm saying the facts
I came back with some sicker stones
That got these broke niggas looking at me like they chokin' on a chicken bone
Every chick I bone
Can't leave the dick alone
So I know
It's one of them every time I flip my phone

I see em on the block when I passes
Looking like they need oxygen mask-es
I make it hard to breathe!
But I keep the glocks in the stashes
'cause the cops want to lock and harass us
And make it hard to breathe!
They has to react
Like havin' a asthma attack
When they see the plasma in back
You dudes are wheezin' behind me
My flow is like a coupe, breezing at ninety
That's the reason they signed me
It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut
How I address the haters and under estimaters
And ride up on them like they escalators
They shook up and hooked up to respirators
On they last breath talking to investigators
I'm a breath of fresh air

Pop a few corks in it
As quick as a tick in a New York minute
Catch a breath, fore you catch a left
Even worse, catch a Tef
Only way you catch a F
To the A-be, its in the maybe
Rollin with my baby
Gripping on a toy that you won't find in ""KB""
I rhyme slick on ya
I'm a have to put the Heimlich on ya
What you know bout lettin' dimes lick on ya?
While you inhale the weed

And I brought two of my niggaz with me
And we about to shut the industry down
Aiyyo Wheezy let's get it poppin'!

Hit me!
Front that shit this the south side, got a fat dick on your mouth wide
I've come to take outside, nah do it right here
Hop out later owning on everybody's home that you fuckin' with
Wheezy F baby, please say the baby
Riding with your bitch got keys on the lady
Triple gold these four tires on the whip
Young Carter sliding out I'm flyer than the whip
Yeah, higher than an angel, or hotter than the devil
The pot or kettle, uh
The metal let 'em burn like Ursha but worse, uh
If there's any beef I come Ron like Mertz, uh
Word up, eagle street I'm throwing my curve up
We take your ice cream and turn you into sherbert
I got flow I'm like ""Sure"" but, if it's about dough I'm like ""Sure 'nuff""
I'm from the bird bunch, Birdman Jr. you niggaz bird lunch
I see your lips moving but I ain't heard much
You see the wirst moving, it look like pure punch
I hear the playa hating but I don't endorse such
I got the Escalade, guts like the tour bus
I got the styrofoam poured up with syrup
And in the tires little package is gone
Might I spend a good deal with these Firestones
I spit like Myer's bones, born in chromers
For the buyers chromosomes I got summers
I got vicadens, valiums I ain't stopping
Got pot and heroin, ex, oxycontin
And that's how we rocking
How can you hear that bop unless I'm be-bopping
Yeah skip when you hear that click
Cash money nigga I'm that shit
Weezy Baby, ugh!

That's what I'm talking about
Now Fab, spit at these niggaz and let them know why they ain't fuckin' with you

Your goddamn right I'm feeling myself
A chauffeur no sir, I'm wheeling myself
Looking for a chick chilling for self
So I can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
I'm having problems dealing with wealth
But you wouldn't understand it, until you get a million yourself
You niggaz must've got a deal for your health
Your cd is frozen food, it just chills on the shelf
I spend big, at any time I can start splurging
The twin cigs open chests like a heart surgeon
And I'm buttoned up, I'm just a blue collar crook
But I keep a stack thick as few college books
I got a new polished look
And twenty dime bitches, to show y'all niggaz how my two dollars look
The boy's got at least six digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money, is like ten bridges long
I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
I got some good smoke just for puffers
The two grand twenty's make the hustlers suffer
Plus it's fluffer, than a cotton ball
I've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you can't put it past 'em
I got a Dan Marino arm, I'm bout to throw some bullets past 'em
And the niggaz in the hood keep quoting my lines
I don't jump ship I keep floating in mine
Long as I keep toting I'm fine
I'mma have these dick sucking niggaz deep-throating the nine
I jumped in the English ship, Benzed whip
It's Terminator 2 chrome the engines dip
I'm reading scripts no, not the penmanship (no)
The box-office shit (yeah), I box off this bitch (yeah)
Jessica Alba, Kirsten Dunst
And still make a mil' off the first of months
These dudes be the first to front
'Til they family and friends is in limos, they in hearse in front
I'm in the top position, I can make you a proposition
I'm in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
To hell with the patience
I'mma send a nigga down under like Australia vacations

Yeah it is what it is, my niggaz just killed y'all and I'mma close the casket
I'm tryin not to let this industry get the best of me y'all
I work hard in the game, the game's stressing me y'all
All they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
From the hood to Hollywood they respecting me y'all
And even overseas they accepting me y'all
All the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all
I get a lot of dirty money so respect me or fall
But I'm saving all my checks, I'm investing 'em all
They say, what goes up is gon' definitely fall
Even the stars work success, it's my destiny y'all
Look, I cook tracks I got the recipe y'all
You can't name another cat that can mess with me y'all
At the shows all the hoes be molesting me y'all
I got broads crying trying to get next to me y'all
I got broads craving begging to have sex with me y'all
Screaming, ""Cash you don't know how sexy you are!""
And I'm happy I'm alive, God's blessing me y'all
And all the problems that arrive is God testing me y'all
So I pray everyday but I ain't praying too much
Cause I be sinning everyday so I ain't praying enough
And we all could be beat, and I ain't saying I'm tough
But if it's beef I don't speak, I ain't saying ""What's up""
If it's beef when we meet then I'm spaying shit up
Prraat prraat.I ain't saying too much and that's that
Cause that cat you embracing with love
Might clap that gat cause he got hate in his blood
Keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
Cause the folks you call friends can envy the most
Some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
Burn the bridge and don't give a boat, let 'em sink
Sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
But sometimes you gotta give 'em the nine and let 'em stink
You can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
I'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
As soon as your eyes shut, them niggaz will ride up
And the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
And we all gotta die, but I ain't ready to leave
That's why even if it's petty I'll be ready to squeeze
But put a cheddar in cheese, guac-a-moola
I pop the ruger, send that hot shit through ya!
Like booya! That's the sound when the pound busting
Ooh, ah, you'll be laying on the ground suffering
Clowning's nothing to pull out and blast you
I try to only resort to violence if I have to
But man niggaz out here are playing fair
So before the odds are even I'm leaving them laying there
And I ain't even playing believe what I'm saying here
Cause before this shit gets further your click gets murdered
And found in a hole in the grass
For trying to play that thug role I'll stomp a mud hole in your ass
And this Cass, nigga I'm that sick

Fuck a lobby asking for double keys
I got a spot with more rooms than the Double Trees
Who was in the Domincan Republic breeze?

On the Mojitos
I'm soul food, spice was so frito
Being a star player, it is no treat though

Fabolous,"I try to play cool
Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryin' to keep myself from goin' crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}
I want my baby back! {'Lo-so} And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't) {y'all know what this is}

Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin' to scream about just back your Beemer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to Kima house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me

The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'mma slide (yup)
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay

But it's hard for me to let you GO!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't)

Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin' them climb up in my throne

Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin' crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above

It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick with 'cha entree and get over your side

We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love 'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

I try to play cool
Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryin' to keep myself from goin' crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't)

Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin' the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin', it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be Tryin' to perm us up
We already straight - yes

I try to play cool
Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me

Ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn; son, yo' life can get took, man 
And threw off bridges; one hard top, two soft bitches
Ride through the borough with two four fizez 
Phantom open up like two door fridges
I'm makin' change to New York digits from seven-one-eight to one-eight-seven

They ain't wanna hear the bang; bang, I'm back on my bully shit 
That flat bush, bush wick, black hoody shit 
Half a billi in the bankroll, bank stop anybody
Bank stop anybody - what you bank ho? Big B's on the wheels
Spread love the Brooklyn way; B, how's it feel?
I'm on my Robin Thicke shit; shit ever gets thick, back to robbin' niggas quick, trick, click

Whole borough is wit' me, hold ya cannons up 
Buck one for Bucktown, Brooklyn; what the fuck?

Got my grandma out the hood; ROC is back, now look at niggas 
Now they can't say J ain't signed a Brooklyn nigga 
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Shootin' somebody up, or gettin' off them packs, or go into the club
Lookin' for somethin' to cap or runnin' up in ya crib like, where the safe at?
East New York'll shoot ya; they'll gat ya, homey
Brownsville rob ya; they'll clap ya, homey
Benz style, I'll get you killed for a hundred grams
Get a Coney Island nigga to pull the trigga, man 
Ask Flex, he used to run the turf
Brookyln had dudes scared to rep their borough
Uncle Murda - I'm a rep to the fullest

Just bein' suggestive, a lil' more impressive 
And I'm a good player: I listen to the coach 
He show me the play book, and said this is the approach
If you ever wanna score, 'cause some players rush they shots
And that's why they never on the floor

Then get the chops or the lobster
Prime on twelve, dinner for dos
We begin with a toast, end with a dose

Straight to Barney's, somethin' we need to stop for

How 'bout green grass breakfast, top floor
Later on Fred C, or Max Fields

In a glass with some ice, maybe mix juice in

White marble, new floors that shine still
And the help keep food stored, wine chilled

Dear Fab
I wrote this letter in confidence you will read it
I succeeded getting my college education completed
Smart girl, not conceited, but used to being treated any way
But anyway, your advice is needed
I'm twenty-two years old with a beautiful daughter
By a dead beat who wouldn't give a quarter to support her
My money was gettin' low, and my patience was getting shorter
Heard about his new girlfriend and all the shit he bought her
So I caught, fought her, heard she had restraining orders
I still grabbed her pony tail and held her under water
So right now I'm sorta locked up for manslaughter
Missing every minute I can't spend with my daughter

[Chorus]

Lo-so
I know you hold profession as a lyricist
But you probably never had depression as severe as this
Your music - it's like a session with a therapist
I asked the Lord to send me any blessin' if he's hearin' this
I'm stressin' somethin' serious, pressin' on delirious
A smart man always asks questions if he's curious
I believe in God, but I don't understand his plan
Why send a Spanish man way up to Afghanistan?
Hand this man a rifle, suit me up in camouflage
I salute the hand of Sarge; he is not a man in charge
I'm fightin' this war, don't know who I'm fightin' it for
Might be goin' AWOL any day, y'all

I'm such a fan, I don't have much demands
But I'm really hopin' that you will keep in touch with fans
'Cause see, I know you're probably busy kickin' 
With one of them pretty girls from on television shaking it
My vision ain't mistaken, I can see you wasn't faking
So I hope that you can help me with some good decision making
I've been thinkin' lot, so much I haven't slept in days
My mother and father about to go they separate ways
I'm a teen in the cross of a painful divorce
I love my mom, and she thinks I'm an angel, of course
I love my dad, too; I feel tangled and lost
Who's side should I be on?
Your friend, Deon

[Chorus]

Yeah, this song is dedicated to anyone who find they self in a place where they need some advice
You may not always find that person in the physical form, but there's someone you can trust in
Who listens when everybody's ears are shut, who sees when everybody's eyes are closed
Who speaks when everybody's voice is silent
Put your faith in god; the man will take you from there
Loso

'Cause not a day goes by that I don't wonder why, and what should I do?

To stay fly till the day I fade away
Hey, I pray I stay out of a hater's way

Lemme hear 'em say ""ah"" when he spit to the joint
You gon' hear a spray ""raa"" when I get to the joint

Still let us slide through the door, like Cramer
I believe in God, but my true religion
Is stuffin' big faces down in these true religions
We everywhere, you ain't never there
New coupe shoe shine, like patent leather Airs
Pushin' something we ain't got our names on
Two '07's, neither one of us is James Bond

Now they say you ain't never suppose to envy no man
Can't tell that to a dingy old man
Who see a young nigga getting plently dough man
Icy Audemar, Hendy gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bentley door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow for my dough
Why would you try with that guy
Scene told you he keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coupe's up take the new Lame for a sec
12"" up, new cane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer and a coozie
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the uzi

They making plans, we sit and counting
Our cheddar stack it's just like a mountain
You heard about it 'cause she running her mouth
She want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouth

Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believing
I mark with death, hard to kill like Steven
When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga?

Now watch me dip-dip-di-dive all over the beat
Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street

Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crap music and the kings of the cross
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dying
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you feeling my spot
Why you niggas getting mad at us, we shit on your floors
All in your house nigga, our strategies is different from yours
Listen, you come you can do it while I continue to preach

Pull up the Phantom, show 'em how we switch
From the Bentley blinds spur kill 'em with the six

How she leave dude broke tell them boys on work
I'm in the G5 Jedi, Brooklyn what's your chrome
'Cause that niggas lying home if the tutti with the dead-eye
My nigga Neck got hit up in his truck
And no Stranel ain't the same since Homo got touched
Nasty with the pistol, nasty with the clit
See I'm a beast with it, fucking 'til I'm crippled

So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

They should learn us, instead of try to turn us

Something small as a look, can bring about a man's demise
And whoever he stands beside, hit him where he can't survive
Throw the drop, or slip an object, if not then missing
Nine shot, pop a clip in, pine box the opposition
Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary, determined the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath
Skin peeled off your flesh, I know you wish you wore a vest
That's a no brainer, I'm coming with both flamers
I'll spray 'em, but I'm no painter
To this here, I'm no stranger
It's obvious you no bangers
You dudes pose no danger
Your whole crew chumps, in the closet like coat hangers
Like purple broke up in the dutch
Leave you broke up on a crush
That's what happens when shooters choke up in the clutch
We gonna body you, and have to hook your wife to an I.V. too
Put both of your parents side by side in I.C.U (everybody lose)
Closed casket so they can't have a proper wake

Listen...I'ma hundred percent hussla from my face to my feet
My lifetime cases the street, my dime places the street
Until I wake and see another fuckin day is relief
I pray that he keep, I'm scrappin my knees from chasing this cheese
I had point guard dreams of playin for some team
Hit the block and made NBA money in one week
See I hussle in the hood and plus I fly birdies
And play the tracks out every month so I can ride dirty
Needed someone to manage my money I hired Shelly
But Shelly started talkin to much so she died early
They got me loadin up my Benz with my eyes blurry
I sent the message to the fucker at bout five thirty
Now if the bitch ain't got my dice for me then I'm sorry
But I'ma leave everyone who outside bloody
And then I go in the stash get the coke and the cash
I'm lettin niggas score it for half, I'm hopein it last
But still nigga don't, I might have to just go in the lap
And if its slow in the ass back to the rope and the mask

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
Freaky-freaky...

Ay yo I got a resolution
This year I'm playing right
No six fifteen this year
You can stay the night 
We can go bowling it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing?
I was so immature
I was young and having money 
Having honeys come to the crib
Thinkin' they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses'
No room service just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil' Debbies and when your done get ready
The chicks I was fiendin' to smash
Let 'em lean on the cash
Will take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that playa shit
I need a chick that practice top cheese
That still can by weed
And can give me some good head
And I'll make her remind me, uh-huh

Them chrome wheels spinning on them new rims
Home suspended from school again
I'm grown, still ill ladies love to be a deal, like Bleek
Can I feel up on your wood and grill?
It's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain
She give me good brain
Love the way I push my slang
Callin' my jack soon as the hop in my V
They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave
Bet'cha man can't do it like this, like this
I bet his wrists ain't bluish like this, like this
And I'm from Marcy you catch me on anybody's block

I was the worse
I used to switch chicks every day
Had niggas mad for real like ""I wish he was gay""
Cause they knew sooner or later hun was gettin' with Jay
Just a matter of time she was gettin' with Jay
I'll have your chick in the summer tropics sippin' on 'zae
Spittin' up in the Pacifics smoking spliffs in the shade
She used to love ya, but she feeling different today
You used to smother her, look at your honey slippin' away
Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
She said she feel free when she's around me
I'm letting her do her and in turn she's doing me

Tell me why you're here tonight
Are you looking for someone to do you right
I see you standing by yourself
And I heard you're stepping for somebody else
Came up to you
So I approached you on the wall
I Started off by saying beautiful
And then I saw
That you already had a man
Cause I noticed the ring on your hand

[Bridge: Slim]
So I thought to myself slow it down, cause I don't want it to get the best of me
But I'm starting to get closer now, cause I'm feeling that this might be destiny
And I'm dancing with you although its wrong
And I cant help but notice you're feeling it
And there's really no use holding out, cause I know its that good love you need
I can give it to you baby

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
If its good love you need, I give good lovin'
How its supposed to be, all night and it wont slow down
Its good love you need, I give good loving'
How its supposed to be, all night and it wont slow down

[Verse 2]
Imagine if you came with me, and imagine all the things that we can do
Me and you can make it work so easily, baby I can see it in the way you move
The way you move
I get it from the way you dip, from the way you're biting on your bottom lip
I know you want it
Cause even though you got a man, you're still taking me by the hand

You ain't heard of me by now, well you should've
What you been under a rock or you're just outta touch
I know you work, go to school, and don't get out as much
So if you let me baby, I'ma let you whats good
A TV with HD wouldn't show as good 
I got that fogging up the windows in the back of Jeeps
Yeah I wake that thing up, and put it back to sleep
You put it back to sleep? That's what I said right?
They do it wrong baby come get your head right
And I think everybody know what Biggie said right?
If its right is on tonight like headlights
I don't slow down, not even for red lights
You cant stop this G double O D
We can both try to fight it like ??
But you need this Loso, in case you didn't know so
Slim take us outta here

Now I'm rolling down my tinted window
Is you coming or staying, I see you think about it girlfriend just surrender
You got a chance to make the right choice
I'm intelligent, got my money right, plus I got a nice voice
I can give you the right touch, the right place
You don't really need to be wifed up, hes lightweight
I wrote the right hook, and got you knocked out
I take you shopping, get iced up and rocked out
I know you like the picture, I'ma paint it for real
By the way I put it down slowly when I'm rolling with ya
They'll be looking for us, but well be under covers

Tell me all your stories, I'ma tell you mines

Fabolous,"In the crib on this rainy day, I'm chilling
Glass pianos and Portuguese drapes, hang from the ceiling
Persian rugs, Moroccan sofas
I walk to the house in paisley robes and Ferragamo loafers
And Iron Chef just season the salmon
It's coming down pouring, he watching BBC, eating a salad
I'm on the couch hitting the chalice
Checking my texts and out of nowhere, my dick is hard as a callus
I stood up, pulled back my sleeve, checked my watch
Where the, fuck is my wife, it's 12 o'clock on the dot
Very impatient, I'm getting nervous, can't stop pacing
My heart's racing, her Nextel don't get no service
Damn, all this over a gallon of milk
Something, happened to her, somebody wig'll get peeled
Okay, let me calm down, maybe she at Keeba house
Her birthday's today, we both bought her jeans and a blouse
Since 7 o'clock, she been gone for Owls
Jetted up the steps to the master suite, checked the shower
Nope, all that is there is towels and soap
Stomach is nauseous, caught a big lump in my throat
Found a phone book with mad names, looked down
Bow, there go Keeba, tying my shoes, I put the bitch on speaker
And bluntly addressed her, 'where's my girl?' (Yeah, she ain't out here)
(Last time I seen her, Ghost, she beat it on an old nigga)
Yo, Keeba stop playing, yo (Nah, we took a shot of Henn')
(Lately she work out by 10, I told her, bitch, buy a Benz)
(Or even shot a car, I'm getting me some Advil)
(Show these motherfuckers, how Keeba love to drive stick)
I snatched up my raincoat, the grass was soaked
Under the bed in the guest house, where I keep my toast
I yelled to the Chef, yo, watch for Kayla, check the pool and the bowling alley
If anything, just hit my cellular
Hopped in the go cart, the yard is dark, I'm bugging
Few feet from the guest house, is where I parked
Hope she's OK, is what I say in my heart
But something don't feel right, so is what I'm saying to God
As I got closer, something ain't kosher
I heard a bunch of squeaky sounds from the house, I don't think I'm suppose to
Is this the end, of the Starks regime?
Let me find out somebody on my ground, yo, is pounding my queen

Yo, I'mma kill, yo! (Hold on, cause)
(Baby, let me explain, you over reacting, that's not what it was)
Shut the fuck up, you got caught moaning with your legs up
Eyes all red, what? Did y'all just blaze up?
Then froze for a sec, so I dipped quick, lift the mattress
Aimed the biscuit at both of them bastards
What ya'll excuse now (Yo, cause, she said she live with her pop)
(Her dude mad strict, that's why we up in the spot)
(And yo, this little trick of yours, bought me a ten G watch)
He reached down for his drawers, that's when I let off a shot
Back the fuck up, snatched his covers
Had 'em looking like the black Adam and Eve, some sinful lovers
(Chill, Tone, put the gun down) How you know my name, son?
(Hold on, let me explain) Yo, y'all two is done
(Just let me put my drawers, get dressed, before I get rocked)
(Cause real talk, is looking like you trynna let off that glock)
Yeah, you right, you look familiar, you put my cable in, right?
The FiOS nigga, and you fucking my wife?
(Yeah, I put that cable in, nigga, we both got caught)
(And she a triflyn ass chick, don't act like it's all my fault)
(Baby, no) Mind your business

It's like you find love, and you loose love, and then

Met her up town on dykeman
Aight then
Light skinned
Starring with a slight grin, I don't know, Might been
Cause I'm in this white Benz

Or the way the Ice in the Brietling flash brighter than a lightning
But I knew from right then
She was 'bout her money, and how she fit right in knowing how I might spend.
To make a story short, other than a Tight End
Had a Washington Heights friend
Who bring that white in.
Set up a meeting, Her dude caught a flight in
Sat down at Sole, popped a bottle of white then
Got straight to business like two corporate white men
The food came, before I could take a bite in
He said ""You the type I usually don't invite in, 
But since we got a like friend I could get you like, 10""
I told him I could move like 10 by nights end
Put the white over the plate, like I'm throwing strikes in.

'El Duke' got a dude in the UK, Buy 5 bricks at a time, $22 K

He send the Euro's I send the Puredo
Now that's what I like to call a ""Foreign Exchange""
He smiled. Duke finished his glass of wine
There's a van outside, pull your S-Class behind
My man will pass a dime, at 15 a pop
Tell shorty ""Make the drop, Don't make no stops!""
I gave him a hand shake some dollars for the tab
Told shorty the location then I holla'd for a cab

I hit mike told 'em ""Send the wire to the buyers""
Word got 'round like we were handin' out flyers!

And them things went as quick as they came
I'm back being a hustler, this chick is to blame

And them things went as quick as they came

I gotta celebrate, that's the way I am yo
In the past week I watched fifty thousand grams go
Pocket full of money, Army full of Rambo's
Trunk full of bricks, Hand guns full Ammo

Even got detectives if somethin' goes wrong
The money's so strong they see it from my perspective
But with my shorty, A nigga's so protective-
And should be, she's the one who knows where the connect lives.
She don't talk much, real calm and collective
Seen something in me 'cause shorty's really selective.

I tell'er fall back, shorty stilla drive
Said the rush of the risk just makes her feel alive
I listen to her fuss, saying ""that I must, let her do it 
Cause they're aint too many niggas that I trust""

So now time is flyin', I been kinda eyeing
A ring for my queen who got me diamond buying

I'm in the G-T headed up to C-T, 
Lookin' for a stone to light her finger like E-T
I got there, and got a call from a D-T (detective)
Sounded nervous saying ""we need to talk now""
I told em chill out, I ain't in new york now
Any problems I got, get traced in chalk now!

But when I get back, we can sit and chit chat
Better not be no bull shit, I ain't even wit that

Back to what a nigga came out here for
This 5ct. Diamond without near flaw's

Head back to the city, call up the committee
Get ready for tomorrow, they're comin' in with fifty
I almost forgot, I gotta see a cop
I figured it was a drop who must ain't get his gwop

He told me meet him by the bridge, I get there in a hurry
Got me worried and it's probably just a minor mix up
He said: ""Nah Los, FED's dun snatched ya chick up
Caught her at a pick up, scoopin' those bricks up! 
She gon' cooperate, and ya fixed up. 
She's probably at the headquarters now hangin' flix up""

I asked him ""Was he sure""
Shorty's ""Mi Amore""
This happened to me before, with my man Diadore
Over a Ki(lo) of raw
My nigga got killed, caps got peeled and I still got guilt.
He assured me, I was hot- she had put 'em on me
Swore to Jesus' Tears that he was here to warn me.

Normally, I would have just ended her life-
But this was the girl I intended to wife

So I went home to shorty, had trouble sleepin'
Shorty's kinda peepin my sudden discomfort
She woke up mad early, so I got up with her
She wanted to go alone, but a nigga insisted
Like ""Baby it's been a while"" and truthfully I missed it

We rode out, but she don't know that I done made a plan
Once she hits the spot, one shot, see you later man

I watched her in the building,
Knowing it's the last time-seein' her ass climb in and out of the car
Yo I even thought about gettin' out of the car
But sat back lookin' at the ring about to be y'all's

I let one tear fall at an unfair call
Ya whole life can change in just one year y'all
Caught in a thought, then I heard a

Hi love, bye love, I will miss my love.

It's so crazy how it happened like
It's just
Crazy

It's just crazy you know? Just the way it happened it's just

Still don't give a fuck

The block got my back, and my boys do too
And my baby mama trippin' said she need more loot
Every block, every hood, every ghetto got beef
I got a heater on my lap, and another in the back
See how I'm suppposed to cope with all this stress on me
Everybody and their mama callin fed's on me

Fabolous,"I said, fuck em all, motherfuck 'em all
Y'all done turned a good guy into a Chuckie doll
I would've been your friend till the end bitch
Guess there ain't no friends in this shit bidness
Just a bunch of assholes in the shit bidness
But they won't flush me down the toilet bowl without my tissue
These bitches talk shit out the same mouth they kiss you
These niggas kiss ass with the same mouth that dis you
Ew, you niggas disgust me
And they ain't talkin' bout shit unless they discuss me
Let's talk about how, I'm killin' everything I touches
Or how I walked in this game with no crutches
No Diddy, No Dupri, No Dr. Dre
No Cash Money from Baby and no rocs from Jay
And I'm still here
We still here
What does this break dude?
It's still here
And dude talk, concernin' New York
When I was runnin' the city you was learnin' to walk
So I watched you niggas take they first steps
And I was happy for ya, daddy was clappin' for ya
But, wasn't for me prolly wouldnt've happened for ya
So I rest my case
I'm a rappin' lawyer
That's unless you wanna talk bad bitches
Section full of bridezillas, that's mad bitches
No words, I describe em with letters best
They pretty as can be, curvy as the letter ""S""
They keep it G, they sweet as T
Look good in the passenger seat of V
They ride double R, smell like double C
The Bags are L.V., D, or a double G
Fly as hell, shades wire cell
On E, sippin' P.J., high as hell
And please don't even talk about swag
I'm cool and collective
A Fool with perspective
I'm far from being typical my respect is reciprocal
I already came up
You still on the zipper pull
And I would say my style is 5th Fab meets Brooklyn
I keep the hood watchin', I got the streets lookin'
They watch what I do, so they know what to do
Lil money never told big money what to do
Money talks, if u speak guapanese
A language better known if you gettin cheddar holmes
If not get a loan, use that like Rosetta Stone
And that way you can holla bout a dolla
I hear em cryin' broke, they holla like a toddler
Come holla at yo gualla, don't holla at sovallas
You'll end up down under tryna holla at Koalas
I keep that nine on me, Ala Iguodala
We can get it jumpin like the drolics on Impala
I feel like Neno lettin em rock wallas off the colla
Somebody tell me something, What the fuck happened?
Somebody talk to me, muthafuck rappin
They infiltrated the game, but who let in the pookies?
Kingpins is snitchin' that shit is not lookey
So fuck new friends unless they stay solo
Cause who gon' watch you back after you kill Manolo?
Isn't it ironic Santana's own fella stabbed him
The king of New York die while I yellow cabbed him
No Carlito's way
When I spot a hater drop him like a hot potato
You ahead, got me later
Yeah I keep it gangsta but I'm a do it my way

I wave at you, I'm so player,
I'll never be done I'm so rare'r

We killin' the game its not faiyr
You motherfuckers stay right theyre
'cause we too high up in the ayir
We blastin' off just like a layzer
Nigga pewoon, pewoon, pewoon
Give me rap, give me room, room, room
D-B-9 like vroom, vroom, vroom
Young Hov what we doin', doin', doin'

We ballin', bitches, eatin' y'all food leavin' dishes
Why these niggas always talkin' leir talk Ye
Why I never see them at the clear port Ye
Why I always hear they at the airport
Why I fly daily like I'm in the Air Force
Therefore, please stop talkin' my ears off
Millionaire talk, you haters,
You mad at me cause your paper,
""you need to get his mother fuckin' weight up"", waita
I ain't done, name one thing that I ain't done
It hurts when you say that I ain't the one, you haters
How do I gain your favor, I need to know cause I cayre
I need you to love me I sweayr, look heyre
See Ye is, runnin' the Chi like Gale Sayers,
I'm runnin' new york, I got the mayor, on my pager
You cant fade us, you hate us
I need you, stay theyre
I breath you, like ayir,
Ayir
Ya, ya, ya, yayer
Ya, ya, ya, yayer
Where are my haters,
I love all my haters
Love all my haters
I love all my haters
Where are my haters, hater
