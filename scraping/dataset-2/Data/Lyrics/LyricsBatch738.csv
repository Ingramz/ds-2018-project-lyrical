Mirah,"The earthquake
Is making
The house shake

The earthquake
Is making
The house shake
The house shake

I don't know
What to do
In times of
Disaster

Solid things
Go liquid
And the breath
Gets faster

I ask you
What you think
Of my forward question
Is this a
Release, or
A build up
Of pressure?

Mirah,"Oh, person, person
We're really missin' you
It breaks all of our hearts to know
That you just want to come on home
So come on home

The telephone
Just doesn't seem to do
To let you know
How much it's true
That we love you
Yeah, we love you

Oh, person, person, person
Oh, person, person, person

How's that wide river?
Are the mountains doing fine?
Can you smell the cottonwoods?
Is it huckleberry time?
Is it huckleberry time?

You tell fast eddy i say ""how d'you do?""
Take a nap on a sandbar
And we're dreaming of you too
Yeah, we're dreaming of you too

Oh, person, person, person
Oh, person, person, person

You give those glacier boats
Some muscle driven hell
And make sure the captain stands up straight
When the river starts to swell
When the river starts to swell

Oh, person, person
We're really missin' you
It breaks all of our hearts
To know
That you just want
To come on home
So come on home

Mirah,"You've got pollen on your nose
Where've you been? Where've you been?
Pretty pretty bunch, I'll take a dozen of those
You've got pollen on your nose

I want love in the afternoon 
I want love in the afternoon 
I want love in the afternoon 
I want love in the afternoon 

You've got pollen on your nose
Where've you been? Where've you been?
We make the dirt go flying with the shovels and hoes
You've got pollen on your nose

I wait and see if you'll give it to me 
I wait and see if you'll give it to me
I wait and see if you'll give it to me 
I wait and see if you'll give it to me  

You've got pollen on your nose
I've been leaking like a garden hose",Pollen,2000

I'll see you around
I wish you'd move

Fall in a hole
I wish you'd go
It's a small town

Mirah,"You remind me of a firework, boy
You touch the ceiling, you touch the floor
You sparkle and burn but you take your time
And I bet I could carry you across state lines

I'd tell you why, but I don't know
It's simple and so complicated
I could walk all day on the railroad track 
But there's much more to it than that

You know all of my secret ideas
The ones I'm giving up on and the ones I'll keep
And everybody sees a funny look in our eyes
'Cause we know that we already won the sweepstakes prize

I'd tell you why, but I don't know
It's simple and so complicated
I could walk all day on the railroad track 
But there's much more to it than that

I ask you if you ever think that maybe
It's what's inside of us that drives us crazy
Fingers feeling underneath your skin
There's blood and bones and some rivers to fall in

I'd tell you why, but I don't know
It's simple and so complicated
I could walk all day on the railroad track 
But there's much more to it than that

I'm so lucky because I asked you once
""What are you doing? Do you want to come up
For a cup of tea? Come visit with me
We'll play guitars and I'll give you my number""

I'd tell you why, but I don't know
It's simple and so complicated
I could walk all day on the railroad track 
But there's much more to it than that

Mirah,"Lean in close and speak to me low
Tell me things you want me to know
'Cause i want to be the one
You need to
Lean to
Speak to me low

Regretful it's the time of year for letting go
Wasting all my time 'cause you just tease me
Please leave me alone

Scared of the feeling of you coming home
I'm leaning out the open windows
Looking into the alley below
Rooftops black and the moon's hanging low

And the telephone wires
That carry the sound
Stretch across the sky
And under the ground

And i will be here
When you come back
And speak to me low
Speak to me low

I'll pretend that
It's okay
We'll just be friends
So the wires say

But i will be here
When you come back
And speak to me low
Speak to me low",Telephone Wires,2000
Mirah,"The sidewalks are dirty
The gutters are dry
The summer is over
My bones are inside

This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me want to spin
'Round in the yard

Asleep in my bedroom
My eyes open wide
I hope i get out soon
Get lost in the tide

This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me want to spin
'Round in the yard

And when i get thirsty
From drinking the ocean
And my blood is burning
From all the commotion

This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me want to spin
'Round in the yard

Love is an arrow
Shot through the sky
The streets are all narrow
The rivers are wide

This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me want to spin
'Round in the yard

This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me want to spin
'Round in the yard

This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me want to spin

Mirah,"Water come up from the ocean
Water come right up the street
Water come up to the edge of my bed
Water come up while i sleep

I'll wait for sleep
Leave salt on my sheets
Salt on my sheets

By stars navigate
Dreams anticipate
By night it's too late
To try and not think about it

I'm visible
I'm invisible
The moon it is full
It pulls back and forth

I'll wait for sleep
To take me again
Take me again

The ocean side
Roller coaster rides
Please tell me why
They're all closed for the season

The rivers rise
The wells run dry
Water it tries
To swell and make it's mark

I'll wait for sleep
Leave salt on my sheets
Salt on my sheets

Ready for water
Ready for the sea
Dried out from water
Tired out from sleep

Get inside of water
Get inside of sleep
Get inside the things you do
Get inside of me",Water and Sleep,2000
Mirah,"Words cannot describe
The twinkle in your eyes
The fireworks that happen
Inside my heart they're snappin'
I'm wishin' on a star to be with you

This lazy afternoon
Will find me in my room 
Plucking petals one by one
Oh my heart will come undone
Wondering if my wishes will come true

I'm waiting for the day you'll let me love you
I'm like a flower swooning for the sun
Shine on me so tenderly, my love
And say that you will be my only one

I look up at the moon
And hope that maybe soon
We'll be together i can tell
Our romance will be like a spell
Cast upon the town when we're around

I see you walking by
'N there's no use to disguise
The fella in me quivers
And now I've got the shivers
Tingling up my spine, oh you're divine

Oh tell me won't you say to me my darling
That your love for me will never die
I look up at you and sweetly sigh
Forever i could stare into your eyes

Words cannot describe
The twinkle in your eyes
The fireworks that happen
Inside my heart they're snappin'
I'm wishin' on a star 
I'm wishin' on a star 
I'm wishin' on a star 
To be with you",Words Cannot Describe,2000
Mirah,"Heard a shot rang through the woods
Couldn't tell from what direction
Spun around and tried to see
If there were two if there were three

The mist came down the ground was wet
I talked with you inside my head
The way i have forgotten back
Quickly prepare it's an attack

Listen for the sound
Feel a shaking underground
To have the weapons and the time
The will to push off from the side

I use my eyes, and use my head
I use all of the things you said
A person needs to know before
A hunting, hunting we will go

Oh, my beloved alleyway
To go it takes a lot of patience
Figure out the constellations
Work on the coordination

Listen for the sound
Feel a shaking underground
To have the weapons and the time
The will to push off from the side

Listen for the sound
Listen for the sound",Advisory Committee,2001
Mirah,"The stars so far
Stay up all night
They've got some kind of way
To shine their light
I'd like to have one
Hold it tight
Start a fire
Burn all night

You have to go
I wanted you to stay
But just like you said
After you left i was okay

The sheets all broke and
The coals are dead
Migration high up
Above my head
You know the way
You've got some kind of way
It comes so natural
But seasons change

Now it's hot like summer
Winter's days are numbered
You have such cold hands
But that weather lifted after you left",After You Left,2001
Mirah,"There should be no hesitation when the coast is clear 
You got a right to slide right into place when the end is almost here 
So you think you got some rotten deal 
What a way to compromise 

It's a long long way before you get to claim that final prize 
Looking at that sorry face i can recognize the fear 
But if you keep on looking up at night the stars will all appear 
See there's food for me, there's food for you 

There's gold that's in the air 
There's oceans deep and wide and there is love beyond compare 
There's apple in the trees 
Let's take all that we need 

We know what we believe 
There's hope for you and me 
My eyes can almost see 
If you fight 'til you're free 

You don't have to wait until you die",Apples in the Trees,2001
Mirah,"There's a story i could tell
When the cold wind starts to blow
Like a whisper in the night
From a friend that you know

It says ""keep holding on
To my body below
Forsake me not,
Don't ever leave me alone""

There was a time when the sun 
Gave it's life to the trees
And the air it smelled sweeter
For the honey and the bees

The ocean rolled salty
And wild and free
The fruit swelled and ripened
And burst with their seeds

But what starts with desire
Can turn into need
The chest gets all tight 
Like it's got some disease

What burns in the fire
Just ends up as coals
What floats on the water
Can sink like a stone

Now i want to believe 
Every word that you say
I want you to need me
To not go away

Have trust in the nighttime
And faith in the day
To walk on the water
Be never afraid

Can you bear it upon you?
My love has gone under
Above all the stars
Have forgotten to glow

But if you keep holding on to
My body below you
I'll warm you and keep you
From feeling alone

Warm you and keep you from feeling alone 
Warm you and keep you from feeling alone 
Warm you and keep you from feeling alone 
Warm you and keep you from feeling alone 
Warm you and keep you from feeling alone",Body Below,2001
Mirah,"I saddled up my pony right
And rode into the ghostly night
It was wide, wide open, wide, wide open

I left the only home I knew
I stayed alive and I found you
Now I take you where the water's deep
And make the air you breathe so sweet

But is it not enough to be complete? Please?
Let me give you everything you need, please?

We found a way, we found a street
Directions sweat under the sheets
And I let you have it, let you have it

But it can be a lonely place
Desire comes, desire fades
There's a bright one caught your fancy eye
It's okay so long as you stay mine

And I'm so number one that it's a shame, a shame
That you let other numbers in the game

Now I suffer for your hungry eye
Oh why must it see more than mine?
It's a light you're after, 'cause light moves faster

But when I ride again into the night
My torch will shoot flames strong and bright
And my absence will remind you of
How tough it is to be in love

And it's not what I think it's what you say, hey
And it works great for you to have your way, hey

But if the west can be a desperate place
You search all day for just a taste
Of the cold, cold water, cold, cold water

And if you think I've gone too long
Listen the sky will sing this song
As it burns up all the memories
That flow like water out of me",Cold Cold Water,2001
Mirah,"Oh oh I really wanted that thing
I just want to sing
I love you baby
Won't you bring
All the flowers you
Find out in the garden
Don't tell me the truth
That your heart has hardened

But you don't want me anymore
How can it be
Look what you've done to me

Oh oh
Oh oh the bee does quickly sting
I was wondering
If you could maybe darling
Think? I'd give everything
If you'd grant my love a pardon
And all the fruits
Again would fill the garden

But you don't want me anymore
How can it be?
Look what you've done to me

Oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh (and so on)",The Garden,2001
Mirah,"want to start a fire in your heart tonight
Oh tell me why do i so yearn to cause trouble?
I need you to be mine in the summertime
When the days are long and the nights are slow and sweet

But why do you turn and shield your eyes?
Do i burn too brightly?
Oh, don't take my love lightly, for i mean every word

You flicker, you amaze me
Your lips illuminate me
I want your eyes to tell me I'm the only flame
My glow it will attract you, my smoke will push you back
Until you call again please arsonist attack

But why do you turn and shield your eyes?
Do i burn too brightly?
Oh, don't take my love lightly, for i mean every word

I'll just light the match
And the flames will catch

But why do you turn and shield your eyes?
Do i burn too brightly?
Oh, don't take my love lightly, for i mean every word",Light the Match,2001
Mirah,"The door is jammed
The door slammed shut
And i wait for the sound
Wait for the sound

There is one addiction
I like to keep the power and the heat

Make it hot
Take me over and over and over
Make it hot
Take me over and over and over

The snow falls
The snow's all ugly
When it hits the street
When it hits the street

It gets colder
Arms and shoulders

Who would've guessed it?
C'mon and feel me flex it
Who would've guessed it?
C'mon and feel me flex it

Take me over and over and over",Make It Hot,2001
Mirah,"Aren't you going to come along?
Aren't you going to fight?
Aren't you going to hold your hands up to the light?
If you feel an emptiness, if you want to hide

Think about the blood that's pumping keeping you alive
We've got it all worked out, the plans all made
If we believe in the fight then we're all saved
It's gonna hurt for a while but it would anyway

Let us stand resolute with our voices raised
We have a right to insist to be free and brave
If that should cease to exist I'd throw my heart away
It's a long long way to the promised land

So try where you are, do what you can
You belong to what you understand
So teach yourself how to demand the monument that you deserve
For rising up in a beaten down world

Aren't you going to come along?
Aren't you going to fight?
Aren't you going to hold your hands up to the light?
If you feel an emptiness, if you want to hide

Think about the blood that's pumping keeping you alive",Monument,2001
Mirah,"From the morning when I rise from my bed
'Til the evening when I lay my head in slumber
Oh, the loss of you does wreck my days
Leaves me with a violent hunger
I will never be free from you
'Til I escape the lion's jaw
There's no welcome in the end
There's no reason to return again

The mountain stood so large
We were humbled
We walked a high and lonely path
The sun beat down on the ground
We looked around us
There were no trees there
We found a creek there
We dipped our feet there
We were alone there
There was still hope there
There had been a great disaster
The hot winds came just after
A tremendous shock was felt
Survivors often tell
The trees all hit the ground
Death was all around
And not a single lonesome sigh

The example lay before you
You knew what you had to do
You have a pressure in you
To destroy the one who loved you
The death was all around

You were hotter to me than the sun
That burned me up the day we went
To mount saint helens
And if the special death you gave to me
Is the prize i get to take home solemnly
And suffer with the fact that
I could never be your friend
I could never come back home again",Mt. St. Helens,2001
Mirah,"Before you left to go away
I wrote down what i couldn't say
I bet you read it on the road
With foggy lights and fingers cold

Now you drove so far but now you know
How rough it is to let me go
And let me recommend that you think twice
And i always give the best advice

Now come on back to where you know i'll be
Lets' go sit under the apple tree
You can floor that thing, let the engine roar
The wheels they'll spin, the rain it pours

There's regret that you feel
About the choice you've made
You'll just have to deal
Before it goes away
You ask me how i feel
And here's what i'll say
I'm doing fine, just fine
I'm doing fine",Recommendation,2001
Mirah,"A terrible mistake was made
The weight would break the backs
Of ten strong horses tried to save
The castle in the fray

If you knew that i could take the pain
Inflicted at the battle
With faithful arrows you
Might get back in the saddle

But it's a special death you saved
For me, the brown-eyed daughter
Once you made it hotter
The thankless, holy praise

Is left alone. Why bother
To cast a stone in water?",Special Death,2001
Mirah,"You need a big wide space
You need light, you need grace
Disappointment in your skin
I'll always let you in

Pull a feather from the nest
Fasten it to your chest
Shoot yourself up to me
Cut through the gravity

You don't have to be scared
You hold yourself down there
You would like it here i know
You were meant to let it go

'Cause i am the sun
I'm the only one
I'll pull you to me

When the oxygen comes
And blows it all clean
Remember to breathe
Remember to breathe

We fill up the sky
And we burn with devotion

When our bodies are done
And hard times are over
Remember to breathe
Remember to breathe",The Sun,2001
Mirah,"You make my everything okay
You make me feel this certain way
It's like an ocean, like a wave
It's like when morning lights the day

It only grows and grows and grows
You come to me when i'm asleep
You hold me close and it's so sweet
Somewhere between my head and feet
You make my alphabet complete

It only grows and grows and grows
If i were a planet in space
You'd be the astronaut who braves
My deserts and my lonely face
My axis holding you in place

It only grows and grows and grows
There is just one more thing to say
Happy birthday",Birthday Present,2001
Mirah,"Don't go
Don't take yourself away from me tonight
'Cause we know the only time we both feel alright
Is when you're lying next to me holding me tight

You say you'll think about me for two hours in the car
In some ways it is and also isn't very far
I'll sit at home listenin' to Friday night pass by
And while you're at that party I'll think about you and sigh

Don't go
Don't take yourself away from me tonight
'Cause we know the only time we both feel alright
Is when you're lying next to me holding me tight

There's all these things about you shine a love light on my heart
It's nice to think about 'em on these nights when we're apart
I like the way your hair is getting' shaggy and kinda long
It goes really good with that new tough jacket you've got on

Don't go
Don't take yourself away from me tonight
Just stay here on the sofa with me or i might
Just pick you up and pin you down, alright

Wear big hats and make lots of noise

Bucking bronco cause a scene

So tell me all about how long your battle lasts

I'm saddle sore but I'm okay
I'll find a place to lay my head

1982, I'm playing atari
In my living room
I am learning how to play breakout

Use my paddle, use my joystick
I am winning against the odds of hand eye coordination
I am winning against my brother

Frogger! Remember that game?
I'm a frog crossing the street
And many cars are trying to run me over

Frogger! I'm a frog
Breakout! You're a dog
You're a dog for trying to run me over

Frogger! I'm a frog
Breakout! You're a dog

We are in a sailboat and
The wind is picking us up
And putting us down
In another town

We are in a sailboat and
This other town is still
The storm has blown over
It's over

We are in a sailboat and
There's nothing left to do
But wait and wait
And wait

Floating here (floating here)
Floating there (floating there)
(Repeat x3)

We are in a sailboat and
The water is so still
We can see the animals down there

We are in a sailboat and
The animals look up to say
It's time to go home
They're sending us home

We are in a sailboat and
The moon comes up to shine
Like a big opal in the sky

If I'd read the newspaper
If I'd seen the tv
If I'd listened to the radio
I'd know

Maybe I know better
If it's cold put on another sweater
I wish I knew about the weather

Sometimes I think my whole face is gonna blow
I listen to my blood, it makes me cry
It scares me just to know that I'm alive
It scares me just to know that I'm alive

The storm blew in all over me
Maybe it's just minor injury
But my fingers and my head are rather tired

The travel, the trav...(going under)
The speed, oh, the spee...(it's supernatural)
The loss of, the loss...(of gravity's pull)

I'm going around on the top like a little bug
The trees are lucky their legs did reach so far
Better than me with a crazy heart and a dumb guitar
Better than me with a crazy heart and a dumb guitar
Better than me with a crazy heart and a dumb guitar

I'm looking up through the telescope lens
I'm wondering where does the universe end
I'll take my clothes off for meteor showers
I'll take my clothes off and climb into bed

But all the stars that shoot in the sky
They're falling in love with the sun
They're falling in love with the sun

You're terribly happy that I came home early
I've fallen asleep in the afternoon
Get under the covers I'll give you some kisses
And we'll lie on the roof and stare up at the moon

But all the dumb cats in my neighborhood
I know they'll get me soon
They'll find a way into my room

Oh tell me a secret and tell me a story
Lets make up plans that will never come true
This is delicious, hey thanks for the dinner
I hear footsteps approaching, I'm hoping it's you

But all the blankets on the bed
They're tangled in heaps around you
I can't get my arms around you
They're tangled in heaps around you
I can't get my arms around you

Mirah,"I hung myself out on the line
Beneath an Argentina sky
And I expected there to dry
Beneath the Argentina sky
Upon the rooftop here so high
Beneath the Argentina sky
The storm did call me to its side
Beneath the Argentina sky

And the dogs of Buenos Aires they will take you from your sleep
Between the firecrackers cackling and the taxis in the street
And if you wake up lonely better throw some shoes upon those feet
To keep the heartbreak from taking your life

Once I had planned to be your bride
Before this Argentina sky
Now I just tend my wounded pride
Under this Argentina sky
Now I want the rain to fall into my eyes
From this Argentina sky
The thunder to match my anguished cries
Beneath this Argentina sky

I looked into the darkening and while the air did chill
I knew that though I'm here in exile that you should love me still
And when the rain began to pound I lifted up my face until
I was soaked with the ache of the sky

Ella hacía el lavado de una terraza,
Mientras el sol le quemaba la espalda,
Ella intentaba fregar el sudor de su desconsuelo,
Escurrir las lágrimas, 
Pero antes que la tarea estuviera terminada,
La ropa todavía doliente en la soga,
Bajó desde el delta un viento poderoso
Why las nubes se cargaron a lo largo del cielo
¡Rápido, adentro, cerrad las ventanas, viene una tormenta! 
Sacá tu ropa de la soga.

So many tears could make me blind
Beneath this Argentina sky
But still my love for you I can't deny
Even under Argentina's skies
I'll seek until a path to you I find
Under these Argentina skies
When will you take me back inside
From under Argentina's skies

For a second time in all history

Free from all responsibility
Without the weight of being whole
Some flew seaward all on their own

When i felt like you lied to me
And all the million mistakes
And the kicks in the face

That you need what you got

My father he came in, 
I was nine years old. 
And he stood so tall above me, 
His blue eyes they were shining 
And his voice was very cold. 
He said, ""I've had a vision 
And you know I'm strong and holy, 
I must do what I've been told."" 
So he started up the mountain, 
I was running, he was walking, 
And his axe was made of gold. 
Well, the trees they got much smaller, 
The lake a lady's mirror, 
We stopped to drink some wine. 
Then he threw the bottle over. 
Broke a minute later 
And he put his hand on mine. 
Thought I saw an eagle 
But it might have been a vulture, 
I never could decide. 
Then my father built an altar, 
He looked once behind his shoulder, 
He knew I would not hide. 

You who build these altars now 
To sacrifice these children, 
You must not do it anymore. 
A scheme is not a vision 
And you never have been tempted 
By a demon or a god. 
You who stand above them now, 
Your hatchets blunt and bloody, 
You were not there before, 
When I lay upon a mountain 
And my father's hand was trembling 
With the beauty of the word. 

And if you call me brother now, 
Forgive me if I inquire, 
""Just according to whose plan?"" 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will kill you if I must, 
I will help you if I can.

Back at home the stars are fading
And you're nowhere
You're nowhere

We did travel far to get a taste of so much more.
We dug up the roots of all the stories, put 'em in a pot 
And brought them to a fiery road.
We fed on these things without a worry, 
Never gave a thought to the coming of the winter storm.
Gone away, gone away, what was yesterday. 
Make a meal, make a bed, tuck your feet in.
Rested elbows twice on a table can be nice,
But the comforts they can be deceiving

(Short instrumental break)

The seasons are not what they once seemed.
The berries all are green, though summer's at a fine high crest.
We lifted our shirts up in a hurry, 
Reaching for the belly hollow from the long cold rest. 
We slept up all the fat but there'd be no more of that,
Cause there must be some disease 'neath the canopies.
Swinging tails from trees we could gather what we need.
Give away what we had our first share of,
But now the forks and knives with the sacrifice. 
We could bare only some can believe in.

More than I wanted to give
I am empty

Territory to touch and make a path to lead you down.
If I could hold the wildest winds from blasting through my house,
Then I could shine a beacon whether floats, fine, yes, or drowns.

But there was no heat, it all had been extinguished,
Snuffed right out.
That was not the way I meant to disappoint the crowd.
If you want my center, please don't slice so much around.
And if you won't be having me, watch the sorrow shake my mouth.

And you don't want to hurt me,
But you don't want to need me,
So how can you receive me?

Take a seat, don't grieving be, let's settle this all out,
Then one by one I'll take these from the caverns of my mouth.
The teeth who mash and teeth who make my tender muscles shout
A last goodbye to lose what once I'd never known without.

And in my mind, the river runs a straight line through the town,
Never bending, only sending stuff from north to south.
Under bridges, fishes wear the currents like a gown.
And I will swallow crookedness, not let it drag me down.

Afraid that if I cut you loose,
You'd never again want me to
Embrace you in your solitude.

Now in our eyes, we both still find the perfect place to rest.
We'll unfold wings and fly a while, before the next caress.
The atmosphere will hold us dear and teach us how it's best
To both feel free and satisfied, our two souls will be blessed.

Before my eyes, the fireflies they make the night sky low.
Captured by the sounds of all the horns that the frogs blow.
Through tears so thick, like glue they drip and build a castle slow.
I can see you saved for me the sweetness that still glows.

And though you're still my Hercules,
Neptune's the one who's taken me.
Come on, lay that strength upon my sea.

Steady the string and snap it down the dust gets in my face.
A borderline to not cross, mind our manners, keep in place.
Still, I recall you once extended me with handsome haste,
A rope to climb, to call all mine, to ascend you with grace.

Now we will burn the fog away, our hearts are like the sun.
We moved it now, that's a way down and though the change was rough,
We'll find our lives are kinder without complications of
The fear in me that had taken seed and crowded out the love.

I want you and I let you go
Though we can still walk on the same road.
If we don't try it, we'll never know.

And if you want to face the death you're never that far from
Just take a breath and sing to it when all the day is done

So sorry about all the sorrow in your life you'll know
It's true that all the ones you love will someday have to go
And every time you say goodbye you'll hear the trumpets blow
A serenade to the soul, all surrounded by the glow

If you feel all broken 'cause i left you there too soon
Just know that it's not up to you to make the flowers wilt or bloom
And if you think you're lonely then just listen for the tune
Of all the stars i left for you in the chest of the moon

If you want to shake whatever separates you from
The holiness you want to make your life on earth become
Live your life with a compassion you can be proud of
Then let your last breath fade away with dignity and love

Let's take the time to walk together while we have the sun
You never know when temperamental weather's gonna come
And if you want to face the death you're never that far from
Just take a breath and sing to it when all the day is done",While We Have the Sun,2009
Mirah,"You sent me off without a warning
Wasn't just a threat and man, that was no joke
Did you know you'd struck the final blow
To my faithful oxen hope?

We thought we knew we wanted what we had
But you busted your side of the yoke
So I left with almost nothing but a gaping hole
Yes, I did really went for broke 

No matter how much I weigh, like a boxer I train
Seems like the future is always gonna have its way
Knocking me down, should I fold or spread
My fortune hand on this hard rock bed?

And I don't question, no, I don't doubt
Now that I've tried living with and without 
That was a hard, hard muscle to grow
And harder still to let go

We'd both commandeered a ship or two
We'd had our fun, yeah, we had a few
And wheels spun around and water flowed
In here deep before we felt the cold

And the ride we rode had danger in
We thought we could last while we were real strong swimmers
But we got flooded, yes, we got rolled
And we both went down soon as you cut the rope

I've been wondering lately if ever I'd find 
Someone to hold me like he wanted mine
Should I give up or should I keep on trying?
Should I move on or should I keep on lying to myself

By saying it's all better this way
But all the life is gone, I want to stay
Now I've ruined it, you sound ages old
And I can feel that bearing down a part of my shoulders",Oxen Hope,2014

That I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around

I was dumb I was wrong
I've let you down

And the lock on my door

I know it's late but I just can't stop
All this jumpin' around, all this wastin' time
It's getting to be a habit of mine

You would think I didn't wanna get paid
I'm not the type to procrastinate
But a girl can't always be well behaved

I wanna stay home with my headphones on
With the stuff on the floor and the lock on my door
I lost my keys in the mess I made
So I can't go anywhere anyway
So rock on with the headphones on

Got a lot of nothin' to do
I'm not getting it done and I'm lovin' it too
Twenty four hours since I've been outside
But it feels okay, it feels alright

I could go to school another day
Don't understand why I dance all day
You know what they say about
All work and no play

I wanna stay home with my headphones on
With the stuff on the floor and the lock on my door
I lost my keys in the mess I made
So I can't go anywhere anyway

Above the clouds, I may never get to bed
Can't turn back now, don't wanna come down

Made sure I'm guarding my heart

Everyday at noon like a chapel bell
Find her, Jesus, keep her well
Help her do more right than wrong, at the end of the day
I've got five good years and a tank of gas
50 watts and Johnny Cash

Miranda Lambert,"Me and Charlie boy used to go walking,
Sittin' in the woods behind my house
When being lovers meant a stolen kiss
And holding hands with nobody else around
Charlie said he wanted to get married
But we were only ten so we'd have to wait
He said we'd never let our love run dry like so many do these days

So we treat our love like a firefly,
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar and with holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off
Oh promises we made when we'd go walking
That's just me and Charlie talking

Charlie always said he'd like to leave here,
So he turned eighteen and he left our sleepy town
Letters came and went and I kept waiting
For Charlie to come back and bring the life he'd found
It's funny how time and distance change you
The road you take don't always lead you home
You can start a love with good intentions
Then you look up and it's gone

So you treat your love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar and with holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off
Oh the promises we made when we'd go walking
That's just me and Charlie talking

Now and then I sometimes think of Charlie
How we thought we new it all back then
Now I'd give anything to feel love from a child's heart again

So you treat your love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar and with holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off

Take me far away from Amarillo
I bet this car will go real fast
The wheels might even drive me past
The places that you said I'd never go
Oh

The Texas sky is the biggest one I've seen
But it still ain't big enough for you and me
All the things that make you mad,
All the baggage in your past
Don't leave much room for a girl like me to be
So I'll fill her up with hope and worn-out dreams

And I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
I'll drive until I find the missing piece
You said I wouldn't get to far on a tank of gas and an empty heart
But I got everything I'll ever need
I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings

Mama said I never should have done it
I should have ended us before we ever started
Daddy knew about my pride so he stood there and he smiled inside,
I pretended that I didn't notice
A little tear that fell when I said I was going

And I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
And drive until I find the missing piece

Miranda Lambert,"Sometimes I wish I lived in Airstream homemade curtains
Lived just like a gypsy
Break her heart and roll out of town
Cause gypsies never get tied down

Sometimes I wish I lived on a mountain
Drank from a stream
Instead of a fountain
I'd stay there, on top of the world
But I was born a red dirt girl

Unbridled, or tethered in tide
Safety of the fence
Or the danger of the ride
I'll always be unsatisfied

Sometimes I wish I lived by a pier
In a lighthouse with a chandelier
I'd watch everybody's ships come in
And then I'd sail away with them

Unanchored in a storm
Or save me on the shore
If this is all I need
Why do I want more

Sometimes I wish I lived in Airstream homemade curtains
Live just like a gypsy",Airstream Song,2009

It's insane
It's in vain
You stay to maintain the pain

I swear I hate you but I can't let go
The kind of damage that you can't console

Miranda Lambert,"Well, I was borned a coal miner's daughter,
In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler.
We were poor but we had love, 
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of,
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines.
All day long in the field a hoin' corn.
Mommy rocked the babies at night,
And read the Bible by the coal oil light,
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn.

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay.
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day.  
Why I've seen her fingers bleed, 
To complain, there was no need,
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way.

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear.
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair.
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog,
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter,
I remember well, the well where I drew water.
The work we done was hard,
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler. 

Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then
And it's so good to be back home again.

I just had to come back one last time.
Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam.
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine.
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar.
And I bet you didn't know, under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years.
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazines.
Plans were drawn, and concrete poured,
And nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.

They say, ""Life's a bitch and then you die"",
But I can't see a reason for their point of view
'Cause it's easy living, easy loving you

Talk shows talkin' how it's near the end
Of the one man woman and the one woman man
We might fight like dogs but hey,
We love the makin' up at the end of the day

Tomorrow that ole sun will rise
I'll be layin' here by your side
Coffee cup and a good mornin' kiss or two

You're feelin' good

Is doin' what it should

That I needed for love to work
Engine of a heart that would not start
Had to jump it so much, it hurt

Every time I looked under the hood
It was always a mystery
You pulled up in a rescue truck showed up with a máster key
And revved it up for me

My pulse was nearly gone
I was almost in need of a defibrillator
I didn't know what went wrong
I had to shake it off but I got stuck, oh my God
You turned on my loose strings
You're the love innovator that brings all the right tools
You know what to do, fine tune
Fine tune

You started tweaking on a little knob
That I didn't even know was there
Kissing on my wrist all the way to my neck
Running your fingers through my hair

I felt like I was dizzy and I didn't think I could drive
You flipped a switch, hot wired my gears
Yeah you put me in line

My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now sayin' she ain't gonna have it

Hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady 'cause I
Raised you better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart,
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

I wish I could be just a little less dramatic like a,
Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make

Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up girl it's, just a break up run an'

Day I left is my only regret
And now it's become his biggest thrill

And I'll try to play it off cool
When they ask I'll just say, ""He's nobody""
And me well I'm nobody's fool

Won't take long and he'll find him someone
And then pull them out for a dance
Every no tells me that's all she wrote
And reminds me how I missed my chance

When he's done he'll have a little more fun
And he'll let her act like she's smooth
As they walk out, while I'm learning about
What it is to have nothing to lose

At sixty you find peace of mind

Deberé tranquilizarme y jugar al juego que me propones
Bajo la guardia, te recibo y me abrigo de tu piel

Sabes que esto no me hare feliz. (aunque lo entiendas así)

No es para tanto pero igual si.

Va a ser mejor que dejemos unos días
Yo quiero pensar un poco
Lo que tengo que hacer.
Why justo hoy mejor no decidir nada
Podría arruinarlo todo si no tengo noción.

Que fuiste tu a quien he sentido mía
La que perfumo mi vida
Con un sueño de flor
Yo se que soy, digamos algo inmaduro
Pero es la manera en yo entiendo el amor.

Va a ser mejor que dejemos unos días
Yo quiero pensar un poco
Lo que tengo que hacer.
Why justo hoy mejor no decidir nada
Podría arruinarlo todo si no tengo noción.

Que fuiste tu a quien he sentido mía
La que perfumo mi vida
Con un sueño de flor

Pero esa es la manera que yo entiendo el amor. 
Pero esa es la manera que yo entiendo el amor. 
Pero esa es la manera que yo entiendo el amor.
",Navidad,2005
Miranda!,"Ven aquí
Tengo memoria de tenerte así
Acurrucada why tierna sobre mí
Desvaneciendote en mis brazos

Que, no ves
Que si te llamo es porque te extrañé
Si me desmayo cuando respondes
No es nada grave why es humano.

cae la noche why estoy solo otra vez
Lanzo miradas al espejo why no me ves
Escribo frases en un trozo de papel
Quiero olvidarte why al contrario
Tu recuerdo se hare carne en mí

no cierres el telón
No cortes la función
No vas a acobardarte ahora que viene la acción
Mi parlamento es
Probemos otra vez
Yo sigo extrañándote

creo que
Perdí mi orgullo cuando perdoné
Abrí mis alas why te cobijé
Cuando podría haber volado

nunca nadie me había tratado como tú
Presumo que hasta has afectado mi salud
Veo que no fue suficiente perdonar
Sigues mostrándote distante
Que demonios pretendes de mí

no cierres el telón
No cortes la función
No vas a acobardarte ahora que viene la acción
Mi parlamento es
Probemos otra vez
Yo sigo extrañándote

no cierres el telón
No cortes la función
No vas a acobardarte ahora que viene la acción
Mi parlamento es
Probemos otra vez
Yo sigo extrañándote

no cierres el telón
No cortes la función
No vas a despertarme de mi sueño mejor
Mi parlamento es probemos otra vez
Acércate...pierde el temor

no cierres el telón
No cortes la función
No apagues esta llama que el amor inflamo
Mi parlamento es probemos otra vez
Yo sigo extrañándote...

A veces canto solo para mi 
Solo quisiera que me oigas ahora que sigo mi instinto 
El instinto animal no fallara 
Quisiera hablarte pero sin hablar 
Yo se que puedo hacer que tu me comprendas 
Si sigues mi juego 

Yo quiero ser tu profe mejor dicho profesor
El que te enseñe del amor 
Lo que sabes y disimulas 
Quisiera que me mientas cuando pregunte tu edad 
Quiero volverme tan vulgar 
Voy a engañarte tonta 
Solo para tocarte un poco! 

Ya ves así nunca sabrás de mi 
Mi fantasía me describe así 
Esa es la parte que no a visto nadie 
Y que tu ahora conoces 
Es que te veo y es mi reacción 
El pretender tener todo el control 
Aprovecharme de ti me estimula 
Apuntarte, mis trucos 

Percibo en que momento te comienzas a mojar 
Y entonces no puedo parar 
Hasta sentir que te hago mía 
En el papel de ingenua 
Tu te luces de verdad 
Y yo comienzo a sospechar 
Que eres mi alumna preferida 
Y que caíste en mi trampa 

Yo quiero ser tu negro del camión 
Yo quiero ser un cerdo picaron 
Yo quiero hacerte las cosas mas sucias de modo elegante 
Yo quiero que te toques para mi 
Quiero tocarme y acabar en ti 
Ahí si supieras como me emociona de solo pensarlo

Porque entonces me empezaste a besar

Y tu boca pegándose con mi boca
Besándonos ante todos los amigos

Avanzas sobre mi

Escuchándolo
Por momentos no escuchaba nada mas 
Que tu pasión
Pero ahora que me dices esto 
Debo reconoces 
Que quiero volver a ser de mi 
Ya no me acuerdo como era ayer 

Abriré mi placard 
Pondré todo en su lugar
Tengo que separar 
Toda tu ropa que no quiero usar
Yo te juro que no 
No te guardo rencor
Sólo quiero volver 
A ser ese chico que te presenté
El CD que habíamos compilado 
Para hacer el amor
Ayer fue mi disco favorito 
Y hoy es lo mas triste que oí

Lo mas triste que oí 
Fue tu adiós al partir
Y con esta canción 
Me desprendo de ti",Uno Los Dos,2005
Miranda!,"He querido hablar luego de tu función
Yo te vi fatal pero estabas peor
No se fue tu luz pero hay algo que cubre
No permite que alumbre, por lo menos por hoy

Una canción mas en la que no cantas
Lo que transmitís es mas simple que vos
Debes comprender, lo que tienes alcanza para darme esperanza
y me cubra tu voz

Te seré franco de verdad
Haré ya tiempo veo que estas
Sin encargarte ni de tu disfraz

Se que volverás a ti
Ya vez, algo intentare
No creo poder ver en tu ser

Tu agenda del mes se alborota otra vez
Se que no venís, acostumbras así
No quisiera yo que al hablarte te espante
Me respondas distante y me alejes de vos

Se que volverás a ti
Ya vez, algo intentare
No creo poder ver en tu ser

Se que volverás a ti
Ya vez algo intentare
No creo poder ver en tu ser

Se que volverás",Vuelve a Ti,2005
Miranda!,"Una tarde, un té frío, una espera 
Y esta casa buscando tú presencia
Te espero entre los discos
Los libros y la radio
Te espero como siempre te he esperado
Quereme como la tierra quiere al agua 
Quereme como en el mar esa mañana 
Quereme que las disculpas se han perdido 
Como perdida estoy sin vos, y tengo frío

Quereme mis pasos van por la vereda 
Quereme se que tu casa queda cerca 
Quereme hay una luz en tu ventana 
Pero tu sombra está, mi amor, acompañada 
Quereme mis pasos van por la vereda 
Quereme sé que tu casa queda cerca 
Quereme hay una luz en mi ventana 
Pero mi sombra está, mi amor, desamparada

Vuelvo a calentar agua. Suena un timbre 
Pero otras manos, otras puertas abren
Volando en tu recuerdo 
De pronto me di cuenta 
Que el agua se ha enfriado ya bastante",Quereme... Tengo Frio,2006
Miranda!,"Cuando te vi, comencé a temblar
No soy muy bueno en disimular
Se me noto que guste de ti
Eras alguien que se me acercaba
Eras alguien que me conquistaba

Hace unos años no era común
Que se me acerque alguien como tu
Muñeca mira la situación
No estoy solo

Hace tiempo salgo con alguien
Que me espera en casa
Nueva tentación
Para un hambriento corazón

No voy a ser tu galán
Fue la primera cosa que yo pensé
Trate de ser natural
Y en mi nerviosismo me traicione

Algo se apodero de mi
Y te agarre

Nos escapamos de la mano corriendo
A tirarnos y a abrazarnos por ahí
Amanece junto a mi

Tal vez lo que recuerde de ti
Sea la primera vez que te vi
Inicialmente te lo advertí
Tengo a alguien

Que ocupa un lugar importante
Has llegado tarde
Soy un timador que se disfraza de señor
Piensa mal de mi

Pero yo lo hago por amor
No voy a ser tu galán
Fue la primer cosa que yo pensé
Trate de ser natural

Y en mi nerviosismo me traicione
Algo se apodero de mi
Y te agarre

Nos escapamos de la mano corriendo
A tirarnos y a abrazarnos por ahí
Amanece junto a mi

No voy a ser tu galán
Fue la primer cosa que yo pensé

A tirarnos y a abrazarnos por ahí

Amanece junto a mi
No se si tengo tiempo, no se
Amanece junto a mi

No se si tengo tiempo, no se
Amanece junto a mi

Amanece junto a mi
Amanece junto a mi
No se si tengo tiempo, no se

Que ganábamos si jugábamos los dos

Que los que me des en las manos y en los pies

La revelación en mi corazón
Aparece de repente, sorprendiéndome

Tengo un sentimiento
Que me nace adentro
Tengo que probarte que

En verdad ya no te miento
Todo eso cambiará
Todo el peso se aligerará

Desde hoy atravesaremos cambios
Solamente para mejorar
Si es que ayer algo se nos ha pasado
Ya no volverá, ya no volverá a pasarnos jamás

Hoy podemos salir como al comienzo
A bailar emborrachándonos
Y mañana despertare en tu pecho
Y te sacaré, esa cinta de papel

Sé que me corregiré

Invítame a tu habitación ya

Por dios, discúlpame.

El sol entibiaba y relajaba mi piel
Y como estoy envuelto en ella
Me relajo a mí

Supe de inmediato que hoy seria especial
Un día común, mágicamente normal
De rutinario devenir, me haría feliz
Aunque esté tan solo no me siento tan mal

La señal de alarma debería sonar
Tengo que empezar a preocuparme
O tengo que dejarme
Aunque me cueste lo conseguiré

En unos días te olvidaré
Pero te juro que no puedo más
Disimular felicidad
Si tú no estás nada es igual

Todos los lugares me recuerdan a ti
Las canciones tristes se parecen a mí
No va a ser fácil deshacerme de lo que viví
He pensado mucho en nuestra separación

Creo o aparento que ha sido lo mejor
Pero me estremezco cuando siento
Tu ausencia en las mañanas
Aunque me cueste lo conseguiré

En unos días más te olvidare
Pero te juro que no puedo más

Éramos tan buenos amigos hasta hoy

Es por él, que pensando me pierdo

Estoy amándolo en silencio desde que lo crucé
Escribo en diarios lo que siento ya no se para que 
Si pareciera que me teme 
Si me ve, Si me ve

Pero se va Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho, pero se va

Quiero ir por todo y encontrarlo 
O fingir que puedo ignorarlo 
Ya no se porque estará escondiéndose 

Este amor acaba con mi vida 
Este amor no me deja salida 
Este amor terminará matándome

Y cuando muera estoy segura que me presta atención 
Y me revive con un beso para darle mi amor 
Estoy aquí solo por eso 
Mírame, mírame

Tus ataques de locura cuando nadie lo esperaba
El reflejo de la luna en tus gafas espejadas
Lo imposible de tu amor

Pero también extraño tu llegada
Y el sabor a cigarrillo que tu beso me dejaba
Enroscarnos y dormirnos con las sabanas mojadas
Cuando aparecía el sol

Lo que no se es lo que quiero
Lo vuelvo a hacer y me enveneno
Enloquecer es soledad es mi destino
Discúlpame si con esto te deprimo

Porque también extraño
Abandonarme al universo del engaño
Irnos de viaje y renovar nuestro vestuario
Y me hago cargo, nena te extraño pero no tanto

Extraño el paraíso de tu cara
Con los ojos achinados
La sonrisa desplegada
La melena despeinada
La actitud exagerada
El sonido de tu voz

Lo que no se es lo que quiero
Lo vuelvo a hacer y me enveneno
Enloquecer es soledad es mi destino
Discúlpame si con esto te deprimo

No soy cobarde ni valiente
Solo lo siento diferente
Contradecirme en mi discurso es mi fuerte
Aceptare lo que me tenga la suerte

Porque también extraño
Abandonarme al universo del engaño
Irnos de viaje y renovar nuestro vestuario
Y me hago cargo, nena te extraño pero no tanto

También extraño
Abandonarme al universo del engaño

Depuis des siècles font rimer
Blonde avec monde, brune et fortune,
Amour toujours, aimer pâmer,
Caresse ivresse et rose éclose
Je veux changer toutes ces choses
Je ferai rimer s'il me plaît
Amour avec chapeau,
Toujours avec jamais
Je veux aimer ce soir
Un jeune homme aux yeux verts
Si ses yeux étaient noirs
Ça f'rait un plus beau vers
Je veux, le cœur en fièvre,
L'embrasser sur les joues
J' devrais dire sur les lèvres
Mais, dame, chacun son gout
Tant pis si c'est un crime
Je me fous de la rime
Je veux le cœur en fièvre
L'embrasser sur les joues
Je veux jusqu'à demain
Lui caresser les pieds
Je devrais dire les mains
Ce s'rait plus régulier
Tant pis si c'est un crime
Je me fous de la rime
Je veux jusqu'à demain
Lui caresser les pieds, là!
Il suffit que Margot soit brune
Pour qu'on l'emmène au clair de lune
Mais si ses cheveux sont châtains
Ça se passe au petit matin
Et si la pauvre fille est blonde
On l'expédie au bout du monde
Tous les deux avec mon garçon
Nous n'faisons jamais d'vers
Et nous nous en foutons
Gaston, ce soir en douce,
M'attend sur le pavé
J'devrais dire sur la mousse
Il n'en a pas trouvé
Quoique je l'idolâtre
Il me bat comme un chien
J'devrais dire comme plâtre
Mais ça n'arrange rien
Tant pis si c'est un crime
Il se fout de la rime
Quoique je l'idolâtre
Il me bat comme un chien
Pour calmer ma douleur
Il m'a donné des frites
Oh, si c'était des fleurs
Ce s'rait plus poétique
Tant pis si c'est un crime
je m'en fous de la rime
Pour calmer ma douleur
Il m'a donné des frites
Pourtant, on est heureux
Sous un ciel toujours gris
Pourquoi pas toujours bleu?
Parce qu'on habite Paris
Il a conquis mon cœur
Aves ses yeux d'travers
Avec des yeux vainqueurs
Ce s'rait un plus beau vers
Tant pis si c'est un crime
Je me fous de la rime
Il a conquis mon cœur
Avec ses yeux d'travers
Mais la fin du poème,
La fin sera quand même
Sera toujours la même

Et puisque c'est un crime
Gardons la vieille rime
A la fin du poème je lui dirai
""J' t'adore!""",Tant Pis Pour La Rime,

L'amour est de saison 
Ne soyez pas rebelle 
Vous aurez bien raison""

J'avais le coeur tout content 
Et j'entendais dans ma tête 
Tous les refrains du printemps

Chez le grand coiffeur de Chatou 
Mon Jules aime bien quand j'ondule 
J'étais pimpante et puis surtout
J'avas mis la robe qu'il aime 
Un amour de robe, un poème 
Une robe avec des festons 
Et des tas de petits boutons 
Et des p'tites fleurs sur le côté 
Avec un p'tit genre décolleté 
J'avais l'air d'un chou à la crème 
A tenter le diable lui-même

Et puis il a lu ses journaux 
Il est reparti sans dire un mot 
Quel chameau
Et voilà, voilà les hommes, 
Les hommes ma chère ! 
On se donne pour leur plaire 
Un mal fou 
Et voilà, voilà les hommes,

C'est curieux 
Mais qu'est ce qu'ils ont donc dans les yeux
Hier ce n'était plus ma fête 
C'était un simple jeudi 
J'avais autour de la tête 
Douze ou treize bigoudis 
J'étais encore à ma toilette 
Avec du savon sur le nez 
Dans un pagaille complète 
Quand à la porte il a sonné
J'avais un peignoir que je plisse 
Avec des épingles à nourrice 
Et des pantoufles à pompon 
Pas belles je vous en réponds 
Et puis par dessus le marché 
Mes bas n'étaient pas attachés 
Comme on dit à polytechnique 
J'étais foutu comme l'as de pique 
Jules est arrivé tout 
Comme vous êtes mignonne ce matin 
Mon petit lapin j't'aime bien, tu viens ... 
Quel crétin !
Et voilà, voilà les hommes,

Près de Notre Dame
Parfois couve un drame
Oui mais à Paname
Tout peut s´arranger
Quelques rayons
Du ciel d´été
L´accordéon
D´un marinier
L´espoir fleurit
Au ciel de Paris

Sous le ciel de Paris
Coule un fleuve joyeux
Hum hum
Il endort dans la nuit
Les clochards et les gueux
Sous le ciel de Paris
Les oiseaux du Bon Dieu
Hum hum
Viennent du monde entier
Pour bavarder entre eux

Et le ciel de Paris
A son secret pour lui
Depuis vingt siècles il est épris
De notre Île Saint Louis
Quand elle lui sourit
Il met son habit bleu
Hum hum
Quand il pleut sur Paris
C´est qu´il est malheureux
Quand il est trop jaloux
De ses millions d´amants
Hum hum
Il fait gronder sur nous
Son tonnerre éclatant
Mais le ciel de Paris
N´est pas longtemps cruel
Hum hum
Pour se faire pardonner
Il offre un arc en ciel",Sous le Ciel de Paris,1994
Mireille Mathieu,"Des yeux qui font baisser les miens
Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche
Voilà le portrait sans retouche
De l'homme auquel j'appartiens

Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose

Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous les jours
Et ça me fait quelque chose

Il est entré dans mon cœur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause

C'est lui pour moi, moi pour lui dans la vie
Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie

Et dès que je l'aperçois
Alors je sens en moi
Mon cœur qui bat

Des nuits d'amour à ne plus en finir
Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place
Des ennuis, des chagrins, s'effacent
Heureux, heureux à en mourir

Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose

Il me dit des mots d'amour

Mireille Mathieu,"Tu jubiles sous le déluge.
Je me noie sous deux gouttes d´eau.
Tu dis que Venise est à Bruges.
Je dis que Londres est à Bordeaux.

Sur l´art de refaire le monde,
Le désaccord est immédiat.
Notre mésentente est profonde.
L´un est à hue et l´autre est à dia.

Nos divergences sont si pures
Et nos conflits si généreux.
Vivons ensemble et je te jure
Que nous serons très malheureux.

Toujours pressé, tu fais la course,
Sans crier gare, montre en main.
Je m´attarde sur la Grande Ourse,
Je musarde sur le chemin.

En bonne mésintelligence,
Nous marchons à pas inégaux,
Désunis jusque dans la danse.
Tu es valse et je suis tango.

Nos divergences sont si pures
Et nos conflits si généreux.
Vivons ensemble et je te jure
Que nous serons très malheureux.

Pour éviter toute harmonie,
Soignons notre jardin secret.
Semons un peu de zizanie.
Voici quelques graines d´ivraie.

Croquons la pomme de discorde.
Cherchons quatorze heures à midi.
Sur la place de la Concorde,
Empruntons les sens interdits.

Nos divergences sont si pures
Et nos conflits si généreux.
Vivons ensemble et je te jure
Que nous serons très malheureux.

Ce soir, ils vont s'aimer, leur cœur est amoureux
Ce soir, le ciel d'un lit se fermera sur eux

Quand je t'ai vu passer près de moi

C'était la dernière valse
Mon cœur n'était plus sans amour
Ensemble cette valse, 
Nous l'avons dansée pour toujours.

On s'est aimé longtemps toujours plus fort
Nos joies nos peines avaient le même accord
Et puis un jour j'ai vu changer tes yeux
Tu as brisé mon cœur en disant adieu.

Il plane sur la fête
Par-dessus les têtes
Par-dessus les toits
Il danse sur le monde
Je ne suis qu´une ombre
Il n´est qu´un éclat

Et l´on voit les bourgeois renversant la tête
Ouvrir sur sa silhouette des yeux d´enfants

Celui que j´aime est un poète
Lui non plus n´a pas les pieds sur terre
Lui aussi fait de la corde raide
Au-dessus du vide, au-dessus de mon cœur

Il s´en va dans la nuit comme un funambule
En habit de clair de lune et de diamant
Moi des yeux, je le suis d´étoiles en étoiles
Il fait des ombres chinoises au firmament

Il plane sur la fête
Par-dessus ma tête

Aussi vrai que tes yeux sont ma seule lumière
Aussi vrai que ma vie tient au fil de nos joies

Oui je crois, que mes jours n'attendaient qu'un mot d'amour de toi
Je crois, que tout l'amour du monde est là quand tu es près de moi
J'y crois chaque fois que tu m'ouvres tes bras.

Oui je crois, qu'on peut bâtir un monde avec des mots d'amour
Oui je crois, que nous ferons ce monde à nous deux chaque jour

Et nul ne viendra le pleurer

Comme une veuve est restée là
Couchée sur le flanc dans le sable

La vieille ancre rouillée
Les virons, le lourd filet
Seuls témoins des joies et des larmes
Autant de souvenirs
De tous les jours qui dorment là
Dans le bois de la vieille barque

C´était avant que naisse le soleil
Qu´ils allaient courir la mer, tous les deux
N´ayant que les nuages
Pour guider leurs voyages
Et les étoiles dans les cieux

Où sont les matins bleus
Les grands oiseaux jouant avec eux
À cache-cache au creux des vagues
Quand la barque et le marin
Regardaient naître ces matins
À l´heure où mouraient les étoiles

Le vieux marin n´est plus
La vieille barque est restée là
Elle attend sans doute une vague
Qui alors l´emportera
Elle pourra faire ce jour-là
A son tour un dernier voyage",La Vieille Barque,1995
Mireille Mathieu,"Sie sah als Mädchen mit sieben
Zum erstenmal diese Stadt.
Und als sie staunte und fragte
Da hat Mama ihr gesagt:
Ganz Paris ist ein Theater
Und das spielt bei Tag und Nacht!
Und genau wie in jedem Theater
Wird geweint und gelacht.
Ganz Paris ist ein Theater
Und das Stück heißt ""see'est la vie""!
Es wird weitergeh'n
Immer weitergeh'n
Irgendwann und irgendwie!
Mag auch viel gescheh'n
Es wird weitergeh'n

Sie war verliebt wie noch nie
Dann sah sie ihn mit der andern
Und an dem Tag wußte sie:

Even the cold of December
Feels like the middle of May. .

You are the night I am the day
You are the star that shows the way.
You are the instrument I play
You're all the words I long to say.
You are the land I am the sea
You are in counterpoint to me
And we agree to disagree
No need to lie.

I only know when we're apart
I only live with half a heart.
I need your hand to play my card

And how we get our meaning through.

And I will always try to understand you

But if we say goodbye it's not forever
I can't lose you now I've found you

I need you in my life
'cause now you're in my life.

Everyone has a different dream
Yours may not be the same as mine

We can make them all come true.

Mirel Wagner,"My baby has a swollen face
Long stiff limbs
Them eyes are black pits
Of a place where I've been
Her hair is long
Still smells like mud
She answered to my kiss
With a rotten tongue
No death can
Tear us apart
Her body is cold
Well its gonna get colder
But my love will ignite
What was left to smoulder
I move my hips
In her I am home
I'll keep on loving
Till the marrow dries from her bones
No death
Can tear us apart
All day
I stay by her side
But death has a claim
And a right to my bride
I shut the doors
Pull the curtains and hide
I heard something moving
Somewhere outside
No death can
Tear us apart
But death comes a sneaking in
Trough the keyholes
He's clever and he knows
What's beneath the floorboards
Death comes to feast
Like a greedy hungry beast
He wants it all
And here he crawls
And here he crawls
And here he crawls",No Death,2012

And it was all fun and games
He asked me to dance
And we danced danced danced

And at the first break of day

Oh he’s evil she says
He knows your name 
And you’ve played his game
He’ll eat your flesh
And he’ll spit out the seeds
Those eyes will go red
And at the first break of day
Your true love will go away

Let the devil take me
Oh leave can’t you see
You cannot save me

Mireya Bravo,"Fueron cuatro los segundos que pasaron
hasta que pude encontrarte entre los rostros congelados
Y pasó una eternidad al mirarte y contemplar
en tus ojos reflejada mi mirada
Y hoy bendigo las razones casuales por las que decidiste
elegir mi banco para esperar, para encontrar
Fue tu rose, fue tu aroma, despertando mis hormonas
lo que me obligó a cerrar la mente y respirar, y controlar la activación

Y mi razón se convirtió en buscarte entre las calles, en los parques, tiendas, bares; en sonrisas y destellos de cristal
Quien siguió la consiguió y esta historia comenzó a brillar
Y buen día te atreviste a confesarme que tenías tanto miedo a que yo supiera de tu realidad, y no comprendes…

Que no es tu signo positivo en que invierte en conflictivo
las cosas del querer
Que eres tu quien me revuelve, que eres tu quien me enamora
tu quien me convierte en la mejor persona
Y si tengo que gritarte lo que siento
Te digo que te quiero con tu suerte, con tu mierda
con pasado, con presente, con o sin enfermedad
Y tú no vez que quiero seguir comiéndote a besos…
Y tú no vez que quiero seguir comiéndote a besos…

Y es que el miedo que yo tengo es simplemente
no poder saborearte lo suficiente
Es dejarte escapar, es vivir sin apostar
por quien juega con la mano más potente
Son tus ojos, no tu sangre, los que arrastré a mi cama
cada noche y cada día al despertar
Y es tu sexo, no tu sangre, el que se adentra protegido
entre los huecos más oscuros de mi intimidad, y no comprendes
Que es tu risa, no tu sangre, quien contagia de alegría
las esquinas, los rincones de mi vida
Que eres tú, que no es tu sangre, quien invade de felicidad mis días

Que no es tu signo positivo en que invierte en conflictivo
las cosas del querer
Que eres tu quien me revuelve, que eres tu quien me enamora
tu quien me convierte en la mejor persona

Right about now, I'm about to show you how good we are (I'm in the club, I'm)

[Chorus: Mr. Maygreen]
(Good), I look so, (good), the car look
(Good), I'm in the hood, and I'm OK
(Good), the jewels look, (good), the girls look
(Good), they all from around the way
(Good), hey there, (good), look at you
(Good), me, I'm just passing by
(Good), look at her, (good), time out
(Good), I think I'll give the game a try

[Ghostface Killah]
Hey yo, my rose was good, plus my face was good
The way I wear my jeans up over my boots is hood
And my cash is good, the grass, spread it out, over the hash is good
The grasp who be hypecast is good
That's the bird that fucked the game up
Cut the head off lames and platinum niggas, your boy done came up
Got my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains
Chilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings
With bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes
You was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though
Cause I'm good, she's good, so you should be good
Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood
And we don't love those hoes, with they flat butts caked up
And tipped up toes, need an ill plastic surgeon to fix they nose
Cause they shit is too fat like an Adidas sole
Don't even touch my gold, I'm good

[Bridge: Mr. Maygreen]
I know you heard it a thousand times
Not quite like my design
You say that's what you looking for
Gator boots walk through the door, now

(Good) Theodore's good, (good), my team is good
(Good) My robes is good, (I'm so good)
(Good) My moms is good, (good), my style is good
(Good) My queen is good, yeah, come on, (I'm so good)
(Good) The days is good, (good), babies is good
(Good) Wifes is good
(Good) The hood is good, (good), God is good
(Good) Everything is good, come on, let's go

[Ghostface Killah]
Goose over ice cubes, pass the O.J.
Two light skinned wizzes, want Ghost, on both ways
Come here, sit on my lap, it's not a gat, sugar
Have a seat, don't be afraid to move back
Feel that? You'se a nasty girl
Big butt, slim gut, I'll crash your world
It's not polite to bend over in Starkey face
Sheer lace, fat ass, got want me to taste that
Lodi dodi, with a coke shaped body
And my jewels hang low like my balls in the potty
And I dare ya'll to try to rob me
Theodore U, we got the army
A-Town to Mariner's Harby
Wild West, Now Born, go hard, G.
Killa Hill, Stapletown, Port Rich' kids
Pack heat, like I was pulling out biscuits

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Trife Da God]
When we on the block bubbling rocks, watching for cops
Holding glocks in and out of the spots, (it's all good)
When we overseas, getting that cheese, whipping the hottest V's
Blowin' exotic trees, player, (it's all good)
When I'm in the whip, sunk in the six, drunk off the liqs
Pull up, stunting, fronting for chicks, (it's all good)
When we on stage getting them Grammy's, snatching them panties
Jet skiing off the shores of Miami, (it's all good)

Yeah, told y'all before, another Theodore Production
This is how we go in the 06 to 07, come on, come on

I, J, I wanna write somethin' immaculate
'Cause that's what you are
I would say you're bright, like the little lights in the night
But you're so far, beyond the stars
Me lady you're bad like the water found on Mars

You see when she places the violin
Under her chin and begins
A melody breezes through the atmosphere
Like angel's wind

Her harmony feels right like when angels bend
When she strikes a chord, my Lord
She impacts the earth
Like Mr. Bojangles tappin' in Timbs

With her, no, my flow can't be down, I scribe of fountains
'Cause she makes me feel like I can climb mountains
Like Proto in Sound

Miri Ben-Ari,"I never meant to hurt you
She was just a friend

I know I've made mistakes
Times before did ignore
The pain in your voice
There was writing on the wall

And it don't take a fool to see
You were right for me
Meant to be in the beginning
Why we had to take this fall

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

Girl, I never meant to hurt you
Didn't really mean to hurt you
Tried my best to show I love you
And it all turned out so wrong

I'll be sitting waiting for you
'Cause I know patience is a virtue
Gonna do just what I got to
Girl, I love you

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

I had some time to think about this
She's your friend and not our friend
That was a problem from the beginning
I care for you and I trust you too without guessing
But intentions of some folks, I had to question

I tried my best to show you I loved you
I never thought you'd hurt my emotions
If she was just a friend then why does it hurt so?
If there's nothing going on, honey, I will stay with you

It's like a plan gone wrong since you've been gone
Nights alone, my worlds gone cold
It's like I'm hiding from my soul

I had to meditate and concentrate
On doing with disappointing me
Honey, I want to come home

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

I never thought you'd hurt my emotions

",She Was Just a Friend,2005
Miri Ben-Ari,"I spent my years isolated
Couldn't live with myself
I was trouble as a young kid
My tears didn't help
Very depressing and it was evident
I'd fade to the deep
All alone like these four walls came at me
Barricaded cause my mind state
I just wanted to die
Never happiness
Just sad time living a lie
Rater leave me
I was suicidal
Slittin' my wrist
Mamma thinking I was crazy
Like use some sense
And on them days I was feeling
I was paining inside
It wasn't me
It was my inner feeling coming alive
I remember waking up like I was going to school
Left me standing in the hospital
Locked in this room
Put away
I was a troubled kid losing my mind
Fallin' short
Of what they expected from me every time
So don't fault me if you meet me
And I look to be strange
I'm just mad that the sunshine dies in the rain

[Chorus]
Sunshine to the rain
When it comes it goes again
Even when the story ends
Just turn the page and begin again
Sunshine on cloudy days
Don't hate me I'll never change
Thankful I was made this way
Your sunshine for cloudy days

Now I was raised in a neighborhood
With half of a dime
If you was real it was understood
It showed in your eyes
Every corner had a different hustle
Sprawled on your face
Drug wars
Growin' up raw cause violence the case
Had to move along
Quiet it's kept
Spoken words got you dealt with
So ride with yourself
I'm a juvenile
They telling me get down for they wealth
No getting high
Cause when you gettin' high
You needing some help
As far as help
Mine was middle though
You know how that go
Psychologically
I deal with demons talkin' in codes
Hopefully, I'll get to meet Jesus
Somewhere on this road
Sick of hearing people screaming in my head saying no
Better of if I was dead
Cause they killing me slow
All in all it's just a part of my life
Watching the show
Ain't nothing never came to niggaz sleep
Except for a dream
It's like a movie with the ending credits etched in the screen

[Chorus]

I prayed my last days of sunshine
Just die in the rain
Kinda selfish
But I know that dying
Eases the pain
Heartfelt words
Spoken hurt
Provided the frame
For the picture I done painted for the master to explain
So I leave behind my testimony
Witness to give
Far from holy
But this matrimony provided the script
To live on
And live by
Grow up and grow on
Get on and get by
So forth and so on
And this here's the last days
I can hear the horns singin'
I can see the red sky
I can hear the drum beating
I seen the dead die
How long will they mourn Jesus
At least I'm saved by my scriptural warn readings
And while leaving you here
Believe what you believe in
But you don't want to not believe
Believe in seeing
Don't take this here too personal
Cause I'm just speaking
This is my family on my mind

Miriam Karlin,"This was my dream, in the beginning I dreamt
That we were having a celebration of some kind
Everybody we knew was there, musicians too
And then in the middle of the dream in walks
Your grandma Tzietl, may she rest in peace

Grandma Tzietl, how did she look?
For a woman who's been dead for thirty years
She looked very good, naturally, I went up to greet her
And she said to me

A blessing on your head, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
To see a daughter wed, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
And such a son-in-law like no one ever saw
The tailor Motel Camzoil, Motel

A worthy boy is he, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
Of pious family, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
They named him after my dear uncle Mordachai
The tailor Motel Camzoil

A tailor? She must have heard wrong, she meant a butcher

You must have heard wrong grandma, there's no tailor
You mean the butcher grandma by the name of Lazer-Wolfe
No, I mean a tailor Tevye, my great grandchild
My little Tzietl who you named for me
Motel's bride was meant to be

For such a match I prayed, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
In heaven it was made, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
A fine upstanding boy, a comfort and a joy
The tailor Motel Camzoil

But we announced it already we made a bargain with the butcher

But we announced it grandma to our neighbors
We made a bargain grandma with the butcher Lazer-Wolfe
No, no, no, so you announced it Tevye that's your headache
But as for Lazer-Wolfe I say to you, Tevye that's your headache too

A blessing on your house, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
Imagine such a spouse, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
And such a son-in-law like no one ever saw
The tailor Motel Camzoil

It was the butcher
The tailor Motel Camzoil
It was Lazer-Wolfe
The tailor Motel Camzoil

Look who is this, who is this, who comes here
Who, who, who, who, what woman is this?
By righteous and is shaking
Could it be, sure, yes it could, why not
Who could be mistaken

It's the butcher's wife come from beyond the grave
It's the butcher's dear, darling, departed wife

Fruma Sarah
Fruma Sarah
Fruma Sarah

Tevye, Tevye, Tevye
What is this about your daughter marrying my husband?
Yes, he's her husband

Would you do this to your friend and neighbor, Fruma Sarah
Have you no consideration for a woman's feelings
Handing over my belongings to a total stranger

How can you allow it out, how can you let your daughter
To take my place, live in my house, carry my keys
And wear my clothes, pearls, how?

How can you allow your daughter to take her place
House, keys, clothes, pearls

Such a learned man as Tevye wouldn't, let it happen
Tell me that it isn't true and then I wouldn't worry
Say you didn't give your blessing to your daughter's marriage
Let me tell you what would follow such a fataled wedding

If Tzietl marries Lazer-Wolfe I pity them both
She'd live with him three weeks and when three weeks are up
I'll come to her by night, I'll take her by the throat
And this I'll give your Tzietl, that I'll give your Tzietl, this I'll give your Tzietl

Here's my wedding present if she marries Lazer-Wolfe
It's an evil spirit may it fall into the river, may it sink into the earth
Such a dark and horrible dream and to think
It was brought on by that butcher

If my grandma Tzietl, may she rest in peace
Took the time to come all the way from the other world to tell us
About the tailor all we can say is that it's for the best
And it couldn't possibly get any better, Amen, Amen

A blessing on my head, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
My Grandma Tzietl said, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
We'll have a son-in-law like no one ever saw
The tailor Motel Camzoil

We haven't got the man, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
We had when we began, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
But since your grandma came, she'll marry, what's his name

The tailor Motel Camzoil, the tailor Motel Camzoil
The tailor Motel Camzoil, the tailor Motel Camzoil
Thank you

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

There's a time for love and a time for healing 
Can't go back and undo what's been done 
The word of mouth, time is revealing 
Just how far we've left this kingdom come 
Hand in hand we're finding our way 
And today is just tomorrow's yesterday

There's all kinds of people in this world 
Turn the world around, tear the borders down 
There's all kinds of people in this world 

Kiss of life and the hand of fate 
Boy grows up into his father's son 
And he learns to love, has been taught to hate 
To carry on the way it had been done

Maybe someday we can put the past away 

Some will die for you, some will lie to you 
There's all kinds of people in this world 
Turn the world around, tear the borders down

I've been running from the truth 
I've been running since my youth, tired of running 
I will stand here till you see 
I am you and you are me, tired of running 
There really is no difference when you look beneath the skin 
Someday I know we'll go beyond this world we're living in 

Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams 
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing 
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams 
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing 
Dancing in my dreams 

There's no hiding in the dark 
From the beating of my heart it's getting louder 
Just as long as we believe 
The truth will set us free, it's getting louder 
All that really matters is the light in your face 
In you I see the longing of the whole human race 

Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams 
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing 
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams 
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing 
Dancing in my dreams 

On and on the story goes 
Or it's the passing of the torch 
With one small voice it all begins 
Then there are millions more, millions more",Dancing in My Dreams,1991
Miriam Stockley,"The sun goes down
And the moon comes up
My heart is pumping for you
And a mad thing starts
Ooooohhh-oooooohhh

Never in you wildest dreams
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Could it ever be this easy
Never in your wildest dreams

The night is hot outside your window
I hear people walking people talking
I smell your skin I feel you breathing
Don't let me go not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet

Never in your wildest dreams
Could you ever get this easy
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Did it ever get this easy
Never in your wildest dreams

And the world is slowly turning
As it turns I see your face
Touch your eyes, your lips. . .space

We've arrived at the place 
Where they open hearts
And fill them up with love
Filled with love filled with love
This on is pumping for you
As a mad thing starts

Never in your wildest dreams 
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Could it ever be this easy
Never in your wildest dreams
",In Your Wildest Dreams,1991
Miriam Stockley,"There was a time when I would have followed you 
To the end of the earth
I was willing to share it all with you, the love, the hurt
I've seen you when your dreams were falling in the dust
But I never stopped believing in you
I always thought our love was strong enough
One you could hold on to

You never see it coming you just let it fly
On silent wings, silent wings
You can't hide what you feel inside 
And the fire has left your eyes
On silent wings

I see us in my dreams and we're dancing
I can almost hear the song
But the prayers they go unanswered
We both know, we're just hanging on 
I can feel the change but I'll never know the reason why 
The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet
I only know that something good has died
Between you and me, oh, it's just a memory

You never see it coming, you just go separate ways
On silent wings, silent wings
There's no more promises to break, our love has slipped away 
On silent wings

You never see it coming, but you know it has to end
Silent wings, silent wings
I will never be the same again
I feel the whisper of the wind of silent wings

Let me tell you about a man I knew 
Yeah, I knew him all too well 

My attitude has always been you can have me for tonight 
But not for tomorrow 
It's gonna cost you plenty, more than you can afford 
More than you can borrow 
Well I can make them fall in love just as easy as I 
Pick their pockets hey 
And when I've done the deed I jump on a freight train 
And make my getaway 

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night 
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight 
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes 
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine 

I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes 
Did something strange to me 
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride 
But there was a fork in the street 
Well I didn't mean to fall in love, didn't practice the rules 
That I've been taught 
You never get involved, never drop your defences 
But this time I got caught 

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night 
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight 
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes 
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine 
Thief of hearts, paying for my crimes 
Thief of hearts, and now you've gone and stolen mine 

Feels so good, I want more, it should be against the law",Thief of Hearts,1991

Whatever you want me to do I will do it for you 
Whatever you want me to be I will be what you need 
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near

Wherever you are I know it's for real 

 Whatever you want me to do, I will do it for you

Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near 
I'm feeling sensual 
And I, I know that it's real 

 I know you've had pains in your heart, that have torn you apart 
I know you've been safe on your own, but together we're strong 
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're holding me 
I'm feeeling passionate 
And I can't deny it in myself, I'm wanting you and no one else 
You've got the power

And left a new day
Nothing seems to move everything is still

The shadows and light
That move with the wind

Fear is nature's warning
Hunger here is never far away

And all of this world
Is for children who play
Days that never end always should remain

Mirkoeilcane,"Cominciò tutto da un ""Ciao, piacere sono Lorenzo
Non seguo la moda e non bevo caffè"" Son nato trent'anni fa 
Amo viaggiare da solo
Lo zaino,un taccuino e la curiosità
E poi mi perdo in un bar
In compagnia di un bicchiere in cui affogo l'amore ed altre banalità
Ma non parliamo di me
Dimmi com'è che ti chiami
Se studi o lavori, piuttosto che bevi 
Un bicchiere di più cosa mai cambierà?
E adesso eccomi qua, quarantotto anni
Due figli e una moglie annoiata di una casa poco fuori città 
E la mia curiosità è diventata un divano 
Un lavoro sicuro e la bolletta del gas
Hanno fregato anche me, ho perso la mia partita 
La chiamano vita e non capisco perché

Cominciò tutto da un ""Ciao, piacere sono Beatrice 
Non seguo la moda e non bevo caffè""
Non so parlare di me, che poi c'è poco da dire 
A me piace dormire e ascoltare De Andrè
E mi fa strano lo sai, non parlo mai con nessuno 
Poi specie se un uomo mi guarda così come te e non capisco perché
Però mi sento al sicuro,profumi di buono
Forse è colpa del vino 
Ma dammi la mano e vieni con me
E adesso eccomi qua, quarantuno anni, due figli
Un marito distratto e una casa poco fuori città, altro che curiosità
Lui pensa solo al lavoro,carriera 
Denaro e ai suoi amici e non sa
Che tanto quando non c'è, viene a trovarmi il vicino 
Mi tiene la mano e ascoltiamo De Andrè",Beatrice,2018
Mirkoeilcane,"Domani Valentina parte e quando torna e se ritorna lo sa solo lei
E se soltanto avessi un cuore mi venisse un colpo, giuro che l'aspetterei
Domani Valentina parte e quei suoi occhi scuri scuri se li porta via
Tra libri, medicine, scarpe, nella sua valigia un pezzo della vita mia se ne va con lei

Domani Valentina parte e non le ho neanche raccontato di quella volta in cui 
Anche se per un solo istante ho immaginato di fermarla e dirle ""Dove vai? 
Abbracciami che è più importante, non parlarmi per un anno ma rimani qua 
Ti giuro che divento grande se mi dai una mano tu con la felicità""

E invece no che fare il duro era più facile
E alla mia età non è concesso mica chiedere
Vale annoiata sul tram, si guarda riflessa nel vetro e si vede lontana da qua 
Che le gambe camminano già sulle strade affollate di un'altra città
E troverà un altro pezzo di sé 
Un'altra risposta da dare a chi vuol sapere dov'è la sua casa
Il suo posto qual è perché non ti fermi, perché non ritorni, perché?

Domani Valentina parte che non vuole sicurezza ne comodità
E quella di partire è un'arte che si impara col silenzio e con la libertà
Domani Valentina parte e i suoi capelli scuri scuri se li porta via
Domani Valentina parte ed ho paura che stavolta sia per colpa mia
O forse no, però sparire fu più semplice, perché alla mia età non è concesso mica piangere

Vale annoiata sul tram, si guarda riflessa nel vetro e si vede lontana da qua 
Che i polmoni respirano già l'odore straniero di un'altra città
E troverà un altro pezzo di sé
Un'altra risposta da dare a chi vuol sapere dov'è la sua casa
Il suo posto qual è perché non ti fermi, perché non ritorni?
E perderà un altro pezzo di sé
Un'altra risposta banale per chi vuol sapere dov'è la sua casa
Il suo sogno qual è, perché non ti fermi, perché non ritorni, perché?",Domani Valentina,2018
Mirkoeilcane,"La gente qui d'estate fa paura
Va in giro in calzoncini e non lavora
S'ammassa dentro a un centro commerciale
Tra i saldi i passeggini e la puzza di sudore
Ed ecco un posto in prima fila per l'orrore
Davanti a una vetrina e sotto al climatizzatore
Alternativa più che valida al dolore
Di prendere coscienza di una vita sotto al segno del torpore
La gente qui d'estate si diverte
Le bombe, gli attentati ma non gliene frega niente
È più importante, più essenziale, più impellente
Fare muovere le natiche sul ritmo di una hit spagnoleggiante
I maschietti fanno coda di pavone
Le donne abbronzatissime gli contano le piume
E mentre il cocktail gli si annacqua nel bicchiere
Gli parte il selfie intitolato ""andiamo a comandare""
Oh oh oh oh

La gente qui d'estate non ragiona
L'ormone gli si impalla e si innamora
Dimentica la fede stretta al dito
Per farsi accarezzare dal fratello di un
amico del cugino alla lontana del marito
Che intanto va a puttane dopo il settimo Mojito
E la domenica la messa ed il rosario
Per chiedere perdono al loro amico immaginario
La gente qui d'estate perde il filo
Sarà per il calore o per le canne sul lettino
O forse il sole sulla testa dal mattino
E per le 10 birre prima dell'aperitivo
E mentre lui si è emozionato per un culo
Lei con circospezione apprezza il pacco del bagnino
E con la prole abbandonata al centro estivo
Dimentica propositi e promesse
Qui la gente fa casino
Oh oh oh oh

La gente qui d'estate s'addormenta
Si sfoga, si racconta, si lamenta
Del traffico, dei soldi e del governo
Di quanto è stato duro il loro inverno
E poi s'interroga sul senso più profondo
Gli alieni, il campionato e l'origine del mondo
Chissà se dalla morte c'è ritorno
Qui la gente è prevedibile come il finale di un film porno
L'estate qui fa schifo e no non scherzo
Non è che poi l'inverno sia diverso
Ti chiedo scusa è stato mio l'errore
Di mettermi un costume e andare al mare
Sedermi solo sotto all'ultimo ombrellone
Ed essermi fermato ad osservare
Sono venute qui da sole le parole
E adesso torno a casa ma grazie per l'ispirazione
Oh oh oh oh",Epurestestate,2018

Il Trono di Spade, YouPorn e le ore su Facebook
Poi vedo una foto di lei sul profilo
L'aggiungo ""Ma si dai,mi butto"", mi accetta, ridiamo,scherziamo, parliamo, chattiamo di brutto
Novembre, che grande occasione,al locale qui dietro fa live Mirkoeilcane 
La invito ad uscire ""Ehi, ti vengo a prendere, ti offro da bere""
Accetta, mi vesto di fretta 
Il concerto ovviamente è una grande cagata ma quel che è importante è che lungo la strada
Tra una Panda arancione e una siepe, tra una strofa di Vasco e la sete
Con il vento di fuori a bussare e la birra sgasata, io 
Vi giuro su Dio me l'ha data

Dicembre, le luci, il Natale, i regali da fare, la neve 
La gente che si vuole bene ma noi due avevamo ben altro da fare
E quello facemmo per tre quattro volte ogni giorno, da far concorrenza ai migliori film porno 
Chiudemmo la porta e buttammo la chiave
E a gennaio che feci lo sbaglio di dirle, ""Ti amo"" all'orecchio 
Dicendolo piano e tenendole con infinita dolcezza la mano
Lei, sorpresa,stupita,stordita, rispose ""Io no, fattene una ragione"" 
Poi con gli occhi lucidi aggiunse, ""È uno scherzo, ti amo coglione""
Poi febbraio, il suo cuore di ghiaccio in tempismo perfetto per stringerci ancora 
Più forte nel letto

L'odore dei fiori di marzo, con i suoi giardini
Ci trovò vicini con gli occhi sognanti a parlar di una casa,un giardino e i bambini
Fortuna che poi venne aprile e quel tiepido sole a ridare vigore a quel solo neurone
Assopito,stordito,ubriaco d'amore
Poi maggio con la primavera riaccese i colori,gli amici, i locali 
Le cosce di fuori, le tette, i sorrisi e i cattivi pensieri
I primi messaggi dettati dal dubbio e dalla gelosia 
""Chi è questa Sofia che ti mette mi piace? 
Ora vattene, lasciami in pace, sei un bastardo come tutti gli altri
M'hai ingannata e la colpa è la mia che ci sono cascata
Mamma mia ma perchè te l'ho data?""

Poi giugno e l'estate alle porte, rendevano forte 
La mia convinzione che tutto l'amore del mondo tra luglio ed agosto va in ferie
Le presi le mani e le dissi 
""Dai, amore è importante, per questi due mesi fai finta di niente che poi, casomai 
Se ne riparla a settembre""

Stiamo tutti bene, stiamo tutti bene

Ciao, mi chiamo Mario e ho sette anni
Sette e mezzo per la precisione
Mi piace il sole, l’amicizia, le persone buone
Il calcio, le canzoni allegre ed il profumo buono della pelle di mia madre
Papà mio è da qualche mese che non torna
Ma guai a parlarne con qualcuno
Specialmente con la mamma
Perché si sente male
Grida, piange e non la smette più
E per tre giorni si nasconde e non si fa vedere

Ma oggi è un giorno felice
Che qui è arrivato un pallone
E finalmente potrò diventare forte
E fare il calciatore
So già palleggiare
Con i sassi è diverso
Ma sono avvantaggiato
Perché corro forte
Come il vento

E allora volo alla radura
Insieme agli altri bambini
Chi arriva ultimo in porta
Sai che rottura di co-
Arrivo primo, come sempre
E allora sono attaccante
Scarto, driblo, tiro in porta
Ed il portiere non può farci niente
Poi da più lontano sento
""Mario vieni qua
Prendiamo tutto quel che abbiamo
E raggiungiamo papà""
Mamma, proprio adesso, sto tirando un rigore
Ma non c’è verso
Ce ne andiamo, meglio non polemizzare

Stiamo tutti bene, stiamo tutti bene, stiamo tutti
Stiamo tutti bene, stiamo tutti bene

Ma guarda te la jella proprio a me doveva capitare
Quattro giorni su sta barca, intorno ancora solo mare
Ma ti pare giusto
Uno va in vacanza per la prima volta
E quelli lì davanti son capaci di sbagliare rotta
Che poi a chiamarla barca
Ci vuole un bel coraggio
Stare in tre
Seduti in mezzo metro di spazio
È come me e gli altri duecento
Tutti intenti a pregare
Ed io vorrei soltanto alzarmi e palleggiare, ah

Ma se soltanto sporgo anche di un centimetro il piede
Questo davanti si sveglia
E inizia a dire che ha sete
Io ho pure sete, fame, sonno
E mi fa male la schiena
Ma non c’è mica bisogno
Di fare tutta sta scena

E poi c’è questo di fianco
Che ha chiuso gli occhi e non li apre più
È da due giorni che dorme
Che pare non respiri
Non ho mai visto nessuno dormire così tanto
Ho chiesto a mamma
E ha detto che era proprio stanco, boh

Tre giorni fa
Ne hanno buttato una ventina in mare
Mamma dice che volevano nuotare
Io li sentivo gridare
E non sembravano allegri
Ma almeno adesso ho un po’ di spazio
Per i piedi

È il sesto giorno
E adesso dormo, pure mamma e un tipo magro
Qualcosina più in là grida che vede la Madonna
E questa barca adesso puzza di benzina e di morte
E mamma ha detto di non farci caso
E di essere forte
E di fare il bravo bambino
E star seduto qua
Che mamma adesso s’addormenta
E raggiunge papà
Però piangeva e si sforzava di sorridere
Forse era proprio tanto stanca pure lei

E c’è un silenzio tutto intorno
Che mi mette paura
S’è fatta notte, ho freddo
E in cielo non c’è neanche la luna
Gente grida, chiede aiuto
Ma nessuno risponde
Mi guardo intorno e neanche a dirlo
Vedo sempre e solo onde
Dopo onde e ancora onde
Allora onde evitare di addormentarmi come gli altri
Ed esser buttato in mare
Mi unisco al coro della barca
E inizio a piangere e gridare
Non ho forza, chiudo gli occhi
E non so neanche nuotare

Stiamo tutti bene, stiamo tutti bene
Stiamo tutti bene, stiamo tutti bene, stiamo tutti bene, stiamo tutti bene
E stiamo tutti bene",Stiamo tutti bene,2018
Mirkoeilcane,"Sulle spalle di Maria il suo mondo piccolo 
Quanti giorni da scordare e quanti ne ha scordati già

Segreto da nascondere a chiunque e portare via con se 

Ma Maria si siede lì con il suo gomitolo 
Senza fretta senza rabbia senza chiedersi perché 
Troppo grande anche per lei l'ultimo ostacolo troppo stanca per 
Lottare ancora e decise di andar via in quel giorno di un agosto 
Troppo tiepido fece finta di dormire per non risvegliarsi più e ha 
Difeso il suo segreto fino all'ultimo stretto 
Dentro ad un gomitolo con il coraggio e con la dignità 
Nella vita di Maria nessun miracolo ma 
Una splendida bugia che vale mille verità",Sulle spalle di Maria,2018

Y las palabras de aliento y el abrazo 
El compartir con todos ellos la factura 
Que nos presenta la vida paso a paso 
A mis amigos les adeudo la paciencia 
De tolerarme las espinas más agudas 
Los arrebatos del humor 
Le negligencia, las vanidades 
Los temores y las dudas 

Un barco frágil de papel 
Parece a veces la amistad  
Pero jamás puede con él 
La más violenta tempestad 
Porque ese barco de papel 
Tiene aferrado a su timón 
Por capitán y timonel 
Un corazón, un corazón, mi corazón 

A mis amigos les adeudo algún enfado 
Que perturbaba alguna vez nuestra armoní­a 
Sabemos todos que no puede ser pecado 
El discutir alguna vez por una amiga 

A mis amigos legaré cuando me muera 
Mi devoción en un acorde de guitarra 
Y entre los versos olvidados de un poema 

Mi pobre alma incorregible de cigarra

Miro,"Edgar était un vrai saoulon 
Il écrivait toute la journée 
Il n'écrivait pas de chansons 
Mais des contes où l'assassin 
L'emportait toujours haut la main 
La victime était homme de bien 

Le soir Edgar de la folie 
La plus atroce se sentait pris 
Malgré les honneurs et les prix 
De l'alcool était avili 
Courant d'une ruelle à l'autre 
Son paletot se déchirait 
Dans la boue il se rassasiait 
Dans la vermine il se vautrait

À boire à boire pour le génie 

Prenez garde au fou qui sommeille 
Au fond d'un manoir décrépit 
Jouant de ses mains anguleuses 
Une valse de Chopin affreuse 
D'une femme il était amoureux 
Comment la convaincre que le bleu 
N'est pas la couleur de ses yeux 
Mais bien celle des démons hideux visqueux 

À boire à boire pour Maître Edgar 
À boire à boire pour le génie 

Voilà longtemps que je j'ai bu 
Jusqu'à la lie mon dernier verre

Qu'il venait d'obtenir la palme d'espoir des auteurs du pays 
Dans le canal il était gris 
En proie au delirium tremens

Délirer son génie immense 
À l'hôpital puis il mourut

To a house just by the moon
You gave me silver loving

You asked me to the theater
In a place quite near the sun
You gave me golden sunbeams
Your act was all in fun

Rope ladder, rope ladder
Rope ladder to the moon!

You asked me to a meeting
In a cottage in the snow
You gave me central heating
I can't forget the glow

You asked me to a weekend
Down by the stormy sea
You took me to a ceremony
And the sacrifice was me!

You asked me to a storm cloud
Up near the rainbow's end
Then you threw away the ladder
And gave me to your friend

And you said its chief was me
Then you locked me deep inside you

I know he is near

Are the words that can start my heart singing

In the light of two eyes that adore him
And bore him it might
But he won't leave my sight for a glance

Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She's into new sensation
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night
She'll make you take your
Clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain

Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca

Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart
And she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleepin' pill
She never drinks the water
And makes you order
French champagne
Once you've has a taste of her
You'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane

What I want is for you 2 be wit me
Lovin' you everyday will be easy
What I no is that we will never be	
But that doesn't stop me from wanting the dream of reality

I saw you this mornin' as I left my house on the way to work
You were wearing the same old attire the pinstripe suit and shirt
If only you knew the things we could do 
As we crossed round the corner at the photo booth
Don't think I can't see your lusting for me
'cause I know your down with opp

Well I'm over here ,your over there
Tempting looks are all we have 2 share
But you can't take a bite of the apple inside
My body's pulsating at the thought of you there
All I want to do is hold you tight
Want to know how you feel inside
But I'm with another man day and night
And your girl sits on the next desk 2 mine

Don't let me show you my weakness
I'm falling deeper can't keep this
Burning desire that's deep in my soul

Mis-Teeq,"I'm gonna tell you a little story about this girl we used to know.
She's was a friend and so, I've only got one thing to say
She's so nasty.

Goes a little something like this
Hit it

Looked into my eyes as she passed me by.
A smirk on her face as she turned and said hi.
Standing over there, haven't got a clue about style or flair.
Watching my hair, don't go there.
Every time you see me you stop and stare.

Body language was weak so I turned the cheek.
Hold me back, I'm about to speak
I'm about ready gonna call ma peeps.
Listen up its da one Misteeq

She's a nasty girl 
Messing my world
A nasty girl 
And I said get up on the mic as we rock this beat.
She's a nasty girl
Messing my world
A nasty girl

Our style is unique
Can you take the heat?

She's a fake
Back in the day back when,
I had nothing , you were my best friend
Self seeking scheming
Change when you see a little money roll in

Pretentious, devious 
I should have never ever, ever, ever put my trust
Calculating and devious
Or should I say another one bites the dust.

Hold me back, I'm about to speak
I'm about ready gonna call ma peeps.
Listen up its da one Misteeq

[Chorus]
She was so nasty
She was really really really nasty
I'm gonna bring her down
She gonna bring her own self down

Gonna take her to the cleaners
Gonna wash your mouth out

How could you be?
(Shame on you)
So nasty?
(Shame on you girlfriend)
Spreading all your shit around
You just nasty

She's a nasty girl 
Messing my world
A nasty girl 
And I said get up on the mic as we rock this beat.
She's a nasty girl
Messing my world
Hear what I say
A nasty girl

And I said one, two, three, four
This just ain't the way it goes
Mama never taught you so
This just ain't the way you see
Change will come eventually
This just ain't the way it goes
Mama never taught you so
This just ain't the way you see
Change will come eventually

She's a nasty girl, come again
Messing my world, say what
A nasty girl
Sing it again and sing out loud

Mis-Teeq,"So you're coming into my house OK
Tell me if you're gonna stay
If you feel you can resist my ways
Say what you gotta say
Let's get forward, as we cut the chase
Tonight we go all the way
Do you wanna get busy
And You know I'm feeling jiggy
'cause tonight we gonna play

No point in waiting for you to call
Two hours straight no word at all
Time to get down for the physical
Been so long can't wait no more
Don't be shy - we can get it on
So give it up 'cause the night is young
Can't be tripping when I feel this strong, yeah
You can't deny that you dream of me everyday

Gotta keep it going
So we get hot
Forget about the clock
So we don't stop
You gotta keep it coming
Be a man and make a stand
Lose control
I know you think you're ready
But I think not
So come a little closer
And guess what?
I'm gonna tell you when you hit
The spot
Tonight it's on

So coming into my house it's okay
Tell if you're gonna stay
If you think you miss my way
Say what you gotta say
Let's get forward, let's get on the chase
Tonight we can walk away
To you wanna get busy
You know I'm get jiggy
'cause tonight we gonna play

How's it feel tell me what's the deal
No need for lies gotta keep it real
Took so long why you hesitate
That's why we're hooking up so late
If I didn't bother to step to you
You'd be out first base won't have a clue
I bet you're glad that we be getting it on
I gave you the feeling and I hope that you're here to stay

All I want is to be with you
Mis-Teeq with the one, Sunship

All I want is to be with you
But I just got to live, live my own life too
All I need to know that the world is nuts
Snap my fingers and everything is fine, that's all
Firing it up and away we go

Sitting, looking in the mirror
Like Alice, through the looking glass
Life's a never ending journey
Be careful not to go too fast

Sometimes I can't help myself
From falling in too deep
I know it may be hard to tell
Your love is calling me

All I want to be
And away we go
All I want is
Gonna get on the mic
Gonna make you whine

All I want is to be with you
But I just got to live, live my own life too
All I need to know that the world is nuts
Snap my fingers and everything is fine, that's all

Floating on a river of dreams
On a magic carpet ride
Take control of my destiny
I know it's just a matter of time

That I will find that Midas Touch
And everything will turn to gold
It would mean nothing
Without you here to hold

All I want to be
And away we go
All I want is
Gonna get on the mic
Gonna make you whine

All I want is to be with you
But I just got to live, live my own life too
All I need to know that the world is nuts
Snap my fingers and everything is fine

I can read it in the stars
That what I want is who you are
I will lay my hair down for you
A thousand times to show you

That when you reach me at the top
I'm gonna give you all I got
And wherever we will go
Our hearts will follow

It's a UK thing, stuff that we bring
No one to burn, let the journey begin
We're the Mis-Teeq, we're in chorus, we sing
Quick off the mark, ring a ding ding ding

In a mix with a bag of tricks
Feel the vibe with the one, Sunship
Move to the beat, it's about music
Roll through these tracks with the fresh tactics

And when they come around
They finally find a love forever strong

How could I be so blind
When all the time
I was in your heart
Here we go, here we go,
Move to the beat and go with the flow,
Come, come,
Gimme, gimme, come gimme more
Move to the beat pump up the tempo.
For so long I've been searching
For a love I call my own
Now I know I was only waiting
For the face I've always known
I believe what Heaven is
Just like this every time we kiss
Deep inside feel so high
Won't you tell me why

I can hardly get to sleep
You're in my head it's getting deep

When my feelings start to show
When my body tells me so, I know it's true

Like the sun on my skin on a hot summers day
Like a song in my head that won't go away
Like the smile on my face 'cause you make me happy

And I'm not looking back no more I wanna live

Mis-Teeq,"You get it back
You can't get it back
You get it back
You can't get it back

Verse one, when we begun
You know you had a sister all sprung
With your tongue
I thought you were my babe but no

When we laid
You always knew the right words to say
We got engaged
To be married the very next May

As the time moved on
The love we had got torn
You used to love me from dusk 'til dawn
But now you're trippin' from night 'til morn

Now you want me to change
I'm sick of you playin' these games
I'm tellin' you one thing
You wont get it back
You won't get it back, this ring

Gave you my love and I can't get it back
Gave you all my time and I can't get it back
Now the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back
'Cos it's just not goin' down like that

Gave you my time and I can't get it back
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back
But it's just not goin' down like that

You get it back
You can't get it back

Verse two, now were through
Too much time's been wasted on you
But it's cool
Put the glass shoe on another young fool

I accept that you cramped
And you couldn't take the heat
So you stamped, now upset
Don't come back for nothin' that you left

As the time moved on
The love we had got torn
You used to love me from dusk 'til dawn
But now you're trippin' from night 'til morn

Now you want me to change
I'm sick of you playin' these games
I'm tellin' you one thing
That you wont get it back
You won't get it back, this ring

Gave you my love and I can't get it back
Gave you all my time and I can't get it back
Now the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back
'Cos it's just not goin' down like that

Gave you my time and I can't get it back
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back
But it's just not goin' down like that

Boy, let me tell you this
Don't you know you can't get back
What you put in this relationship?
That includes this ring
'Cos I know I can't get back
All my kissin', huggin', lovin', [Incomprehensible]

We had a happy environment, I put on this diamond
I gave you my all and even met your requirements
Now you're goin' out, cheatin' and you're comin' up smilin'
You can say what you want but you ain't gettin' this diamond

You ain't gettin' this ring back, you tiptoed
You been livin' a stranger, just keep ya zipped closed
Did you really think that, that you can take me for a ride?
If you knock on my door, you know we're gonna collide

Gave you my love and I can't get it back
Gave you all my time and I can't get it back
Now the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back
'Cos it's just not goin' down like that

Gave you my time and I can't get it back
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back
But it's just not goin' down like that

Gave you my love and I can't get it back
Gave you all my time and I can't get it back
Now the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back
'Cos it's just not goin' down like that

Gave you my time and I can't get it back
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back
But it's just not goin' down like that

 Seems like the more the days go by
 The less I miss you by my side
 Lately you've been carrying on
 I've never seen you act this way
 All this cause i came home late
 I thought you had more faith in us
 Faith in this
 
 [Bridge 1]
 If you had just talked to me
 Then you would know how much I care
 Instead you chose to be
 Insecure and complicated
 
 [Chorus]
 How could you do me like
 Had your back when things got twisted
 No you ain't got it like that
 With me, cause I'm a queen
 And if you don't recognise
 I'm the most high
 And if you don't realise
 I'm the most high
 
 [Verse 2]
 No matter how much I did for you
 You would never notice me
 You never took me out for dinner
 You were always too busy
 I warned you that someone
 Could take your time and space
 But your ego kept tripping
 Now your baby girls slipping

 So you cause me fever
 Stan' up on the corner and a chat to Leana
 'Dem de type of summin de we say we na inner, 
 Inner hit the road
 Me a go tell you, you won't make it along
 Me love how, me love how, me love how you flow
 You never did know we run the show
 You've got me pacing like I've nowhere to go
 You got me caving like a man on death row
 What makes you think that I will settle for anything less
 Never wanted much from you, only the truth
 I gave you my best and that's all I can do

 I'm breaking these vows
 And taking some time out for me

You can take me home tonight
Take it slow boy we can chill
And if I'm feeling it I will

Maybe, would you let a thug give you a hug
Maybe maybe stroke your back till you fall in love
Maybe, If it's cool can I kiss you please
Maybe, love you down till we fall asleep

But I won't give in too easily

Mis-Teeq,"[Chorus: x 2]
What I want is for you to be with me
Lovin' you everyday will be easy
What I no is that we will never be	
But that doesn't stop me from wanting the dream of reality

I saw you this mornin' as I left my house on the way to work
You were wearing the same old attire the pinstripe suit and shirt
If only you knew the things we could do 
As we crossed round the corner at the photo booth
Don't think I can't see your lusting for me
'cause I know your down with opp

[Chorus: x 2]

Well I'm over here, you're over there
Tempting looks are all we have to share
But you can't take a bite of the apple inside
My bodies pulsating at the thought of you there
All I want to do is hold you tight
Want to know how you feel inside
But I'm with another man day and night
And your girl sits on the next desk 2 mine

[Chorus: x 2]

Don't let me show you my weakness
I'm falling deeper can't keep this
Burning desire that's deep in my soul
Now that your feeling you just can't control
Baby see my frustration
Unbearable situation
Your with her and I'm with him
So we can't let our love begin

Mis-Teeq,"Wake up early wipe the sleep from my eyes
Glance across the room its 8:45
Can't forget to hang the washing out to dry
Pick out my clothes so I can hit 'em with my style
Wash up my face and brighten up my smile
Fix up my hair and add some sheen so I can shine
Look at my watch it's saying 10:45
Grab me some breakfast, time to jump in my ride

My family is calling
I've been on the move since morning
Trying to fit it all in
Wish I could add some more hours to the day

[Chorus]
Check my mum and make sure she's OK
All in one day
Cook and clean cause nothing seems to change
It's everyday
Get my nails done, take a trip to Spain
Back the same day
Text my friends and drink some chilled Rosé
All in one day
On the move we keep on going no time to lose
And we're just trying to keep the day running smooth
Who says that we can't have our cake and eat it too

Benn to the gym and now I'm feeling energized
I had to exercise and tone up my thighs
But I got to pay m bills they're on the red line
Gotta rush myself to the meter now before I get a fine

Went to my mum and now she's cooking the dinner
I got to wait for the chicken to simmer
Rice and peas with some sweet plantine
Go grab your coat
Let's go shopping in Spain

As we listen to the man sing Andala
We roll down the street street to the bay
Buy what we can buy and head back to the plane
Cause we've only got one day to

All my girls shout
Let me see my sisters who go all out
Freshly dipped in caramel tans with the back out
When we do it right you know it's gonna last all night
When we get together know it's gonna be all high
And we don't need no fellas to spoil out vibe
And we goin' keep it rocking till the morning light
And we goin' keep it popping till the

Gonna make it up to you

How much that we share,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Tell me where the darkness is

Written with stories of those who dare touch it
Pages filled with feelings

This is fantasy
Let it go, let it flow

Close the book open it again
There are blank pages, simply close your eyes

In my torment, dreams and agony

Looking forward, don’t look back
Imagine the world
Without hate and pain

There are shadows surrounding me, the ghosts from the past

I tried to forget all misunderstandings of my words

In a world of hollow heads, what’s the reason?

Are you gone bust or play bones?

For the niggas that slept, they shoulda stayed in step 
And kept ya big fuckin mouth shut

Misery Index,"Thrust into this competition naked and undone
Back to back
Yet divided on our own
Fear breeding fear
Exploding pressures on
We're locked away in self-made chains
Run out through the windows and into the streets
Terror abounds as each man lives in fear
Dread consumes their day
The public is passive
Inactive
And lame
Lock up the doors and let out the wolves

While inside the soul is boiling over

The dead-end ambition
You'll eat yourself alive
Submit to the anger
The coming of vengeance
The cult of uncaring
The chaos of living
And face this world alone

Distorting your vision
You'll drink from their poison
So ripened for this fall
You take from the worst and give up the best
But never forget you're a human being...you breathe
But can you think?

See the fire in the skies
See them devastate the land

See the humans fight and die
See our planet laid to waste

When everything seemed lost
The hearts of men would not concede
No matter what the cost

Upon the Martian doors
The voice of war would thunder there

See the death of the warrior tribe

Misha Mengelberg,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Mishelle Bradford-Jones,"Well, it occured to me, this very morning
That every day lays out like Sunday for me
I sit around and watch the washing, dance around with Sally
I bust my automatic chance, a nine to five, I don't think I'd survive

I raced inside to find the meaning in the dictionary
I'm the cat and my guitar, so all so quite contrary
That's enough, I'm Bohemian, I'm not what I might seem
And I'm no baker or no butcher, candlemaker

Each day is like a dream boat
Go gently down the stream
Oh, life is what you make it, it's true

Each day is like a dream boat
Go gently down the stream
Oh, life is what you make it, it's true

Thinking what it might mean if I make a start
As I walk towards the bus stop, I wish I had a car
Inside this view, the wheels go round, the people up and down
Feeling like a lady leisure, maybe it's my lucky shirt

If my arms fail and my pieces are no more
And life decides to lead me to another closing door
I won't be needing horses or the suitable king's men
I can put me all back together again

Each day is like a dream boat
Go gently down the stream
Oh, life is what you make it, it's true

Each day is like a dream boat
Go gently down the stream
Oh, life is what you make it, it's true

Eight days around the garden
Waiting for the thoughts to grow
Skipping stones in rows and circles
Inventing brand new ways to go

And later on, I battle rules and shopping centres
Cupboard's bare, the dog forgot to mention
My family's coming round to eat and laugh and play
And share with me something I call another lazy Sunday

Each day is like a dream boat
Go gently down the stream
Oh, life is what you make it, it's true

Each day is like a dream boat
Go gently down the stream
Oh, life is what you make it, it's true

Make it, it's true, oh, life is what you make it
Gently down stream, go gently down
Go gently down stream, go gently down
Make it

Mishka,"Squaws out on the gulf stream
Big storms comin' soon
I passed out in my hammock
God I slept 'till way past noon
Stood up and tried to focus
I hoped I wouldn't have to look far
I knew I could use a bloody Mary
So I stumbled next door to the bar

And now I must confess
I could use some rest
I can't run at this pace very long
Yes it's quite insane
I think it hurts my brain
But it cleans me out then I can go on

Something about sunday
It's the most peculiar day
Strollin' down the avenue
That's known as 818
Feelin' tired that I gotta inspire
I knew that it wouldn't last long
So all alone I walked back home
Sat on the beach and then i made up this song

And now I must confess
I could use some rest
I can't run at this pace very long
Yes it's quite insane
I think it hurts my brain
But it cleans me out then I can go on

Well the wind is blowin' harder now
50 knots or there about
There's white caps on the ocean
And I am watchin for water spouts
It's time to close the shutters
It's time to go inside
And all week I'll be in Old Paris
Hell that's a mighty long airplane ride

And now I must confess
I could use some rest
I can't run at this pace very long
Yes it's quite insane
I think it hurts my brain
But it cleans me out then I can go on
Yes it cleans me out then I can go on
Yeah it cleans me out then I can go on",Trying To Reason With Hurricane Season,2013

Misplaced Comedy Group,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

And I match from head to toe, then to top it off

Insane with faith, I took the driving front seat
In the lowlight comfort of Berlin streets
The calm from emptiness duetted with my body heat

I was alone at the front line

The joy of a lifetime

I just can't think of England
I can't see the picture
I'm still running from the fire, the fire

I just can't think of England
I can't see the picture

I bought the peace before believing the threats
In a foreign field, I cut all regrets
But the boys in stories just repeat themselves in a fucked up mess

I was alone for the first time
The message I was told was to triumph at
The joy of a lifetime

Et je désespère dans mon hiver

Attentionnée et protectrice
Je les intimide et ils me laissent les mains vides

Et je désespère
Pourtant j'ai aussi besoin d'un doudou

La nuit porte ses étoiles quand je porte ma peine
Et je me dis que tout est fini
J'aurai eu beau chercher encore et puis toujours
Mais rien ne sert, personne ne me repère

Moins rêveuse et optimiste
Je les attriste et les rends mélancoliques
Plutôt distante et lunatique
Je les intrigue et ils me laissent les bras vides

La nuit porte ses étoiles quand je porte ma peine
Et je me dis que tout est fini
J'aurai eu beau chercher encore et puis toujours
Mais rien ne sert
Moi qui avais tant besoin d'un doudou

La vie passe ses jours quand je compte les heures
Où ce grand amour viendra dans mon coeur

Hell, I've watched you growing up

But it's the way that you get up that separates you from the rest
So stop giving in, and start living your life
And start speaking out
For something more til' you have it

Ahh but that don't bother - cold, in this big city babe [2X]
Ahh but that don't bother me [repeat ""me""]

I see the tears in your eye and your heart may cry
To my niggaz locked down it's gon' be alright
To my sisters in the hood tryin to make life better
You ain't by yourself, you're looking better
Whatever the storms that come
Life is full of them
Take a look in the mirror at yourself
Believe in yourself, yeahhhhhhhh

[Verse One: Jade]
Now I, understand that man gotta meet his quota but damn
Is it because I'm tan that you pull me over
My man, he gotta hustle cause he can't get a job
Slam the door in his face, because he caught a juvie case
It seems as if I got people tryin to pull me down
Red broads intimidatin insinuatin and hatin
I'm a young buck, keepin on a young tuck
Waitin for the next move, zippin up and lace shoes
And you niggaz tryin to get at me, uh-uh I never sweat be
This world is chilly but Willies could never catch me
Although you wasn't ready still ridin for you already
Make me wanna crack a vanilla dutch and smoke heavy
Oh, regardless you could come and holla at the O girl
The streets raised me so I'm ready for this cold world
You think you know but you have no idea
I'm never slippin, never runnin, here I go right here, c'mon

[Verse Two: DMC]
I be the microphone talker, the big street walker
Known to rock a rhyme, a bonafide New Yorker
O.G. godfather, like Afrika Bambaataa
DMC comes harder, cause he gotta be smarter
Growin up in the city I can't be dumb diddy dumb
I'd rather be sittin pretty than in a city like a bum
I roll with some killers, some real bug niggaz
And some real ill figures that ain't scared to pull the trigger
My homies all dead, in jail or doin life
While the honies give us his and we treat 'em like a wife
There's a whole lot of shootin, and executin
And the crew keeps gettin stronger cause we keep on recruitin
We can never die, we just multiply
We keep the records in the store for the streets to buy

Rest in peace Keith, Cowboy and Scott LaRock

[Verse Three: Sonny Black]
Can you tell me baby why the world is so cold
Why is Hennessy the only thing that warm my soul
Into the belly of the beast, I watch the hood cry
Gangsters bangin out I'm seein good niggaz die
The world is so cold, yeah I can feel the breeze
Hatred is sacred, life's a dying disease
Livin to hustle, down to die for cheese
Just hustlin with muscle slugs are flyin with ease
Behind bars baby I seen the world is even colder
It seems like the weight of the world is on your shoulder
Life moves along like the hands of time
Death brings life and life brings crime
Dyin is easy, but lifes tend to stress me
Livin through sin hopin God will bless me
And forgive me and save my soul
What he from heaven cause the world is so cold

Just, get here if you can

Any purse but had a curse that hurt worse than givin' birth 
My first verse explains some of the game she was playin'
I'm blamin' myself cause in my wealth was where her pain would haven 
Behavin' like a money hungry hooker, funny how the money took her 
From a average honey to a stunning looker 
I look back and reminisce how we used to kiss 
And smash hips in the GS I bought her last Christ' 
She got too big for her britches but The Britch is Over 
Not the one in Queens I mean the one she dreamin' wasn't sober 
Told her how I felt, gassed me when she cried for help 
Supplied the guilt trip and I was whipped without a fuckin' belt 
I felt stupid Cupid struck me with a poison arrow 
Shoulda drowned ya when I found ya crushin' in my boy's Camaro 
I didn't bother but you probably find your lover dead 
You robbed me of my honor, you ain't shit like my mother said

[Chorus]
Come back come back come back come back to me, Punisher 
Punish me, ah I've been so bad, so bad 
Won't you come back?

Nah baby, I'm not gon' be able to do it, you blew it 
Threw it all the way cause you was stupid, girl why'd you do it? 
I mighta knew it by the way you gave me your baby 
Then left a day before I ever saw the son that God made me 
It's hard maybe we can make amends, be friends 
But we're only hurtin all of us for certain by forsakin' him 
Just take it in, don't even say a word, observe 
The way you were, preserve, these words so you won't play the herb 
Ever again, never pretend that he doesn't have a father 
I'm always there and you don't wanna bother 
I honor my word on my father's grave, guide him through his hardest age 
So he can thrive and survive in these modern days 
I wanna raise my little man but you keep resistin' 
I'm insistin' you chill for real before you come up missin'
Listen, I don't wanna fight I'd rather do what's right 
A boy needs a father that's the most important part of his life

[Chorus: x2]

I gave you everything, love letters and sweaters with leather seams 
Feathered wings, and rings with emeralds right out of Geraldine's 
Simple dreams a dream fulfilled, the green DeVille Cadillac 
To mack, matter 'face redeem the bill
I mean for real I can play it mami how you wanna stay 
At Monty Frask, givin' the next nigga my punani 
You want me back cause he hit it wrong, now you wanna get it on 
With the Long Don, word bond my shit is strong (come back) 
Girl don't even start again, I beg your pardon 
And get your hands off my six button Cardigan 
This ain't no love lost between us far as I'm concerned 
Please leave, cut that busted weave I've been dyin' to burn 
Go buy a perm, try and earn some respect 
It's better to have loved and lost than live with regret

Come back, to, me 
I want you to

Alright, don't go, no

I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
The ones that look like Santa Claus
Christmas trees, bells and stars
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe

Now, Christmas cookies are a special treat
The more she bakes the more I eat
And sometimes I can't get myself to stop
Sometimes she'll wait till I'm asleep
She'll take the ones I didn't eat
And put those little sprinkly things on top

I sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe

I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe

Now those sprinkly things just makes things worse
'Cause it makes them taste better than they did at first
And they're absolutely impossible to resist
Some disappear to who knows where
But I make sure I get my share
And those kids just stand there waiting for the ones I miss

Sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
She gets mad that they're all gone
Before she gets the icing put on
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe

Now there's a benefit to all of this
That you might have overlooked or missed
So now let me tell you the best part of it all
Every time she sticks another batch in the oven
There's 15 minutes for some kissin' and'a huggin'
That's why I eat Christmas cookies all year long

Fff off I am running on my metal horse
A knight in the night there's only one thing I wanna do
