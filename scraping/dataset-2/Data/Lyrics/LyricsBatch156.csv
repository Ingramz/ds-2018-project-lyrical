DJ Kid,"Turn it inside out so I can see-uh
The part of you that's drifting over me-uh
And when I wake you're--you're never there
And when I sleep you're--you're everywhere
You're everywhere

Just tell me how I got this far
Just tell me why you're here and who you are
'Cause every time I look
You're never there
And every time I sleep
You're always there

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

I recognize the way you make me feel
It's hard to think that you might not be real
I sense it now, the water's getting deep
I try to wash the pain away from me
Away from me

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

I am not alone

And when I touch your hand
It's then I understand
The beauty that's within
It's now that we begin
You always light my way
I hope there never comes a day
No matter where I go
I always feel you so

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I catch my breath
It's you I breathe
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone

You're in everyone I see
So tell me
Do you see me?

Dj Koco,"Yea (House of Hits) 
Finally up in this nigga 
On the real all you crab niggas know the deal 
On the real all you crab niggas know the deal 
To my seed May I lead you into no breed of evil 
In the categories and stories I breed my sequel 
You know the money blues blunts broken 22's 
Monkey see Monkey do 
A shorty sipping sunny dew 
Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. that's mad smokey 
Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me 
Up in the Marriot, Sweet dirty tint, Don't make no noise cause we dirty 
Tell the ho's to hurry in 
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom 
And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens 
Rolling on you non descript niggas 
Your marked for death like colombians with bad coke that gip niggas 
Tilt the dutch, twisting up the uwee if your skilled enough 
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili's bust 

[Chorus] 
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 2x 

Now its verbal abuse cause the mic's in use 
This is your sorry excuse 
Get your neck put in a noose 
K-L is quick to let loose, to make your blood count reduce 
Over the snare drum 
We reproduce like cum 
Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was 
Giving life to idea 
Through the verse is what he does 

See a close call about two clicks from my fortress 
We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses 
QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us 
We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is 
We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess 
Accumalating to much cream for you to touch 
Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers 
From the ruckus 
Your gone and your crew still love us 
Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit 
I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent 
Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles 
Onyx pendants, and Rubied down shit from the nile 
Kamikaze style, sought the antique three pound 
Yo Nas, lets cop this brick and let the mobb supply the town 

[Chorus: x2] 

(Play some treats on us) 
Drugs in my shirtsleeve 
The side bubble converti 
Eyes low cause the lye blow 
Five-oh know we dirty drive slow 
Write a line sipping a glass of wine 
The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind 
When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with 
Exhale precise shine like cocian white 
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know 
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinite's and lexus 
So send my enimies a message 
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot 
I'm still protected 
So never ask why I write so violent 
My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island 
I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and 
When I performed niggas mic's went silent 
To the kid who made my man ill will bless this 
(On the real) 
When I catch up to your ass you know the deal 

On the real

DJ Kool,"Attention, all you niggaz
All you bitches
Time to put down the Cristal
Time to take off the ice
For a minute
Time to throw a little mud
In this motherfucker
Turn me up some
Yo

Oh shit
Who those motherfuckers
Comin' in here?
No, it can't be
Ah

Yo yo, gimme some room
I'm throwin' elbows
Timberland boots, Air Force
And shell-toes
Who the fuck is them?
If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'ma go pop the trunk and turn
The street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't VIP
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black
When I'm makin' the moves
Similar to the new PlayStation 2
I can't help it if the club
Only packin' a G
And the fire marshal want to
Shut it down in 3
And you ballin' as* niggaz
Whose dressed to kill
For the h*es showin' the toes
With extra heels (man)
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a carload of bitches
Charged on Belvedere
My niggaz hit the cells
If the line is thick
So I drive the 500, through
The door of the bitch

On the count of three
We gonna bumrush The Tunnel
With a pound of weed
Cut the light on, you see
It's Brick City in here
Blazin' like Biggie passed us
A semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed Doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it
When the dark is out
I'm outside of the line
And I'm actin' a fool
Like a three o'clock bully
Waitin' after school
(Punks) I've been in
This line for hours
I even killed the time by helpin'
My man pass out fliers
Now all I want to do is
Get in where I fit in
Shake my as* with the
Baddest pidgeon with her wig in
Jump, move, crash
Smoke, drink
Shake that as* stank
The fuck you think?
Poppa Bear at the table, and
The porridge is pourin'
Since +Def+ is the label
I belong in a morgue
I'm walkin' half-dead, actin' senile
With bigga niggaz from jail
Than the one on ""Green Mile""
I'll huff and puff, blow the club down
I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed Uptown

I lose some sails
And my boss won't be happy
But I can't stop listening to the sound
Of two soft voices
Splendid in perfection
From the reels of this record that I found

Every day there's a boy in the mirror
Asking me what I am doing here
Finding all my previous motives
Growing increasingly unclear
I traveled far and I burned all the bridges
I believed that soon as I had land
All the other options now before me
Will wither in the light of my plan
So I lose some sails and my boss won't be happy
But there's only one thing on my mind
Search in boxes, underneath the counter
On a chance that only tape I find
A sun forth, someone that needs somewhere
To long for
Someone who needs somewhere
To long for.

It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my times elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate

I wished for this, I bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create

I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise

I guess I'll save the best for last

You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes

If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it

Put me back together or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces
Then you can leave me alone

Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I've found out the hard way
Nothing is what it seems

Actual facts
The ghetto reacts to warfare 
Real bullets miss you by your hair 
Survival of the fittest 
Hell for the three time losers 
The prisoners of enemy maneuvers 
Hold down the fort 
Coz life is short enough to get it taken 
Forsaken when your mental planes' breakin' 
Concealin' a four pound with every area 
We surround coz clown 
I get down for my crown 
Take it to the streets for the 
Honor and respect 
Connect the lethal 
Plus my young guns are unbeatable 
Aiding and abetting the foul 
Is a violation 
That's why my retaliation 
Is premeditation 
The invitation 
Is to run with a crew you can't do 
And too great to infiltrate from a 
Nickel plate 
I state 
This be the illest ever known on a rush 
Swervin' with the Krush 

Slip into the world of shiesty individuals 
A troubled man stalked by criminals 
Creeping through the city 
I step on the block to chat with 
Thugs from all the drugs for fat cat 
Stepping off the set now hand on my tool 
Thinking how bad I want to flip on that fool 
Times are wasting 
Chasing these punks for petty loot 
When there is a real mission to execute 
I put the plan in effect 
Forget what you heard 
When you get the word from first and third 
For real I got the fam and all my soldiers to feed 
With the gunslingers on the block puffin' weed 
Envision the prison that I walk through 
Leaving any witness 
When I'm about to handle my business 
No escape from the duct tape and artillery 
Now tell me big man 
Where's the money ain't a damn thing funny 
 
Cops play for medals 
Killers play for corners 
In the middle are your sons and are 
Your daughters 
Who gives the orders 
To chaos and mayhem 
Who has the proper guidance and mind to save them 
From this cold world of heartless ghetto dwellers, 
Pimps, prostitutes, and dope sellers 
Strive to be the lead and not follow 
Ladies 
You can be the queens of tomorrow 
Dig it, I want all that and more 
For my peeps in the struggle 
Food, clothing, and shelter 
Is essential 
To maintain the hardcore from the soft 
That pushed me to the edge but I can't fall off 
My battlegrounds keep the sound of babies crying, 
Gunshots, and cursing 
Can you feel my reel 
Here's the deal 
By any means necessary 
Go all out 
And keep this alive 
Coz only the strong survive",Only the Strong Survive,1996
DJ Krush,"We're playing those mind games together
Pushing the barriers planting seeds
Playing the mind guerrilla
Chanting the Mantra peace on earth
We all been playing those mind games forever
Some kinda druid dudes lifting the veil
Doing the mind guerrilla
Some call it magic the search for the grail

Love is the answer and you know that for sure
Love is a flower
You got to let it, you gotta let it grow

So keep on playing those mind games together
Faith in the future out of the now
You just can't beat on those mind guerrillas
Absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind
Yeah we're playing those mind games forever
Projecting our images in space and in time

Yes is the answer and you know that for sure
Yes is surrender
You got to let it, you gotta let it go

So keep on playing those mind games together
Doing the ritual dance in the sun
Millions of mind guerrillas
Putting their soul power to the karmic wheel
Keep on playing those mind games forever
Raising the spirit of peace and love",Mind Games,1997

Yeah, and get down, word up you know the vibe bay

From all borders, doorways and gates
Resurrection draws near, mankind awaits
When you're livin' in this world you got to survive
Shaitan is lookin' on alert, attackin' from all sides
Witness before all eyes, the evidence of unseen
The power past the comprehension that controls all things
The battle fought by good and evil is a real contest
It is the outcome of the struggle that we play context
To all sets sections cruddy clicks crews and clans
Gilgreens to Badlands, jump up, to understand
I'm just a man, not the universal architect
We tread the face of this heavenly place, and show respect

Osaka, raise your hands, where you at

Strugglin' hard, to overcome the perils of life

My pad and pencil, will transcribe the elemental
The raw essential, the South bound residential
The pure and simple, to resonate in your mental
I flash a dimple, my Shine like precious metal
Left the rah rah livin alone, about to settle
Fast act tryin to go slow down, and save your petrol
Cause the beat don't stop, like yellow cabs in the metro
Rejoice your verse to Earth, as the verbs connects
This is a daily operation like birth to death
And I burst the breath, yep, as a so-called vet
I've orchestrated designs while they slept, quiet as kept
Everything that you heard in advance is just a glance
Of the landscape, furnish we Crops And props till
Sunsets and Tree-dots, back jobs Of pure skill
At night, I do right, to excite, what truth reveal
Got to believe, that the Most High I see
Every degree, of this three-see-ix-to-e
We maintain Son and carry on officially
From troubled projects to the shores of Tripoli
I speak prolifically, I write reciprocally
Transmit upliftedly, it sounds terrific G
Allah has gifted me, with great ability
To speak to my beloved, and make em all love it
Refined rugged, a product of the ghetto public

Suspended in mid air defy physics 
See I live it, she got a gap like bridgette, she get it
Ooh I'm so vivid, so descriptive
Girls they know how we move bad boy to 08 mike lowrie

Call me the quicker picker upper like bounty

DJ Lazy K,"Come on, come on
Come on give me that double give me that double, Give it to me
You never knew what it took to get here
They say life don't stop for no one
So I'm going back in my people
This what ya'll wanted right? You said you wanted the truth
So I solemnly swear, that the truth be told I'm thuggin to the day I die
It's Dipset, it's more than just music now
It's a way of life, it's more than the 200 hundred years of blood sweat and tears
Ho stand me? For all my ballers, my day crawlers... It's bigger than Nino Brown

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

It must of been a obsession, Had to make it large (Dreams)
Started my progression, I'd stay stayed with the huds (Down South)
Now it's private jets, smokin' haze what the stars (G4)
Quarter mill write the check is how we for the car (What's The Price?)
Switchin' lanes up 7th, Are we racin' the cars (Harlem)
But the boys still stressin', I'm facin' the charge (Yay-Ya Be Trippin')
Still prayin' to God, Cause lifes not promised, not even manana (Fuck tomorrow)
Remember movin' bricks, paranoid bout ehanas
Or even at the club, an them boys and then behind us
I'm chasin' death, gettin' closer to 30 (Gettin Older)
Sunny outside, but the work is dirty
Days out, Harlem nights, over in Jersey
In my rare view goin' home cause the vultures is thirsty (I See Em)
Pull that doubt you won't catch me in traffic
Dark tints on the V, when I lack it's the ratchet, bastidd

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

Now I'm the leader of the pack, Can't help to think back
How I was eager to sell crack, I thought it was the shit (Damn)
When they talk about my influence, I thought of uncle Ricky (Uncle Ricky Wha's Good)
He used to call up on his flip, he start snortin' on his shit
The same life had me gas'd, when I bought my first vic
I was heavy on the gas, when I bought my first whip
I thought I was the shit, you couldn't tell me nothing
I was 16, I told the teacha ""You can feel me fuck em"" (Feel Me Nigga)
Just any suits, pullin' up to club in Beamer coups
Gettin' cash (Gettin' Cash)
We livin' fast (Fast)
Different women every night, couple of bitches clashed (Fuck You Bitches)
I just laughed (Ha ha ha ha ha ha, Now Listen)
I almost got wiped out on the wave, Thought 11 was tsunami
For the prices of the yay (Fuck The City Up)
The hustlas, they know the saga of the story (I Know The Story)
We live sucka free and show problems to authority

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

One... Two, Feds comin' for you
Three... Four, Betta' watch the law
Five... Six, If you start pumpin' bricks
Seven... Eight, hope it ain't heavy weight

Ferrari dreams, feds spooked me in my nightmare
I tried to scream like Freddy Kruegers' in my nightmare (Livin' For The Fame)
So a nigga scared to go to sleep
Until the day break, I'm tearin' up the street
Porsche'n with the clutch, ballin' like the play off's
Top goin' 40 on the floor, with the safe off
12 car convoyed a road full of race cars
Till' the pilot give me 5 minutes before he take off (Roll Up)

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

That's my conclusion... See it's the fast life we livin'...
So I'm ah tell you, if you in the left lane
Keep going cause they right on your heels nigga (Squalieee)
And if they catch you, that's your ass...
And if you blink nigga, your life could be over (We Got No Time For Sleep)
I keep sayin' the rap game is like the crack game
Cause we could all end up dead or in jail
They got us under surveillance...
And to all my niggas behind the g-wall (My Soldiers)
Inhale, exhale... Shake your nuts if you have to (East Side)
And all the political soldiers that ain't never comin' home (RIP Too)
To all my homies, East Side...
While you in your cell, raise hell to this (Roll Call)
I do this for ya'll (Dipset)... I feel ya' pain (I'm On The Same Route)
I know what it's like hittin' the streets at ah early age to deal cocaine (It's Ah Cold World)
Survival, It's all about the struggle (We Gotta' Eat)...
So I dedicate this to you (My Soldiers)
Keep your head up and your eyes open...
Stay focused, It's us against them
I'd never let them take me alive, take me alive..

Take a journey wit ya' boy, let's ride..

I heard that true
Make things go up an' down
I heard that's true

I been through the full court pressure stage
The homies gave me a nine, the first time I saw a gauge
The first time I put my feet
Down solid mashin' on top of concrete

Before all the ways of war
House an' car doors felt the rays of war
When life was simple as shit
An' we didn't give a fuck about a bitch, 1986

It's all about lics, heat in the streets
Trucks with the beats
Bitches with biker shorts, worn all tight
Tryin' to get a pussy, just worn all night

Plus you had to be a baller to get the baddest hoes
Back in the days, 6-4 six trays
Back in the days, Elco's, S S's
The best is where the west is niggaz don't test us

Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?

Back in the days where them laces were thick
I was concerned with break dancin' an' layin' some dick
For whatever it's worth, I'm still doin' the smurf
An' I'm walkin' on this earth like I don't give a fuck

An' now I'm rollin' up in third gear
With 3 dollar bills, 3 more minutes to kill
3 more seconds to snap, 3 more bottles of beer
An' corrupt my lifestyle, so shut the fuck up
An' back the fuck up with that buck free style

Nigga, what freestyle, nigga?
Walkin' on a razor blade
Comin' through I got it made, posted up in the shade
Comin' through to get paid, sunny California, baby

I got subs in my trunk an' it's bound to bump
Straight smashin', hollerin' out, ?Wassup, Kurupt??
Wassup? I'm fillin' in my right mind, one to the head
An' I'm on the smash, hollerin' out, ?Wassup, Fred??

Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?
Just lay it on back, do you wanna ride?

I don't give a fuck, so fuck what they say
Nigga, won't you pass? Say, ?Pass the bombay?
Niggaz, they decide to ride an' they ride
Niggaz, they decide to lie an' they die

I can bust a fleet of hoes with my skills
I can make them hoes bow down, pay my bills
Think I can make them hoes convert to my will
Wanna bet I'll turn them hoes in the scrill'?

If you love a bitch, a bitch can drive you crazy
Anythin' a hooker do, it won't amaze me
You better be up on your game homie 'coz they be
They may talk a lot of shit but they can't fade me

If you hang around with suckaz then you may be
Another type of brother I don't want with me
When you compensate with bustaz you confuse me
'Coz I'm tryin' to stay out the penitentiary

DJ Linux,"King mob in a plastic iceberg
Smoking water damaged cigarettes
Observe as he works your wasteland
Pulling punches that you never met

Controlled in a listless air stream
Jets are breathing in his latex eyes
True to form, he is scared to touch them
And your wasteland stays vandalized

Success in a cut glass wardrobe
All the clothes loose like shredded hair
Dream escapes to a closet class war
King mob in a smashed wheel chair

Nerve gas for the walking wounded
Suffocating in a sadists' prayer
Flaming horses on a fading landscape
Break the surface but there is no air

King mob as he vents his anger
Throws a brick through the city gates
Backfires on his wordless offspring
The population disintegrates

Cold stream plus a wash of carbon
Drives his mind like an engine room
Cogs turning like a flawed stage whisper
King mob sings a lifeless tune

Surface stop
Pressure drop
King mob

Faded wrists and the risks worth taking
Cleans his blade with dreams he froze
Metal moments fed on foreign textures
Breaks his mind with the things he knows

King mob at his withered console
Electric arcades run on secret oils
Flicks a switch and he's the God of anger
Pulls a handle and the wasteland spoils

You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet
Yesterday I cried
Must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean
You'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that
When I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Just when you think, you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees

I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way",Bitch,2004

By Pigface
Album:
I love all aminals but they don't love me back.
I tend to put them in a state of full attack.

You think I'd pet a kitten and it would rub against me
But that doesn't ever happen
I must be made of sweetmeat.

Cause they bite me
They try to eat me alive
I get so frightened
I cry.I cry.

I want a pet so bad I can just taste it
I'd love to walk a dog and not be chased by it
You think I'd feed a stray dog and it would love me sweetly
But that doesn't ever happen
I must be made of sweetmeat

Cause they bite me
They try to eat me alive
I get so frightened
I cry

da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da

I can't even take a walk in the great outdoors
Cause suddenly I'm being chased by wild boars.
Squirrels hit me with their nuts.
Raccoons with their hissing bit
The deer they take turns kicking.
The rabbits try to maul me.
The snakes are licking lying
Their tying me down
They wrap them selves around my legs..
The poison me they paralyze me
The birds are pecking my eyes
They rip out of all of my hair
I tell them go on have a bite
Make a pig out of yourselves

I'm made of meat.
And I am sweet meat.

Like my first time on the night we met
I wish I could go back there tonight, tonight
Looking in your eyes the way you held me tight
Where'd it all the wrong, when it felt so right
There's nowhere I'd rather be tonight, tonight
Tonight
Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I held onto your every word
Trusted and believed, no matter what I heard
But that was then and this is now
You and me were like a movie scene
Superstars playing in a teenage dream
There's no rewinding life tonight, tonight
Guess you could've broken someone else's heart
I'm the lucky winner because I played the part
Don't want to say goodbye tonight, tonight

Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I held onto your every word
Trusted and believed no matter what I heard

You said ""I'll be your first, my love""
There'll never ever be another one 
Don't worry I'll tell no one
You and me together'll be so much fun
You said ""I'll be your first, my love""
There'll never ever be another one 
Don't worry I'll tell no one
You and me together'll be so much fun
Sometimes you gotta let things be
Even when the truth is that you lied to me
I want to keep these thoughts away, from me
From me
It's the little things that I dream about
That no one ever talks about
The little things I think about
That no one ever dreams about
The kisses that were promises
That were suppose to be planned
Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end

Funny how I held onto your every word

To drink her lips like nectar
On the mind of all that see
And I'm only here to tell you

Up to the same old game

The comedy, I don't regret
But instead forget to mention
A thousand times of taste and touch
Slightly slated not to be

Mean to make a mockery
I imply my apt intention
The devil in the details wails
For one day want of breaking free

And through the morning reverie

The ashes fall by morning
Landing safely on the ground

All fires rage with the sun going down

Every chance that comes my way
By every turn, I've left to burn
Still another will be sought

By that thing that rings the tuning fork
For the force of night and day
The sun shines as I slumber
To earn the evening I have wrought

I got my man and them stay pretty like I'm a stay shitty
Cuddy, it's all for the money, is you wit' me?
Hit the bitches, when I commit the crime
And when it's on, we transform like Optimus Prime
I'll form the head, roll out, let's make it happen
If we ain't gonna get it wit' them, we'll take a cap
Bustin' off, dustin' off 'cause them softest niggas
Money with the biggest mouth yo, let's off this nigga
A novice nigga never made a sound
Breathe too fuckin' hard and he gettin' bust down

Yo, yo, y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real? (Get at me, dog)

What the deal?

Y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real? (Get at me, dog)

Nowadays, it ain't lookin' too good for certain niggas, I'm hurtin' niggas
What you doin' robbin' niggas, jerkin' niggas, stickin' niggas?
'Cause they deserve it, with money got murdered
They know he died slow if they heard it
The nigga ain't blew up his spot a while
And the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while
Just take some light up, to fuck the night up
Blow everything in sight up
Fuck around and I'll have your ass right up
What makes you think you wasn't able to stand?
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of the hand
The days are longer and seems like I'm wastin' time
I've got a lot of dreams, but I'm not really chasin' mine
I soak it all up like you set the fire
Nowadays gettin' by, is nothing more than the occasional meal and gettin' high
I live to die, that's where I'm headed
Let your man hold somthin', now it's all about you can get it

Y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real? (Get at me, dog)

And I bet you wish you never got hit 'cause you'd be walkin'
But shit happens, and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wonderin' how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under they eyes, now it's surprise to the guys
And one of their mans was a bitch in disguise
Fuckin' with cats and order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holler at you on Baltimore shit
Know what I mean? I'm just robbin' to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbin' the street
When we starve, then we eat whatever's there
Come on, you know the code in the street, whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk
After the talk about him not being on the 11:33 to New York
Transformin' ass niggas will get it quick
And yo for real that nigga K can suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game
To barely move me 'cause when I blow shit up
I'll have niggas fallin' like white bitches in a scary movie
Ah, you know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas, it's like

Next time, the County or the State see me

You don't hear me though, you don't hear me though
You don't hear me though, see'mon, see'mon!

Watch them young guns that take none, nobody safe
from the Friday the 13th, ghetto Jason
Itchy trigger finger achin, snatch yo' ass
out that S-Class for fakin, forty-fo' blast
is a bloodbath, take your first step down a thug path
Ain't no love here, just slugs here
Kids know the half you get plugged here, that's just impossible
for the weak to last now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin you, watchin me
Throwin rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young G we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
Cause we family for better or worse, you and I
from the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
to be here, and each year, I'm pourin out more beer

Hot corners, cops with warrants, every block is boring

My dawg, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl
in the stomach, he robbin niggaz who pumpin
Lil' Blood got popped, by the Group Home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats
Fiend yellin out, who got those? Go and see
shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin from court cases
Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The Mayor want to call the SWAT team to come and kill us
but, dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
to get revenge, and we ride to the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's
and only five in, the Belly of the beast
Didn't want to hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggaz from the hood, hangin off his teeth
We slangin to eat, bringin the heat
Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh

The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed

Beat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED
How MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer

Rap artist and I'ma start this
Shit up for real, get up and feel, my words
I make herbs split up and squeal
Ill, is all I've been hearing lately
Niggas hate me, wanna duck tape me and make me
Put their brains on the wall, when I brawl
Too late for that 911 call
Niggas stay beefing but a lot of them bluffing
But not me because I'ma nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them tough? That's just a front
When I hit them niggas like 'What you want?'
The battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggas chasing 'em down
We all knew that you was pussy
But I'm tasting it now
And never give a dog blood, 'cause raw blood will have a dog bite
Biting whatever, all up in ya gut
Give it to them raw like that
And ain't no love I do 'em all like that
Four right up in they back (Clack, clack)
Close your eyes baby, it's over
Forget it, happened in front off your buildin' but
Nobody knows who did it

Keep 'em running from the Werewolf, oh
Howling at the moon on the roof
Eh, ah, no, get 'em
Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have 'em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back, strike back
Left him like that, laying up with the white hat
Getting right back at ya when I snatch ya
Up out the grave, nothing but bones and ashes
Hitting niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red
But this girl gave me head for free
'Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003
That nigga D took it there
He thought it was a joke
He ran through like 20 G's, thought that I was broke, stupid
That's what you get for thinking and eventually
Found that's what you get for stinking
Blowing up the spot when you rot
Plus if it gets hot they know you dead
Four squared box
Hit 'em with the ox to the grill
Eh, ah, kill nigga kill
Yet still they don't know I'ma rob

Never turn your back on you don't trust 
Never turn your gat on and don't bust 
Never expect to give away with cent more than twice 
Never forget you could get it too for a price 
Never bring a two and if you scared to die

You whack, you're twisted, your girl's a ho
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and everybody know 
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, ""So? 
I love my baby mother, I never let her go."" 
I'm tired of weak-ass niggas whinin' over puss

Fake up-North-type nigga

Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water 
We done been through the mud, and we quick to the slaughter 
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out 
We run up in there, everybody come out, don't nobody run out 
Sun in to sun out, I'm a keep the gun out 
Nigga runnin' his mouth, I'm a blow his lung out 
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin'

In the Bible I read, death is of the tongue
And if you talk about death enough, death is gon' come
Dave taught me how to flow, they shot him in the head
Randy ass was there, now he runnin' scared
Some say I'm gangsta, some say I'm crazy
If you ask me, I'll say, ""I'm what the hood made me""
Now I can stunt 'til my ass dead broke like JD
Or put a hundred grand on e'ry nigga head that play me
See I'm cool with them Haitian mob niggas
They say sak passe nap boule and rob niggas

Back to the street again, it's all hood my nigga
Knock on wood my nigga, we both walk the dog
We ain't get to where we at by luck, shit was hard (aight?)

Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

I could flip that flow, I could stick that ho
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that yo
And the thing about the shit I came through, I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's having dreams
All nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever
The closest thing to me is gonna get it, but, never
Will I, can I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holding, on 'til, what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom
These other rap cats will give a nigga room

I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with the gift
I'm the best, so, unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk pass the doghouse, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start running
'Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm coming
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm broke so I'ma bash his head wide open
Begging me to stop but at least he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack
Two glowing red eyes, everything else is black

When the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thanking me for their help
Hoping that they not around when it gets dark outside
Sun's going down you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge, with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day that's when your luck stops
One drops, and another and another
Gun pops, going through you, hit your mother
When does it all end? I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fucking with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight cause I'm so high

Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why 'cause
Getting measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives is a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove

Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your hair
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game, rhythm player

Looking like beef
Tell them I'm lurking nigga don't sleep
I'll ride into your village on horseback
Five thousand soldiers in my fleet
But it's looking like war
Looking like beef
And they've had nothing but invisible beef
They can bring Zeus because I'm like Ares
I'm a warlord but I've never been Greek
Now it's looking like war
Looking like beef
Looking like you coming up against me
Looking like Bugzy Malone's top 3
And set man are getting too old to compete
Set man are getting too old for this grime ting now
Man are way too old for these beats
When the album dropped everybody stop listening
To his album after one week
Now you're looking confused, looking at me
You sing now but you didn't sing last week
Oh you want to make a track for the galdem
Because the galdem love beauty and the beast
This one's a robbery with no baly and gloves
Man know I got a bare faced cheek
I'm not from London but when I go London
Man know I got a army behind me

Come to town and fuck up the whole grime scene?
How much money does he make per show?
And how much did he make from the EP?
Wait and all that from his own label

How did he get that car? (Life!)
How did he come so far? (Life!)
How did he go from selling drugs signing on
To becoming a star? (Oh Life!)
I'm like the Leonardo DiCaprio forget about trophies
I just want to know have you ever counted
£500,000 out in £20 notes? No?
'Cause I've never been standard
You can get lost out here, get stranded
Anybody coming to the North tryna fuck with the King
On a boat or ship and get anchored

Most of these MC's are just muppets

I'll make a dark-skinned MC crumble
Just like a double chocolate chip cookie
I'm King Kong
I'll make a light-skinned MC sound like a new born puppy
They can team up they can round the whole scene up
It's not going to make a difference on G-Dot

Acabamos de llegar a Las Vegas
Cero atraso vuelo directo
Tú sin pensarlo a mi cuerpo te pegas
Sin estrés todo perfecto
Puedo causarte diferentes muchas emociones
Besos que cuando te toque no habrá reacciones
Te quedaras frizzada un poco trastornada
Tranquila ma te noto desesperada

Que bien no la pasabas se notaba
Que era mentira cuando decías que bien vivías
Hace tiempo que no sonreías yo veía
Como me encantaría que esta aventura
No tuviera final fuera para siempre
Hacértelo a diario sin censura
Penetrar lo más profundo de tu vientre por siempre baby

Te gustan las mujeres, pero te encanta el bicho 
Yo estoy claro de lo que de mí te han dicho 
Que lo tengo grande y que bien rico chicho

Y dale, métele, solo por capricho, so métele, motívate
Agárralo con tu mano y verás que es algo sano dale para adelante y para atrás y súbete en el palo 
Ven lúcete, no me hagas perder el tiempo
Dale ven que me siento contento
Este bicho parece cemento

Yo sé que a ti te gusta cuando hacemos el amor 
Y prendemos en llamas juntos en la habitación

Yo soy un demonio por dentro de tu cuerpo, tú vas a venirte otra vez 
Yo te exploto la traquea y después hacemos la cabrona 69 al revés 
A mí me quieren matar, pero ella me chinga para atrás y me quita el estrés
Por party cobraba mil, después cobré dos mil, pero ahora estoy cobrando tres

Haciéndolo contigo yo me crezco 
Bien rico te lo voy entrando bien lento

Ahora se pasa en Snapchat mandándome fotos del culo y el crico

DJ Luis,"Uh, it's really goin' down in the South bitch
Yeah nigga, we know hip hop and rap
And all that shit started in the motherfuckin' East

Know I'm sayin'? Then it went to the West coast
And they did it a little bit better
Know I'm sayin'? But now it's our time
To shine down here nigga

Know I'm sayin'? So since y'all niggaz keep sayin'
We ain't real hip hop down here
We don't wanna be down with you bitch ass niggaz

So y'all stay up there with that bullshit
This country rap tunes down here nigga
Young Pimp, Young Bun, Underground Kingz

All the O.G.'s that's recognizin' the real
I got love for y'all but all you bitch ass niggaz
Talkin' down in ya records, you can eat a dick
Hold up

Pushin' cocaine, servin' pounds of weed
Steady stayin' on the grind
Pussy nigga can't say he ain't hatin' me
Because if you did, then you wouldn't be lyin'

But how in the hell am I supposed to respect the man?
That talk down on every song
You steady actin' like a bitch, you steady cryin' your eyes out
Say my name pussy nigga, we can get the shit on, on, ooh yeah

Quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, gettin' money
Quit hatin' the South, baby
Quit hatin' the South

Well, it's been a long time my nigga, I shouldn't have left you
When I some real trill shit to go left to
Gotta lot of respect fool, for the ones before me
But when my time came they act like they ain't know me

I've been down with rap music since Cold Crush and Melle
Before MTV put Run-D.M.C. on the tele
Back when Whodini tried to tell ya about ya friends
Nigga I was givin' rap all my time and my ends

Bought damn near every record the motherfucker dropped
West coast gangsta music, East coast hip hop
Now it's our time to shine and the tables is turned
Them motherfuckers aggravated 'cause we gettin' some burn

There's no room for everybody, just a few niggaz is swole
Probably 'cause they favorite rappers ain't in control
But just let go of the past 'cause it's hurtin' your hands
And pass it over to the next generation of fans

And quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, getting' money
Quit hatin' the South, baby
Quit hatin' the South

I'm blastin' off on you hoes like NASA
You double standards and hypocrisy remind me of Massa
We ain't good enough to eat at ya table but when ya dick get hard
You wanna run up with [Incomprehensible]

I from the get coke but I'm still clockin' figures
Bitch hoe cock suckin' nigga
And that goes for all you visitors too
If you don't like it down here, get the fuck on fool

They say you can't rap and they questionin' our intellect
Friendly ass niggaz jumpin' bad on the Internet
Ain't nobody typin' that much can't be a danger
Catch you in person, bitch I'll break yo' fingers

It's some trash in the South but I promise you
From the East to the West, some of y'all garbage too
As long as the beat knock and the lyrics hot, son
I can give a rat's ass where a rap is from

I remember N.W.A. and PE
Had me feelin' like a rapper was the thing to be
You can't fuck with Willie D, UGK either
Disrespectin' the code, does motherfuckers neither

Quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, gettin' money

To all the radio, TV and even the press
Been hatin' on the Sizz-outh like we ain't impress
Y'all think we came in the place, say man we came in the state
Y'all shoulda listened to Andre, bitch we got somethin' to say

And all you washed up rappers, you ain't what it's about
I see y'all tryin' rap like us and puttin' grills in ya mouth
Y'all buy the beat, buy the beat like y'all bouncin' and twerkin'
But hoe we know what's goin' on and bitch that bullshit ain't workin'

I'ma O.G. Rock Ball, write my name up on the wall
Fuck yo' bitch and hit the switch and put my dick up in her jaw
I'm Sweet Jones, fucked a clone, legend on the microphone
Player's choice, silver Royce, keep yo' bitch's pussy moist

I'm bumped the school, that's how I do, sippin' drank, each teen night
In Benz, big blue lens, knock this bitch and fuck with her friend
Candy cart, squeeze 'em out, bought the ranch man fuck the house
And y'all still gotta buy y'all dope from us
So what the fuck you bitch niggaz talkin' 'bout?

All you ole sensitive ass niggaz, know I'm talkin' 'bout?
Y'all niggaz on y'all period up there bitch
Know I'm talkin' 'bout? y'all hide behind them e-mail addresses
Sendin' that bullshit through the air

Bitch, say my name bitch, I'ma come to ya house
Fuck how you feel, country rap tunes nigga
They put all y'all records on one side of the store
And put all the country rap music on the other side of the store
And see who sell out first

Bitch ass nigga, it's ya own fault ya shit ain't sellin'
You reap what you sew and fuck you in ya pussy
Keep talkin' that shit
Them young gladiators go come get you too partner

Already, UGK for life, fuck how you feel about it bitch

We representin', kid, we representin', what?

DJ Scratch
What, I represent, I represent
Infinite J
What, I represent (represent)
Daddy Rae
Represent (represent)
Magic Mike
Yo, I represent, I represent

I represent 10 albums at twenty seven years old
Millions of copies sold and four albums that went gold
I represent a Benz, BMW and a Cherokee
And still the industry won't respect me
Yeah, they give a lot of respect and props
But then the rappers that get em done had albums that flip-flopped
I never flopped an album in my career
You could stand in my shadow and you still couldn't see me here
So brother, check up on your Billboard pops
And you'll see I got more slots than a cheetah's got spots
I wrecks, gets wicked, you niggas couldn't stick it
Forget it, you regret you ever stepped to this man, so bet
I recollect, a-mic-checka 1-2 and what you're thinkin'?
I want respect like Aretha Franklin
So when you see me just back the fuck up
'Cause see, your shit was like my dick right now (and that sucks)
I represent a strong black mind, I'm one of a kind
Vice President of my own
Makin g's on the microphone
I gets props, I get fan mail, hell
I'm the man of the hour, got more power than that kid Fidel
Castro, as if you didn't know
It's all about do-re-mi, so follow me, hoe, so
It's the Magician and I'm magically stickin'
'Cause you're magically imitatin' and misrepresentin'

[Chorus: x8]

Goddamn, I am what I am, watch me wreck it
I microphone-check it, Mr. Cool, Calm, Collected
Goin' buck wild damn, I got mad styles, 'ooo child'
Things'll get easier meanwhile
I represent the hood where I grew as a kid
To wreck shop, so I did, not your everyday normal neg-
Roe, I'm dishin' out mad flows, you know I'm a rhyme pro
So don't even front, hizzoe, mizzym
Styles are nothin' short of dope
If I wanted em clean, I woulda wrote my shit down on a bar of soap
I gets intricate and slit your throat
With skills so unreal you get chills on each and ever note
So all you want to be's, nigga please
Back the fuck up cause Royal Posse MC's will take you out with ease
We got it goin' on, you know it won't be long
We got your girlie sayin' (he-ey that's my song!)
Infinite the lyrical injector, come selector
Like Wu-Tang said you best protect your neck
'Cause I ain't got no heart for you, for you I have no heart
My crew'll rip your ass in two like in Jurassic Park
If you step in our way you best keep steppin', son
'Cause we're (movin on up) just like the Jeffersons
Now you been rocked by the Infinite
I gots to get the hell out and let the next brother come and represent

[ Infinite Jay (& all) (8X) ]
I represent, kid (we representin, what?)

Hah shit - gimme this mic, I got some shit I want to stress
Relax, release, represent, gets off my chest
You niggas know that I'm in it for the action
'Cause 'I'll be there' like my name was Michael Jackson
I find more skies to make money than Delta
I guts niggas like a fish and murder em up like helter skelter
Who felt the, wrath of my staf, I'm cuttin' niggas in half
Servin' myself a bloodbath with just one paragraph
So slow your roll, I want to know how you figure
That you were quicker and bigger, bigger and quicker than a bigger nigga?
I stay strong in a battle, I never fled
I gets juiced like Tupac and say em (this nigga's scared!)
'Cause we make shit to make your speakers thump
And to that nigga at Maniac, we pissed in the fuckin' swamp
I got niggas bobbin they heads and grabbin' they dicks
And yellin' out loud (yo kid, that's the shit!)
The unorthodox I drop, you can't touch
You hang around my jock so much your name should be Nuts
So 'do you know..' who you're fuckin' with
'Cause when you step to the Posse you get your wig split
I see you carbon copy rappers don't understand
'Cause Rae starts screamin' like Chris Tucker (piss off, man!)
And now it's over, I know you can't get with me
'Cause I be chillin' with my brothers droppin' ('agony')

I represent, kid (we representin', what?)
I represent, kid (we representin', what?)
I represent, kid (we representin', what?)
You know I represent, kid (we representin', what?)
I breaks em up, represent, kid (we representin', what?)
I represent, kid (we representin', what?)
I represent, kid (we representin', what?)
You know I represents, kid (we representin', what?)

DJ Manian,"Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden the faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the madman

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young

Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures given up today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
Oh let it come true

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, and ever?

Into white water,
Far from the islands.

Never going to get to France.
Could a new romance ever bind you?
Walking on foreign ground,
Like a shadow,
Roaming in far off
Territory.
Over your shoulder,
Stories unfold, you're
Searching for sanctuary.
You know you're
Never going to get to France...
I see a picture
By the lamp's flicker.
Isn't it strange how
Dreams fade and shimmer?

Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town

You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere

You thought you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand
In return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out

DJ Marco,"On the floating, shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
til your singing eyes and fingers
drew me loving into your eyes
And you sang
＂Sail to me, sail to me, let me enfold you＂
Here I am, here I am waiting to hold you
Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you here when I was full sail?
Now my foolish boat is leaning, broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sang, ＂Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow＂
Oh my heart, oh my heart shies from the sorrow
I'm as puzzled as a newborn child
I'm as riddled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Or shall I lie with death my bride?
Hear me sing: ＂Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you＂
＂Here I am, here I am, waiting to hold you""",Song to the Siren,2012
DJ Marco,"Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the face of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you found that special thing
You're flying without wings

Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You find it in the deepest friendship
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So impossible as they may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
'Cause who's to know
Which one you let go
Would have made you complete

Well, for me it's waking up beside you
To watch the sunrise on your face
To know that I can say I love you
In any given time or place
It's little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you mine

And it's like flying without wings
'Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings

And you're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy you bring

The Queen Latifah the King of 45 
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor 
I make beats she rock rhymes so I gave a 
A sample sound the she added a compound 
Word this is for those who haven't heard 
A King and Queen combine minds and trample 
Those who oppose us here's an example 

It's time to run, the King and Queen is on the set 
The competition is petty and ready to step 
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one 
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one 
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken 
Queen Latifah's outspoken 
Use your imagination, picture this 
Any male or female rapper trying to diss 
Here for excitement and enticement 
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment 
Teach the youth, feed the needy 
Confident descendant of Queen Nefertiti 
The mother of civilization will rise 
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation 
Secondary but necessary to reproduce 
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack 
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind 
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher 
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys 
I'm steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy 
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King 
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring 
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation 

Technician, musical musician 
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction 
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most 
Creativity, you get a double dose 
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test 
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet) 
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one 
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one 
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum 
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em 
I rock, never hyperventilate 
Others get tired, could use a commercial break 
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias 
It takes a ton of M-C's to prevail against me 
Just listen, I'm unstoppable 
You want a mission? This one's impossible 
Beats rock all night with no curfew 
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue 
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it 
If the style fits, I wear it 
Many attempts were made, none was recognized 
45 King said sample soundified 
I'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next 
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet 
Studio mixer, I got the formula 
And said the man from self, I'm warning you 
It's my domain, just ask my chauffeur 
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa 
On top, it's a usual act 
Can't wait to get down to 45 Studios

Don't let nobody ever your feelings

There ain't a day when I don't get that feelin'
But about tonight, the vibe is right
Am I'm damned if I can hold it any longer either
Just for tonight, the vibe is right

My glock bursts, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Ya head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aw shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'
However, I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin' terror, quick damage ya whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous, cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow sparks like Waco, Texas

I watch my back like I'm locked down, hardcore
Hittin' sound, watch me act bugged, and tear it down
A literate type asshole, songs goin' gold, no doubt
And you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that
Carryin' gats but yo, my Clan
Rollin like forty Macs

The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot ya knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga
So bad, stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on ya ass like your dad, bring it on

Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus

Yo, I'm more rugged than slave man boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp!
A mud hole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through ya back swish
Givin' bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin' prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You want to bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' gain, I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin'

The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scattin' off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin' your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where I come from, gettin' visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin' on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural

Pierced your internal, streamlined compartments

Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

Bitch stop my momma serve, free lunch from the church
I come like a thousand doves
Bitch you quiet at the bus, makin' the fuss, I gots tough love
Unglove the news, watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

After laughter, comes tears

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

I'm the Osirus of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
It's like this ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swingin' swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds I pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performin' live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
It's my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan, into the fire
Transform into the Ghostrider, or Six Pack
In A Streetcar Named Desire, who got my back?
In the line of fire holding back, what?
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped, and they trying to twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned, for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
Clot, we smoke pot, and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loot my voice on the LP, my team is on to slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what?  Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For, judgment day come'th, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
The fake false step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king

Watch for the wooden soldiers, see-cypher punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular
My beats travel like a vortex, through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
Program fat baselines, on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck I'm duckin' five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save shell from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo! Yo! Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lampin' like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy Green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing, thousand dollar court by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission hold the
Fuck up, Allah fasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, Black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese
Is that so?  Caesar needs the greens
It's Earth, ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Hey yo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul off
Connect thoughts to make my man Shai walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York gank adviser world tranquilizer
Just the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While, my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see ya, the number one traffic
Sit down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex, the white-gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God, substantiala

Eighteen karat rap between noodles

I saw ? sippin' Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin' off the hip

Now what you talkin'? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin

Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ""Any Means Necessary""

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine

Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force

Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance

I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

You told your great tale and it's always the same 
""Quite a shame that it goes this way,"" is what you said 
How very bizarre, all these blood-letting games 
""Quite a shame that it goes this way,"" is what you said 
[repeat] 

Every time 

(It's such a shame) 

You told your great tale and it's always the same

How very bizarre, all these blood-letting games 
""Quite a shame that it goes this way,"" is what she says 

You told your great tale and it's always the same 
""Quite a shame that it goes this way,"" is what you said 
How very bizarre, all these blood-letting games 
""Quite a shame that it goes this way,"" is what you said 

Still smell of fear, she came again 
A frozen wall like teenage skin 
She'll break my fall, begin my friend 
Small substance cloud like sinking sin 

You told your great tale and it's always the same 
""Quite a shame that it goes this way,"" is what you said 
How very bizarre, all these blood-letting games 
Quite a shame that it goes this way 

It's such a shame 
It's such a shame",Shame,2002
DJ Mea,"We go our separate ways through the portals of love
Truth was in creating, not the aftermath
Can't say I was nothing before you came into my life
But I will keep the memories for when my soul gets weary

Bittersweet stores, they always have no end
In the quietude of daybreak, we watch the sunlight bend
Can't say I was nothing before you came into my life

DJ Mehdi,"I’ve seen that same look
In your eyes before
It ain’t good for you
It ain’t good for me
It ain’t good for nobody else
Lord knows i’ve done my share
Plus a whole lot more
Now you’re through with me
But i’ll stay true to you
You see I ain’t got nobody else
And time flies
You’d better not let it run away from you
You’ll never get it back now
So take me back now
Can’t you see i ain’t got nothing left
Baby but you, you, you
You’ll never get it back now
So take me back now
Can’t you see i ain’t got nothing left
Baby it’s true, true, so true
You’ll never get it back now
So take me back now
Can’t you see i ain’t got nothing left baby but you
Can’t stop thinking about
The moment you walked out that door
Wasn’t good for me
Wasn’t good for you
Wasn’t good for nobody else
And Lord knows I’ve done my share
But lords also knows
That you don’t care

And hold the line

Stay on point and you'll get yours
The Good Lord unlocks many doors
See God don't change us, players because the devil ?
I'm telling you

It's the hands free, hurt you virtue
Patience, I been chillin' where you make your mistakes friend
I mean I be building where you renting your space see
I'm clean, all I ever had was my horses was for the reign
Grand stay clear of slander, its naked to see
That you a fake, when I talk about me, the lawfully wed
I've read six bars written over three days
Spittin em two or three ways, perfectin the phrase
Never on some ""hurry up and wait for a plate""
I'll eat what's available, my fate is unjailable
Patron saint of the flow, you're like ""say it ain't so""
I'm full circle though, no way to corner me
And I'll be right here ridin camels through the eye
A brainstorm buyin time like Superfly
So I can smell the roses in the rap narration
Of my legend, twenty five years in the making

I dreamed of being seventeen up in the magazine
On my most Special Ed, but that wasn't even half the dream
Shoulda seen the cream I had eyes for, the hots for
Hard dick lyrics bangin on the locked door
That this nigga named ""In"" rest beyond for a long time
Though we wouldn't even correspond
So it was just me, propostionin Mr. 'Dustry [industry]
Like ""trust me, it's way husky""
I got the hottest rhyme book around
I cook the sound medium rare
Let the big snares blare

I live and breathe this, Mr. In Dustry just
Give a listen, you can find out what you been missin
Total package with the golden options
I can leap over lies and mash down doctrines
He wasn't even hearin that
That's okay though, it came the time to analyze the cliche that goes

Haste makes waste
Walk don't run, take time to be safe
Fuck around and get egg all on your face
Pace yourself son, PACE
Your body just pace
Cuz you could work hard and never blow
Or you could work smart and better your flow
You can't hurry game though
You fuck around and get egg on your face
So pace, your body just pace

It ain't to be gotten dick ridin

Rhyme victory raps that patience is the author of
The wack dudes burn fast like sparklers

DJ Melo-Mix,"Bounce with me, baby, bounce with me
Roll the windows up baby, blow an ounce with me
We tight of the green and Hen
Get in the wind
Pick the chipped up flip up and call your friends
Lets do it till the police kick the doors in
Tell them niggaz get to steppin', let all the hoes in
Make room for this big body
In a big body, pimp caso, the life of a 'cardi
Brave, back as a spade
Teeth glistening, hard core, hittin'
EightBall the one they mentionin'
Hot South southern fried everybody want to taste
Erase hate, and bring love to a dark place
Show my face, and get love when I'm recognized
G and me in the 5 gettin' high
Ball has got cheese
Showin' love with the thicky
Relax your mind and baby bounce with me

Chorus
You could cheef on a leaf in a jeep with me
Break it down, make it fat, fire it up with me
But you know what I really want you to do with me
Bounce with me, baby, bounce with me
You could sex on ex in the lex with me
Lick it up, lick it down, baby, work with me
But you know what I really want you to do with me
Bounce with me, baby, bounce with me

Get on a continental jet 7:30 in the A-M
A-T-L bound tryin' to escape the mayhem
Beeper off, at the Swiss with my mistress
Kissin' me, and lickin' me, actin' like she miss this
Playground just for her to play in the hay around
Fringe benefits, make her want to stay around
Money makin' cats with gats who love hood rats
Thug players who make tracks, and bust raps
Confidentialy, we represent Tennesee
Gain control, puttin' soul in this industry
Bounce, baby, bounce
Shake the room up
Do it, keep it hyped
So we can blast off
High into the sky
Until the beat stops
But don't stop, till all the hoes clothes drop
Call big Ball Dr. Sticky, got the remedy
Throw your hands up and baby bounce with me

Chorus

Now I have been many places, seen so many things
Did what a lot of niggaz only see in they dreams
Hoes used to be like, uh, nigga you too big
Now they let me bust shots all over they wig
In the bed, on the floor, hot tub everyday
I know it be this way, cause I make a lot of pay
I smoke a lot of hay, tune up mentally
Gentally, grab a pen and kill the enemy
Dead, cause everything I said flip like work
Made a stack, bustin' raps, doin' concerts
hate to see a player doin' good, I know
Behind my back, talkin' shit like a little hoe
Little did you know, I got the people standin' up
Tucked away, in the cut, makin' platinum stuff
EightBall spittin' nothin' but poetry
Relax your ind, and baby, bounce with me

DJ Melo-Mix,"These are the tales, the freaky tales
The tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales, the freaky tales
The tales that I tell so well

I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I soaked her pans
We ended up freakin' by garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak was all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Mary
Talked about sex and the girl acted scary
I heard she was freakin' for my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece
She only talks about signin' a lease
I met this tender, her name was Lori
And a X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was Michelle, 
Her booty was bigger than a tale on a whale
When i freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than flames in hell
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammy
I didn't want to do it cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend, her name was Jane
I pulled to the side and I spitted that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespan
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name was Janine
She was thirty-two and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I want to big freak, fat and sloppy
I kick on back and I watch her mouth
Two tons of fun, big mama jama
A country-girl from Alabama
I met this girl, her name was Betty
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Donna
She was a built little freak from China
I said I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm havin' so much money that I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my home and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I tell you more
She was down on her knees beggin' to blow
She's like another freak named Rene
You get her alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
But a freak like Rene, you can have it your way

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well

I met this girl, thick as hell
Only sixteen, said her name was Linell
I took her to my house, I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than Central Safe
Let me tell you this since we talkin' young
I met another girl, said her name was Yvonne
Always talkin' about havin' fun
Once again in the bed I got it goin' on
I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk
I try to get funky like female funk
So when you see me comin' or see me goin'
I keep my money, let the hoes keep throwin'
I once met a tender, she did it for free
On the Foothill bust number forty-three
All the way on the back she was workin' me
Had my big beatbox and I was jammin' the beat
I met this freak named aunt Winell
Macked on the baby like an ice-cold vet
Everythin' she had is what I get
Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita
Baby thought that $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she can suck my peter
Or even go home cause I  knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again I took a second look
Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept lookin', well, I kept stairin'
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'
She never left, she cutted out
I know you all know what I'm talkin' about
There's a freak named Shannon, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's gettin' thinner
Shannon is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's goin' on
She had another buddy, came by my place
Thick ass bitch, said her name was Grace
She walked in the door wearin' a lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named Belinda
Homeboys call her Belinda the Blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl slick like olive oil
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad he blood would boil
But I rapped her all up like aluminum foil

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well

Shockedy life, Friday night, it's goin' on Too $hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like Mary's sheep
I hitted around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Anita and her man's in Santa Rita
I took her to my home and homeboy, I geed her
Set her on the way the very next way
Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped to this girl, her name was Roseann
We hitted the motel and got it goin' on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Sherrie
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg to let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top and she was up under
The bed hitted the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a date with girl named Kitty
She was so fine with big fat tiddies
All night long she was actin' shitty
So i macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
There's another girl, her name is Rose
I use to roll baby like brand new Volv's
I never saw Rose wearin' clothes
She's a pimp house pet, ready to pose
I was ridin' down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to poem it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was Bunny
Said I was the only man who ever called her honey
Everythin' I did to her was funny
I macked on bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight a date with Shirlie
She was really short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirlie was freakin' like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my navel
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the brood up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed and I got it on
I grabbed the microphone and started to sing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this, they might be freakin'
But, boy, you never had that T-P-Treatment",Freaky Tales (Beat),2000

Ya hear about tha latest westside killin'.

Set trippin', 
Fo' dippin', 
Get tha grip in, 
Neva slippin'. 
BG's tryin tah hang out, 
But OG said take ya little ass in tha house. 
My big homey just got out, 
Used tah be down now he's just crack ad. 
He's bout hard as Darth Vada 
In his sweat shirt, khakis and Chuck Taylors. 
Just see him in the drive way, 
Gettin' beat like a smoka fool 'cause it's Friday.

Why must I be like dat and chase da cat, 
Or settle for a hoodrat. 
Dookie braids no dreadlocks, 
Flyin in and out of jail have a chicken and a cock. 
And I love her 'cause she down, 
Tah fuck around wit tha underground pussyhound. 
And her ass is big round and wide, 
Jacked up makin' nigga down tah ride. 
Smokin' indo, 
Playin' dat Super Nintendo, 
Hear a rat tat tat on my window. 
Gave her ass dat pelvic thrust, 
Don't trust tha rubber 'cause its bound tah bust. 
In tha oven in tha nappy, 
I had on two so I was happy. 
'Cause dat HIV'll make ya dick hang sideways, 
And dat ain't cool fool 'cause its Friday.

Throw tha west side in da air, 
Throw tha east side in da air, 
Throw tha south side in da air, 
Throw tha north side in da air.

We can't stop now bitch!!!
We can't stop,
And you can't stop us,
So bitch don't try.
We tru soldiers, we don't die,
We don't die, we don't die. 
We don't die, we don't die.

I'm bout my paper, my paper,
Important people on my pager.
I might not drink Alize,
But I'll smoke you under the table.
Don't make me peel your potato,
Don't make the devil your neighbor.
I might not be nothing to you,
But I'm the shit on this label!
Five hundred words might make it hard to digest what I say,
But five up in the morning, see me on the billboards
Y'all gonna keep it that way.
Hold on as tight as you can,
Whatever you do, don't loosen your grip,
Not only are they anticipating your every move
They're waiting for you to slip!!!
But like I told you before, we not gonna fall, put a banana in the tailpipe,
I'm not bout livin' in no six by six, wearing no muthafuckin' jail stripes.
Been bout it from the start nigga, we raw nigga,
You don't want to, go to, war nigga.
We superstar niggas,
You know who we are niggas.
From poverty in the projects,
To livin' large niggas.
It take one hell of a combination, to get what we got,
We soldiers on a mission, and you can't stop us!!!

[Chorus]

Nigga want to start shit,
That they know they can't finish.
By far niggas want to go to war,
But they know when they ain't winning.
Fixin' to keep this bitch jumpin, like a muthafuckin', second line,
Been bout it, and I'll be rowdy, and you gonna know it by my, second rhyme.
No limit chain around my neck, so check, and respect the sign,
Y'all want to play, but I guarantee that you won't play, a second time.
Sometime I'm in camoflauge and sometime I'm in all black,
Y'all want to go to war with us, wit you knowin' we all strapped!!!
Fuck it, pop it, don't stop it, 'cause I drop, by no means, look,
Bitches dyin' like a dope fiend, while he have on a pair of old jeans.
Nigga what?  pistols we all got, sometimes it's all glocks,
Keep one in the chamber for danger and make sure they all cocked.
Went from a, small knot to a tall knot,
Nigga please, I got all the g's for breakin' these ki's down to all rocks.
Blow up the spot till it's all hot, surround the world together 'cause y'all not,
Nigga we ain't gon stop jus 'cause y'all stop then it's our props.
If you want to get it started, then let's started, but let's do it right,
But if you want to get started, get started, let's do it tonight!!!
Likely to get your head busted, lined in some chalk.

DJ Melo-Mix,"Now here's a little story - I've got to tell
About three bad brothers - you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, M.C.A., and me - Mike D.
I had a little horse named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer
Riding across the land - kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse on my tail cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself - without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin' hot - the beer is getting flat
Lookin' for a girl - I ran into a guy
His name is M.C.A., I said, ""Howdy"" - he said, ""Hi""

He told a little story - that sounded well rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand - and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry - he asked me for a sip
He said, ""Can I get some?""
I said, ""You can't get none!""
Had a chance to run
He pulled out his shotgun
He was quick on the draw - I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said,

""Now my name is M.C.A. - I've got a license to kill
I think you know what time it is - it's time to get ill
Now what do we have here - an outlaw and his beer
I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear.""
We stepped into the wind - he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over but it's ready to begin

""Now I got the gun - you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me"" I said, I'll ride with you if 
You can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this - I did it like that
I did it with a whiffleball bat
So I'm on the run - the cop's got my gun
And right about now - it's time to have some fun
The King Adrock - that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.""
We rode for six hours the we hit the spot
The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
M.C.A. said, ""Yo, you know this kid?""
I said, ""I didn't."" - but I know he did
The kid said, ""Get ready cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money.""
Pulled out the jammy - aimed it at the sky
He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" - and let two fly
Hands went up and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
""I'm Mike D. and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""
M.C.A. was with it and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face
The piano player's out - the music stopped
His boy had beef - and he got dropped
Mike D. grabbed the money - M.C.A. snatched the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.",Paul Revere (Beat),2000

Knick knack patty whack give a dog a bone
Yo, don't give him nothing but a microphone
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
You said I'm not the E, you wanna make a bet?
Remember this: Lounge, you in the danger zone
I figured you would, now leave me alone
You pick and you wish on a four-leaf clover
To be the E double E over and over
You're intrigued by the way I do my thing
(Do what?) Pick up the mic high and make it swing

[PMD]
I have the capability to rap and chill
Cold wax and tax MC's who tend to act ill
It's like a Diggum Smack
Smack me and I'll smack you back
I get goosebumps when the baseline thumps
A sucker MC arrives, now it's time for lunch
When I'm cooling on the scene, I notice one thing
I'm not Bounce, so sucker MC's cling
I consider myself better than average
Yo, I rock the mic like a wild beast savage

[Erick Sermon]
I'm in the bottling state, I can't concentrate
I make a move like chess, and then I yell ""checkmate""
You know why I get zanier and zanier?
Because of EPMD mania
When I walk through the crowd I can see heads turning
I hear voices saying ""That's Erick Sermon""
Not only from the women, but from the men
You know what? It feels good, my friend

[PMD]
I'm the P double E, the Thrilla of Manilla
Better known as the MC cold killer
PMD cold keeps the place jumping
And if not then we feel like we owe you something
Like lotto, you have to be in it to win it
But if the beat is fresh then Diamond J will spin it
If J spin it, then it has to be fresh
To make you dance until there's no one left

Cause you a customer

[Erick Sermon]
Praying like a prey when the fox in action
I smell blood, no time for maxing
Camouflage in the green, my back is arc
Plus you in trouble cause it's after dark
My eyes close like Steve Austin, I got you in the square
I won't let you run, nah, that ain't fair
So I clear my visions until I can spot him
Snatch him by the neck and say ""Hmmm I got him""

[PMD]
Whenever MC's, you're in over your head
My rhymes are hungry plus they haven't been fed
The process of elimination is quite simple
Let you grow like a blackhead and pop you like a pimple
Slice you like lettuce, toss you like a salad
Revoke your MC license if your rhymes ain't valid
As we go on, sucker MC's sound wacker
Like a parrot says ""Polly want a cracker""

[Erick Sermon]
It was a record test, nothing we can't handle
At the house they had the mics on the mantle
Looked at the DJ and said ""May I?""
Lit it up like the Fourth of July
Because I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Whoa, I'm the E of EPMD
I have a strong point of view on the way things run
Just shut up and listen and learn my son

[PMD]
Absorb that ass like Bounty, the quicker picker upper
To tell you up front, you're nothing but a sucker
The style we're using, no doubt copastetic
You try to bite and yet sound pathetic
Design my rhymes like a taylor, floatin' like a sailor
As the P gets stronger, MC's get staler
Not bragging or protagging, surely not fagging
MC's surrender, raise the flags and
Give up the titles because the signs are vital
I keep a voice tuned at a slow and swift idle

You a customer

[Erick Sermon]
I need a man meal sandwich, yes I need Manwich
I feel good, now it's time to do damage
I feel like balanced, you know what I mean?
Wanna rhyme one time, to release the steam
When I grab the mic I get dramatic like an actor
You know why I get over? I'm the master
I do a show, pack it in til it's clamming up
Look for the microphone then jam it up

[PMD]
You said you see me jamming in New York Tech
You got one right fella, you deserve a check
How did you know, you must have been jocking
How do you know the places I be rocking?
Don't follow me fella, every move that I make
I'm hostile now so I'll give you a break
Well search upon me but don't go past the limit
Here's a card and on the back is my fan club digits

[Erick Sermon]
There's two things to check out in the words that I'm saying
Plus listen to the good time playing
Bro is bad, the strings he's plucking
Fire rhyme after rhyme, watch MC's duck and

[PMD]
MC's, the final countdown
You look tired, can you go the round?
If you can, I'll slap your hand and give you credit
And if not, I'll turn around and say ""Forget it""

Is a word we use everyday
Most the time we use it in the wrong way
Now you can look the word up, again and again
But the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends

And if you ask me, you know, I couldnt be much help
Because A friend is somebody you judge for yourself
Some are ok, and they treat you real cool
But some mistake kindness for bein a fool

We like to be with some, because they're funny
Others come around when they need some money
Some you grew up with, around the way
And you're still real close too this very day

Homeboys through the Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
And then there's some we wish we never knew at all
And this list goes on, again and again
But these are the people that we call friends
 
When we first went out together, we barely knew each other
We had no intentions, on becoming lovers
But in no time at all, you became my girl
Me and you, one on one, against the world
Talkin on the telephone for hours at a time
Or else I was at your house, or you was at mine
Then came the arguements and all kinds of problems
Besides making love, we had nothing in common
It couldnt last long because it started out strong
But I guess we went about the whole thing wrong
Cause out of nowhere it just came to an end
Because we became lovers before we were friends

You say you and your girlfriend were so tight
You took her out with you and your guy one night
She even had a set of keys to your home
And you shared mostly everything you owned

But as she shook your hand, she stole your man
And it was done so swift, it had to be a plan
Couldn't trust her with cheese, let alone your keys
With friends like that you don't need enemies
 
You wonder how long it was all going on
And your still not sure if your man is gone
You say, well if she took him he was never mine
But deep inside you know that's just another lie

And now you're kinda cold to the people you meet
Cause of something that was done to you by some creep
But nevertheless, I'll say it again
That these are the people that we call friends

Criando y cuidando de mi, madre mía
Con estas palabras quiero demostrarte
Todo lo que siento y también explicarte
Que entiendo las veces que conmigo te enojaste
Que entiendo las veces que me regañaste
Ahora se que lo hacías por el bien mio
Madre nunca me dejaste pasar hambre ni frio
Porque tu calor de madre siempre ha estado ahí para mi
Y no creas viejo mio que me olvido de ti
De tus esfuerzos de darme siempre lo mejor
De darme fuerza cuando he estado de lo peor
Perdóname madre si te hice llorar
Perdóname las veces que te hice rabiar
No hay mujer en este mundo que ocupe tu lugar
Porque madre hay una sola y no se puede remplazar

Tanto que has hecho por mi
Cuando niño no comprendí
Tras los años que has sufrido
Pero sin embargo he tenido tu calor

Siempre humilde, de buen corazon
Y siempre como madre tenias la razón
Quisiera darte el mundo madre si pudiera
Y todo lo que hay en el del resto fuera
Porque lo que único que importa para mi
Eres tu y que mis hijos y familia
Estén bien de salud
Recuerdo cuando me enfermaba y estaba muy mal
Corrías de inmediato conmigo al hospital
Tu nunca dejaste que algo me pasara
Y si algo había que hacer lo hacías por la cara
Ahora deja darte un abrazo y un beso
Porque te quiero con toda mi alma y por eso
Perdóname madre si te hice llorar
Perdóname las veces que te hice rabiar
No hay mujer en este mundo que ocupe tu lugar

Cuando niño no comprendí
Tras los años que has sufrido
Pero sin embargo he tenido tu calor

No había limite en las cosas que tu hacías
Por mi y mis hermanos tras las noches y los días
Como lo hiciste madre dime
Todo el sacrificio con tres hijos vuelta en Chile
No hay forma en este mundo como te pueda pagar
Tanto drama hasta los años que tuviste que pasar
Enfrentando diferentes situaciones
Madre como tu hay una en millones
Soy realista y se que algún día te me vas al cielo
Ojalas sea yo el primero
Madre verte bajo tierra no lo quiero ni pensar
Tranquila madre mía el cielo puede esperar
Fuiste tu la que me dio la vida
Con mucho amor
En cambio yo te di preocupaciones y dolor
Cree madre nunca fue la intención de herirte
Por eso escucha lo que tengo que decirte
Perdóname madre si te hice llorar
Perdóname las veces que te hice rabiar
No hay mujer en este mundo que ocupe tu lugar

And I hate to tell you too much, 'cause I stay with too much pride

And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don't need no rush
Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh
Can I be with you just one night, I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri's

I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right
Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
I ain't thinking I ain't right, can't decide but I can't fight
Easy baby you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine

Or at least try, can I speak up?
Was it peace out? can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots? What's your flavor?
Flat drinks we call A cups

I just think I need one night
Slightly more if it's done right

And still I'm trying to get up
That great big hill of hope
For a destination

And I realized quickly
When I knew I should
That the world was made up of
This brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head

And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high

And I scream at the top of my lungs
What's going on?
And I say, hey, hey, hey, hey
I said hey, what's going on?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
And I try, oh my God, do I try
I try all the time, in this institution
And I pray, oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution

And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head

And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high

And I scream at the top of my lungs

",What's Up?,1994
DJ Miko," Twenty-five years of my life and still
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

And I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of
This brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

** And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?
And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what's going on?

Ooh, ooh ooh
And I try, oh my god do I try
I try all the time, in this institution
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution.

And don't be steppin' on my shoes

So now I travel everywhere with mack mack mack 
I crack heads till I'm fed, and I dodge tricks

D-boys in two songs, niggaz I got that Nelly curse
So dig down in your purse, the wait no longer here
The type of niggaz, type of killers bootleggers fear
Now they may rock the party, see me I'm off the yam
They bought a dub or two, I'm like a thousand grams
My pistol in my hand, I'm confiscatin rocks-es
No SoundScans nigga I'ma see my pockets
So lay it down player, your face to the flo'
You do yo' dance baby girl bend your back low
See you can ride to it, might even drop a tear
I'm smokin sticky bubble kush album of the year
Watch how they talk about me, watch how I set up shop
I'm DJ Unk, Legal Records, beat'n down yo block
Watch how they talk about me, watch how I set up shop

DJ Muggs ,"Don't get nuthin' confused about me, this nigga hea throw clips
You think you could hold three, nigga hea go six
I bring heat like Deniro flix, my team lock and load
And rock and roll like Aerosmith

Fuck cops I got Cochran Shapiro chips
One point five in ice in each earlobe shit
Fuck who you and your man go get
Me and cat take pussy's on boat rides on some Soprano shit

Move wit troops in cougar coupes
Like beeno and notes for a G a piece, they'll remove your roof
Ya better spread when the ruger shoot
Paul Cane got fire, everything ya heard on Clue was the truth

It's like who want what what ever
Yo and your man play tough ya gon' get plucked together
At gun point gettin stuck together
Black Benz tinted out, buggy headlights stuck together

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us

They said I rap like a man and act like a man
So when it come to war she gon' clap like a man
Short arrogant wit this gat up in my hand
Chicks don't play cute I'm still attractin' your man, come on

Rock many lands, Japan to Philly sands
Luck stay ghetto like Rican dolla bands
Only thing I take serious is garments and money
And late periods, there she is

Screamin in a two by two, too fly two seater
Too much ice, too cold, two heaters
Love men but got lesbian guns
That love to lick off at you pussies for fun

So play dumb in these dum dups, hit you where you pump cum
Stick you for your lump sums, we the ones you run from
Till the day my lungs done for blocks
I hit hard like Ronnie Lotts, lady Luck got it locked

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us

Ya talkin' greasy like Paul ain't a nigga wit fire
Like I ain't got guns or killers for hire
Got wolves that'll run through mask and arms
Like point break clear the safe out and smash your moms

Over 40 years old still blastin' chrome
Smiles never cross they face till there's cash in palm
'Cause they still do murders for bucks
Have 'em put hollow points through you then pass the burner to luck

We like a two G Bonnie and Clyde, back to back in beef
Wit two heats a piece, mami gon' ryde
Spit four, she behind me wit five
You know Paul Cane and Lady Luck MO catch homo's and slide

Before we drop the guns
Wipe off the prints, push the pedal through the floor
And get away back to the bricks, ya don't want nothin' wit us
Paul Cane, Street Life, Desert Storm, we're dangerous

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
