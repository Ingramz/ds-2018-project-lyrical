Treblemakers,"You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Hey, walk out that house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I looked at my cotty, are ya out of control?

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewellery that's always on whoa

I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies, it's on
Then pop in the next 'cause this mix'll be ours

We keep a fade away shot
'Cause we ballin' it's Platinum Patron that be ours
Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you the drink with all that goodie powers

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

Hey, Shawty must know I'm the man
My money love her like her number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans
My Benjamin Franklins

A couple of grands, I got rubber bands
My paper planes makin' her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my hand
We buildin' castles that's made out of sand

She's amazin', fire blazin'

Hotter than Cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster

I'm in a daze, that bottom is wavin' at me
Like, damn it, I know you
You wanna shoot like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your gopher

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

I'm spendin' my money, I'm out of control
Somebody help me she takin' my bank roll
But I'm king of the club and I'm wearin' the crown
Poppin' these bottles, touchin' these models
Watchin' they asses go down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down",Right Round,2012
Treblemakers,"I've been living for the weekend but no, not any more.
Cause here comes that familiar feeling that Fridays famous for
Yeah,I'm looking for some action and it's out there somewhere
You can feel the electricity all in the evening air

Yeah, it may just be more of the same
But sometimes you wanna go where everyone knows your name
So I guess I have to wait and see
But I'm just gonna let something brand new happen to me
But its alright, its alright, its alright, its alright
Bright lights in the big city
Belongs to us tonight

I've got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Know everybody knows I've got the magic in me
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me
Now everybody wants some crystal magic

Its tricks that on a tempo will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse I'll hypnotize you with every line
I'll need a volunteer
How about you with the eyes
Come on down to the front and sit right here and don't be shy
So come one, come all and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, no ghosts or poltergeists
You know I'm no Pinocchio I never told lie
They called me mister magic man
I'm floating cloud nine

I've got the magic in me
(I've got the magic baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold

Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent

Vente conmigo

Hoy estas en mi mente, usted causa locura
Y es cuando la cosa se pone mas dura
No intentes ni pienses que te de ternura
Vámonos a hacer travesuras
Ma', te siento caliente
Vamo'a prendernos on fire
Después tiramos bolitas de humo
Como ninja guaya
Guaya, guaya, pasa de la raya
Después que me pruebes no vas a querer que me vaya
Go, mami 
Baila, mami 
Que tú eres la reina del party

This Land is my Land
From California
To the Boston Harbor
From the Redwood forest
To the Gulf stream waters
This Land was made for you and me
As I went rambling that ribbon of highway
I saw above me a polluted skyway
I saw below me a congested highway
This Land was made for you and me
On Sunday morning in the shadow of the steeple
By the welfare office I see my people
They stood there hungry, I stood there screaming
This Land was made for you and me
Nobody out there can ever stop me
When I go walking that Freedom highway
Nobody out there could ever make me turn
This Land was made for you and me
As I went walking I saw a sign there
And on the sign it
Said no trespassing
But on the other side it said nothing
That side was made for you and me!

I dress like a thief I feel like a soldier
I'm on the ladder getting madder and madder
'cause rung after rung my song goes unsung
I sweat and toil over a bucket of oil
I see my chances dim and my blood begins to boil
I'm on the jobsite from morning to night and it feels like I'm wasting my life
That's how I feel every single day
Wasting my life as the radio plays
I'm just a blue collar rock n roller

Trees,"Sweet William rose one morning bright 
And dressed himself in blue 
""Come tell to me the long lost love 
Between Lady Margaret and you"" 

""I know no harm of Lady Margaret,"" said he 
""And I hope she knows none of me 
But tomorrow morning before eight o'clock 
Lady Margaret my bride shall be"" 

As Lady Margaret was in her chamber high 
A-combing up her hair 
She spied sweet William and his bride 
As they to the church drew near 

She threw down her ivory comb 
And tossed back her hair 
And from the room a fair lady came 
That was seen in there no more 

The day being gone and the night being come 
When most men were asleep 
Sweet William spied Lady Margaret's ghost 
A-standing at his bed feet 

""How do you like your bed?"" she said 
""And how do you like your sheet? 
And how do you like the fair lady 
That lies in your arms asleep?"" 

""Very well do I like my bed,"" said he 
""Very well do I like my sheet 
But better do I like the fair lady 
That is standing at my bed feet"" 

The night being gone and the day being come 
When most men were awake 
Sweet William said he was troubled in his head 
From a dream he had last night 

He called his weary waiting maids 
By one, by two, by three 
And last of all, with his bride's consent 
Lady Margaret he went to see 

He went unto the parlor door 
He knocked until he made things ring 
But none was so ready as her own dear brother 
To arise and let him in 

""Is Lady Margaret in the parlor?"" said he 
""Or is she in the hall 
Or is she in her chamber high 
Among the gay ladies all?"" 

""Lady Margaret is not in the parlor,"" said he 
""She is neither in the hall 
She is in her coffin 
And a-lying by the wall"" 

""Tear down, tear down, those milk white sheets 
They are made of silk so fine 
That I may kiss Lady Margaret's cheek 
For ofttimes she has kissed mine"" 

The first that he kissed was her rosy cheek 
The next was her dimpled chin 
The last of all was her clay-cold lips 
That pierced his heart within 

""Tear down, tear down those milk white sheets 
They are made of silk so fine 
Today they hang around Lady Margaret's corpse 
And tomorrow they will hang around mine"" 

Lady Margaret died of pure, pure love 
Sweet William died of sorrow 
They are buried in one burying ground 
Both side and side together 

Out of her grave grew a red rose 
And out of his a briar 
They grew in a twining true lover's knot 
The rose and the green briar",Lady Margaret,1970

A veces es ángel y a veces demonio
Así la queremos porque con su amor lo tenemos todo
Es inexplicable que le aceptemos todo
Pero lo que sucede es que con ella actuamos

My younger sister, Erika, just adopted a child
My older brother served fifteen, he made it out
Even though my father loved me, I ain't seen him for a while
Had to fight my baby, bitch, give me my nigga now
Cause I'm running out of time and I need him to understand

I'm surviving cause the lines ass crooked in the hand

I just wanted to join her
Now I miss to join her, get to California
I got something for you to do, it was like I was annoying
Resurrected, found my purpose, I remember being dragged
Being nervous when I would kick my verses
I was virtually worthless, my whole life was a circus
I was sleeping with serpents and I thought it is worth it
Got a call from Paul, told me shit isn't working
Exchange words, told me tell me that shit in person
He probably told him, and by the way did he said it
On a prolijetic twisted made about him
I see Slim and he said he didn't recognize me
Was it that or did he let another man to find me?
I don't know, but now I gotta get this all behind me
Follow my calling when I used to follow niggas blindly

I wish I had a better relationship with my uncles
Blood relatives I could turn to when I'm feeling trouble
And talk about my struggles
My uncle John Nail, he only put me on the phone
With different females
And this is such a such, nephew, tell me, what's up?
Ain't even ask about your man in Cali, growing up
Fuck, I drink it all and I smash the bottle
Self medicated numb, but I'm a feel it tomorrow
It feel like pain and sorrow was like a second skin
But now that pain was gone I got my second win
Only the strong live long, you better settle in

I ain't forgot about that yet
But I still have some whiskey left

Sure thought I'd be able, once I reached the middle of the label
That some of those memories would somehow wash away
Now I'm pushin' toward the bottom, an' thoughts of her, yeah, I still got 'em
Those shots, I've shot 'em, but they ain't killed yesterday
Just a little below the sticker
Yeah, I must've got a bad batch of liquor

I can still see her standin' there on that sidewalk
Yellin' out for the taxi that would take her away
From the arms of the one that still loves her
With all of his heart.
I ain't forgot about that yet,
But I still have some whiskey left

I just tipped it up an' took the last sip from the cup
Threw that bottle on the ground an' started to cry
I know that I've had plenty an' now there just ain't any
An' I'm just as empty as that bottle inside

My uncle Titus had a bright idea
He's gonna bottle up his own brew

What he was banking on was all in the name

He's gonna sell 'em all in big ol' jugs
He wouldn't package 'em in a 6 pack

Pretend it was our own
Where the live oaks had hidden
A little limestone cabin
Had to be a hundred years old

That's where we'd raise all our kids
Then we'd pop the top on a lone star

Trent Willmon,"There used to be a sign saying 
Welcome To Population 82
Just a little town with no line streets
Where I loved you and you loved me
But there ain't been a day of sun
Since this town has become 
Population 81

We used to lay beside the lake
And talk about the plans we'd make
We'd build a house by that old oak tree
Make it population 83
Now those dreams have turned to dust
Since this town has become

I threw a penny in the wishing well
And I made a wish that wished you well
And I watched it sink away from me

I hear what they don't say to me
But they'll talk about it when I leave
Cause they know what's done is done

I'd probably tried to hide
But I came around the corner
And she caught me by surprise
There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say 
The things I thought she'd say to me

It was nothin' like that rainy night
She left and slammed the door
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore
I felt like some neighbor
Just some guy she once knew
You'd never know she loved me
And I broke her heart in two
Was she hidin' her emotions
Or did she really get that strong
Right then she turned and 
Introduced me to her new friend John

Trent Willmon,"Tuck was a cowboy I knew years ago,
Could put a stretch in a story like a forty foot row
Young an' wide-eyed, I believed every word,
As he rambled through the canyons an' stampeded herds
Swore there were still Comanches in them breaks to the south
He'd seen good hands ride in there an' never rode out

He had a horse he called Dollar that twice saved his life
He lost him to Jim Shoulders playin' poker one night
When I turned eighteen, I packed up an' left home
Tuck was pretty old back then an' by now he's long gone

But I've heard it said that ol' cowboys don't die
They get put out to pasture way up the sky
So if God's got a Heaven for old cowboy legends,
I hope the grass is greener on the other side,
An' he's got good horses to ride

Now the folks back home would tell you Tuck was just crazy an' old
But I still believe in Conquistador gold
An' those memories look like a mirage in the distance,
Starin' out from this prison of urban existence
So I saddle up an' I go back now an' then,
To remember who I was an' just forget where I am

Now the concrete an' steel, they spread out like a plague
Consumin' the rivers, the mountains and the plains
Then one of these days, it'll all be gone
But somewhere, that spirit will always live on

'Cause I've heard it said that ol' cowboys don't die
They get put out to pasture way up the sky

Trent Willmon,"Try and put your arms around 
The 100 year old tree 
Climb up on a horse 
And let it run full speed 
Take a look out at the world from 30,000 feet 
On your next flight 

Watch a flock of birds 
Against the morning sun 
Close your eyes and listen 
To the river run 
Catch a firefly in your hand 
Or a raindrop on your tongue 
That's right 

[Chorus]
There is a God 
There is a God 
There is a God 
How much proof do you need? 

Plant a seed and see 
What comes out of the ground 
Find the heartbeat on your baby's ultrasound 
In a few years hear it laughing, 
And don't it sound like a song? 

Stop and think about 
What you don't understand 
Things like life and love 
And how the world began 
Hear the doctor say he can't explain it, 
But the cancer is gone 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Science says it's all just circumstance 
That this whole world is just an accident 
But if you want to shoot that theory down, 
Just take a look around 

Oh just look around 

Now there is a God 
There is a God 
Oh there is a God, 
How much proof do you need?

Trent Willmon,"Tell 'em all I'm on vacation
Say I went to visit friends
That you ain't seen or heard from me in quite a while
When they ask you where Ive been
Tell 'em I'm out on the west coast where it don't ever rain
And I'm probably doing fine

[Chorus]
Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Don't tell 'em all the truth

Tell 'em all I'm out in Vegas
Throwing every dollar I have away
Tell 'em that I must be into something bad for me cause
I sure lost a lot of weight
Tell 'em I'm out on the road with some old Rock n Roll Band
Living like a Gypsy King

The truth is that I'm asking you to lie
We both know that it ain't right
If you ever loved me please

Trent Willmon,"He said, ""I'm going to west Texas""
They said, ""damn, you've gone crazy""
Ain't nothing out there but coyotes and Comanches
But he headed out anyway as far as he could
Till the heat finally got to their mules

He sold whiskey and cigars to passing through would be settlers
But nobody wants to settle where there ain't no damn water
Then they figured out a windmill could pump it from the ground
And up sprang a tumbleweed town

[Chorus]
Where the lonely wind blows like it's angry for being there
A flat piece of stone in the middle of nowhere
The town never grows cause nobody can keep their roots down
It's tumbleweed town

They came in like gypsies to steal their black gold
And the towns population increased hundred fold
But they scattered like quail when all the oil wells ran out
Left no trace of the riches they'd found

Then some big shot from Dallas built a factory here
Gonna put us back on the map but damn, that was back a few years
Now the weeds have frown up and the buildings falling down
And you'd think they'd figured it out by now
Damn, its a tumbleweed town

[Chorus]

Now a few hay seeds and ranchers are still hanging in 
Too old to start over and too damn stubborn to quit
And their kids all get restless waiting on that greyhound
So that they can get the hell out of this tumbleweed town
But I love my tumbleweed town
It's a tumbleweed town",Tumbleweed Town,2008

Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me

Si... vine aquí PNO, Chesta why me
Rima de calle, de entalle, como es que a mi me sale
Sudada del alma pale why pale va pal derrame
Sangre, ojo por ojo, diente por diente
Bala por bala, ciento por ciento
Su daga prototipo del mal, que ilícito como ese tipo
El jibarito listo pal delito
Inhumana selva urbana de mala fama
Llama a tu mama, por lana te mata mi pana sin trauma
Nací yo en esta sabana
Donde perro come perro why la muerte rima con parcero
Aquí solo el diablo manda, fierro con fierro
Te advierto mi perro no hay cielo ni infierno
Solo mi voz que te guilla en la penumbra
El odio que me tienes te aciega why te derrumba
Que es lo que quieres marica?
Que es lo que hago? Te irrita?
Te cambia la carita cuando sube en tarima
Grita la gente, me apoya
Que sea de plata o de la olla
Ola, abran paso que voy a abrir

Si tu me quieres odiar
Odiame más mucho más
Solo te vas a matar
Nunca vivirás en paz
Si tu me quieres amar
Amame mas, mucho mas
Why los que estén conmigo
Levanten la mano

Si tu me quieres odiar
Odiame más mucho más
Solo te vas a matar
Nunca vivirás en paz
Si tu me quieres amar
Amame mas, mucho mas
Why los que estén conmigo
Levanten la mano

REY CHESTA...
Si me quieren envidiar
Es por mi estilo, lo mío, mi filosofía, mi flow
Porque tienen que hablar
Esperen como yo hice why véanme progresar
Si no hay flows, no hay show
Yo soy el bacano, gusano, en el mercado mando yo
Mi vida esta basada en envidia, odio, cárcel, velorios
Los puntos favoritos del demonio
Nunca podrás actuar como yo, pensar como yo
Tratar como yo, triunfar como yo, brillar como yo
Pues si me oyó dígame que rayos pasó
(Rey Chesta!)
Yo no soy lo que usted piensa
Mejor te mueves porque pierdo fácil la paciencia
Tu ni siquiera sabes lo que es la delincuencia
Why para hablarme cobarde sabe que tiene experiencia
Tu herramienta no me asusta
Eres de esas gentes brutas, mejor coge otra ruta
Porque te ves perdido, confundido
Lárgate de mi camino ya

Si tu me quieres odiar
Odiame más mucho más
Solo te vas a matar
Nunca vivirás en paz
Si tu me quieres amar
Amame mas, mucho mas
Why los que estén conmigo
Levanten la mano

Si tu me quieres odiar
Odiame más mucho más
Solo te vas a matar
Nunca vivirás en paz
Si tu me quieres amar
Amame mas, mucho mas
Why los que estén conmigo
Levanten la mano

Tres Hernandez,"Nunca podré morirme 
Mi corazón no lo tengo aquí 
Alguién me está esperando 
Me está aguardando que vuelva aquí 

Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé mi vida dejé mi amor 
Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé enterrado mi corazón 

Late y sigue latiendo 
Porque la tierra vida le da 
Pero llegará un día 
En que mi mano te alcanzará 

Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé mi vida dejé mi amor 
Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé enterrado mi corazón 

Una triste tormenta 
Te está azotando sin descansar 
Pero el sol de tus hijos 
Pronto la calma te hará alcanzar 

Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé mi vida dejé mi amor 
Cuando salí de Cuba 
Dejé enterrado mi corazón",Cuando Sali de Cuba,1999
Tres Sasser,"I don't feel the same as I did when you walked out my door 
And I don't see things the same as I did from down there on your floor 
So you can take back all of those things that you told me were true because 
I'm pretty sure that I'm over you 

Take back that photograph with your pretty little red dress on 
I don't need the memories that keep me walking the floor until dawn 
But don't you worry because my lonely night will soon be through 
Because I'm pretty sure that I'm over you 
Oh yes I'm pretty sure that I'm over you 
 
And I just don't feel the same as I did before 
This time around I won't let you back in my door 
So you can take back all of those things that you told me were true 
Because I'm pretty sure I'm over 

Oh yes I'm pretty sure I'm over 
I'm pretty sure that I'm over you 
I'm over you",(Pretty Sure) I'm Over You,2001
Tres Sasser,"See her walking alone in this city of heartache and stone 
She finds her way down to where she once found all her dreams she doesn't understand 
Why something she'd given her heart to could die 
But that's just the way it works out they say it's alright 

[Chorus] 
She's coming back down 
This carousel ride has stopped spinning round 
She wants to say she's sorry and stay but it's too late 
Now this carousel ride has shut down 

Fingertips trace the lines pens and papers recall the good times 
But clocks they do run and change what's been done say goodbye 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

And I want you to come with me tonight 
I don't know if it's real but it surely feels right 

[Chorus]",Carousel,2001
Tres Sasser,"She was just 16 with a pack of cigarettes and a pawn shop ring
She wanted things to turn out like she'd seen on that silver screen
So she hit the road with her thumb in the air and a ring in her nose
She had a tattoo of a butterfly because that's the way it goes 
When you don't know just which way the wind will blow

[Chorus] 
Hey girl where are you going to
Say that you'll be the queen of heartbreak avenue

She met a boy out there with a silver el dorado and jet black hair
He had a tattoo of Elvis so they took their clothes off to compare 
And well you know just how far these things can go

Then the sun came shining bright and true love in the morning 
Never feels like it did last night
He left a letter that said goodbye hold on tight
Now he's gone so she'll just move along

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

So you say you don't know how your broken
Dreams just drag you down

[Chorus]",Heartbreak Avenue,2001
Tres Sasser,"It's four in the morning the phone on the wall is ringing so loudly 
I'm sick of it all but what can I do 
I told you again that we're through 
The neighbors upstairs yes they know these paper thin walls let everything show 
They say keep it down but I can't with you hanging around 

[Chorus] 
Well you tell me you don't want to fight 
You're just here to see if I'm doing alright 
Well darling let me be lonely tonight 

The sound of hearts shattering down on the floor is just the same as it was once before 
My wisdom in years just won't be washed away by your tears 
Now I can see your disguise is nothing more than red lipstick 
And lies painted for me to see that you won't let me be 

[Chorus]",Let Me Be Lonely,2001
Tres Sasser,"Ms. Williams where did you stay last night 
Say you wasn't home till the sun was shining far too bright 
The way you wear your hair I know it surely was not right 
Ms. Williams could you tell me where you stayed last night 

Sun goes down and it's the same old thing 
Float the whiskey river to the mountains of cocaine 
Looking for that one true love to tell her she's a star 
Instead she's drinking with a long haired boy that plays a rock and roll guitar

[Chorus:] 
she just wants to shine 
Her heart gets broken every time but she knows some day soon she'll find 
Ms. Williams where did you stay last night

In a wedding dress that no one wore 
The whole world's on fire so she slams the door 
With a bible on the front seat and a shotgun in the floor she 
Points her headlights into hollywood because she wants so much more 

[Chorus]

[Repeat first verse]",Ms. Williams,2001
Tres Sasser,"Hail hail rock and roll 
Come here son and let me help you sell your soul 
Sit right down and everything will be just fine 
Sign right here and it will all work out in time 

Sit right down and I will tell you about the plan 
See I'm gonna make you 50 thousand dollars and I'll only take 10 million 
But did I mention I got a new mercedes benz 
Smile pretty be witty come meet your brand new friends 

[Chorus] 
Everybody thinks that you'll go far 
You're gonna be a rock and roll star 

Now you got a banker and a lawyer on 16th avenue 
That's the funny things they call you when you spend a couple extra years in school 
They got big black cars and dollar signs in their eyes too 
What is a boy like me to do 

I got this guitar I play a little out of tune 
But it makes no difference if I get all the right tattoos 
And hey get a look at these cheekbones 
Who cares if mick taylor was ever even in the rolling stones 

[Chorus]

Besides he didn't even get that far 
But me I'm gonna be a rock and roll star 
Yes I am so now we're living happy underneath the sony tree 
I got my big top 10 record on wkd? 

Something or other bartender could I have another and another and another 
You're lucky we're even drinking in this bar 

[Chorus]",Rock and Roll Star,2001
Tres Sasser,"I see her every morning as the sun drips slowly down 
Walking up on my street to her swanky little job uptown 
She's got an office with a window I'm looking out my window too 
I wish the four winds would blow and change my point of view 

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 
She wears them high steppin shoes and her dress seems to fit so right 
I got two pair of corduroy pants everybody says they fit too tight 
I got a 3 dollar shirts on she got 55 dollar hair 
I want to pick her up and take her down but she's already been there probably two times 

[Chorus:] 
And every time I see her I just cry 
Ain't no sense in even wondering why 
She don't care about me 

I know she lives on 4th street or somewhere round about all 
I want to do is hold her hand or hang her dirty laundry out 
She's got a sister names Alice her older brother's name is bill 
She ain't got no dentist but her teeth are shiny still 

[Chorus]
 
She probably likes those older men with those big long cars and don't care much for fools like me That spend time in all these smoke filled bars 
She likes shirts and ties and cigarettes that smell like fallen leaves I just want to be the monkey That she lets climb her big tall tree 

[Chorus]",She Don't Care,2001
Tres Sasser,"Here we sit again and tales begin to spin
About the things that we've done and seen
Stories of wine glutton and glory
And the occasional altered dreams

Appetites for memories grow
As the sunshine begins to fade
Across the hill it's the same old chill
Lurking right there in the shade

Just a child with bright eyes and a smile
Laughter was all she knew
Her mama was away and all papa did was pray
So the wanderlust slowly grew

She spread her wings and a couple other things
For the medicine man downtown
With his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was going down

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

She was gone on a bad trip
Followed by a needle and a silver spoon
Mama sat and cried and papa told us lies
Said she'd be back real soon

Suddenly the seasons changed
From the fall back to the spring
Answers live like peasants here
When the questions reign as king

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

Just a child with bright eyes and a smile
Laughter was all she knew
Mama was away and papa sat and prayed
While the wanderlust that slowly grew

She spread her wings and wanted to do things
For the medicine man downtown
And with his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was, soon she was going down, yeah

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back
And I will really do is, wish she come back
I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline
",Sweet Magdeline,2001
Tres Sasser,"I remember as the seasons turned to fall 
Wind was sitting and the leaves fell a hinting a sign of the near winter's ball 
Chill in the air as I strolled down the front steps looking for a tale to tell 
Then she slipped me a stare as I slid into my chair she already knew me too well 

She said hello in that beautiful voice my reply was nowhere as sweet 
She seemed impressed by the state of my mess laughed at the wings on my feet 
Offered me a cigarette and before I could even refuse 
We were standing alone she was chilled to the bone she told me to sing the blues 

[Chorus:] 
Hey hey now I feel alright and I just wanted to see 
If I may if I might be the king of your world tonight 
So I told her of the books I'd read and details about the time I stole 6 dollars from a man named Jed just to turn around and pay him back 

I quoted my favorite poem but I ended it terribly wrong 
She said I understand then she clapped both her hands and said that's my favorite song 

[Chorus]

Just then a man walked in and took her away she said her sweet goodbye 
I'll see you again some day so it was over and I was standing there all alone 
And I said to myself as I dusted my shelf this time I think it was love 

[Chorus]",Wish,2001
Tres Sasser,"You say that it's over this time for good 
But this time around you know that I wish 
That you would not call me on the phone
I need to get used to being alone 
Now you tell me you want me to be your friend 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again 
You say now you're gone and you won't be back 
This time around I'm just a little bit smarter than that 
Just because you've packed your bags 
That doesn't mean that you won't return 
That's the lesson I learned the last time I let you back in 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again 

My friends tell me that they doubt it 
When I tell them I can learn to live without it 
They say it's a game that I can't win 
So you say you found a new man and he treats you fine 
You say he brings you flowers and bottles of cheap red wine 
You say you like the way he wears his hair 
But don't you know I wouldn't care if you ever walk out on him 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again",Your Fool,2001

Liefer' mehr als Dealer, die das Weed und Cocaina in dem Siebener noch zu dir fahr'n
Die Musik ist unbesiegbar, hat massives Format
Dieser Bass verbiegt den Unterkiefer wie ich schieße unparierbar
Nur die coolen DJs spielen unsere Lieder, miese Miezen pumpen's
Lieber als die Beatles, kriegen direkt Dschungelfieber
Vögel verlieren Titel und Gefieder
Wie Pestizide eliminier' ich Ungeziefer
Brauch' für euch Kinder nur 'n Spielplatz und 'ne KiTa
Tanz um die MCs herum - Nikeata
Die Industrie kann mich nicht mehr aufhalten
Weil sie von der Straße zum Club und zurück zum Schulhof meine Tracks spiel'n
Ihr dachtet, ich hör' einfach zu, wie diese Vögel mit der Kacke Kohle machen und die Kultur in den Dreck zieh'n
Tokat macht dich wieder breit, Whisky
Hustle mit den Liedern kein Nipsey
Nein man, das ist Mega und ich weiß auch alles besser und ich scheiß' auf alle Rapper, finde wieder kein Dixi
Kam in Frieden und ich nehme keine Gefangenen, aber heißt nur, dass ich gleich richte
Dr. Coop schwingt die Bleispritze, donner' über den Beat und schmeiß' Blitze

Wer hat die Hitze?
Wer hat die Hitze? (Wer hat die Hitze?)
Setz' den ganzen Laden in Brand
Wer hat die Hitze?
Zigtausend Fahrenheit, jenseits der Maßeinheit
Diese Hitze brennt für die Ewigkeit
Wer hat die Hitze?
Alle wollen's ständig, sie alle roll'n längst wie
Alle voll Kendrick, alle voll emsig
Ist alles voll Trend, aber wer hat die Hitze?
Alles voll chic, Halle voll vorn, hinten alle voll dick
Alle roll'n miteinander, alle wollen mit
Alle wollen Klicks, alle wollen Hits
Aber wer hat die Hitze?

Wer hat Hunger? Ist noch nicht satt?
Wer hat die Hitze, die das Feuer entfacht?
Wer bündelt Licht? Lässt Flammen lodern?
Und Asche regnen auf Seifenopern?

Ich bin der Dealer, sie wissen schon
Kommst du zu mir, willst du Frisches holen
Weißt du, was du kriegst, brauch' es nicht beton'
Kenn' sie sich aus, ham sie mich empfohlen
Huh, Händler mit der Ware und schon länger in der Lage
Geh' auf Beats, so als ob ich eine Gang dahinter habe
Hör zu, denn der Banger is' so Blamage
Dieser Sound hier ist Bruce Wayne bei Nacht, Bruce Banner mit der Rage
Enterte das Rap-Biz, kam ins Game und beendete die Wackness
Leg' nach und beende deine Skepsis
Höre nicht auf, bis die Veränderung perfekt ist
Im Untergrund am Ackern wie mit Bohrer und mit Bagger
Flow ist Strobo wie bei Gabber, alles frisch wie Tau
Ohne wenn und aber, dieser größte Motherfucker
Die Kanone ratatata oder klick-klick-paow
Aus Liebe zur Sache und Max ist mein Helfer
Von niemand' erschaffen, ich machte es selber
Das Business, die Neider, sie machten mich kälter
Die Sorgen, Familie, sie machten mich älter
Frag mal die Jungs hier am Block, wie's ihnen geht, was ihnen fehlt ist Perspektive
Keine Kohle um mein Album zu supporten, aber jeden Tag 'n Zehner für die Wiese
Ich cutte durch die Wolken, laufe schneller als die Schatten, die mir folgen
Mache, was ich mache, meine Sache, mach die Sachen, bis die Sachen mir Erfolg bringen
Lass es brennen, Gemüter sind erhitzt und ich frag mich ob sie das hier wirklich wollten
Ich mein' hier nicht den Klimawandel, aber deine Kappe wird geschmolzen - bang

Lieg' im Bett und checke Voicemails
Nala kann schon reden, wie die Jahre doch vergehen
Sie will wissen, wo ich heut bin
Single, gerade keine Freundin
Alexa, spiel mir „Jocelyn“
Immer da, wo meine Boys sind
Im Studio und trinken bisschen Henny wie mit neunzehn
Yeah, sie wollen wissen wie es schmeckt
Ich sag': „Komm und setz dich zu uns, denn die Tische sind gedeckt“
Ich fühl' mich grad wie Pablo, mach' im Business so viel Cash
Aber Carlo, bitte, bitte, bitte, bitte bleib echt
Check, jeder meiner Schritte war perfekt
Nehm' die Clique mit an die Spitze, doch mein Blick dabei relaxt
Ich will nie wieder frieren, ich hab' Hitze im Gepäck
Und sobald es kalt wird, buch' ich mir 'n Ticket und bin weg, yes

Ich pack' die Fam in mein Spaceship
Wir fliegen hoch, wo es hingeht, weiß man nicht
Ja, es war 'n guter Tag, alle happy
Noch 'n Zug vom Spliff, noch 'n Schluck Henny
Wir blasen Rauch ausm Fenster
Und sehen die Sonne, wie sie langsam untergeht
Alles, was ich weiß, wo wir waren, wo wir sind
Erinner' mich genau, wie das alles anfing

Und auch ich gone till November, Wyclef Jean

So I'm talkin' Multi to the fullest
As long as I'm livin', fuck the ones

And show me how to get it
And you can ball all you want in the paint for the digits
But you gotta learn how to pivot
For the score, never speak, bet the goal that you want
Gotta keep it slow mo when you outchea creepin'
Watch for the lows when your head up high

One false move and we all finish
We come together, we all winnin'

Either rob for the money, hit the mall with it
Then to the club, pull the broad with it
Then wylin' chopper in it, I'm goin' down with it, no lie
You get a chance, go to Dubai
You see your money ain't as much as you thought
Matter of fact motherfuckers so rich
Make nigga feel petty and ashamed just for showin' it off
100 thou for the outfit
A billion dollars worth of sun plugged in the outlet
You put your money where your mouth at
You won't be talkin' much would ya

Revolutionary do it for the niggas that wish they were there to do it
Gotta chance to do me boy you better do it

And you can't look inside 
So you'll never see my cry and cry 
In my house without you 

For all the loving I had , you treat me so bad and run away 
So when you look inside ( look inside) 
You will never see me cry and cry in my house without love",House Without Windows,1998

It will make you weak in the knees 
Make you want to plant unity with all your apple seeds 
We're going to mix a mixture to create a portrait picture 
Organic natural visions that will taste real sweet

A howl at the moon until the lunar eclipse 
And I sip from the wine my father gave me 
I'm willing to take all this pain from my feet 
I've walked everywhere in these shoes looking for you 
Following the stars above following the scent of love 
It's all true it's all true 
I'm just an orphan of the sky 
Who and what and when and why 
There's no proof there's no proof 

With the stars out 
We got everything that can save us 
With my window down 
I've found my way to my haven 

Now on this plain 
Everything is rearranged 
See we co exist with love and that will never ever change 
Well the grass grows when the music flows 
Don't you know this feeling will put you right at home 
The connection not to mention it has such a good intention 
The spider met the blossom well he showed so much affection 
Oh my friends I send you my good prayers 
If you ever need a lift to heaven you can take my stairs

Fallin' from the sky, pullin' on my parachutes
Grew a couple pictures and I painted them tie-dye
Dedicate them all to the beauty of your blue sky

Does it cry like the rain on my windowpane?
How does it sing and what does it say?
Does it shine like the gold of my lion's mane?

Yeah, he sports him this way, a child at play
Open up my lips but what's there to say?

Come play, come play
As the river runs down, as the river runs through
As it runs through the field with all his companions
This is the scene of the most enchanted

I am a drunken fool
Drunk off the love that holds up the moon
Drunk off the love that binds me and you to the most high

Just close your eyes and hold me
No harm will befall you, volume
And that's what is spoken to me
When I turn down the volume, volume
Volume, volume, volume

Time has come to speak of this love
Spread your wings of your song and soul
To maintain internal heights above
Close your eyes and feel it unfold
Rush like a river from the highest mountain
Drink from the fountain and stop your counting

What kind of wine does he have in his tavern?
Oh, so enchanted and sing like a mad man
Mad with the love of a wife for her husband
Child or mother, sister or brother

Rain and the thunder, the rain and the thunder
Sing for the most high, sing for no other

Lighten my load and grow me tall

Spruce tips and cedars now free up them rivers
The salmon will run, no dam can hold
Uniting the nations, it's gonna take some patience
So unzip your sheepskin, the wolves have returned

I read the totems, my ancestors wrote 'em
Now I sit patient, as I wait on the tribe
This runs through all things, like thunder and lightning
Song everlasting, well always I learn
Pull off the old skin, now we are kindred
Open and listen, the wolves have returned
(Ah-ooooo)
The wolves have returned

So channel the old ones, with each waking new sun
Walk with your totem, conditions unsaid
Walk from the mystery, a love where you feeling
Myrrh for protection, a spear in your hand
In light of our dreaming, never meant to be easy
Sometimes there'll be water, sometimes you'll be dry
Footprints in tandem, in this ancient sandstone
Grandmothers reside, and I'll be by your side
Oh, I will be by your side
Grandmother, I will be your side, oh

Part of creation is making a statement
You can't escape it, she's coming for you
If it was up to me, I'd teach that the lonely
This is just part of the courage it takes
Maybe it's the music, it's moving right through us
All of the songs that will outlive me
I'm running the song lines, I'm wrapping my prayer ties Preserving the old way, my wolf has returned

Everytime I think of you I always catch my breath 
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away 
And I'm wondering why you left 
And there's a storm that's raging 
Through my frozen heart tonight 

I hear your name in certain circles 
And it always makes me smile 
I spend my time thinking about you 
And it's almost driving me wild 
And there's a heart that's breaking 
Down this long distance line tonight 

 I ain't missing you at all (missing you) 
Since you've been gone away (missing you), 
I ain't missing you (missing you) 
No matter what I might say (missing you) 

 There's a message in the wire 
And I'm sending you the signal tonight 
You don't know how desperate I've become 
And it looks like I'm losing this fight 
In your world I have no meaning 
Though I'm trying hard to understand 
And it's my heart that's breaking 
Down this long distance line tonight 

 I ain't missing you at all (missing you) 
Since you've been gone away (missing you), 
I ain't missing you (missing you) 
No matter what my friends say (missing you)

So here I go and out your door
I'm searching the world for something more
Than just a voice that just says no and keeps me down 
Glued to the top of the ground
I'm waiting for a little relief from all of this

You came to say hi and it brought me down

You made it clear when you left here and turned to ice 
Reminding me I ought to think twice

Leaving a grin
Thinking that your life will begin
By pushing all of your dreams on top of him

And it's all because
I see you

Trevor Lucas,"He was a stranger to himself,
A spy in his own camp,
And his money was his health,
All thrown to the dust by his very own hand.

Yet his beauty lingered still,
Beyond the draining of the sand,
But greener was the other side of the hill,
Richer was the other man's land.

But we loved him, loved him just like brothers would.
We loved him, loved him like no others could,
And she loved him, loved him like a lover should.

Take good care of an aching heart,
You never can replace it.
You know you are the master of your art,
You'll realise that when you think it fit.

Those orbs of blue are jading away,
No laughter from these dances.
Yet you're bound to remember this one day,
Hazards are risks, and risks are chances.

You can run for cover, run for cover like a frightened hare,
Till it's all over, all over and there's no-one there,
'Cause you daren't discover, daren't discover that we really care.",Stranger to Himself,1997

See the light or get knocked off
I don't talk a lot
I drop it hot modern day psalmist topping charts
Get me in my comfort at a concert
For child hurts merging in the city clubs and outskirts

Keep walking proceed behind the line of caution

He ain't the same dude changed afraid he came to pay dues

And bring me one step closer to where I am now
And every time you try, breaking me down
I'm gonna get right back up, and stand my ground

Verse II
I run up in your set with black con's and a skate deck
Throwing hockey pucks blowing speakers and mic check
One, Two, what you gone do when I come through

Tell me people never listen to the words
Well watch the reaction I get when I drop this verse

In the frozen night.
When your hope is on the guard
There's a running threat.
There's a new design
When the poison fills your heart.

Broken from the shattered hopes
And breathless from the stare.
Standing in this lonely room
I can see you there.

Lights from the waters
Have swept me away
So say your goodbye's now
This will say.
Drink from the water.
It swept me away.
So say your goodbye's now.
This will say.

Let the tidal pull
And the neon lights.
Let it spill across this place.
Like a deepened hole
From your glossy eyes.
There's a flame that marks the race.

Can you hear? Whispering this time?
Dream the fear.
Are you listening?

I'm a end up on the news 
I just don't know what to do

Another show, another freestyle another note,
Another seed sown deep into the hearts of those
Through a microphone speaking in a hyper tone 
Flights around the globe from Japan to Calico

No matter how big or small or monies involved
I won't falter or fall I'm giving you my all

Verse II
You called me again called me your friend
Even when I didn't call back ye still lent me your hand
When I didn't have a cent, and on the floor we slept
You still kept a close eye though I didn't understand

Another mile stone, wild you never left me alone
Though I don't always get it, I could never forget it
How you saved me made me, forever I'll tell it

Trevor McNevan,"Last night got a little crazy
I don't remember, woke up spun with the pasties
My friends say I was tweaked out
Passed out on a dirty coach, still in the house
It kind a scares me, I don't know
Am I out of control, always waking up still in my clothes
I wrote a note that said goodbye to pain, good bye to shame
But couldn't find a way, I just cry for days
I'm so depressed, soaking wet, I can't rest
These thoughts just beat me to death I'm un-kept
I thought of a song my mom used to sing in church
But it's been so long I can't remember the words

Every time you run, every time you hide
Every time it hurts, every time you cry
Every time you run away, every time you hide your face
And it feels so far away, I'm right here, with you

Every time you run

I keep sleeping in don't want to wake up
I keep hearing from the landlord pay up
Hide my face in my pillow till the sunsets
Hung over and I haven't seen a pay check
I took a job downtown at the factory
I was hired and fired with no salary
I keep running from responsibility
It's seems impossible, the pressure is hitting me
I know I need to man up, or sit down
Stand up and get out of this crowd
I thought of a song my mom used to sing in church
But it's been so long I can't remember the words

Every time you run, every time you hide
Every time it hurts, every time you cry
Every time you run away, every time you hide your face
And it feels so far away, I'm right here, with you

Well I know I'm not ready to die, but I've
Sure thought about the meaning of life
Cause I can't seem to find a purpose for me
It's just the choices and I fail to proceed
I got a ""get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
I hear voices in my mind, ones a devil, ones jesus
I can feel it can you help me find the pieces
Like an angel on my shoulder, you hold the
Joy of the lord raising up a soldier
You gave me the song my mom used to sing in church
I promised not to quit and I remembered the words
I promised not to quit and I remembered the words

Every time it hurts, every time you cry
Every time you run away, every time you hide your face

In a twitter, in the throes, 
Oh the critter's 
Got me dancing on a thousand toes,
Thar' she blows 
Who's that hiding in the tree top?
It's that rascal The Jitterbug,
Should you catch him buzzing 'round you,
Keep away from The Jitterbug.
Oh! The bees in the breeze and the bast in the trees have a terrible, horrible 
buzz,
But the bees in the breeze and the bats in the trees couldn't do what The 
Jitterbug does;
So be careful of that rascal,
Keep away from The Jitterbug, The Jitterbug.

All you do is just sit tight, 'cause it's all so, so, so, so down-right, right.

Trevor Rabin,"Innocence no answer to your breaking heart
If the situation sometimes falls apart
Then in this ecstasy your charms are frozen
No emotion falling through your arms

Morning, daydream time still growing shorter
Take me over lead me to the water

To the rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love

Why should I escort you to your secret needs
Climbing up your ladder I keep falling down
Anyway will do, anyone will do
When you dance to your darkest tune
Surrounded as you crawl around the room

Night time fever burning till you're higher
Take me over lead me through the fire

Stay where you are, don't move, we'll find you
By the time I remember this
I've covered wingspans of miles, in dreadful circles

Nightfall gathering
There's a dark array of gloomy stars
Keep changing direction
And I don't know where we are

Like the flight of a dove
Take me back to the land that I love

Cover up, inside
The more you learn, the more you hide
Cover up, inside
The more you learn, the more you hide

The changes of pattern
Timing, concrete distinctions
In the presence of danger
Nightfall, darkness, be alert

You head for the wall, you suck on stones

Trevor Rabin,"Are you waiting for your freedom
Or a love you just don't know?
I can see you through my window
Did you know your feelings show?
Are you looking towards the border?
Hold out for something new

Does the white, bright, right and degradation
Wear you down the way we want it to?
Calling on you for confirmation
In a way that we feel is good for you

Eyes of love, look down on me
When you gonna see
Eyes of love, send down the key
Will you deliver me tomorrow

Are you searching for an answer?
Are you questioning at all?
I can't reach you but I can feel you
Are you living in surrender
Or just waiting for the call?

Does the white, bright, right and degradation
Wear you down the way we want it to?
We will control the information

From the clouds that cover me

I can't look away
I can't look away

I have climbed the valley side, scaled the mountain
Yet, my freedom's still one thousand miles away
Yet, I'm frozen in mid-stride
By this yearning deep inside

I can't look away
I can't look away

I was waiting for the moment

But I need to make you see

When the time comes 'round don't slip away
Give me something to hold on to
I'll give you more than you came for

About the things you say you see

Everytime I think of you I always catch my breath 
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away 
And I'm wondering why you left 
And there's a storm that's raging 
Through my frozen heart tonight 

I hear your name in certain circles 
And it always makes me smile 
I spend my time thinking about you 
And it's almost driving me wild 
And there's a heart that's breaking 
Down this long distance line tonight 

 I ain't missing you at all (missing you) 
Since you've been gone away (missing you), 
I ain't missing you (missing you) 
No matter what I might say (missing you) 

 There's a message in the wire 
And I'm sending you the signal tonight 
You don't know how desperate I've become 
And it looks like I'm losing this fight 
In your world I have no meaning 
Though I'm trying hard to understand 
And it's my heart that's breaking 
Down this long distance line tonight 

 I ain't missing you at all (missing you) 
Since you've been gone away (missing you), 
I ain't missing you (missing you) 
No matter what my friends say (missing you) 

 And there's a message that I'm sending out 
Via telegraph to your soul 
And if I can't bridge this distance 
Stop this heartbreak overload",Missing You,1991

Charge the common ground

Shake, we shake so hard
How we laugh so loud
When we reach we believe in eternity

Trevor Rabin,"I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and
In and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and
In and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see 
I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distance atmosphere
Call it morning driving through the sound and
Even in the valley

Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see 
I'll be there with you

Along the drifting cloud 
The eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind 
The sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings 
Create as weather spins out of hand

Go closer hold the land 
Feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time 
A thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears 
We stand surrounded by a million years

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out

In and around the lake

From the top of my head to the bottom of my shoes
'Cause last night my baby took the weight off my mind
Told me everything was gonna be fine

I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me
'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way

But she knows how I feel and she's not exactly shy
Though right now I'm lonely I know it won't be long
I can hear the train comin' bringin' lovin' along

'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way

I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried
But still I didn't rest I had to know
What was behind it all I'd come so far
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote
I couldn't resist it being beside her
Could have held that moment forever in my heart
The moment I saw her was the moment I knew
That her love is my life and her light's shining through
She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me

I'm not a shadow, 'cause I'm not a shadow

Here's to you don't settle, and never separate
And never be quiet 'cause the words you say
You never go back on and never turn around
Never judge another 'cause as stupid it sounds
'Cause when you see others knowin' they're all brothers
Knowin' they're all sisters, seein' the big picture
If they're not with you, then they're against
And were here now when they are way back when
So why try to please everyone? 
When it seems that all the people really want
Is to show love, and out and get love back
Is to show some faith and get respect
Just look at the world then, you look at the problems
And look at the hatred, and we still cant solve it
So look inside and you'll find step one

You never fit the mold, you never go sit down
You never go get approval no matter how you prove
That love is the motive in everything you do
And revolution is you and you're against the machine
You know who you are and you know what I mean
And when this record stops you would never slow down
When the video is over you want your turn now so
You make the truth and move straight ahead
While the followers behind you get left for dead
For the imminent brainwash follow the dumb rules
Created by individuals who unlike you
Don't care for the world or, care for the people

And they love when they feel above someone

While this distant fog surrounds me
I let it settle on the ground

Look all around

What?s said in tunnels to remind me
Spread out in liquid on the ground
And drawn in circles all around me
Until its time to set it down

Whenever you find it
Look all around
You?re never alone
Until you rewind it
Love on a line
I will follow you home

Whenever you find it
Look all around
You?re never alone

So if your hinges aren?t alligning
What falls away and rolls along
And when our breathing is divided
We weather battles on our own

And so if you find it
Look all around
You?re never alone
Until you rewind it
Love on a line
I will follow you home

Wherever you find it
Look all around
You?re never alone
But if you rewind it
Love on a line
I will follow you home

But not a life like this, so I take a knife like this and slice like this
Take life like this, fuck around and I take my own life like this

I just peeped the game, and these niggas be shife
Over the years, I seen a lot of niggas turn fake
Riding thick on the cool, and then I have to erase
You see me and the Maab, done learned without a thang
Man most of these niggas, be around for the fame
It ain't no more love, therefore if you ain't kin
And if you get up in mine, you gon' meet your end
I'm one of a kind, I think you better check yourself
And it don't mean a damn thang, if I shake your hand
If I ain't too enthused, and I got on a mean mask
You better stay on note, 'cause I'll beat your ass
It's Guerilla Maab this, and Guerilla Maab that
I think you better get back, and shut the fuck up
For you straight step off, and get fucked up
Nigga Trey and Dougie D and Z-Ro, take nuts
So don't come around now bitch
When you showed everybody, all kinds of love
And I ain't got none left, didn't nobody wanna care
How we thug, that's why I'm fin to be alone till I meet my death
Everybody we was cool with, fuck you too
And everybody who was hating us, fuck you too
It just took a little time, for me to find myself
And that's why we getting rich off ourself

Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me
Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me

Better watch your back, and identify yourself
Nigga one mo' step, and I'ma cock back every weapon
I pack, fuck around and fry yourself
A punk ass patty melt, no remorses gon' be felt
When I be dealing, with a less than G individual
Nothing but a AK shot, is gon' be felt
I never did trust no bitch, and I don't trust no nigga
Fuck all of my associates, but in a life of a life
This motherfucker like me, you get what you suppose to get
Pussy in the middle of the fo'head, I wanna see my foes dead
And I smoke, one of these old busted up ass hoes
Old trailer trash ass hoes, I live life one deep
And I don't speak to the non-kin no mo', nigga they know
Coming around my neck of the woods, is a no-no
'Cause I got a .44, lay low please
Everytime I open my mouth, mo'fuckers would never believe
That's why a nigga trip a lil' bit, with a razor blade
And the reason, I wear long sleeves
Y'all can't help me, I don't want your help
I just want some, leave me alone
I don't wanna go to the club, I'm cool in the streets
Bitch, just leave me to roam
Don't call my cell phone, give folk don't give a damn
If I get one in my dome, fuck you dealing
Y'all don't understand my zone, finally I found me

Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me
Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me
Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me

Trey D.,"I thought I heard your voice amid the noise on the street. 
I imagined it at best, but the knot in my chest still skipped a beat. 
I cannot concentrate or think at all of late for the thought of you, 
Though it's been so long since the day I found you were gone when I came to. 

Llast night, I saw your face. but something was wrong that I could not quite place. 
Suddenly I began to realize: the eyes I did not recognize. 
I woke up with a start and a pounding heart, gasping for air. 
I thought you were a ghost, or a dream at most, but you're everywhere. 
Was that you just then, calling me again?","Out of Sight, Out of Mind",2000

Trey Harrison,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1998

Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun

And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock

And the parlor lamps begin to glow

Hey kids, gather around, it's Wyclef and Melky Sedeck
I got a story to tell, here we go

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof
One night, he jumped out the car
And caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be at the party gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose

Hey yo, hey yo, my pen's in my hand, OK, what should I write next?
Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect caller from Jeff
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""
""Yo, I got bad news""
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the I'll street blues
""The friends will make you, them too can break you
They plan an execution like Fu Manchu""
""Who?""
""You know the character from channel 5 kung-fu (wahoo)""
""Slow down, man, Jeff, I'm losin' you""
""Hey yo, your cousin Rohann...""
""Uh-huh""
""Who used to sell bang""
""Uh-huh""
""DT's found his hand in the back of Bennigans""
""What?""
""In a plastic bag with a note attached""
""Saying what?""
""A million and a half or he won't be back""
""So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge, 12:00 sharp""
""If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp""
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?
Don't they know like Sting, I can turn this murder into art?
I jumped into my car, there's gotta be a joke
Traffic's backed up, who's in town, the Pope?
S-s-s-s-someone blew the horn, I turned and looked left
To my surprise, it was my sis, Melky Sedeck

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way

He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be at the party gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose

You're shootin' in the opposite position
I'm thinkin', ""Should I fire or hold back on ammunition
On your wig transition?""
My mission, like Take 6, is to spread love
But all you screwed mugs got me wearin' black gloves
You up in my face, I see the fear in your eyes
You gonna feel the pain like a grown man gettin' circumcised
Shalom, shalom, pardon my left
But my right hand's on your throat, massaging you to death
You provoke the cycle, call Michael
You're lookin' in the mirror, well, I'm in your window, oh oh
You hear me Urkel, your blood will turn purple
Like the color, you holler, bawlin' for your mother
No-one hears you even though you knock
You used to walk around the block with the daily rock
Things done changed since your spark got hot
Now you got your knot wocked with your very own Glock

Trey Parker,"I heard there is no Christmas
In the silly Middle East
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus
They have different religious beliefs

They believe in Muhammad
And not in our holiday
And so every December
I go to the Middle East and say

""Hey there Mr. Muslim
Merry fucking Christmas
Put down that book the Koran
And hear some holiday wishes.

In case you haven't noticed
It's Jesus's birthday.
So get off your heathen Muslim ass
and fucking celebrate.

There is no holiday season in India I've heard
They don't hang up their stockings
And that is just absurd!

They've never read a Christmas story.
They don't know what Rudolph is about
And that is why in December
I'll go to India and shout

Hey there Mr. Hinduist
Merry fucking Christmas
Drink eggnog and eat some beef
And pass it to the missus.

In case you haven't noticed
It's Jesus's birthday
So get off your heathen Hindu ass
and fucking celebrate!

Now I heard that in Japan
Everyone just lives in sin
They pray to several gods
And put needles in their skin.

On December 25th
All they do is eat a cake
And that is why I go to Japan
And walk around and say

Hey there Mr. Shintoist
Merry fucking Christmas
God is going to kick your ass
You infidelic pagan scum.

In case you haven't noticed
There's festive things to do
So lets all rejoice for Jesus

The Virgin Mary was sleeping
When Angel Gabriel appeared.
He said, ""you are to be the virgin mother,""
And Mary thought that was weird.
[Mary said, ""I'm not a virgin
I blew a guy last year""]
But then, Gabriel said to Mary,
""My child, have no fear:

[""'Cause you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still not be considered flawed.
[Though, Mary, you went to town,
and sucked some semen down,]
You're still still a virgin
In the eyes of god!""

There was no room at the Inn
When Mary and Joseph did arrive.
They were so very tired, you see,
[and Mary had to offer him a bribe.]
Said she had no money,
[and they had no place to sleep.]
Gabriel appeared to Mary,
And told her not to weep.

[""'Cause you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be the mother of Christ.
If there's no room at the Inn,
then it's not considered a sin
[to suck a dick to get a room for free!""]

That's right

And three wisemen did appear
Bearing gifts of myrrh and such.
They said that they had followed a star,
And missed a woman's touch.
[Mary thought that she might pleasure them,
But could not take them to bed.]
But, again, Gabriel appeared to her
And this is what he said

[""You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[You can suck all the dick you want,]

[Fellatio ain't no sin,
So go and blow those three wise men!]
And you'll still be a virgin,
['Cause there ain't no penetration!""]

And still be a Virgin, Mary!
[The donkey, or the ox and the lamb]
And even the little drummer boy.
Folks will remember your name quick!

Since I am a thug, why do why'all get so mad
Why can't cha'll accept that, it's my life

If I ain't a thug then why'all tell me who is
How many other mutha fuckas why'all know can do this
Yea I'm a thug fo ever and I never ever

Slippin' already cost one of my niggas
So I better select the fools that I be chillin' wit
And I don't know nothin', didn't hear or see nothin'
I can't remember, but yet still I won't forget 'em

I'm from the dark side, born and raised in a thug life
And I'm out the city from the drug dealers and wise guys
If I ain't a thug, then you explain it 'cause
How come a young nigga livin' so dangerous

And why my name always somehow involved in stuff

Trey Songz,"They say rap music is subliminal
But the music for us is like our own diary
Something like a confession
They tell me life is a bitch

She's something like the seasons
Just like mother nature
She come and go as she please
That's why they get their period once a month

I say that to say this, if you think that bitch
Summer is yours, she could be cheating on you
Ya heard?

Uh, just got me feeling like opium
I'm tryna dance with the loaded M
Open up a bottle and it goes around
I'm leaving drunk by 4 a.m.

And watch me jump in the golden Benz
Top down with the pokey rims
Now I'm swerving, so you know I'm bent
I lost count, who knows what I spent

I recall nine cleavage
Bitches stepping on my nice sneakers
One hand in the sky, the other hand was on her thigh
I was grinding to the beat with my hammer on my side

Now G's only as we speed to the Rolex
And three or four G's is what we sneeze at the Rolex
Play some out your part, it's about 6 a.m.
You think the night is over but it just began

They say clubs pacing like Bad Boys 2
You can see the snow bunnies do what bad girls do
And that's ecstasy, weed that had girl too
Scoop the bitch that had key's to some fast old blue

Now, I'm speeding to the telly, I got the Porsche behind
Trying to get in her belly the only thought on my mind
Like damn, I'm not trying to be pushy or nothing but
Since the strip joint girl, I should have been fucking

I shoulda lil' mama, listen
Spending my summers with the top dropped low
Throwing my hundreds at the top notch hoes
When we smoking on the top notch dro
Dro, dro, that's the summer wit Miami

Bottle in the air, I'm living without a care
Shorty beside me, wind blowing through her hair
Oh, no, no, that's the summer wit Miami

I can't keep it low anymore
I'll be with my girl, when it starts to snow, I get bored
And when you love three women
It's hard keeping up with lies

See, spring's my first love, I started creeping with July
Used to say I had some shows
Catching planes to M I
Then I started tricking dough, I brought the range for July

Mama said, I'm love sick over this hot ass hoochie
I seen her when I told Nas I slapped her with coffy
We don't play disrespect but that was the day that we met
Summer jam O 2, I hit the stage with my set

But her man, he was from Brooklyn
She still slipped me the number
She said, he's on vacation, so, get with me this summer
Then I been flirting wit her for about the past two years

So now, she hates seeing me in the winter
Ain't gonna last through the year
So now, I'm looking at winter like life's an adventure
And when June come, I'll be gone till September

Now, would you hate me for that?
I know your heart's cold, could you wait till I'm back?
I'm just a sucker for love
But a nigga hold you down if you wanna fuck with a thug

Spending my summers with the top dropped low
Throwing my hundreds at the top notch hoes
When we smoking on the top notch dro
Dro, dro, that's the summer wit Miami

Bottle in the air, I'm living without a care
Shorty beside me, wind blowing through her hair
Oh, no, no, that's the summer wit Miami

Spending my summers with the top dropped low
Throwing my hundreds at the top notch hoes

And mama's doing the best she could ever do
But the funny thing is when it's all said and done
She probably did it better than you could ever do

How can he make it all alone
How can he be responsible

Trey Songz,"Now I've done had lots of relationships,
Ain't none of them ever added up to shit,
My folks they always told me what you wish,
Be careful cause that one thing you could get,
So I prayed to the Lord to send me love,
Send me something like an angel from up above,
But instead I got a chick who played on my heart,
She had me feeling good then tore me apart.

Love ain't supposed to feel this way,
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain,
Love ain't supposed to make me cry,
But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes.
Love ain't supposed to feel this way,
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain,
Love ain't supposed to make me cry,
But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes.

She was like the devil in disguise,
Spending time with me and thinking of other guys,
And even though I tried my best,
I cant describe the way she made me feel,
All over a girl, who never gave her all,
Never gave me much, when it came to love,
I don't know why I spent so much time,
On a love that wasn't mine,
And the pain is so unkind.

Love ain't supposed to feel this way,
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain,
Love ain't supposed to make me cry,
But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes.
Love ain't supposed to feel this way,
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain,
Love ain't supposed to make me cry,
But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes.

Now it ain't even worth my time,
Love ain't supposed to feel like I'm losing my mind,
I once was blind but now I see,
The girl was playing games she ain't the one for me,
I'm trying to told ya,
If you find a love, just don't close your eyes, you might go blind,
Got to keep it smart, give it all your heart, if you fall to far in love you'll find the hard way.

Love ain't supposed to feel this way,
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain,
Love ain't supposed to make me cry,
But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes.

Right now we got the fifth wheel reclinin'
Trunk is popped up, screens fallin' from the sky
I got the candy paint sprayed by Eddie
And I'm ridin' on that glassy chrome, all courtesy of my hustle game,
Be a hustler's in my bloodline, I don't complain or whine
I just get on my grind, puttin' in work overtime
I learned overtime, many hustles of every kind
Whatever it takes to make a dime, I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind, but now I see the road to riches
It's a long road, full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Benard Freeman taught me to keep it movin' when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me to keep it trill at all cost
I peeped game from the best, and since then I been playin' chess
I put in work with no rest, to get that paper that's my quest
I'm on a slow grind towards success, one of the best cause I keep it fresh
I'm one hundred and nothin' less and I'm still ridin' dirty pimpin'

A flight that's promised to take you high
Way high up in the sky
So get out'cha blunts
Ya Dutchmasters and ya Backwoods
And I'll turn ya seatbelt signs off

Won't give a triple choke
And it won't hurt my throat, nope!
Chinky eyed, just ridin' n vibin'
On that real fire
Be high for two-three hours
And I'm cool wit' A-I, but hey
I ain't too much into Phillie's
But split a Dutch and I'll re-fill it
And I ain't friendly, so nope, ya can't hit it
I smoke good trees
Yo collard-greens full of reefer seeds
You use too many chemicals
Too much added stuff, fool, it ain't real kush!
One joint of that G-14
Will have you higher than your highest dreams, just floa-ting
Not knowin' if you're comin' or goin'
But when it's partly-cloudy, be prepared for the storm
And get high

Lil ma circle by my house wit' the weed trap

Spark it like a broads bush when she's on douche
Fruit cocktail, you could tell, by the smell
Burn one, let the whole club know I'm here (Hey!)

A blessing nigga still living, still pimping, still visions of
Sitting in that foreign whip, whipping up cola take a lick
To my tongue, numb from the shit
My nuts hung since I was a young one
And that's just the slum fuck of it
I'm pumped daddy gone but, gun in my palm
My momma can't save me her gender is wrong
On my own in this jungle that niggaz call home
What? His momma died from a lump in her D cup
Police freeze 'em up for serving these glucks
It's like a habitual situation, we stuck
The ritual is for niggaz to grab they nuts
And just soak all this bullshit up, where I'm from?

I'm from real bridge cause, for niggaz living hard
Welfare scarers just most chicks'll buy them broad
Pimping the government cause government pimping us
Rather see 'em suffering then niggaz live it up
Cause you ain't heard? Bird got birds
But the nigga got murd' cause niggaz felt he ain't deserve
What he was worth, he ain't a real nigga from the turf
He was birth with money, that's why they left him bloody

I adapt to em, I'm exactly in tuned with 'em

You can't slow me down, you can't hold me
So I'mma keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' goin' on strong

They say why you so defensive? I take that offensive
Comin' from the shit that I lived in
You wouldn't understand him unless you eye witness
Chillin' on the block where vacant lots are given

Women and children, missin' men in the picture
These niggas hit up sittin' down at some center
Get a kite with a flick of a chick, he once hit up
Ridiculous but that's us niggas

On the corner from dusk to dawn
Till that shit whites brought to America's gone
Be a good Samaritan, my heritage was did wrong
So all that sufferin' that's just prolong

Long as you knowin' that strong arm robbery
Was brought on from this society deprivin' me
This brings violence if you're not survivin'
My environment, don't expect you to be drivin' in

Only my mama done seen me cry, this my life
I'll be thuggin' till the day I die, this my life
You niggas don't know me
You can't slow me down, you can't hold me
So I'mma keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' goin' on strong

Mama worked 37 years at the plant
34 days she missed, that's where I get my grind at
Her little nigga, see her as father figure
Even though she got hips and tender bitch up

Show me how to maneuver snakes far as niggas
Eleanor Trice, one real sister
Raised the kids up to be go getters
Now a nigga living room big as an ampatheater

Got the theater nigga, I'm from the hood
So at times I see the mirror and tell him he doin' good
Keep up my spirits 'cause niggas want him destroyed
But that's null and void when it comes to ya boy

I'm from Detroit, Shady employee
I'm on a voyage tryna get more than royalties
Niggas some royalty, that's why your bitches spoil me
O T are I see E

Only my mama done seen me cry, this my life
I'll be thuggin' till the day I die, this my life

You can't slow me down, you can't hold me
So I'mma keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' goin' on strong

I got visions of makin' executive decisions
But the system tells me to be realistic
You can't do shit with see's and D's
I can do the work, I'm just interested in makin' cheese

So your schools can't control these G's
He got his own rules and do whatever he please
At ease to my soldiers that's feelin' Obie
Long as I know my 1, 2, 3's I'm flippin' OZ's

A nigga can count like an accountant

Doubted him, now look at the child's outcome

I assume I'm valuable, they throwin' in the towel
Bow whenever they see him rollin' at diablo

Only my mama done seen me cry, this my life
I'll be thuggin' till the day I die, this my life

You can't slow me down, you can't hold me
So I'mma keep rollin', rollin', rollin' goin' on strong

[Chorus]
Store run
pack of three up at the counter.
Store run
be back in less than half an hour.
Store run
I need protection and I'm out
wait for me, keep it warm
I had to make a store run.

[Verse]
Speedin', switchin' lanes, and I'm flyin,
And tryin to get back to her
before she changes her mind.
Cuz if I take too long,
she might put her clothes back on.
Henny in my system,


She tipsy on that Grey Goose.
It's obvious what she's tryna get into.
Top huggin' them curves (them curves)
Got a nigga like me at a loss for words.
I know she can tell that I'm wit it,
Wanna get it, while inside your tee
She can tell when I'm close to her.
She keep lickin her lips,
She touchin and she grabbin.
Oh
I'ma throw her the bone.
I'ma give it to her all night long.
I want it bad, oh so bad.
But I know that it's wrong.
Here we go.

[Pre-Chorus]
She want it and I want it too
but I'm unprepared.
And we came so close to goin' raw dog that we both got scared.
And then she said, ""I ain't ready to have no babies.""
Jumped up put my clothes back on.
I was just about to get some
had to make a store run.

[Chorus x2]
Store run
Pack of three up at the counter.
Store run
Be back in less than half an hour.
Store run
I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm
I had to make a store run.

All I could do is think of being inside you,
Drivin like I'm up out of my mind.
Baby here I come.
And you can take your clothes back off.

[Chorus x3]
Store run
Pack of three up at the counter.
Store run
Be back in less than half an hour.
Store run
I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm
I had to make a store run.

I know, I know
Shoulda thought of this before.
But who would've thought that we'd end up right on the kitchen floor?
I ain't ready to have no babies.
No ifs, ands, buts, or maybes.
I'm tryna keep it safe.

First time I [called ?] her shit, she ain't even know how to throw it back
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night
'Cause after I beat ya baby I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice

She my Lamborghini, I'm her 57, 
When she hold me I close my eyes and just picture heaven, 
She picture perfect, this a perfect picture, 
I'm stuffing thousand lines in each and every verse I get ya, 
I kiss her in the mouth, she watch my money stack, 
She know I'm here forever, its deeper then a rap, 
I have multiple showing, she one in a milli,
Now its colorful stones, cause there's ice in my phillies,

[Juelz Santana]
Sorry, I gotta go I gotta get it, 
But she know how daddy roll I'm coming back home wit it, 
Sometime I take her wit me when I go and get my dough, 
Cause my girl roll harder then some niggas I know, 
And I know, that she know, I'm by her side, 
She by my side, 
And if I ride then she goin' ride and we goin' ride until we die, now now now now, 
Picture us rolling, in something stolen, steering wheel twirlin', 
Who? me and my girlfriend.

[Chorus]

[Ace Hood]
I gotta chick that'll hold me down, she moving no, when im outta town, 
She ride or die and keep it line she never deny me down, 
She find me shit that's bigger then ? the baddest bitch around, 
That's why I let her push the whip and drop the top and down, 
And give her the stacks you just imagine you should see the smiles,
I have her shipping crates to different places out of town, 
Baby we balling see them hatas they so out of bounds, 
Lets have a toast, I'm supposed to lay your body down, 
I spread the money round give it to ya doggy style, 
See this the remix bay I might just put that tonguing down, 
Gotta keep it gutta baby I'm trying to hear that moaning sound, 
Cause you my ride or die it ain't no question about that

It's like B. Gizzle, the world wide ghetto pass

It ain't no secret I can tell ya bout the gutta man
I'm a write a book on how to come out the struggle man
Now come through, you know what's in them dufflebags
A lot of gats, a lot of cash, and some ski masks
You know my street pass, it been certified
Stop lying I'm a g you been heard about
Stop repping, you a pussy I been heard of you
You playin with a gangsta homie the nerve of you
Oh you lookin for me, but the homie lookin for you

I said bust somethin, shoot somethin
You just talking I know you ain't gon do nothin
Pussy nigga (ya heard me?)

Salt and pepper, nigga I'm seasoned for any reason
The day you want something with Juve, come on and see him
My G ain't gon allow me to lose, I'm busting shots as soon as you make a move
Oooh, I'm not a fan of fools that's why I got attitude
Runnin your mouth to me, I'm a try to get at a dude

Gon head and choose ya [? ], cause I'm a shoot

Anything I will commit it just to show that I'm committed
Commit it then get acquitted
Aye Gizzle let me get em, Gizzle let me get em
Eat em up and shit em (ha)
And ain't no explanation for this damn insanity
I'm a monster like I'm part of the Addams Family
And some say I am old, but I'm new to a few
And I'm blessed... achoo

And I'm so me and I'm not you
And even if you get married you could'nt do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals

[Scarface Verse 1]
I think if Adam would of had another squeeze he might
Not have ate those fruits from the leaves of light
Far as Eve, we could of been the more deceiving wife
Seeing the nigga had a weak spot and she was right
I just call it how I see it, she in love with him
And he in love too, and still be fucking all of them
Can you imagine you in lock with one breeze for life?
Waking up in the morning and laying down the night
With the same face looking at you all the time
Realizing now that happiness was hard to find
You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face
Plus she's always mad, and her sex ain't great
And she don't suck dick like she used to do
Force a nigga into trying to find him something new
And on the real, I done seen it when it went like this
But girl there's one thing happening that you can't forget

[Chorus]

[Scarface Verse 2]
But you can never be my main boo, we can remain cool
But we can't be seen and for this I can blame you
Because you got more miles than a F-350
You been ran through, and I know for a fact you got history
But since we met, I've been hearing your name in certain circles
Pussy got a snap like a turtle
And you can catch a nigga on the late night
Coming out the club, half drunk off Remy and Sprite
You make a man out of your clit, that's how you handle the dick
It's unlike no other, she a bad motherfucker
But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercover
Make me look fucked up, because unlike those others
I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan
So you can't get mad because I am not your man
Your under-standing was bad, it was not my plan
For you to fall in love with me, girl it's not like that

[Chorus]

[Scarface Verse 3]
For me to say that, ""I do, "" would be a lie because I don't
Believe no woman is right for me so I won't
Try to talk myself into thinking she is
And if she leaves me for this, that's just one less bitch
And trust me, I tried to be a one woman man
But for every one woman, there's a man, home man
Saying, ""Damn, I done spent six years in this shit
The first two was cool and then the bitch just flipped""
And then that's it, had to make some new plans
'Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man
And you're hurt all along, steady hitting her phone
But a bigger dick and longer bank roll, she gone
And if I ever say, ""Maybe, "" and you thought that I might
You consider, just imagine what my wife was like
And if you ain't love my kids like you loved your own
And me unconditionally when I was wrong, I was gone

Shorty poolside, one piece Veroaine
She the baddest bitch in them Jackie O shades
Flabby beach mat, she don't give me no shade
Hold the heat down, she don't even know Wade
Nigga get smoked like cigarette tote
I like her soft kiss and I dig her wet throat
I love her booty bounce like cigarette boats
And it won't quit
She can't wear skinny jeans cause her ass don't fit
Real shit

It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that

How you living, what? How you living, what?
How you living, oh I be living fabulous

Got a rich bitch on the way
That for real though, just like Wanda say
She just wanna rock my world in the Wonder way
I'm sitting at the airport like Andele
Fist I saw the Luggy with the Louie monogram
Then I saw my baby like a sonogram
On the runway, just me and Bentley
I open doors, you ain't gotta G the gent me
I was thinking Knicks game, court side
She put her hands in my pants, I let that thought slide
We can get it on, but there's no leg room
No water bed, just a boat with a bedroom
Now you tell me who can top this
Hey, laying on the deck topless
Got two different dames, it's a Fabolous thing
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain

It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that
Get your money right, you could be living that
You could be living that, you could be living that

Gave you the benefit of the doubt
Till you showed me what you were about
Your true colors came out

Oh

And your words couldn't hide the scent
'Cause the truth about where you've been
Is in a fragrance I can recognize

Standing there
Scratching your head
Blood shot eyes
Drunk with regret
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge
I'm done with this
Feeling like an idiot
Lovin' you--I'm over it
I just don't love you, don't love you no more

You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay
See, you, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
I don't wanna hear a thing you say
So yesterday

Funny now how I'm gone
The little light in your head came on
Now you realize it's all your fault, ooo, ooo

Don't you wish you had a time machine?
That way you could change history
That's the only way that you could be with me

Power down your inhibitions and power up your inner freak

But enough about me let me think
Should I be worrying about if I can handle you

All night I'ma whip that thing, all state better put a claim on it
I claim my territory, my tongue finna mark you up

It's kind of ironic that I slow down,
It's best that I go now rather than later

Hungry but I don't wanna have my cake and eat it too
And it's not that I ain't feelin you

Trey Songz,"We were so dumb in love
Couldn't get enough, no
But I could've loved you so much better
And I can't believe you never walked out
And it's not your fault

That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
You did everything I asked of you
Drived across the country if I asked you too
But I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart
I'm bad news, yeah I'm just bad for you
I'm bad news, I fumbled your heart

Girl you used to feel so pound my heart
I wish we could touch some more
I'm sitting, working on this letter
The first line I write, I was wrong
So wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
And it's not your fault
So wrong, so wrong, so wrong

That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
You did everything I asked of you
Drived across the country if I asked you too
But I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart
I'm bad news, yeah I'm just bad for you
I'm bad news, I fumbled your heart

It's all or nothing
Give you my all or nothing
Want all of you or nothing
I'm sorry that I messed up girl
Really love you, really really love you
Now that I know I love you
I'll never love another girl
And it's not your fault

That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
I should've let go
You did everything I asked of you
Drived across the country if I asked you too
Never asked you to, I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart
She said I ain't gonna change
Ever since the day we met
And her mama said the same
I dropped the ball I'm so ashamed
I'm bad news, real bad news, I fumbled your heart",Fumble,2012
