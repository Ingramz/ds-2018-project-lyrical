Fred Martin & the Levite Camp,"Gather your deeds and your possessions,
Whatever certainty you've known.
Forget your heroes,
You don't really need those last few lessons.

Stand in the open,
The next voice you hear will be your own.

How right they knew that they could hurt you,
And you let them cut you to the bone.
But, God forbid, you allow them to rid you of your virtue.
Forget their laughter,
The next voice you hear will be your own.

The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear will be your own.

Throw down your truth and check your weapons.
Don't look to see if you're alone. 
Just stand your ground,
And don't turn around, whatever happens.
Don't ask directions, 
The next voice you hear will be your own.

The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear,
The next voice you hear will be your own.",The Next Voice You Hear,2006
Fred Moch,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
For strangers in the night.",Strangers in the Night,2003
Fred Moch,"L is for the way you look at me.
O is for the only one I see.
V is very, very extraordinary.
E is even more than anyone that you adore can.

Love is all that I can give to you,
Love is more than just a game for two.
Two in love can make it.
Take my heart and please don't break it,
Love was made for me and you.

Fred Mollin,"Baby mine, don't you cry.
Baby mine, dry your eyes.
Rest your head close to my heart,
Never to part, baby of mine.

Little one, when you play
Pay no heed what they say.
Let your eyes sparkle and shine,
Never a tear, baby of mine.

If they knew all about you,
They'd end up loving you, too.
All those same people who scold you,
What they'd give just for the right to hold you.

From your head down to your toes,
You're not much, goodness knows.
But you're so precious to me,
Sweet as can be, baby of mine.",Baby Mine,2000

Makes no difference who you are

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat

Life is just a bright sunny day
Your cares fade away 
And your heart is young

There's no use in grumbling
When the raindrops come tumbling

Who can fill the world with sunshine

When you smile and you sing
Everything is in tune and it's spring
And life flows along
With a smile and a song",With a Smile and a Song [From Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs],2002

Fred Mollin,"He's lazy, but he's lovable, we know him like a book
Anytime he can't be found, we know just where to look:
 
Gone fishin', there's a sign upon his door
Gone fishin', he ain't workin' anymore
There's his hoe out in the sun where he left a row half done
He said ""hoein' ain't no fun"", he ain't got no ambition
Gone fishin' by a shady wady pool
I'm wishin' I could be that kinda fool
I'd say no more work for mine on my door I'd hang a sign
Gone fishin' Instead of just a wishin'
 
Gone fishin'. . .see him snoozin' by a brook
Gone fishin'. . .didn't even bait his hook
There's his hound dog by his side fleas are bitin' at his hide
He won't scratch 'em he's to tired he ain't got no ambition
Gone fishin'. . .learnin' fishin' worms to swim
I'm wishin. . .he wuz me and I wuz him
Wish I had a plane to fly here's what I'd write in the sky
Gone' fishin'. . .instead of jest awishin'
 
Gone fishin'. . . he don't worry 'bout no wars
Gone fishin'. . .left his wife to do the chores
Cows need milkin' in the barn but he jest don't give a darn
See his fishin' pole is gone he's on a secret mission
Gone fishin'. . .out where peace has never died
I'm wishin'. . .all the world was by his side

Now I'm gonna tell you a little story
About the stuff dreams are made of, heh heh heh!

I'll tell you when it started
I remember it was way back when
I sat there crying, my sister was sighing, my blanket was my only friend
Felt like it was hopeless
The baby food was grey and bland
I needed something yummy for my baby tummy, I needed to make a stand

Then suddenly I'm chewing on a slice of sheer delight
It was a snack worth snacking
My lips were smacking, my friends, I've seen the light!

(Cheese, please) that's all I gotta say
(Cheese, please) I eat it every day

Some people like it on a string
Some folks prefer it grilled
Pass me some Gouda, I'm always in the mood-a
I can never get my fill

Talkin' 'bout (cheese, please) that's what I love to eat
(Cheese, please) the taste that can't be beat

When I wake I scramble some into my morning meal
Later macaroni, some cheddar and baloney
Just depends on how I feel!

Cheese, please
That's what I feel like, just some cheese!
Any kind of cheese!
Mozzarella
Parmesan
Very easy!
Any kind of cheese
Just feed me some cheese

Swiss and Brie are cool with me, I love that Camembert
It feels so fine, ain't life divine
When you've got cheese to share!

Cheese, please, it satisfies my soul!
Talkin' 'bout cheese, please, I lose my self-control
Cheese, please, as much as I'm allowed
Cheese, please, the food that comes from cows
Moo!

And eternity near

And shed not a tear

When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil

Fred Penner,"Winken and Blinken and Nod one night
Sailed off on a wooden shoe
Sailed down a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

Now where are you going and what do you wish?
The old moon asked the three
Well we're going out fishing for Herring fish
That live in the beautiful sea

And some silver and gold have we
Said, Winken and Blinken and Nod

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in their wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

While the little stars were the Herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
Now cast your nets wherever you wish
Never a feared are we

So sang the stars to the fishermen three
Winken and Blinken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

T'was all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
And some folks thought t'was a dream
They dreamed of sailing the beautiful sea

But I shall name you the fishermen three
Winken and Blinken and Nod

Now Winken and Blinken are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle bed

So close your eyes while mother sings
Of the beautiful sights that be
And you will see the wonderful things
As you rock in your misty sea

Where the old moon rocked the fishermen three
Winken and Blinken and Nod

Fred Penner,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Fred Penner,"When you find that your mind
Keeps you worried and blue
You can always let your feet
Keep your disposition sweet

Want to see
What makes me feel the way I do?
Will you kindly cast an eye
On two good reasons why?

Happy feet
I've got those happy feet
Give them a low down beat
And they begin dancing

I've got those ten little tapping toes
And when they hear a tune
I can't control my dancing heals
To save my soul

Weary blues can't get into my shoes
Because my shoes refuse to ever grow weary
I keep cheerful on an earful of music, sweet
'Cause I've got hap, hap, happy feet, yes

Happy feet, happy feet, happy feet
We've got those happy feet
Give them a low down beat
And they begin dancing

We've got those ten little tapping toes
And when they hear a tune
We can't control our dancing heals
To save our souls

Weary blues can't get into our shoes
Because our shoes refuse to ever grow weary
We keep cheerful on an earful of music, sweet
'Cause we've got hap, hap, happy feet, oh yes, we do
'Cause we've got hap, hap, happy feet

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002

Took me to the jail
It's oh me and it's oh my
No one to go my bail

It was late last night when Willie came home
I heard him a-rapping on the door
He's a-slipping and a-sliding with his new shoes on
Mamma said Willie don't you rap no more

Took me to the jail

Sittin' in that big armed chair
One arm around this old guitar
And the other one around my dear

And a dollar is all that I crave

",Way Downtown,
Fred Price,"No home, no home, said a little girl
At the door of a rich man's home
She trembling stood on the marble steps
And leaned on the polished wall

Her clothes were thin and her feet were bare
And the snowflakes covered her head
Let me come in, she feebly said
Please give me a little bread

As the little girl still trembling stood
Before that rich man's door
With a frowning face he scornfully said
No room, no bread for the poor

Then the rich man went to his table so fine
Where he and his family were fed
And the orphan stood in the snow so deep
As she cried for a piece of bread

The rich man slept on his velvet couch
And he dreamed of his silver and gold
While the orphan lay in a bed of snow
And murmured, so cold, so cold

The hours rolled on through the midnight storm
Rolled on like a funeral bell
The sleet came down in a blinding sheet
And the drifting snow still fell

When morning came the little girl
Still lay at the rich man's door
But her soul had fled away to its home
Where there's room and there's bread for the poor",Little Orphan Girl,1967

In a bad Laredo fight,
Killed him with my bare hands
For the girl I loved that night.
Jed's brother's out to get me, 
He's comin' with a gang
I'd rather shoot it out, by God, than let 'em see me hang

Bullet in my shoulder,
Blood runnin' down my vest,
Twenty in the posse,

15 miles to the, Love Shack! Love Shack yeah
I'm headin' down the Atlanta highway, lookin' for the love getaway

Glitter on the front porch
Glitter on the hallway

Fred Small,"Annie's up at seven on a work day
Brewing up a cup of peppermint tea
Gathering her papers and lesson plans
She grabs her keys
Teaching arithmetic and Africa
Geology and girls' basketball
All the kids in her class will tell you she's the best
But she's heard other teachers in the hall saying

[Chorus]
""What are we going to do about Annie
Pretty girl like her shouldn't be alone
If she took our advice, dressed up real nice
She'd find a man to take her home""

Mondays come with questions of couples
Where and with whom did you go
Avoiding the personal pronoun
She hopes it doesn't show
Shopping with her lover in the city
Two women holding hands don't get a stare
If the kids at school knew, what would they do
Would they hate her, why should they care, tell me

[Chorus]

Never getting too close to a student
Never letting out too much of her life
Keeping her delights and disappointments
Tucked out of sight
Annie takes herself to the Christmas party
The principal whispers with a smile
""You're vivacious and bright, if you play your cards right
There's some men here tonight worth your while,"" thinking

[Chorus]

Work that you love is hard to come by
The kids she could never bear to lose
So she makes conversation out of silences
And half-truths
But at night by the fire with her lover
She looks out at the wind-driven snow
And imagines the day when she'll look in their faces
And tell everybody she knows, she'll tell them

Don't you worry about Annie
She don't lie awake and pine
Got love to fill her heart, flowers growing in the garden
Annie's doing just fine",Annie,1984
Fred Small,"All my life
Working at the factory
The pay looked mighty good to me
When my body was my own
Doctor won't look me in the eye
My youngest child asks why
I won't ever see her grown.
CHORUS:
Now I can feel the darkness
Growing wild inside me
Catching my soul by surprise
You know that you've made it
You got your home, your job, and some good times
Then they tell you it was death in disguise.
In the consultation room
They explain the x-ray slide
I stop the rising tide
Of self-pity and cold fear
Pale in the fluorescent light
I find no one left to fight
And remember all my careless years.
CHORUS
Half the town works there
So people fear the truth
There's no conclusive proof
There's any danger in those fumes
The company never saw my face
They've got another in my place
Another life to be consumed.
CHORUS

",Death in Disguise,1984
Fred Small,"You hear so many rumors sometimes you get confused
But I read it in Time Magazine and I heard it on the news
We'll see dramatic changes in the lifestyle we enjoy
If those megatons of atom bombs are actually employed.
The scenarios are scary, oh, but they don't worry me
Since I received a pamphlet from a federal agency
It's got diagrams and checklists and I read it front to back
And it told me what to do in case of nuclear attack:  Just
CHORUS:
Dig a hole in the ground, and climb right on down
Lay some boards on top of you and sprinkle dirt around
You won't have to be dead if you only plan ahead
You'll be glad you kept a shovel on hand!
Now you can't just go picking any old place to dig your hole
Got to take a ride to the countryside to the town where you are
told
If your plates are odd-numbered please don't panic, you'll be
fine
Just politely let those even-numbered cars go first in line
If you don't have a car, just hail a cab or ride your bike
You can climb aboard the Amtrak train, sit back, and enjoy the
sights
You and thousands of your city friends will be welcomed
cordially
By townfolk who will show you country hospitality--then
CHORUS
We're sure to give you notice up to seven days before
But it's wise to recognize the warning signs of nuclear war
If the temperature is rising in a flash of blinding light
Grab your toothbrush and a flashlight and shut the windows tight
If the wind is blowing wicked and there's buildings in the air
Blisters on you body, fire in your hair
If the tupperware is melting and your dinner plans are wrecked
Stay calm, it's time to put this foolproof plan into effect: 
Just
CHORUS","Dig a Hole in the Ground, or, How to Prosper During the Coming Nuclea",1984
Fred Small,"In the stillness of the alley waits a man with an open blade
And he hurts the woman badly and within her plants his seed
She can't shake the dirt and horror as the seed takes root and grows
But the law now claims her body, the doctor's door is closed
She goes back to another alley to a leering butcher's blade
And the deal is dark and bloody in the crime the law has made.
CHORUS:
And the face at the window never blinks never turns away
When you wake in the night to a flashing light
When you burn on judgment day
They have spoke aloud your daydreams
They have listened to your plans
They have watched you dance in the rainstorm
They have seen you ride the wind.
Walking slowly home at night a man touching a man
And the car looks kind of familiar and it's coming round again
You got no chance in that deadly dance when they cut you to the bone
There's a bleeding gash from the broken glass and you hear somebody moan
And maybe somebody calls the cops and they take their own sweet time
And they say it's just a couple of fags again and maybe your friend is dying.
CHORUS
And your lover comes to you softly and you touch and you feel no shame
And you steal away from the city and lightning fills your veins
In an air-conditioned office the committee discusses your case
They know the words you whispered they felt the flush upon your face.
They have files on every fantasy, who's on top and who's below
You have crossed into the shadow place where outlaws freely roam.
CHORUS
You can drink the lies of paradise while the books on the shelves disappear
You can make a comfortable living, you can swear it can't happen here
And maybe they'll come for the unionists and maybe they'll come for the Jews
And maybe they'll come for the heretics but they'll never come for you
When you hear the step in the hallway, when you taste the iron fear
Don't you go shouting out for justice 'cause there's no one left to hear.
CHORUS


 ",Face at the Window,1984
Fred Small,"From the land of shooting waters to the peaks of the Coeur d'Alene
Thimbleberries in the forest, elk grazing on the plain
The People of the Coyote made their camp along the streams
Of the green Wallowa Valley when fences had no name

And they bred a strain of horses, the treasure of the tribe
Who could toe-dance on a ridge or gallop up a mountainside
Who could haul the hunter's burden, turn a buffalo stampede
The horse that wore the spotted coat was born with matchless speed

[Chorus]
Thunder Rolling in the Mountains
Lead the People across the Great Divide
There's blood on the snow in the hills of Idaho
But the heart of the Appaloosa never died

In the winter came the crowned ones near frozen in the cold
Bringing firearms and spyglasses and a book that saves the soul
The people gave them welcome, nursed them till their strength returned
And studied the talking paper, its mysteries to learn

In the shadow of the mission sprang up farms and squatter towns
The plain was lined with fences, the plow blade split the ground
In the shallows of the Clearwater gold glittered in the pan
And the word would come from Washington: remove the Indian

[Chorus]

The chief spoke to the People in his anger and his pain 
""I am no more Chief Joseph. Rolling Thunder is my name. 
They condemn us to a wasteland of barren soil and stone 
We shall fight them if we must, but we will find another home.""

They fled into the Bitterroot, an army at their heels
They fought at White Bird Canyon, they fought at Misery Hill
Till the colonel saw his strategy and sent the order down
To kill the Appaloosa wherever it be found

[Chorus]

Twelve hundred miles retreating, three times over the Divide
The horse their only safety, their only ally
Three thousand Appaloosas perishod with the tribe
The people and the horses dying side by side

Thunder Rolling in the Mountains said, ""my heart is sick and sad.
Our children now are freezing. The old chiefs are dead.
The hunger take our spirit. Our wounds are deep and sore.
From where the sun now stands I shall fight no more.""

[Chorus]

They were sent to Oklahoma, malaria ran rife
But more died of broken hearts far from the land that gave them life
And the man once called Joseph at death was heard to say
""We have given up our horses. They have gone away.""

But sometimes without warning from a dull domestic herd
A spotted horse of spirit wondrous will emerge
Strong it is and fearless and nimble on a hill
Listening for thunder, the Appaloosa's living still

[Chorus]",The Heart of the Appaloosa,1984
Fred Small,"In nineteen thirty-who at a zoo in Los Angeles
a polar bear named Larry performed for the crowd,
they'd cheer aloud
He'd go slipping and sliding, jumping and diving
The people would laugh. They took his photograph.
Larry was born at the zoo
He never knew as he grew older
anything colder
than Los Angeles
which is warmer than Alaska
where Larry's parents were born.
CHORUS:
Larry the polar bear
He'd never harm a hair on a child's head
He'd do tricks for them
at the Los Angeles zoo,
as he'd been taught to by his keeper Fran.
Fran would teach him new tricks
A funny pose
scratching his nose
He knew there'd be a fish at the end,
Fran was his friend.
One day she said ""Larry, you'll be in the movies
with real movie stars and a few simple tricks
and lots of fish
to be filmed on location in Alaska.""
and so they rehearsed for Larry's big scene,
He's supposed to be mean
and growl at a woman who was rescued by a man who scared him away
It was stupid
but fun to do.
The director would frown
and jump up and down
kind of like the chimps at the zoo.
CHORUS
At last came the day of the trip
They put Larry in a crate
twelve foot by eight
and he sailed aboard a steamship
The journey was long
and boring
Fran would visit
she'd talk to him
and bring him his favorite fish
then the noise and the rumbling stopped
and they lowered him down
set the crate on the frozen ground
and opened it
Fran said ""Larry, we're here
It's time for your tricks.""
And Larry appeared
He looked out at the gray Bering Sea
He squinted and puzzled
put his nose to the wind
and the scent of the seal made him tremble
He smelled the fox in its lair
and the weasel and hare
felt lichen and snow 'neath his paws,
and he looked at the tundra and ice,
looked at the loon in the sky and he ran
slowly at first
kind of lumbering
he ran
gathering speed
gathering memories from within
old and dim
growing stronger
to run and to swim,
to dive and to float,
the cold at his throat
But warm inside
'neath the fur and hide
Ocean and ice all around him
He ran
He ran
He ran
and he swam away.
",Larry the Polar Bear,1984
Fred Small,"The market place was bustlying in the morning
When the army and the ORDEN made their strike
Like a farmer killing chickens for the market
They cut down every living thing in sight.
They tore into the wombs of the women
The sunlight gleaming on their bayonets
And the fishermen downstream, though they never heard the screams
Hauled in a harvest of human carnage in their nets.
CHORUS:
Take down my name
I ain't alone, I ain't ashamed
And I say U.S.A. out of El Salvador!
You can tell the Pentagon
We want no more Vietnams
We ain't marching into that jungle anymore.
She left her home in Ohio far behind her
She swore a sacred vow to help the poor
With three sisters she was raped and slowly tortured
Left in a shallow grave in El Salvador.
A doctor, he would grieve at all the suffering
He never asked his patient's party line
But he saved a rebel's life--the death squad came at night
Healing the sick his only crime.
CHORUS
Our taxes buy the bullets of the killers
Our helicopters darken southern skies
Our business wants new markets and cheap labor
Our papers rush to print C.I.A. lies
But take a message to the smiling politicians
Who like to talk so tough and act so brave
The rattling words of war, we've heard them all before
And we will answer them with peace and joy and rage.
CHORUS
",No More Vietnams,1984
Fred Small,"CHORUS:
Peace is the bread we break
Love is the river rolling
Life is a chance we take
When we make this earth our home
Gonna make this earth our home.

Feel the cool breeze blowing through the smoke and the heat
Hear the gentle voices and the marching feet
Singing call back the fire, draw the missiles down
And we'll call this earth our home.

CHORUS

We have known the atom, the power and pain
We've seen people fall beneath the killing rain
If the mind still reasons and the soul remains
It shall never be again.

As the acorn grows into the tallest tree
Many years ago I heard a soldier say
When people want peace, better get out of the way.

Fred Small,"I went for a jog in the city air
I met a woman in a wheelchair
I said ""I'm sorry to see you're handicapped.""
She says ""What makes you think a thing like that?""

And she looks at me real steady
And she says, ""You want to drag?""

So she starts to roll and I start to run
And she beat the pants off my aching buns
You know going uphill I'd hit my stride
But coming down she'd sail on by!

When I finally caught up with her
She says ""Not bad for somebody ablebodied.
You know, with adequate care and supervision
You could be taught simple tasks.
So how about something to eat?""

I said that'd suit me fine
""We're near a favorite place of mine.""
So we mosied on over there
But the only way in was up a flight of stairs.

""Gee, I never noticed that,"" says I.
""No problem,"" the maitre d' replies.
""There's a service elevator around the back.""

So we made it upstairs on the elevator
With the garbage, flies, and last week's potatoes
I said ""I'd like a table for my friend and me.""
He says ""I'll try to find one out of the way.""

Then he whispers, ""Uh, is she gonna be sick,
I mean, pee on the floor or throw some kind of fit?""
I said ""No, I don't think so,
I think she once had polio.

But that was twenty years ago.
You see, the fact of the matter is,
If the truth be told,
She can't walk.

So he points to a table, she wheels her chair
Some people look down and others stare
And a mother grabs her little girl
Says ""Keep away, honey, that woman's ill.""

We felt right welcome.

Then a fella walks up and starts to babble
About the devil and the holy bible
Says ""Woman, though marked with flesh's sin,
Pray to Jesus, you'll walk again!""

Then the waiter says ""What can I get for you?""
I said ""I'll have your best imported brew.""
And he says ""What about her?""
I say ""Who?"" He says ""Her.""

""Oh, you mean my friend here.""
He says ""Yeah."" I say ""What about her?""
""Well, what does she want?""
""Well, why don't you ask her?""

Then he apologizes.
Says he never waited on a cripple before.
We immediately nominated him for Secretary of the Interior.

Well, she talked to the manager when we were through

She says ""There're some things you could do
To make it easier for folks in wheelchairs.""
He says ""Oh, it's not necessary.

Handicapped never come here anyway.""

Well, I said goodnight to my newfound friend
I said, ""I'm beginning to understand
A little bit of how it feels
To roll through life on a set of wheels.""

She says ""Don't feel sorry, don't feel sad,
I take the good along with the bad
I was arrested once at a protest demo
And the police had to let me go.

See, we were protesting the fact
That public buildings weren't wheelchair accessible.
Turned out the jail was the same way.
Anyway, I look at it this way--
In fifty years you'll be in worse shape than I am now.
See, we're all the same, this human race.
Some of us are called disabled. And the rest--
Well, the rest of you are just temporarily able-bodied ",Talking Wheelchair Blues,1984
Fred Small,"Lately you been traveling more than you are here
As your dreams describe a circle growing year by year
The postcard you send from Vancouver or South Bend
Recalls the friend too long away.

May the rain run off your shoulder when you're caught in a storm
When the frost comes a-calling may it find you safe and warm
May your place be set, may your promises be kept,
May you never forget you are loved.

It was storming in Seattle when your car wouldn't start
Sunny in Salinas, where you nearly broke your heart
It was snowing in St. Paul but the people filled the hall
And you sent them all home singing through the cold.

All the big Italian women who look just like me
You can take your slender models and their Fifth Avenue clothes
But you'll never find a flower like the big Italian rose

Well, the more she thought about it, the more it made her mad
How they make you feel so ugly, how they make you feel so bad
Sell you junk food and booze then make you diet till you're dead
She sat and wrote a letter and this is what it said:

The dress I wore at 20 I cannot wear today
Just an ordinary woman and it sure would make me glad
Just for once to see someone like me in your ad""

She feels the stings of a thousand fires as the city around her dies
Some sleep beneath the rubble, some wake to a different world
From the crying babe will grow a laughing girl

Ten summers fade to autumn, ten winters' snows have passed
She's a child of dreams and dances, she's a racer strong and fast
But the headaches come ever more often and the dizziness always returns
And the word that she hears is leukemia and it burns

Cranes over Hiroshima, white and red and gold
Flicker in the sunlight like a million vanished souls
I will fold these cranes of paper to a thousand one by one
And I'll fly away when I'm done

From squares of colored paper, it will take the pain away
With loving hands she folds them, 6 hundred 44
Till the morning her stumbling fingers can't fold anymore

[Chorus]

Her friends did not forget her, crane after crane they made
Until they reached a thousand and laid them upon her grave
People from everywhere gathered, together a prayer they said
And they wrote the words in granite so none can forget

This is our cry, this is our prayer, peace in the world
This is our cry, this is our prayer, peace in the world

Washed the dishes and put them away
I have told you a story and tucked you in tight
At the end of your knockabout day
As the moon sets its sails to carry you to sleep
Over the midnight sea
I will sing you a song no one sang to me
May it keep you good company.

CHORUS:
You can be anybody you want to be,
You can love whomever you will
You can travel any country where your heart leads
And know I will love you still
You can live by yourself, you can gather friends around,
You can choose one special one
And the only measure of your words and your deeds
Will be the love you leave behind when you're done.

There are girls who grow up strong and bold
There are boys quiet and kind
Some race on ahead, some follow behind
Some go in their own way and time
Some women love women, some men love men
Some raise children, some never do
You can dream all the day never reaching the end
Of everything possible for you.

Don't be rattled by names, by taunts, by games
But seek out spirits true
If you give your friends the best part of yourself
They will give the same back to you.

Like everyone in the world
He's kind of awkward, he's kind of fragile
Kind of graceful, kind of tough
He's kind of slow, he's kind of clever
He's just Leslie and that's enough

He just lay there helpless and silent
Not a tear, not a smile, not a word
But they held him and rocked him and sang him to sleep
And talked to him as if he really heard
And he grew with the sun and affection
Though his body was spindly and small
And a hundred times they stood him with his hands upon the fence
And a hundred times watched him fall

May used to play the piano
And sing the old songs from the war
There was always music on the radio
And the records she bought at the store
And sometimes they swore he was listening
Though of course there was no way to know
Maybe he was flying in his own blue sky
Where no one else would ever go
Maybe he was lost in a forest
Where demons and woodspirits dwell
But for sixteen years he had never spoke a word
Never taken one step for himself, but they said

Along about three in the morning
A ripple of music broke the night
Joe's fallen asleep at the TV again
May reached over to turn on the light
But the music kept getting louder
And the TV was quiet and cold
Leslie was playing the piano
And his fingers were agile and bold
A Tchaikovsky piano concerto
Like water breaking over a dam
A river of ecstasy flowed through his hands
And each note cried out, ""I am!"" because

Fred Small,"And it's Eichmann and Himmler are turning the screws
The Fuhrer they say grows impatient
""How can it be Denmark's Jews still walk free
After three years of kind occupation?
We will take them like sheep in their beds as they sleep
On the second night of their new year
Devoutly at home they'll be helpless alone
When they cry out no one will hear""

But Duckwitz the German tells Hedtoft the Dane
""My friend I have dangerous news
In three hours the transport ships will set at anchor
You must warn them warn all the Jews""
Soon good Rabbi Melchior stands in the synagogue
""There'll be no service today
The raids come tomorrow, dwell not on your sorrow
By nightfall we must be away""

[Chorus]
And it's fire up the diesel and look out for swells
We're leaving Espergaerde behind us
Who strike at our friends strike us as well
We'll pray the patrol boats don't find us
When the sirens are wailing and shouts fill the night
Never will you stand alone
So it's over the Oresund
Till the day we can welcome you home

Sompolinski the tailor on the eve of Rosh Hashana
Gathers his family near
""The Lord is my light and salvation
Whom on this earth shall I fear?""
When a young Danish gentile steps into the glow
Of the candle with tears flowing down
""Good neighbors flee - I pray you believe me""
And as quickly the young man is gone

Christian policemen, shopkeepers, and teachers
Tell their friends of the quickening storm
While students on bicycles race through the streets
Searching for Jews to be warned
And Katlev the foreman blurts out to the trainman
""My family has no place to hide""
""Well bring 'em to my house,"" the stranger replies
""And we'll spit in the damn Nazi's eyes""

Ellen Nielsen the fishwife in the port of DragÃ¸r
Has no use for political views
She'll call out the catch, ""Fresh salmon, fresh cod""
Comes a whisper ""Please help, we are Jews""
""But if you are Jews you're not safe on the street
I know a man with a sail""
Till moonrise they sleep in the shade of her eaves
And escape on the fisherman's keel

Rabbi Melchior hires a young trawlerman
To ferry his family across
After twelve hours afloat in a scurfy old boat
Morning light shows the same Danish coast
Says the skipper ""I'm afraid of the German blockade
So we've motored in circles around""
The rabbi gives a shout, with one blow knocks him out
And steers a straight line 'cross the sound

Frozen with fright in the October night
Families huddle in basements and barns
Mistaking each breath for the angel of death
The Gestapo, the shot, the alarm
Then down into the hold with the stench and the cold
And drug all the babies with schnapps
Someone shouts, ""ValkÃ¶mmen till Sverige
You are in Swedish waters at last""

Seven thousands of Jews smuggled over to Sweden
By fishermen, nurses, and priests
Hitler sends Eichmann to hunt them down
But his quarry have vanished like mist
When the war's over the Jews return
Cheers and flowers adorn their way home
""We're not heroes or martyrs,"" so say the Danes
""We were just looking after our own""

Fred Small,"The echoes of childhood whisper violence
Cold wind beating out of the past
Rage in your throat, muffled silence
Hold on, I will stand fast

In the darkness your guardians had left you 
Cold wind
None to hear your cries, none to defend you 
Hold on

[Chorus]
I will stand fast, I will stand fast
You are safe in the daylight at last
Nightmare and fear, they have no power here
I will stand fast

I will listen to the terrors that tried you 
I will cradle the child that breathes inside you 

Though you take the shape of a hundred ancient horrors 
Though you strike at me and flee into your sorrow

Ice in the sun begins to splinter

Fred Small,"If I were a moose and you were a cow
Would you love me anyhow?
Would you introduce me to your folks
Would you tell your friends, ""No moose jokes!""
If I were a moose and you were a cow

Would you invite me to your club
And risk a cruel bovine snub
Would you lead me down the receiving line
And boldly boast, ""This moose is mine!""

Would your parents watch us graze
Shake their heads, ""It's just a phase""
Or would they thank the stars above
Their precious heifer's found her love?

Would your grandparents change their will?
They'd really expected a Holstein bull
""For this we toiled before the plow
You bring home someone who's not even a cow

""There's lots of proper stock around
Like that nice young Guernsey at Farmer Brown's
Or that last one we ridiculed and cursed

""But if you think this thing will last
Could he learn to moo and eat our grass
Shed his antlers in the dirt
Could you persuade him to convert?""

If our anatomies did not quite fit
Would you make the best of it
Would you nuzzle up so near
And hum sweet cow tunes in my ear?

Or would you sadly break it off
When all the hillside sneered and scoffed
""You know these moose are all the same
They're lazy, they're stupid, they come from Maine""

It's true things slip a moose's mind
That cows remember all the time
Bulbous nose and knobby knees
A coat that harbors ticks and fleas

But a moose can be a handy thing
When hungry wolves come visiting
In icy gust of winter storm
Our fur is deep and dry and warm

And someday should your milk run dry
And farmer stare with baleful eye
In dead of night I'd slip your noose
And lead you home to the land of moose
If I were a moose and you were a cow

If hunters came to do me harm
Would you hide me in the barn
Would all the herd come on the run
And glare until they dropped their guns?

Might you permit a goodnight kiss
Could you learn to love wet moose lips?

If you were a cow and I were a moose",If I Were a Moose,1988
Fred Small,"Call us America's sweethearts - we found a place in Roxbury
Where we can meet the mortgage, go to church on Sunday
I teach communion class and David leads the choir
Ten years together thinking about children

Lots of children out there beat up, beat down, hoping for a 
Home and a harbor, a hand that doesn't hit
Where the form said father and mother, we had to cross it out
Father and father, that's David and me

Twelve months of waiting, suddenly two little boys on our doorstep
Scared and crying, gave them a bath and tucked them in
Three-year-old Jamie, little brother Scott
Jamie had a bruise like a boot in the middle of his back

Refrain:
Love is love, no matter who, no matter where
Love is love, and a child knows when it's there
They can pry away the fingers that graced these walls with dirt
They can pull us apart, they can lie, oh they can hurt
But love leaves a trace and the heart holds a place for love's return

McDonalds and K-Mart - do you know how hard it is to find kids' shoes
Scott's first haircut, grinning and a little confused
Outside the aquarium baseball jackets red and blue
A picture is like time that's standing still

Jamie was a scrapper, he punched his brother, decked the kid next door
He threw a plate at David then ducked and cowered waiting for the blow
After supper I held him close, ""You're safe here, this is your home""
And the rains came to the parched and broken earth

But the papers smelled the headlines - gay parents, two little innocent boys
TV news on the front porch, politicians made a lot of noise
Liberal governor, he gave the order
Social worker phoned, ""Have them ready at three""

Picked Jamie up at daycare, kids were running shouting as they played
We didn't want to tell him, maybe the governor could have explained
Jamie was screaming when we strapped him in the welfare car
David said, ""We love you,"" and they were gone

You find out who your friends are, some came 'round some just let it go
Rallies on the common people singing people saying no
This is crazy - but Scott and Jamie 
Are still pinballs in a busted machine

The kitchen's clean and quiet, we changed the furniture around
Still keep Scott's rabbit - in the middle of the night sometimes I wake to the sound
Of a little one crying when there's nothing there at all
David holds me, says ""Go back to sleep""

Where the light throws a pattern of lace
You say you don't know if you are leaving
But there's no shadow of doubt upon your face
And you tell me there is no other
And I know you well enough to know it's true
And well enough to know you need a lover
Who can give what I never gave to you.

You can say that you were lonely
When I lay right by your side
You can say you saw the distance
When I looked you in the eye
And you can say I never reached you
No matter how many times I tried
But don't say I didn't love you
Cause that's a god damn lie

I emptied the drawer filled with letters
And I bowed my head and cried
No one ever loved me better
There was love in every line
But there were times I didn't hold you
When all you needed was a touch
And there were times when I said nothing
When one word would have been enough

And it seems sometimes like I lost my hand to a machine
In an accident a long time ago
It grabbed at my fingers and tore them off clean
Still I wait for these fingers to grow
And if I had fingers I'd touch your cheek
With a gesture so gentle and fine
I would braid your hair with baby's breath
I would take your hand in mine

You can say that you were lonely
When I lay right by your side
You can say you saw the distance
When I looked you in the eye
And you can say I never reached you
No matter how many times I tried
But don't say I didn't love you
Cause that's a god damn lie

I hear your voice in the morning
Singing softly to yourself
I know you imaging the loving
That awaits you with somebody else
And maybe I will find another
Who will take me in spite of these scars

And each of us yet may discover
How innocent we are

You can say that you were lonely
When I lay right by your side
You can say you saw the distance
When I looked you in the eye
And you can say I never reached you
No matter how many times I tried
But don't say I didn't love you

Fred Small,"When gravity's dragging you down
Look up

So you see yourself stalking the city
Staring straight down at your feet
You notice the scuff on your shoeshine
You avoid all the holes in the street
And you pity the drunk in the doorway
While you wave the panhandler away
And you take it as a sign of insincerity
When someone says ""Have a nice day""

But when gravity's dragging you down
When gravity's dragging you down
When gravity's dragging you down
Look up

Look up where the sun hits the skyline
Where the thunderheads warn of a squall
You don't need to believe in a miracle
It's a miracle to be here at all

Where the bus driver grins through his mustache
And an old woman's lost in her book
And a man is possessed of a paisley vest
That insists upon a  second look
And a little girl in a baseball uniform
Is leading her father who's blind
And a man who is muttering under his breath
Is having a very hard time

And when gravity's dragging you down
When gravity's dragging you down
When gravity's dragging you down
Look up

I have looked in the eyes of the damned and despised
Seen souls no different from mine
And what I perceive in this world I believe
Is no more than I'm looking to find

In the valley of clouds
In the span of the branches
Two eyes keep the watch
Where the hummingbird dances
And the snake hesitates
With the calm of command
The jaguar waits

The chain saw is whining the bulldozer roars
Monkeys are screeching in flight
The spires of the Arawak cut down at one blow
Where will the jaguar go
Where will the jaguar go

Under the hammer of hunger
On the anvil of fear

Stream to the frontier
With the promise of farmland
Honest work honest pay
Till the rains unrelenting
Sweep the topsoil away

The captains of cattle take the land cheap
New York and Osaka crave beef
Hooves crush the dirt into dust below
Where will the jaguar go
Where will the jaguar go

When the circle is broken
When the crystal is cracked
When the thread of creation is torn
We slip through the veil into terrors unknown
Where will the jaguar go

In the canyons of commerce
In convoys of light
The armies of loneliness
Drive into the night
Trading plastic for plastic
Making fashion of trash
We are dreaming of love
As love turns to ash
The fires of Prometheus flare to the sky
The seas of the prophets boil dry
This gutted globe was a garden I'm told

No hooded knights on horseback, no banners boldly raised.
Spray paint and bomb threats, a voice on the telephone line:
""Kill the niggers, kill the homos, Jew bitch die.""

Five-year-old Isaac woke screaming in the gloom.
""Mommy, there's a man at my window, looking into my room.""
""Son, there's nothing out there but the shadows branches make.""
The little boy went back to sleep, his parents lay awake.

For Isaac's bedroom window showed their faith for all to see
The candles of the menorah stood for hope and memory.
The next night, out of the darkness, a cinder block was hurled.
It shattered Isaac's window, and the boundaries of his world.

[Chorus]
One moment of conviction, one voice quiet and clear,
One act of compassion, it all begins here.
No safety now in silence, we've got to stand our ground.
No hate. No violence. Not in our town.

The cop was not unfriendly. He said, ""Ma'am, if I were you,
I'd take down that menorah, the Star of David, too.""
Isaac's mother Tammy said, ""I'm sure that's good advice.
But how then could I ever look my children in the eye?""

Then at their doorway a little girl did stand
A gift for her schoolmate in her outstretched hand.
A menorah drawn in crayon, from a Gentile to a Jew
It read, ""To Isaac, From Rebecca, I'm sorry this happened to you.""

Have you seen the paper? Did you hear the news?
What kind of people are we? We thought we knew.
Can children primed in prejudice in peace together dwell?

""This time the Jews will not face their foes alone.
We'll make paper menorahs, display them from our homes.
We'll show the bigots there are more of us than they have stones.""

Volunteers printed up menorahs by the score.
Children in their Sunday schools colored hundreds more.
Grocers and dry cleaners gave out the design, singing:
What's a little broken glass when freedom's on the line?

Now in the town of Billings live not 100 Jews,
But menorahs now were everywhere, on every avenue.
Thousands upon thousands, in windows rich and poor.
When a neighbor stands in danger, we will not close our door.

To see all the menorahs in the windows of the town.
""Are all those people Jewish?"" asked Isaac as they went.
""No,"" his mother answered, ""they are your friends.""

Told the truth about the gold I'd searched for in my head
Like my Dad I'd roamed the land and Mom could never understand
How Lucifer could bring a man to the Punkin Center Barn Dance

Fred Spoons,"Any old iron? Any old iron?
Any, any, any old iron?
You look neat. Talk about a treat!
You look so dapper from your napper to your feet.
Dressed in style, brand-new tile,
And your father's old green tie on.
But I wouldn't give you tuppence for your old watch and chain,
Old iron, old iron.""

Just a week or two ago my dear old Uncle Bill,
He went and kicked the bucket and he left me in his will.
So I went around the road to see my Auntie Jane.
She said, ""your Uncle Bill has left you a watch and chain.""
So I put it on right across my derby kell.
The sun was shining on it and it made me look a swell.
I went out, strolling round about.
A crowd of kiddies followed me and they began to shout,

I won't forget the day I went to London on the spree.
I saw the mayor of London there. That's who I went to see.
He came along in a carriage and a pair.
I shouted, ""come on, boys! All throw your hats up in the air.""
Just then the mayor, he began to smile,
Pointed to my face and said, ""Lor Lummy, what a dial!""
Started Lord-a-mayoring, and then to my dismay,
He pointed to my watch and chain and shouted to me, ""Hey,
Any old iron? ...""

I shan't forget the day I married Miss Elisa Brown.
The way the people laughed at me, it made me feel a clown.
I arrived in a carriage called a hack,
When I suddenly discovered I'd my trousers front to back.
So I walked down the aisle, dressed in style,
The vicar took a look at me and then began to smile.
The organ started playing. The bells began to ring.
The people started laughing and the choir began to sing,
""Any old iron? ...""

Fred Waring,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas,1996

You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on baby this laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Fred Wesley,"You think that I don't feel love,
What I feel for you is real love.
In other's eyes I see reflected a hurt, scorned, rejected.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, born  in poverty,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, take a look at me.
 
I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum.
My father left, he never even married Mom.
I shared the guilt my mama knew,
So afraid that others knew I had no name.
 
This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting.
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, by society,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, diff'rent from the rest.
Hold on, Whoa.
 
I started school in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out.
I knew the way it was to always live in doubt, 
To be without the simple things,
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me.
Don't think I don't need you,
Don't think I don't want to please you.
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'.
 
Love Child, never quite as good,
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, misunderstood.
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, never quite as good,
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, misunderstood.
(I'll always love you.)

They tested but questioned weapons rest in my foes
Blessed in my flows and obsessed with my scrolls
Midas Touch as it's told, writin nuttin less than gold

Send you out on a gerdy talkin 'bout yo' eternity
Can't stand it, search for your wind like Ban Enti
One man band on the MP and a nigga ran simply
Hi-Tek, all these other niggas can exempt me
Say he's the nicest out loud and gently
Have it your way, a freestyle mean no pay
If you sign a wack contract that mean.. (no weight)

Measurin blocks, releasin this live like Desert Fox
Hear spiritual, remain plentiful, same generals
Train criminals to get the most plus the minimals
Rob past, raw cash, facin the God last
Spot grabs, sure pop laugh, jump out of stock caps
For cop cash, watch taps, eyes on my top hat
Flop fast, stock crash, how when I drop math?
This rare rap, air vac', exit and fair fact
We share packs, stare back, cover our bear tracks
Ya peeps move, each choose, jump in our Jeep smooth
Unleash two and leak fumes, studyin Hebrew

Fred Westley,"One early morning, as I was walking
I met a woman, we started talking
I took her home, to get a few nips
But all I had was a mint julep

I don't remember just how I started
I only know that we should have parted
I stole a kiss, and then another
I didn't mean to take it further

One mint julep was the cause of it all
The lights were burning low, there in the parlor
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father
He said ""I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!""

I didn't know just what I was doing
I had to marry of face ruin

A mint julep, a mint julep
A mint julep, a mint julep
One mint julep was the cause of it all

Now, I don't want to bore you with my troubles
But from now on I?ll be thinking double
I'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey
I got six extra children from a-getting frisky

Knowing when to freeze and when to run
And regret is just a memory written on my brow
And there's nothing I can do about it now.

I've got a wild and a restless spirit
I held my price through every deal
I've seen the fire of a woman's scorned

Set to the rhythm of the wheel

Juicy and you see
I gotta have my bite, sir

No, sir
I'm gonna live and live now
Get what I want, I know how
All that the law will allow
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw that bell will go clang

One shot, one gun shot and bam

Freda Payne,"Folks I'm looking for a worker Ã¢?Â¦not you
I want an extra special kind
When I get the type of man I want
I know I'm gonna have a little time
Got to be ambitious, a man that loves to work
I don't want no man that's lazy, no man that tries to shirk
I want a two-fisted, double-jointed, rough and ready man
I want a hard working, no shirking, good and steady man

He can even drive a garbage wagon

Long as he's a two-fisted (oh please), double-jointed, rough and ready man
I want a hard working, no shirking, good and steady man

Now I don't have to have a fat man
And neither must he be too thin
And I sure don't want no guy
Got to get all pepped up on gin
And if he doesn't like soap and water
Don't let that worry you Ã¢?Â¦we'll get along
But honey I want a man like Joe Louis
You knowÃ¢?Â¦ a man that's big and strong
I want a two-fisted, double-jointed, rough and ready man
I want a hard working, no shirking, good and steady man

Now he can be knock-kneed, box-ankled
He can even have frog-eyes
But that won't make a bit of differenceÃ¢?Â¦ if he's OkÃ¢?Â¦ otherwise
 I want a two-fisted, double-jointed, rough and ready man
I want a hard working, no shirking, good and steady man

When he snores I want the force to blow the bedclothes to the floor
And the breezes from his wheezes to knock the padlock off the door
When I come home some morning all dressed up like Esther's horse
I want him to grab me and tear all of my clothes, just to let me know who's boss
I want a two-fisted, double-jointed, rough and ready man
I want a hard working, no shirking, good and steady man

I want a man who won't let his children play with neither dog nor cat

[Violent J]
Jump out of bed and I head for the grapenuts
Eat em quick or they soggy and that sucks
Trying to find a clean pair of socks and a shirt
Still sporting the same drawers even though they hurt
In the fridge, there's a Faygo, it tastes ill
'cause it's flatter then a bitch on a big wheel
I got a few money back and a little change
So I'm heading to the store when the phone rings
""What up man, check it out, I know this bitch
She's got another friend with her and her dad's rich
If we find us a ride out to Wyandotte
guaranteed, we can fuck em both on the spot""
Oh shit, let me call Bill Bill
I want to let my nuts through the windmill
He ain't home, fuck, I'll call Mike Clark
'cause I know he can get the fuckin Skylark
He said he can, but he's broke and it needs gas
But I want to buy these Faygo, think fast
I know my brother Jump Steady's got a few bones
But that's going through his shit when he ain't home
""Nevermind J, Legs loned me a ten
No need to get punched in your head again
Tell Mike to scoop me up right away
And it's Faygo and neden hoes all day""
Fuck yeah, I throw my Pro Winds on my feet
Lock the house, and wait for em in the street
I wish I had a piece of gum or something fuck
My mouth still kind of tastes grapenuts

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

Spin slow, drawn into strong voice of reason
Standing there in soul thinking of summer ?
Just longin' for another season

Just rocked another show, just can't remember where I am
And my families far from here, but the stars are bright this evening
On this morning on this afternoon, just got here now I'm leaving

When I fish the phonograph so we could set the record straight

How you helped through to your heart and all the times you fade away
I get to, say these words and speak my piece to Catholic Crowds
Not certain if it's Day or Night but I know the time is NOW
And if we ever lose the purpose as a prelude to the sound
Lets just call it a Day, and burn my empires to the ground...

You'll get chopped off by the needle as it spins over to my rhyme, yo.
Rap Music guys have a self-title: artist to life
Please think twice before you say your things in the microphone
I might not be, but I take it seriously
When you really listen to the words, an your not just hearing me...

[Chorus]
Day and night
Wrong or right
Spill our guts with every breath on the mike
And hope you call it tight
If it's blind give it sight
If it's Dark make it Light
Some call it Music
Deepspace calls it Life

Workin' it out (out), placin' my feet to concrete
Hittin' the street with vengeance, steangence, so sweet
What bitter we consider every circle we pass
Probl'why the reason that I reason with class, so step fast
We pushed and finally pushed that was burnin' staying determined
And yearnin' 'cause the lessons we learnin' were life long (life long)
Its my song, I place to erase
And transpose all these average Joes
With weak flows-
Who knows not, -
The true livin' roles who ascended, blended
With the beat, compete, and apprehended
Today's feelin' all right, color all right
 Being blocked by the shotgun and pray every day and night
Now I've gone a full day without some wackness heard
The One's speakin' absurd-
Are finally heeding my word.   (ya right)
And now I'm left with nothing else to say
That be the Night that I Called it A Day (Called it a Day)

I'm gonna throw thoughts to a page
Let 'em fall where they please
Let 'em rise to the sky, rain down, on four seas
An ocean of possibilities that dwellin'
Yellin' at the top of my lungs convicted by stone tablets as a felon
A nocturnal being of love since the grown of time
Watch the sunrise with both my daughter's eyes
Permanent Shine, refine my reflection inside
Livin' to die, dyin' to live, and all glory given back to God

It was the Night that 24 turned into 12
Had to adjust my spiral off, from the top of the shelf
On the blank page, using the utensil of potential
I'm diggin' in my Brain so I could Rip the Instrumental
With 20 bars left, and I'm consistent from the intro
Lighting candle sticks, as the rain hits my window
Need to focus in, take the topic and let it flow
Got 8 down for the count and 16 to go
The Writer's blocks are stepping stones
Towards the metronome
I'm racing dead last
I'm head last
Placed on my prose
Nocturnal with my journal, a wordplay professor
The aggressor, resembling soda cans under pressure
I'm shakin' but not stirred, deterrent from my train of think
Now I'm aligned, readjusted to infuse the ink
I want to handcuff the hands of time
No great spirit here allotted for here's the sunshine...

[Chorus]

Bet I'm casting nets and dreads
The deep blue ways are wet?????
God's Silhouette, I want to palettes painted pink by suns and sets
BURNT from a long days work, but feelin' fine
Tip his cap and path the moon on his back, his day declines
Candlelight Switch as you slip into the evening
A courtesy to the sun, as it dips below the ceiling
Feeling sort of satellite, like the wind beneath my wings
Or the tightrope, or gravity keeps lunar kites on orbit strings
Man on the moonlight, dream before my time
Like the moon reflects the sun, I make the black begin to shine
Like the moon rewinds the waters, makes the ocean recline
I collapse your mind; I'm Syntax, but melancholy kind
Redefine the best, framed fresh in terms of holiness
Bless the mike, device, 'cause I get nice to keep the conscious
And I split tense mint's spit words like sentence fragments
Moon dust the must 'cause I ain't' in it for the cabbage
The incandescent presence spins, as I'm your present flame
But my name would flicker out my name syntax the wax and wane
For the name above names, I'm so glad that Christ came
The black bird bright the night, we called it a Day...

Shadows step on the one, on, under every tongue, run
Spoken sentence frags., spoken on shattered breaks
It's a black hole soul with my faith as I take

Break Minutes back with father time to coordinate seconds
I surround the 11th hour with sound as my weapon

Villain threatened to sweat the syndrome of the wicked
Heading for your Auditory where the Listener would stick it

Fiction, we're steel, when it breaks from the construction
Crushing your framework and far surpassing your presumption

Sunrays, like a score with notes my surfacing
Great mad at meteors or record the all heed

And when the, Sun Sets
Some one lets the mike down
We pipe down, unplug it and leave it hide down
But not before we retire the pen
'cause yo tomorrow we'll be back just to do it again

Uh, shackled and scarred
I still maintain my praise of dark days
A sullen world covered in pain
So from Dusk 'till Dawn, I represent his word
Deepspace 5: set to serve
We travel in this land of the lost and we understand
We battle with the possible chance you take the cross
On your block, in your speakers Dudes is paid
We out for a change, in The Night We Called it a Day...",The Night We Called It a Day,2002
Freddie Bryant,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1999

Freddie Cannon,"Last night I took a walk after dark
A swingin' place called Palisades Park
To have some fun and see what I could see
That's where the girls are

I took a ride on a shoot the chute
That girl I sat beside was awful cute
And after while she was holdin' hands with me
My heart was flyin' up like a rocket ship
Down like a roller coaster
Back like a loop the loop
And around like a merry go round

We ate and ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rockin' band
And when I could, I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love
You'll never know how great a kiss can feel
When you stop at the top of a ferris wheel
When I fell in love down at Palisades Park

I found the truth some wise men never know

Some I wish I could forget
And I've burned a lot of bridges
But there's not one that I regret
'Cause every path I've taken
They all have led me to knowing my place
My place is with you

I've had my promises forsaken
Into many empty words
And I'm amazed and so astounded
That I won't get what I deserve
Whatever lies I've lived for
I have finally found the truth
I know my place, my place is with you

You are my treasure forever
The one dream I've searched for

I've not been given my tomorrow
I'm only certain of today
If I don't see another sunrise
I will not have to be afraid
I know we will be together

Soon as I flex, cause I'm about to rip up shop 

It's the return of the hip-hop master, Freddie the Foxxx 

(Bo!) Rappers that see me, don't even speak, just walk 

Cause I'm the maddest nigga in New York (hah!) 

I see a rapper in the crowd that I don't like 

I want to fight, so when I drop the mic 

I'ma jump off the stage, bumrush your crowd to whip 

(suckers) that want to be pimps 

How I heard it said that a pimp'll sell his ass 

if his hoe won't, but Freddie Foxxx don't 

Cover your chest G, you better wear a bulletproof vest see 

Cause I'm about to leave this place a motherfuckin mess 

Open hearts on the floor as I explore 

rappers that wanted to be more than number four 

Number one's a hard spot; either you fight 

or get shot, so this is what I got (BO!) 

Three Tec-9's, my uzi, ten grenades, my razor blades 

and I aim to get PAID! 

So who want to step to this, don't come soft 

Cause I'ma straight up knock niggaz off (POM! POM!) 

And when the cops come to get me 

I'ma take a dead body, and bop ten cops with me 

I'm sick and tired of hearin rappers talk smack 

about who's nice, and who's whack, MOTHERFUCK THAT 

They know my style, and my rep, every stage 

that I stepped on - I was the rapper they slept on 

But y'all rappers keep sleepin - cause when they plant 

bombs in your house, I'ma wake you up and punch you 

in your motherfuckin mouth, knock your wife out 

Take your sons to safety, cause they're just kids 

and I want to raise em to face me 

And when they get a little bigga 

I'ma MARK them little niggaz, and put their fingerprints 

on the trigger -- double homicide, call the vice 

Another rapper and his family with no life 

Yeah you're Mr. Tough and, you're full of stuff and 

and Freddie Foxxx caught you bluffin 

I got you in my torture chamber and you scream 

Oh God damn, it's like _Silence of the Lambs_ 

but I don't mangle em and eat em 

I take MC's to the war zone, and there I defeat em 

It gets much worse, with every verse 

as the F-are-E-D-D-I-E F-O-X-X-X, HURTS! 

Punishes, stomps, smashes, crushes, maims

I don't eat franks with the sauerkraut (cause) 

because I don't eat pork from the tail to the snout 

(well kick it) Get on down, to the hip hip hop 

Before I start, peace to Scott LaRock! (word) 

Now let me drop the style that has action 

Cause many MC's don't believe they're rappin 

They're lost, crazy mixed-up in their identity 

This is not, what hip-hop is meant to be (word up) 

I come unique, I can't be beat, hardcore street 

for the kids, with a hundred-and-fifty on their feet

The Juice Crew got stomped, lick two shot 

POM! POM! Really it was Magic's fault 

Always want to diss somebody, he got put to a halt 

It's wack, when a sucker DJ babbles on 

Soupin up MC's to battle on song 

That's wrong, but in any event, I drop the classic 

in 1992 the original it ain't plastic 

Everybody know, BDP, is fantastic, burn like acid 

Credit card plastic, stretch like elastic 

Love and respect is the TACTIC 

Bam! In your motherfuckin face

Mic check 1-2, strap it up, load the beat, cock the mic
And your rhyme better be fat, or you might have to fight
Yeah, there`s no escape from the terrordome
You know I`m nice when I`m bustin' fat rhymes on the metronome

MC`s never pass the mic to the Foxxx, cause
Once I bust a fat rhyme, you be a has-was
I beat you down on stage and when the battle`s over
You`ll be leaving your show in a hearse Nova

I`m flippin' the x`s three times and I`m back again
See, on my way down stage they had me strapped in
But once I hit New York and they losened the chains
I went and bought me a Tec, now I`m wild, insane

I`m on a hunt for a rapper who want to turn singer
I got my beat-em-down bat and a itchy finger
So if you`re nice with the mic and you want to flip
I`m the rap bounty hunter and it`s time to get yo ass whipped

Yeah, I`m comin' from the streets, pop
And please fight back, so you can get dropped
It`s time to see who`s nice and who can really rap
I smack the taste out your mouth, you want to be a mack

I`m not tryin' to shake the water and wake the gator

I heard your tape, then flipped the next side lookin for the def side
You couldn`t be alright if I erased your left side
Who`s wet dried when Treach tried, next died

I`m gonna slide your wet wide, so step side
Any dull raps get the skull caps pulled back full breeze
Blastin' your ass back at full speed
Hoes in flow, you know, bimbo

And won`t stop prayin' and playin' until I`m layin' up in fo`
Nowhere to run, nowhere to go
I got a solid hip below the belt to make your nuts not grow
Here`s to all crews that been wack

I got a thinkin cap with raps I attached with a chin strap
Flash past your girl who`s def in the flesh
Yes, you can`t believe that she said ""Treach""
The wicked-a-wicked-a-wully-bully

Bad and fully and surely bad
Ready and willy gettin' ???? glad
Dissed in hell and fell in fire

When my glock get hot you punk niggas better leave the block

Yeah, Freddie Foxx on a rampage
Every time I touch the mic the police is standin' front stage
'Cause I been labeled as a troublemaker
I send my baddest girl to your house to play the heart breaker

She`ll lay you down and put hickeys on your chest
Then turn around and blast you with a .33 shot Tec
You couldn`t rap, you was wack from the get-go
So you got bumped off by my head hoe

Called by the Militant Mack, my mentality is jail
Long as I`m strapped I can`t fail
Check this, I take the bass and I bust you in the eye with it
A piece of steel with a screen on top, I`m gettin fly with it

I`m bringin' suckers to the street again
'Cause them same broke-ass niggas ridin' on my meat again
Mr. Microphone flipped the beat again
Suckers got caught with the rhyme, felt the heat again

I`m breakin' it down, lettin' you know I`m never lettin' go
I beat your brother down, punk, just to let you know
This is hip-hop, gee, not `hit pop`
You mess around with the beats, get your boots knocked

I`ma slide, I`m in her when I see you suckers later

Sleepin with a limp eye

Well, to hell with you and your fat-o with the gurtle neck
So ol` golddigger, dig some dirt, there you have it
Want ring or a marriage, go get the carrot from a rabbit
Before I stab him for his lucky foot

Hit him with a puffy hook, hit the hare, now look how lucky looks
I`m not a chip on your shoulder, I`m a boulder on a path
Left a gash, you catch a headache in your ass
Class I`m disrespectin', I won`t see you trippin', clown

Shh - when I do, you be trippin', slippin' and fallin' down
All`s left to call cops
When I smack you with a leather wig and make you suckers suede bald spots
Chip-chop, flip the hip-hop, I chuckle

You couldn`t knock boots with a muthafuckin' knuckle
It`s on, what`s more, talk and get a boo-boo from your jaw

We goin' set it off like this
Check it out

On the one...

Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go

Yo, let me hear you say 
Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go, come on

I'm still hardcore gettin mines, like I told ya
I still keep a gun on my waistline, clip in a fat rhyme
Shoot you in the chest with the tec, in the head with the nine

You rappers can't swing the Freddie Foxxx style
Man, I make the softest nigga think he's buckwild
I never won a Grammy, never made a hit
But everytime a rapper get on stage with Freddie Foxxx, he get his ass whipped

I break em down daily
My voice so ill, I make Barry White sound like Philip Bailey
You rappers don't faze me with the rough talk 
Boy, you better back up and pack up 

Before I load the mack up
I swing with the mic, and zhigge-zhigge-zhig it right
And beat you rappers down that just can't speak it right
I been a ruffneck since I was a baby, ask my mama

When I got out, it was just for bringin niggas drama
So set up the beef, I bust it down
And guarantee the opposition never see the 2nd round
And by the end of the song, you're in a trap

""Freddie Foxxx, bust a rap!""

A lot of rappers try to front like they're rougher than they really are
But you're just a booty-ass nigga with a nice car
I bet the girls just like you cause they seen you on the video
You want to meet a real live nigga, here we go, hoe

First I teach you not to talk back, teach you to be loyal
Show her that my gangsta style's above royal
Teach her bout the murder game, so she'll never hate it
Then hit her with a .380 snub-nose nickel plated

See, ladies know the only thing that I like is my gun and my mic
A piece of ass, and a good fight
I'm still knockin' niggas out, ain't nothin' changed, gee
My bodyguards hold me back when there's beef

So understand the Militant Mack will never switch up
A lot of y'all talk behind my back, but in my face y'all bitch up
Yo baby boy, hold me down
While I go inside a sucker nigga's house and bust a couple of rounds

It's like the nigga in white that'll blast you in daylight
And stand there till the cops come and fight
And even if they lock me in jail, I be aight
I do a lotta push-up's, and kill a lotta mice in the night

But once they let me go 
You suckers better know 
I hit my stash
Then I'm comin for that ass

Yeah
Flippin' it on the one

We goin' set it off hardcore like this

I like to cruise through Brooklyn in my old Buick Regal
And right on my left my .45 Desert Eagle
Say what's up to my boys still rappin on the corner
They want me to hang, but I'm solo, I don't want to

Check it, I knock boots like a superstar 
Girls know who they are
My name ain't Bobby Brown 
Girl, I'm humpin' around

So you see Freddie Foxxx, girl, you want to get laid
My name ain't Aaron Hall, girl, you better be afraid
I jump inside your ass like I was Johnny Meat
And do the Sweet-Dick-Willie to a fat beat

I hump you gangster style, and turn you out 
Went through all the positions that the girls love to talk about
I have you strung out, hopin' that we blow up
Waitin' for me all day, but I never show up

Because the mic is my first love, it'd never leave
I stick a mic in a rapper's ass and make him bleed
I'm Mr. Nice Lyrical Style, Freddie Foxxx, did it
Stamina Daddy, freak the funk, girl, don't forget it

So next time you see me killin on the ave., baby
With a hoodie and a .45 mag, baby
Don't play me close, cause it's beef and I'm on a mission
I'm huntin' down the fox, so baby listen

Yeah, you know the flavor, baby
And before we slide
We goin' do it on the ill, know what I'm sayin'?
One for the road, and we gon' set it off like this

On the one
Check this out

Go Fox-o, go Fox-o go

Crooklyn Dodger number two back on the map
Perhaps you thought I was gone, well surprise nigga
Not physically, but I'm a massive figure

Al Pacino status, the baddest, exotic
Repetition like a automatic, can't stop it
High floatin', po satin' like coke snortin'
When I see a fetus, moms thought about abortin'

Important, am I? Gotta ask myself
But then I think twice like a Gemini
Authentic, percentage, calculating my mind state

Slice 'em up like an ox pop

Yeah, okay, it's time to bring these rap cats from Fantasy Isle
I bring it to these fake niggas with a quick and a smile
You know my style, America's most feared entertainer
Yeah, from New York to Cali, I'm called an acid Rainer

While you frontin' like ballin', son I stays in the mix
Same bullets in your burner since '76
Act like you can't tell, shit be live as hell
Bustin' so much shots
When my shells hit the ground it sound like ""Rock the Bells""

Call me Bumpy Knuckles 'cause my hands be swell
From knockin' niggas out from the lies they tell
Oh well, I bet you feel me all up in ya chest
I make the saucest nigga catch a body blame it on stress

And if he snitch, I bail him out and murder his bitch
And then sedate her with my four pound clap
Shit's only rap but I'm livin' like that
So when while niggas be talkin' dogs and walkin' like cats

Niggas mouths were gettin' way too fat
But O.C. and big Fred Oxxx, we bought to bring it back
""Let's go back""
""I'm tellin' it just like that""

We be money under ground but you can't get none
Cause if you step into my round, you be one dead son
We get love where niggas be scared to come
And we got a whole lot to give, but you don't want none

Any nigga play high post, I'm runnin' over
O.C. weigh tons like a fuckin' Range rover
(Tellin' niggas to they face that the fassad is over
Now it's time for this real nigga shit, can you feel this?)

No question, we manifestin', what we feel
Bust up in your session, smack niggas up like adolescence
(Like a D&D, I can't see a gang, no motherfuckin' body
Seein' me that's just pure fantasy)

True indeed son, we ain't the one
While niggas goin' out like that, we bring it on like Scarface
(That's means murder case, I bring highs to any base
Disrespect the profession)

Mean that real niggas on the mic, bringin' it back
It's mad potent, like good crack, it's type addicted
All up in ya mind, you don't want hard times

We be money under ground but you can't get none
Cause if you step into my round, you be one dead son
We get love where niggas be scared to come
And we got a whole lot to give, but you don't want none

Now that your trapped and your fuckin' with thugs
Let me tell your punk ass what I love
I love to see motherfuckers, that show no love
And start speakin' out like a bitch when you catch 'em in the club
I love, when a slug cat shut down
And then try to post up when they damn near cut his ass down
I love, trying to reach all parts of the map
On a Ninja, with a big Buddha bitch on a back
I love, cats that rap and still drip checks

It's when motherfuckers assume
That they ass can't get popped at 12 o'clock in the afternoon
I got the balls to come through your walls, like (Boom!)
Have an orgasm every time I clear the fuckin' room
(Niggas is gone) Nah, not just yet
I need to see you son of a bitches sweat
(I love) What I got, son, my shit is prop', son
With Prem' in the drivin' seat and Freddie Foxxx ridin' shotgun
(Stop son!) Here is the ultimate
Somethin' I love is when thugs be bumpin' my shit

It's real love for the mics that I bless no quest

I love beats that are hardcore, dirty and raw
I love takin' niggas burners when they scared to draw
I love plottin' on my enemies, I love to attack
I love beatin' niggas down when they rhymes is whack
I love seeing emcees struggle to make
Themselves something that us real niggas love to hate
It's too late, I love my Ninas and I love my ""fours""
Blowin' holes through the project doors in ""knive wars"", nigga
I love the feeling, and the rush that I get
From ""Sam"" run the Rolex watch with the diamond begets
I love, how my life was intact without a deal
How I kept the newest chromes on my automobile
I love the fact that rappers make the dough, without a flow
Soft niggas, that I stain, like piss in the snow
I love the fact that I survived through the roughest of times
And break the mic when I want, with the roughest of rhymes
It's a luxury to see me emcee
It's so hard, this lyrical brutality, feed's a nigga's mentality
I love, when you niggas claim to be great
Knowin' your mob ain't never lettin shit, what the fuck is this?
Niggas bustin' shots on New York, I get my vest on
Twenty rhyme clips in my mic, I get my bless on
Loan soldier standin' on the front line, I fear none
Excuses that you give me for your lyrics, I hear none
You niggs ain't no real emcee's
You Sam Goody ass niggas can't write without suckin' down trees
So I love, laughin' at you niggas, while you clappin' at me
I split your head shot from your man, while he's slappin' at me
I feel the hits from your rounds
Your hollow points make a nigga wobble, but I won't fall down

Yeah, you motherfuckers see it, come on!

""It's the real... it's the (militia)""

If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'ma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin up, just straight shuttin up
or we'll start the wettin up

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot
Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop

You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect  you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel

I'm like a pit, with a leg in his mouth, I bring it home

I make you sit your ho ass down, turn off your microphone
'Cause after me its un-rippable
I slap you in your mouth, your drinks'll be unsippable
I got miles of styles, you must be out your motherfuckin' brain
To think I'm not the nicest in the game
Disconnected from your mainframe, punched cocked
Twirl your nose up Murray the cop, to the beat down you don't stop
When Fox and Bumpy keep it hot
End the whole beef with just one shot, niggaz I fear not
This piece of steel with the screen on top
Projects uncut chyna white dope
Leave a freeze in a nigga throat
I fight for this like the right to vote
The poison I spit, they'll never be an anecdote
You niggaz thought I put my mic down
'Cause the industry's scared cause I put my fight down
Before I do that, I sell it out the trunk and make a mill
Now that's a real rap nigga deal
In 99 I'm droppin' niggaz like flies
Fuck flowin', I'm turning niggaz into Jesse Owens
Cock the four pound, keep it going, I'm in your dresser room layin'
You bitch ass niggaz just start prayin' baby

Rhymin' is a part of my life
I'ma die with rhymin kids and a rhymin' wife
I don't let nobody judge me that don't know how to do what I do
So if you don't like it then fuck you!

I watch niggaz get hyped up with one single and get gassed
Then fall like a bad pass
Niggaz run outta New York, to live in other places
Hopin' somebody remember old rap faces
Fuck that, I'ma five borough thorough MC
Where I go, New York goes, keepin' New York flows
Niggaz be switchin' cause they not sure
Your style is played out soft shit like valure
In red and black living rooms when the system booms
He's a nice little diss to whomever whom
Come against me and I give you one of three picks:
Get shot, get stuck up, get your ass kicked
Bring your whole unit, and I be lyrically gunning em
Cause Freddie Foxxx be the illest thing since Run and em
I be running through you like a Hummer, you don't want none o'
So hot I turn December 25 into summer
I scrutinize niggaz and bring em down to size
My lyrical body slam will leave you paralyzed
Fuck what you memorize, I take you out of drive
And leave you neutralized and black in both your eyes
My rise is your demise, shut down your enterprise
Fox and Primo, we stay close like thighs
Bumpy got nine lives, like a cat
With a full gat, keep it underground fuck that!

For every verse I ever spit, for every mic I ever rip
I still got a full clip of unstoppable shit
You mean to tell me motherfuckers never knew
That I be bustin' niggaz in the head with beer bottles like Guru
Check the mic one, two make sure its on
When I bring it to your headquarters, word is bond
Heads up, eyes and ears open
I got you hopin'
That you could catch rec like me
You got a better chance at kickin down a tree
With no legs, doing a handstand on two eggs
Motherfucker, I got lyrical instinct, fuck what you write
I'm The Source like magazine, on the cover with the Ruger 16
I ain't scared to diss a MC, but ask him if he scared to diss me
I bet he won't disagree, he'll probably start sayin' his throat
Hurt, his mom's is sick with a bad knee
Or start screamin he's about dough
He's just a faggot with a whack flow
Don't walk up on me talkin freestyles and off the top of the dome
I beat you down and send your ass home
I'm on my own time, I write my own rhymes
You want to be the nominee? you brave now?
I carve my rhyme in your back and bury you face down
Just remember nigga: 
I'm Freddie the Foxxx I break his back and buck 'em buck 'em down

I remember talkin to Big Poppa; he said ""Foxxx, you the illest,""
(uhh) I make the realest nigga feel it
Got a little mob of niggaz I send to rob niggaz
Take all that fly jewelry, and give it to my moms
I keep the industry up in arms like Zack La Roche
Cause they hate to see me comin, with this too black approach
Through the hardest time in hip-hop, I stayed afloat
So let me give the media some fly shit to quote
I'ma always be a nigga, lookin through your eyes
So nothin that you do to me should come as no surprise
I continue bein raw dog, puttin in work
I drown a bitch and get away, like my name was Captain Kirk
Motherfuckers wanna hear it raw, Bumpy make it hurt
Step on stage, rip the whole shit down and merc'

For the DJ's, the rappers, the writers, the breakers
The movers, the shakers, the beat, the makers
What's stronger than hip-hop niggaz they can't take us
If we deal with the real, and shut down the fakers

What fucked you up is that I'm so nice and don't rehearse
On any record I'm the king of the third verse
It's +Strictly Business+, if it's +Personal+ I let you know
I hold your heart until the Lord tell me let you go
Don't need advice from no corny ass A&R that never filled a milk crate
With breakbeats, I keep it raw nigga straight street
To my comrades in L.A, L.A., L.A.
I still got the bulletproof - Pelle, Pelle, Pelle
Keep the music underground as I reiterate twice
Tell niggaz to they face, I thought you wasn't nice
Kick my ass? Nah, not likely; out mic me?
Not likely, stay on the sidelines like Spike Lee
Niggas know Bumpy like to flow all out
Microphone, gun in hands nigga, go all out
No exceptions to females I ride 'em giddyup
How bad I wanna fuck Brat, since she pushed them titties up
It's the underground sound that designs the street
Freddie Foxxx designed the rhyme, Premier designed the beat

For the DJ's, the rappers, the writers, the breakers
The movers, the shakers, the beat, the makers
What's stronger than hip-hop niggaz they can't take us
If we deal with the real, and shut down the fakers

Freddie Foxxx,"As a child I felt lonely and helpless
Low cash from a neighborhood wealthless
I'll stick a wino, and rob him for his last penny
Happy days around my way we didn't find many
Momma said that I was outta line talkin smack
Extension cords to this young nigga's black back
A juvenile, thirteen, now I'm locked up
Scared to cry, I don't wanna get fucked up
Fifty push ups a strain on my young chest
I paint the pictures that I pose for a sleeveless
I see my momma only supervised when she cry
She said my baby brother's comin he aint far behind
Somebody tell me how I ended up like this
I wait for God to give me strength, I'ma fight this
I refuse to bend down cuz I'm young and wild
Do or die that's this young nigga's rough style
They'll never find me

Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
My soul will be free before they find me

I hit the street full grown, momma's gone now
Had a heart attack I'm living on my own now
My black boots and my state green all I own
And a burning desire for a microphone
I see my little man Tiah bless me wit a burner
Any coincidence I'm feeling like Nat Turner
Twenty stick ups in thirty days they see me comin
Everybody on the block duck and start runnin
A old lady told me baby boy calm down
But like in Vietnam war I got to bomb now
My cash was up a little somethin, somethin, takin shake
I blasted reddie at the weedgate and took his papes
Cuz I done came a long way, in a short time
And I'm willing to die tryin to get mine
Alotta niggas think I'm cool wit 'em, guess what
Them niggas in for a shock cuz I'm fucked up
You'll never find me

Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
My soul will be free before they find me

I got a little crew now I'm selling weight
White mickeyed out Navigator, tight straight
I got the butter soft seats watch a video
Stag a lee, everybody in the city knows
I make my rounds and I'm checkin how my work's moving
Shit is picking up nice, life is improving
I got the baddest bird in Brooklyn, she six months
She keep a eye on my whole house, my youngsters
I got my honey on the side she don't know about
I'm on my way to see her now, I'm a blow her out
I pull up to see her standing in the door waiting
Shorty fine like a porn star masturbating
She said, ""Daddy are you hungry, would you like to eat
Would you let me rub your back, can I kiss your feet""
I told her, ""Baby make the bed cuz I need rest""
She sucked me down until I fell asleep, God bless
I see my momma with my eyes closed, kinda strange
Time to wake up and touch something, outta range
White clouds with the softness I hear the music
What the hell is going on here I'm 'bout to lose it
Momma why you talking to me like you right here
She said, ""Son you outta focus now, come clear""
She said, ""Your life'll be a milestone for everyone
Because your layin in the bed that you made son""
Look how they found me

Freddie Foxxx,"Somebody tell them motherfuckers I'm here!

[Verse 1]
Emcees and rappers, what's up, I hope it's good
For them street niggas breakin them bricks, in the hood
I write, maybe sheddin some light
My experience in hip hop, was struggle and fight
All I ever wanted, was a chance to rock the mic, like you do
Control every crowd in the world, like voodoo
The underground hardcore scene, it's my flaw
I snatch alotta money from that, so once more
I step, where the niggas that rep, get checks
You touch mine, here go my check
It's back to underground clubs, with fights at the door
Niggas gettin one deal in six months they poor
I separate emcees from rappers, standin on stage with two clappers
Cock back, beef at my house, I stop that
I dare any nigga standin in here with half a heart
To address me, I rip you apart, Tell 'em I'm Here!

CHORUS:
Tell 'em the one that blasts first every time it's on
Tell 'em, I put the word back in word is bond
Tell 'em, I stomp rappers to the beat, shut 'em down with no fear
Somebody tell them motherfuckers I'm here!

[Verse 2]
Who got the ill rep, lyrical style like Bumpy Knucks
Outta respect none of you bitch ass niggas your shit sucks
I'm the emperor, you niggas is hoes with gold plaques
Lotta stick ups in town, Freddie Foxxx is back
Bumpy Knuckles I, take out your heart with one look
Frying niggas like ""Yang Kang Cook"" you're all shook
Spittin hella hot lyrics, that infiltrate tracks
Like spirit, real niggas wild when they hear it
My heart bleeds raw hip hop, I got no gauze
Sometimes the beats kicks so hard, I cock them fours
And I can feel it, all up in my veins, keep it noted
I'm the long term maintain, Tell 'em I'm Here!

CHORUS

[Verse 3]
I do it special for them thug niggas holdin the block
They need a nigga on wax that can follow
To give 'em that real shit to swallow
I don't respect a man under no man
You frontin like you holdin all the cards up in your hand
When emcees come in, emcees go
I'm one of the few emcees left, with emcee flow
So while I spit repetitious like techs
Make your bitch say my style is delicious like sex
Undetectable rhyme, it's complex
Check the three X's that I earned from
Bustin my sigs from New York to Texas
Makin niggas take L's like Lexus, tattoed vibes I protect this
Find a mic mechanic, cuz I'm bout to wreck this
Villainous, I'm laughin while I'm killin this
Never break a sweat because my groove be the chillinest
Thug niggas throw your hands up if you feelin this, Tell 'em I'm Here!

CHORUS",Tell 'Em I'm Here,2000
Freddie Foxxx,"""Money in the bank yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled but then you rolled and rocked"" 
""Money in the bank yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled but then you rolled and rocked"" 
 
Listen 
You get upset when you hear the Large Professor 
On your girl's cassette deck expect 
Nothin comin soft 'cause I'll never throw weaker blows 
I'll kick you in your [ass] and your breath'll smell like sneaker soles 
Now how's that for a fixin'? 
You'd better rather go to Roy's, cause I ain't kickin' science fiction 
I kick a size nine sneaker or boot 
Chop chumps to stumps, and they remain minute 
The Sheik, I get deep, and always leave with the wet meat 
Because of my technique, I'm the one you let speak 
I collect crops and props like spinach 
I'm vintage, your single sums up to a ten inch 
My soul brother Van Paul and Pete Rock 
Keep the funk flowin' until the last beat stops 
The soul man, can't have you leavin' on a stretcher 
Probably, have you leavin in leather, I catch a body 
From wreckin' slum rappers, but to be frank 
I don't give a [fuck] I got money in the bank 

""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked"" 
""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked"" 
""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked"" 
 
This is the stage of Triple-X 
When you're sittin' by your radio, screamin', ""Freddie Foxxx goes next"" 
Those beholdin' the words of a master 
Find mental disaster, as I kick it faster 
Whoever opposes me, and what I feel 
Might find their legs bein' replaced by steel 
This is a brand new year, and the penalty is death 
So there won't be a lot of suckers left 
I grab the mic, and I load it like a long four-fifth 
Huh, and dare you to riff 
Or even sneeze as I blow you to your knees, have you curled up 
In a corner like a dog, with hoof in mouth disease 
Spittin' razor blades, cuttin' veins you can't stitch 
I got you screamin like a [bitch] 
I took your microphone, you can't get it back 
Because your rap was wack 
I'm comin' fifty strong in an armored tank 
And takin' money to the bank 

""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked"" 
""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked"" 
""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled, but then you ro.. rolled.."" 
 
Cool G. Rap for your first selection, get up on it 
To my opponents, let me just demonstrate for a minute 
Crooks gettin' hooked, to my book, just like an addiction 
Stop your diction you drop, the science fiction 
Let's get specific you can't get with it 
I'm too terrific and scientific, forget it 
Don't even try to limp it, you're not ready to make hits 
You still got a learner's permit 
Poppin' that [shit], you better sit 
Here's a word, of a third degree burn, so listen and learn 
You're missin' a turn, so you better get, concerned 
My challenger, check the calendar 
I'm as live as a .45 caliber, Colt 
With a silencer, wettin' up, suckers I be settin' up 
Button up, while I'm cuttin' up, never lettin' up 
I don't link up, with suckers with raps that shrank 
Thanks sonny, I'm takin' money to the bank 

""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked"" 
""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked"" 
""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked"" 
 
One in the chamber, eight in the clip 
Pull out a razor, watch your rhyme book rip 
It's Ant Live, liver and deliveries get liver 
With G. Rap, and we're the sole survivors 
MC's want to try me, but can't escape, my clutch 
Too much, caught in the ropes, like double dutch 
You want to run up, you better run up light 
Cause like a whorehouse shippin' out [pussy] tonight 
Believe me I ain't goin' out like a brick parachute 
Or a fruit, or a guy that wears Brut 
Cologne, I'm violent prone, so leave me alone 
I'm about to set fire to the microphone 
And leave the mic so hot you need potholders for this 
Due to burnt wires it's cordless 
(Yo Ant Live make suckers walk off the plank) 
Not now, I'm takin' money to the bank 

""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 

""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Money in the bank, yeahhhh""

Freddie Foxxx,"You got real street niggas that ride on your side
They know the code, it's either do it or die
I got real street niggas that ride on my side, what
They know the code, either do it or die
You got rich street niggas that ride on your side
They know the code, it's either do it or die

So what the world gon' tell us
Me and mine too strong and rebellious, the petties stay jealous
Find me in the dusty cellars, writing
To feed the 5,000 fellas, hustlers and street dwellers

Heather be devoted, quote it
I feed the desperate and demoted
Want passion? I'm loaded the truth, I uphold it
Wisdom, I tote it
Bet that outdoes me, Heather be self promoted

I know thieves, thugs and crooks
We be ridin' and I don't care how it look
You better take it easy 'fore you get that took
Yo my mans and them be off the hook, PA

My peoples be's behind me so I fears nobody
Foxxx push the Navie, while I'm ridin' shotty
The last nigga that tried me, what, he came apart
He dropped mine and they took his heart so don't start

You got real street niggas that ride on your side, what
They know the code, either do it or die
I got real street niggas that ride on my side
They know the code, it's either do it or die

Who got real street niggas that ride on they side, huh
They know the code, it's either do it or die
You got real street niggas that ride on your side, huh
They know the code, either do it or die

My walk through life is iller than most niggas that carry toast
I'm ya emcee, lyrical host
Stretch a nigga if he stand too close
My niggas know who the boss is
The 240 pound bald-headed killer that don't know what a loss is

We like black Yukons and Navigators
Real street agrivators and we'll kill you in a suit and gators
Don't get it fucked up, niggas'll run you like plays
And cut you like 'Back in the days'

I got real street niggas that ride, right or wrong
They always on my side, so bring it on
Take ya picture, then we come and get'cha, ya little bitcha
We bust ya with them four pound shells

That split'cha when they hit'cha
My unpredictable style of emceein'
Kinda reflects the unpredictable zone a nigga be in
My niggas seein' what I'm seein'
Bustin' out the back window when we fleein'

We heard your radio record, you bitch nigga
Now we sittin' back waitin' to rob this fake rich nigga
Biters and snitch niggas, get put in PC like lyrical police
Stay the fuck away from me
I'd rather bounce to Jerse' and rock with Heather be
Then fuck with fake ass niggas that ain't like me

You got real street niggas that ride on your side, huh
They know the code, either do it or die
You got real street niggas that ride on your side baby
They know the code, it's either do it or die

We got real street niggas that ride on our side, huh
They know the code, it's either do it or die
We got real street niggas that ride on our side, huh
They know the code, it's either do it or die, what

yo, now its time
I want everybody to listen
Come on
Cause when I get on the mic and do my thing
You need to listen
Reach out and feel this
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Rockin is a state of mind for niggaz who really do it
Leavin suckaz behind and can't move through it
You cut a throat to do better than niggaz doing better
But you can't cut the neck of the second letter
you MP knucks rappers get swung like trucks
Niggaz swearing that he nice when he really suck
And yo ruck why do rappers say they thugs and gangstas
When they halloween dress up nigga panty hose
Acting like he hard with them new edition candy girl flow
I'm funky like george sir knows
I'm real like tax time you try to escape
I clamp down on your real estate and your fake estate
That means everything rented borrowed stolen
And anything you might be holdin
I Come like ?? it us
Under pressure buss it
Philly soul reaching
Bumpy heart touching
Jazzy like jeff nigga I'm not a giraffe
I'm bumpy abdu jamal I clap you fast
And be dead centre chest like the gold medallion
That hangs around a neck on a old italian

[Chorus]
Scram kid your new to me you bother (that's right its bumpy knuckles)
Cause I know you niggaz really ain't thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you really not
I'll write your eulogy you bother me(that's right)
It'll be no help from family or friends
nobody can really help you now

[Verse 2]
Here I am the real emcee
Writing off sucka emcees like I'm dmc
Little killers in the bm 3
Follow one be in the black 600 with the one true v
I'm in V12 but wherever I dwell
They bust for me in heaven they bust for me from hell
Cause I'm still hot any rapper I fear not
I give it to you raw like my pops was gil scott
Mama was jill scott
Humming melodies
My head on her chest feeling the bass in her breast
Time nor space exists for the man
That knows the eternal
Don't make me return you
You can pull it out
Wave it no doubt
But before you bust it off
here's one to think about
Come to bumpy get your heart tested
If you pass you'll be passing out
I'm blasting in and I'm blasting out

[Chorus]
Scram kid your new to me you bother me (that's right)
Cause I know why'all niggaz really ain't thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you're not (your not)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends
nobody can really help you now (come on)

[Verse 3]
I'm more convinced now than on a part on my life
That I'm a die with rhyming kids and a rhyming wife
I'm a body every nigga that ever did me trife
That's word to great grand grandma indian and her carving knife
I'm power in its finest hour ask queen latifah
Whose the hardest rap gansgta that she'll ever speak ta
You better check my record
Matter fact check my album industry shook down
Niggaz is shook down
Its time for revolution
Cause I see booty its wax prostitution
'I'm the chairmen of busting niggaz with chairs
Cracking niggaz heads open with heineken beers
Most people see my shadow black and wide
But can't see my heart black with pride
Cause you got a devil inside
Plotting for the spot where the late great biggie reside
I be a father like big chuck
Raising my son and keep the enemy close
And bust their gun
I step to a few niggaz and made em all one
With a 16 shot beretta that I call fun
Music must reflect the time time reflect the music
The shorty come correct if you next to use it
From lil bow wow to lil zane
I told lista kane brother little daddy shane
I always spit a nigga name
And hope to god he answer then I get all in his body
Like a nasty cancer
I take honour and take pride in the mic and I fight for it
Like it was a civil rights baby

[Chorus 2x]
Scram kid your new to me you bother (bumpy knuckles)
Cause I know why'all niggaz really ain't thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you really not (not baby)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends nobody can really help you now

Scram kid your new to me you bother
Cause I know you niggaz really ain't thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you really not (your not)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends nobody can really help you now

I don't waste none the air baby ""Lazy!!!""

[Chorus] (2x)
Everybody you know, everybody we know (Come on, that's right)
want to spit a rhyme on a beat by the Primo ""Lazy!!!""
But everybody I know and everybody you know
Know that's one thing not everybody can do though ""Lazy!!!""


[Verse 2]
Bump bringin' you another selection FROM MY MAIN MAN PRIMO
To the heart forever plural
For blessin' hip hop with the one nigga PRODUCERS CAN'T SEE THOUGH
To the end should by our girl
If it takes me a lifetime to prove I'm THE NICEST MC
Then I'm down for every war
And if it ever get bigger than rap THEN I GET MY SHIT be	
Come on down, I'm holdin' fours
I hate to be pain in the ass CAUSE IT REALLY AIN'T LIKE ME
But I couldn't help but notice
You come into this game with a mask AND SNEAK AROUND LIKE WIFEY
And get popped like shooky sodas
Rap voters get Al Gored, which means low scores
On all the music awards
It's all good though, niggaz from the street DON'T SWEAT NO TROPHY
Cause it don't make you hot
Aiyyo Roy I'm the heavyweight champ of hip hop WALK LIGHTLY
Some of y'all must've forgot
Means nothing to me if another nigga got a Knuckle CAN TRUST ME
And I swear that forever
Cause I ever take a ass-whipping dude YOU WOULD HAVE TO BUST ME
Pretty much I'm sayin'; Whatever
See I punish MC's that come in with big dough
Cause I know they gonna pay they way right too slow
These Hollywood niggaz from the hood better know
I'm so ever soul forever flow
Always quick to they spine I'm never slow
I'm probably something you don't want to do, let it go
Basketball players, boxers, wrestlers
Don't take it personal cause I'll get the best of ya
Ask these sorry-ass RAPPERS
They know I'm so CRAZY

[Chorus]",Lazy!!!,2003

Yea, mami jus like that bend down grab ya ankles, do it for crack
Damn should be illegal how that ass so fat
The way you shake yo shit make me wanna cop back
Is it ya motion causing all this commotion?
Forget niggaz you even got bitches approaching
Who am I? I'm just a kid from the Bronx
If you love hip-hop you might of heard my shit once
Or maybe twice or like thirteen thousand times
I'm sick of it myself I'm loving the shine
Who else could it be but the squad's O.G?
Be laid up Wit chicks that resemble ?
Half black, Japanese n something
Menages, orgies believe me its nothing
The girls want tha facts got to feed 'em the lies
Who else can have you swimming in wealth the blink of an eye?

Big trucks, gee rides, we fly, twenty-fo' won't you sit in them tires
Believe me its nothing

Believe me its nothing
Big trucks mean rides we fly t-squad our time
Believe me is nothing

Drop from Harlem even, more for Brooklyn
Still got my Name covering the walls in central Brooklyn
Haters want me, they love to slut me
Mad because my fat ass stay - living comfy

Jack-of-all-trades we do that too
The only rapper get the Suge Knight effect when he come through
When pun died, half of y'all cried
The other half wanna See my demise
It was inevitable the sqaud'll reach new heights it's unforgettable
Follow the don is all we kept telling you
Once you down with the squad you can never give up
No need to get ya jewel's back, let them other crews do that
It's so ironic that I'm under fire I'm like 'mine'll get better one time' you dick blowers

No ya, not dreaming, it's not a visage
It's just another platinum plaque to add to my garage

What the hell in the world did they do to provoke this?

Don't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late

Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms

Here am I, begging for only five minutes more
Only five minutes more of your charms

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,1958
Freddie Gambrell,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1958
Freddie Gibbs,"Aonde estiver, espero que esteja feliz
Encontre o seu caminho
Guarde o que foi bom e jogue fora o que restou

Tem horas que não dá pra esconder no olhar
Como as coisas mudam e ficam pra trás
O que era bom hoje não faz mais sentido, é
Uma hora isso ia acontecer
A vida cobra e a gente tem que crescer
Me pergunto se você pensa em mim
Como eu penso em você

Aonde estiver, espero que esteja feliz
Encontre o seu caminho
Guarde o que foi bom (foi bom) e jogue fora o que restou

Pois acredito nos meus sonhos
Eu acredito na minha vida
E no meio dessa guerra nenhum de nós pode ganhar

Sonhar e não desistir, cair e ficar de pé
Dar valor depois que passou é duvidar da sua fé
Eu vejo a vida, tem vários caminhos
E entre eles o destino improvisa
Nos pequenos detalhes da vida
A resposta está escondida

And I'll be rolling, rolling
Baby get me dope
And I did all wrong, although your heart was gold
Now I may be numb and lonely and heartbroke
Facing that before this heart starts smoke
If you wanted I should, could, would get it
Maybe I should a couple miles, just a little bit
But I was thinking about the present, I was way too selfish
Trying hard not to call you, I just can't help it
Girl you changed me, know this ain't a praise
But it's kind hard to speak without my faith
If you left, leave me I'll act I was all brave
I want you in my life, no one can please me
Rush in to the phone when I hear your ringtone
Hear you when I think, like you push your things on
I'll wrap, but you make me want get my sing on
Gotta sit back and wonder how you get the jeans on, shut

Memórias e lembranças, certezas e duvidas
Nada parece mudar
E apesar de tudo, enquanto o tempo passa
Ainda espero sua resposta

Aonde estiver, espero que esteja feliz
Encontre o seu caminho
Guarde o que foi bom (foi bom) e jogue fora o que restou
Aonde estiver, espero que esteja feliz
Encontre seu caminho
Guarde o que foi realmente bom (foi realmente bom)
E jogue fora o que restou

Pois acredito nos meus sonhos
Eu acredito na minha vida
E no meio dessa guerra
Nenhum de nós pode ganhar",Onde Estiver,2006

Convertible and a bunch of chicks

And pacific coasts

And clean the rack

Beneath the streets of Gary
Would I make it out, I wonder
Could my obituary be the next they read amongst the
Niggas I came up with and fell victim to this dope game
Poverty stricken so our economy is cocaine
Ecstacy, heroin, marijuana ain't no hope man
Absentee fathers and dope fiend mamas

Hate from the hood, everyday I would fight

She would pray through the night

Cause its just another day in my life

You go through, we got your back 'til the end
When I came upon a deal, niggas that I never knew
I could blew, wanna come be my friends
Then the boy got dropped and the friendship stopped
In a flash I was back on my own
Put a strap on my lap and the stash in the back
Cause the fact I was wrappin them stones
Got back to the rap cause its all that
I got in the mid west streets be my voice
I dont think another dude could do what I do
So it seem like I ain't got no choice

Hennesey and Red Bull in my cup
OG Kush wrapped up in the wood
And I still smoke good in a '83 Cut
Still smoke kill in an old Deville
I keep the leather on my back, wood on the wheel
If a nigga don't blow smoke on chrome
Then I really don't feel how I'm supposed to feel
Because I feel like blowin' blunts back to back
With no shame, keep a pack and a sack to wrap(?)
At 13 I was taking Swisher Sweets to the dome
With my nigga lil rone you can ask him that
My homeboy Kendell roll thin ass blunts
So we can smoke at least 20 every day of the month
And keep at least 5 pounds of the hay in the trunk
And when he came from the Chi we was weighin' it up like
Uh
I got 16 zones of death and you can hit it at your own risk
When I travel I ain't lookin' for the local weed man
I be gone on the zone on my own shit
Got a stick or a seed in ya muhfuckin' weed
Then I guarantee you blowin' on the wrong shit
And they wonder how the kid stay blowed, eyes halfway closed
You ain't on what I'm on bitch
I'm lifted
Me and my girl just blew six blunts up in a blue 650
Charleston blue kush and blue Ken Griffey
She love the thug shit so boo get wit me

Last night I blew a whole zip with the crew
We was rollin' with hoes lapped up in the truck
Keep a gold pack of the Trojans
I let a nigga rap to a bitch while I'm wrappin' it up
My thang off in yo main dame
I come straight through and get straight brain
She blow straight kill and make straight change
To make sure my pockets stay straight man
Cuz this pimp shit is in my veins, it's in my blood
I was born with it and I'mma die smokin' this fire bud
In my old school with my chrome spinnin' like
Uh
And my niggas in the bay got the kush for the 27 hundo
I'mma get 'em and sell 'em for 55, you get it for 48
If you wanna get more than one though

Hit a lick, the whip reported stolen
Tell me who out here got my back

I couldn't put food in my budget, I was bustin my ass
To make a choice to either eat or have money for gas
Enough to make you break morals for the love of this cash
The devil work and he stay immersed in my idle time
When there ain't shit twerkin, niggas get murked in this life of mine
And I took some hits on some niggas, never knew what they did
Never considered they momma, they family or they kid
Loaded up my sig, got a pint of gin and I took a swig
Bout to go knock his ass off the map cuz I'm on my dick

I'm a made nigga, bitch Ima make it at all costs
If you niggas seen what I saw, you'd roll with a sawed off
Heard he utter words of my murder, but it was all talk
The killers I know don't get caught, but I bet they all walk
I'm a made nigga, bitch Ima make it at all costs
If you niggas seen what I saw, you'd roll with a sawed off
Few of these niggas be testin me, but they resume all false
This thuggin gon' be the death of me, lord we all lost

Ride with me today, I'm in a mood to go spend some spinach

Funny how we straight from section 8, now we chill in resorts

Brought some bitches with us, but fuck these Puerto Ricans instead
Do this for my people, hopefully I can leave them some bread
Before these punk polices or jealous streets leave me for dead

Tryin to succeed in these European's narcotics trade
Worked all week, 140 dollars was all I made
Fuck a job, I'd rather chop a rock and be chopping blades
Gotta watch these cops cause I came too far to die in a cage
Watch who you fuck, rather catch a bullet than die from AIDS

Crushing feelings on Broadway, I pulled that Monte SS out
Buy my mom a new spot and make sure that bitch super decked out
Swear I can't leave this Earth 'til I'm sure that you never stress out

Emotions froze, I'm so cold on every bitch on my team
A rolling stone, I move on like it's a daily routine
I used to have this bitch that had me twisted
Used to get drunk at the club and call me for random visits
She stumbled into my door and I smashed her in the kitchen
Yes she get rough when we sexing, flexing in all positions
Whispered and I often listened, she got a nigga at home
Not quite at home, he took a pitch and since ‘06 he been gone
She say she grown, she pay her bills and raise her kid on her own
Plus he touch down in a few days, I should just leave her alone
But it's that devil on my shoulder, telling me to come over
3am I hit the gas in my Chevy, blowin on doja
Got me stuck and I can't understand
Why I can't notice, I'm so bogus cause I know her man
I guess I'm dead wrong

I wish I had the nuts to tell you this
While you was locked away in jail I was out here nailing your bitch
I even helped out with the house note, the car payments and shit
I never thought about our friendship, I just thought with my dick
And I was dead wrong, on bogus shit from the start
Cause of this lust in my mind, I carried this guilt in my heart
I be so weak to let a piece of pussy peel us apart
If you found out about this shit, might twist your feelings in knots
Speaking of feelings, I caught em
Big bag of dreams and I bought em
Visions of me and her stuck on an island hideaway balling
Sometimes I don't return her calls and pray one day she be off it
But yo it seems like since he came home, she been calling more often
Damn..guess she addicted to the way I treat her
Because she right back at my doorstep everytime that he beat her
Fussing and crying saying baby I need you, why you ignore me?
Testing me, stressing me, how dare she question my loyalty?

But my affairs with this woman was extremely indecent
Truth is my homie got every right to come leave me leaking
Woke up with my phone on fire
Twenty, thirty missed calls
Called him back, he picked it up and I could tell he pissed off
He told me, bitch nigga, you see me, walk the other way
No room for explanation, just jump straight into pistol play
All them years we go back just got flushed down the toilet
Might lose my life behind this bitch, but man I just can't afford it
Whole situation could have been avoided
I wonder what went through his head when he picked up that loaded pistol and pointed
Like damn, if I can't have you in life, I guess I'll have you in death

Right now I just might rob me a nigga

As I look at the charm, thinking of a strong arm
Seen his watch as he reachin for his car alarm
Bet this hundred round drum pussy nigga thinkin twice
Fore he try to run, shots spit, and the cops come
All they seen was my golds and a black mask
Throw the car round the corner, tinted up with no tags
All these niggas wanna flash, Ima put it to they ass
With the K out, ask a nigga, “Where da sack at?""
Give it here, you wanna die for that rolex?
You can either get your life or that watch back
Ima shoot you point blank, I’m just hoping you think
You can take it as a loss, you can get it back
Nigga, buck and get shot, that’s the street code
I’m leave you there, do you, that’s how the shit go
Just another episode, A-K explode
In his head, left a smoke hole
Be a shamed if you died over fake shit
But that’s a lesson, if you out here on some fake shit
Come and robbin everyday, know the young nigga hungry
They be murkin for a quarter brick
Know they kill a whole fam for the whole thang
All the shooters up in Gary on the same thang
All the little homies strapped, so they look plain
Gun shots rang out, nigga, see flames
We be takin so much, now the shit fun
We be lookin for your shit fore your shit come
Forty eight hours, nigga round my way
Everyday nigga lookin like a sitcom
In this game of lose or draw nigga
You can be the one that get robbed
Or be the one to rob a nigga
But we all gotta eat, so we get no sleep
We gon wait it out and kill a nigga",Rob Me a Nigga,2011

Half a thang of heron in the bathroom
Keep an ak and the backup in the backroom
Cook a meal clean and she suck me like a vacuum
Took a vacation to the county, I'll be back soon
Sent a couple zero's, money on my j-pay
Payin off the c-o's, smoking on the gateway
Word around the block when I was locked she gave my thang away
Bout to have a baby with a nigga, thats what they say (they say)
Damn
Well please say it ain't so
Took off the glove, say it's love when it ain't though
Her classmate was coming over, that was strange though
Apparently the homework ain't all he came for
Maybe yous a stank ho, maybe that's a bit mean
Maybe you grew up and I'm still living like I'm sixteen
Like a child running wild in these sick streets
Man I put that bitch up on her feet, she cut a nigga deep

Damn
Bitch
That's why I treat these hoes the way I treat em
That's deeper than a motherfucker baby, know what I'm sayin

Slammin!
Smack it up and flip it, then I rub it down
Zip it up, and then I ship it to another town
Smokin hella weed while me and Willie bust a couple pounds
She used to like that type of shit, now we don't fuck around
Girl you used to say them other niggas wasn't hood enough
Got your hood degree, now niggas from the hood ain't good enough
Bitch you wasn't trippin when that old school was pullin up
You was short on ends at your college, you would put em up (put em up)
Well bitch I'm out here puttin on
I hope you feel the pain I'm feelin when you hear this song
Don't want a nigga that's gonna slang shit up in your home
But you ran off and got engaged, man that shit was wrong
All to a nigga that dont got nothin that I ain't got
Only difference is he trying to be a fuckin astronaut
Saw this pussy nigga when I walked up in the barber shop
Green as a leaf, lookin sweet, that cut a nigga deep

Damn
So these the type of niggas you fuckin with now baby?
Square ass motherfucker, you used to love a thug nigga

Uh
I loved her and she loved him, so I never touched him
She's got his baby in the oven, so it's mother fuck him
Ain't trippin cuz you got a nigga, I just think you rushin
But leavin him to be with me ain't part of our discussion
Plus I'm on the road now, different color hoes now
Layed back on the dope, I'm getting dollars off my shows now
Bitches wanna tie me down, but I ain't in that mode now
Five years later, why you calling up my phone now? (phone now)
Well bitch, how you get the number?
Like every other month I'm switching up that motherfucker
Back on the bus I used to finger fuck her singing Usher
Down on my luck and then she upped and left me for a sucker
I reminisce on all the crazy shit we did
You and me forever, shit we say when we was kids
She say I'm havin problems and I pray that he forgive
When he find out the baby ain't his, that cut a nigga deep

Police put me throughout, 2-1 on my mugshot
Crazy-ass niggas, yeah we insane
Put the pistol in your mouth, blow out your brain
Bail out on eight million dollar bond
Soon as I hit the streets, nigga, it’s back on

Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder

When I finger fuck my .45
I hit a nigga right between his eyes
Pull out the heat, make him dance, and do the dougie
Before I blow the back of his shit out, it can get ugly
Yes, y'all, I put his cherry pie on the wall
When I ride on my enemies, niggas know it’s uncut and raw
Mr. Bossalini, you can try to stand guard
But niggas like me be going Taliban hard
I spit grenades and piss bullets
Eat a bitch nigga for breakfast when I aim and pull it
Doing wonders for this bread, I Pillsbury these motherfuckers
When his doughboy die with the heat, I carry in my clutches
I’m a natural born rider, like my nigga Freddie Gibbs
Steady going hard and riding with steady clips
I been thugging from the beginning, you niggas soft as linen
I wear my black Jordans to match with my MAC-10

One night I was in Santos, it was lit like a candle
I was fly like a bird, I had on Stüssy Bape camo
With a cutie espanol, she had a booty like J-Lo
She had on jeggings and sandals, you've been trapped in the bando
She has to trap in the bando, ‘cause her momma got cancer
She can’t work in the states because her green papers ain’t legal
Fuck Obama un peso, she be like grande un peso, push the molly un peso
So she can feed her abuelo, she refuse to just settle
On them shoes with them red soles
And refuse to be nude in front of them dudes on that there pole
She can’t lose she just ooze a bunch of ambition like Nepo
Meanwhile I could be ruler, and ride the streets on my Benzo
So now she get money by carrying stuff for friends though
'Cause the kid named birdy look nerdy but he be up at the bandos
She robbed Birdy for birdies, now Birdy's after her head tho'

Death to me the only thing that's definite
Money rule the world, but when you dead that shit's irrelevant
Fingers numb from coka selling, no vote, but out for presidents
Granny found my dope, I told her I would stop for selling it
Nigga please -- she knew I was lying before I even spoke it
Empty promises left them all broken
She said Jamel, I can tell your perspective out of focus
You too obsessed with the liquor, bitches and weed smoking
A young nigga that's been thugging since the old days
Promise I've done seen everything but old age
Pray my demons never catch up from my old ways
Keep the heat cause I was going through a cold phase
Uh yeah
Keep the heat cause I was going through a cold phase
Promise I've done seen everything but old age

Surviving off cold cuts and cold Spam
Can't see eye to eye with my old man
Hiding my insecurities with this gang flag
We both despise the police, but he wore the same badge
And as I child I admired that, now I wonder how
He was a pig, but you was barely making 20 thou
I guess that's why you put me on that lick for 20 pounds
A life of crime is all we ever shared from then to now
And I'm a crook and you crooked, that's all we got in common
He chunked the deuce to my mama, so much for family bonding
But how could something so destined to be just get demolished?
Running through groupies and whoppers, I guess I got it honest
And honestly I know I'm out here fucking up
Seven grams of rock, I stuff 'em in my nuts
And seven bucks an hour wasn't good enough
Cause seven days a week I'm living in a rush
Seven days a week I'm living in a rush
Seven grams of rock, I stuff 'em in my nuts

And the money was the root to what the evil is
It's mandatory for me to live
I hustle harder than the next dude
Remember, everybody is out to get you
Niggas don't respect to live and let live
So I pack a .40 caliber cause that's how shit is
Out here, no fear, fuck feelings
Trigger man rule, that's the art of drug dealing
I'm trying to stack my money to the ceiling
No new friends, don't wanna talk about old business
Sex on the beach, sipping Guinness
With a bitch so thick she can't take no dick
Imagine working grave-yard shifts
Lost friends steady talking that shit
A million a day is for minimum wage
Work a nigga like a slave 'til he put him in his grave

He got the beating, his weed crumbs on plush seats
Niggas wanna hate, they get yellow tape'd and white sheets
And he steady talking, my chopper, he gonna let it rip
All the bullets tagging my name on this banana clip
Life's a bitch, I was a virgin, hope she let me fuck
Pray I miss before a nigga bust his last nut

Feelin' cramps, wishin' I could get a killer gram

The only one who make it last forever is Keith Sweat

Then eat breakfast?
Swallow forced beliefs like police justice

Fingerprints is wiped off
If people seem to always have somethin' to fight for

Meets the time, fall, spring, summer look book
Some people wanna see me hanging from a good hook

And pain fit as well, cause it came with us
After all these years carrying this shame with us
Now the entire planet is going insane with us
Seven year old kids carrying flame spitters
Fortified fences, mortify senses
Crossfire miss my little daughter by inches
Chemical dependence, medical expenses
But no amount of money on earth can buy vengeance

Got me tore up from the floor up
Gang signs, gang handshakes every time a nigga show up
All the real niggas know us
Back in '09 me and Lam we was looking for a way out
But ain't nobody want to show us
Riding round' selling blow, shotgun doors out his Volvo
Must have sowed a whole O up
And you stuck it out with me, I love you like a brother
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't have a record deal or nothing
I know you hate the fact that I'm so loyal to my street affiliation
But my niggas need a pack? I'm out here thuggin'
Willie and Diego need a pack? I'm out here thuggin'
My nigga Butter hit me for a pack? I'm out here thuggin'
And now the DEA they checking on me when I'm getting on a plane
Double life it got me ducking under covers
I just want to be legit man, shit man
And every time I touch the dope I say that ""this gonna' be my last flip man""
I got a shorty that's willing to sell it for me
She my lover, my homie, the devil cursed me with a pimp hand
I hope my daughter never lives this type of lifestyle
Creeping under street lights as a night child
My uncle still can't put the liquor or the pipe down
Meanwhile I'm in this kitchen whipping up the while gal
Plus I got addictions of my own, boy
The pills into laced blunts got me gone, boy
The Oxycontin and heavy syrup got me looking in the mirror saying
""Is you a dope fiend or a dope boy?""
Smoking on some shit that I can't pass to a nigga
Eyes shiny than a bitch, glass to a nigga
Down to kick in the door, .44 Mags to a nigga
Got some habits I pray that I never pass to a nigga
All about the dollar signs, fuck the sympathy
And fuck police cause' they killing you and killing me
Slanging and banging, my paper stay getting fatter
So do black lives matter when you're about to kill your enemy?
I need to know it, drop that paper boy don't be heroic
You'll get a trip to see your Jesus if you're reaching for it
A real solid street nigga, never been extorted
You pussy niggas shouldn't be living, should have been aborted

Why I was starvin' for attention? All she wanted is my attention
All I wanna do is smoke and fuck her
Thug it out and keep shit undercover
Told myself that I would never love her

Get mad if another nigga touch her

Hit that weed and deliver a profound speech

Spoke with profound speech speakin prolific
Smokin' on blueberry like Halle head in the piffy
'Bout to boomerang her Eddie, I Billy Bob if she let me
Right on my living room floor
'Cause these monster balls are so heavy

Under the living room floor
There lies trunk full of gold
If shit should ever go low
Then we will never go broke
Liquify the assets, audio dope-boy magic
Keep the Bentley console full of weed ashes

G-classes, glass feat leather under my ass cheeks
Talkin' bout muscle cars got a driveway full of athletes
Rappin' like half the time I got two twenty bands for the half-book
Keep it a hundred solid, they straight shook they half crooks

When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein

Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me

Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you

I'm sitting here wishing dear I had your love again
I'll never even ask you where you've been

Freddie Hart,"There's a lot of strange men in cell Block 10 but the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Just staring at the wall staring at wall

In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote and it proves that crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole
For name in her wedding day for name in her wedding day

As he looked at the wall so strong and tall I could hear him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first I'm gonna be the first

The warden walked by and said son don't try I would hate to see you fall
There ain't no doubt they will carry you out
If you ever touch that wall if you ever touch that wall

The years gone by since he made his try but I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall he never made that wall

There's never been a man ever shook this can but I know a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide I know it was suicide",Wall,1972
Freddie Hart,"I walked into country music's Hall of Fame
An old guitar hung on the wall that wore Hank Williams' name
As I stood and wondered what a sight to see
I'll swear I heard Hank's old guitar start to talk to me

My friend you're looking at old lonely soul
While these mem'ries locked inside of me that's worth much more than gold
Oh we were closer than friends could ever be
Everything we did we did together in perfect harmony
I would remember one night up in a hotel room
To look upon his face you'd thing that his whole world was doom
But as I stood there in the corner I could see
That a song would soon be born tonight oh he reached his hand for me

And he held me like a man would hold his girl
I was a closest thing to him in his lonely world
I could fill a story begging of release
That night we wrote Your Cheatin' Heart another masterpiece

Yeah we wrote so many songs just like this
And we're proud to know that we gave to world just a little more happiness
Hank told me just before he went away
Oh buddy I'd like to take you with me but this time you will have to stay

I walked out of country music's Hall of Fame
Still I can hear Hank's old guitar crying all in vain
Like a child has lost I heard its mournful cry
Hank I'm so lonesome I could die

Freddie Hubbard,"I Up on the wire
I like to climb and play with the sky
The people far below
The air is clear
And I can perceive
The whole world is shining
Life is sublime
And when you dare to go up in the air and leave the earth far behind you
As I step and dip and leap into a space beyond
Up high
Just for a moment
Alive
And so afraid but alive
As I push against the sky and my heart has broken free


II Fear turns to joy
When you can race the edge of the sky
And life's intense and strong
It's not so long
Before you will run
Beyond your horizons
Up on the wire
The line is thin and you must bow and surf against the sky so precisely
But the sky seems to go on as far as you can see
Up high
Just for this moment
Alive
And so afraid but alive
As the wire disappears
And you've finally broken free

Freddie Hubbard,"I hear music
Mighty fine music
The murmur of the morning breeze up there
The rattle of the milkman on the stair

Sure that's music
Mighty fine music
The singing of the sparrow in the sky
The perking of the coffee right nearby

That's my baby's melody
When you my angel holding me

Mighty fine music
And anytime I think my world is wrong
I get me out of bed and sing this song

When he takes hold of me

To call me
He's gonna handle me and hold me so
It's gonna be like dyin', Porgy
Deep inside me,

Freddie Hubbard,"Once I was a sentimental thing
Throw my heart away each spring
Now a spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
Tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most",Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most,1982

Freddie Hubbard,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,1983
Freddie Hubbard,"Often I think this sad old world is whistling in the dark. 
Just like a child, who, late from school 
Walks bravely home through the park. 

To keep their spirits soaring and keep the night at bay. 
Neither quite knowing which way they are going, 
They sing the shadows away. 

Often I think my poor old heart has given up for good. 
And then I see a brand new face, 
I glimpse some new neighborhood. 

So walk me back home, my darling, tell me dreams really come true. 
Whistling whistling here in the dark with you.

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

I was ordered to listen

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

How's my little man; how's he doing? 
And, umm, did you get the package that I sent? 
I hope that he knows that there's someone who loves him
