Marcy Marxer,"The hand is cold that once held mine 
I can't believe you've really left this world behind 
I can wait, I can hope 
I'll get over this in time 

It takes time to learn when someone's gone for good 
They're not coming back like you wish they would 
In the empty hours when you miss them so 
It takes time to learn to let them go 

Your last hours we never knew 
We never had the chance to say goodbye to you 
Words unsaid, things undone 
We'd just begun and now we'll never see them through 

It takes time to learn when someone's gone for good 
They're not coming back like you wish they would 
In the empty hours when you miss them so 
It takes time to learn to let them go 

",Time to Learn,1997
Marcy Marxer,"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you if you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of bein' alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of bein' alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart",Talk to Me,1998
Marcy Marxer,"Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

It's a lesson too late for the learnin'
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

You've got reasons a-plenty for goin'
This I know, this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

As I lie in my bed in the mornin'
Without you, without you
Each song in my breast lies a burnin'
Without you, without you

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
That was the last thing on my mind

Marcy Marxer,"Ramblin' around this dirty old town
Singin' for nickels and dimes
Times getting rough I ain't got enough
To buy me a bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Little hotel, older than Hell
Cold and as dark as a mine
Blanket so thin, I lie there and grin
Buy me little bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Aches in my head, bugs in my bed
Pants so old that they shine
Out on the street, tell the people I meet
Won'ch buy me a bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Teacher must teach, and the preacher must preach
Miner must dig in the mine
I ride the rods, trusting in God
And hugging my bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

I'll try to remember that I saw you first. (Lay?) Baby I should have seen you sooner.
I saw you first. (Oh gee) think you could ever stand the crooner? (Uh huh)
You smiled at me, that was my lucky break, gave you that double take

una mirada triste si te vas,

echar atrÃ¡s el tiempo de una vez

Mare Anthony,"Yo no he deseado jamás en la vida cambiarme por nadie
Pues con mis defectos y con mis virtudes siempre pude aceptarme
De mis fracasos, mis amores, siempre aprendí de mis errores
Pero nunca celos o envidia de nadie jamás yo sentí

Hasta que el destino me puso ante mi tu mirada de ángel
Y así comenzó mi obsesión, mi delirio por conquistarte
Pero al saber que no eras libre, no me aleje y en cambio quise
Estar lo más cerca posible de ti, espiarte y seguirte allí donde vas

Envidia, me muero de celos y envidia
Pensando en la forma en que el te acaricia
Y siempre me estoy imaginando
Las veces que el te haré suya
No puedo aguantar tantos celos
Me muero de envidia
Envidia, queriendo ser luna do noche
Y así ser testigo de tanto derroche
Queriendo cambiar yo mi vida por la de ese hombre
Y amarte hasta que se te olvide su nombre

Va contra mis principios, mi moral, mi dignidad
El tener sentimientos de amor por una mujer ajena
Que será mi condena que me va a matar

Envidia, me muero de celos y envidia
Pensando en la forma en que el te acaricia
Y siempre me estoy imaginando
Las veces que el te haré suya
No puedo aguantar tantos celos
Me muero de envidia
Envidia, queriendo ser luna do noche
Y así ser testigo de tanto derroche
Queriendo cambiar yo mi vida por la de ese hombre
Y amarte hasta que se te olvide su nombre

No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia
Ay me muero de envidia
Pensando en la forma en que el te acaricia y te haré suya
No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia

Que celos, los malditos celos
Estos celos con mi vida van a terminar
Que celos, los malditos celos

No se lo que me pasa,esta maldita envidia
Que va acabar conmigo yo lo se, si no te hago mía
Na contra mis principios, mi moral, querer amar a 
Una mujer que es ajena

Vivir así no puedo más 
Te digo no puedo más
Vivir así no puedo más
No puedo más,no puedo más",Celos,2015
Marea,"Me envalentono y te digo
Que tienes los ojitos como fruta del olivo
Que no, primo, que yo me voy con el sol
Y por mis muertos que tu no amaneces conmigo
Quiero que quede y se sube al tejao
Con un ojo abierto y el otro entornao
Pa ver si caemos mis penas y yo en algún descampao

Y me encaramo como puedo
Giñao, con las manos sudando
En cuanto le dije ""te quiero""
Ya estaba roncando, soñando de nuevo

Me encorajino y decido
""se que tu serás mi niña, que te casarás conmigo""
Pesao, que eres un pesao
Otra vez te lo digo
Me voy cuando quiera y cuando quiera te olvido
Te he escrito un poema de esos agarraos
Quiero amaneceres contigo a mi lao
Ella me cierra la puerta, a cualquier cosa
Le llaman poeta

Si es cierto mejor me despido
La aurora me pilla llorando
Me acuna y dice que se ha ido
Para que no sufra
Que duerma tranquilo

No quiero tu amor temporero
Tu flujo de hiel, tus ganas de perder
Aunque se que si te vas me quedo en ná
No pienso caer, no me voy a joder
Porque se que me acecha el día y el sol
Pa follarme a cara de perro y decirme
¿lo que vas a hacer con tu mierda de poemas
Sin su olor, sin su piel?

Yo, dosifico a pala y pico el sol",Amor Temporero,2000
Marea,"Quieto parao, no te arrimes, ya son demasiados abriles 
Para tu amanecer desbocao, mejor que me olvides
Yo me quedo aquí a tender mi pena al sol 
En la cuerda de tender desolación
Luego empezaré a coser tequieros en un papel 
Y a barrer el querer con los pelos de un pincel

Y en cuanto acabó de zurcir las heridas de 
Las noches mal dormidas llegué yo 
Y le llené de flores el jergón para los dos
Sin espinas, de colores, que se rieguen 
Cuando llore y cuando no, las sulfatamos 
Con nuestro sudor
Y me confesó, cuando quieras arrancamos que 
En las líneas de la mano lo leyó
Que se acabó el que la quemara el sol
Pero se asustó, ¡como te retumba el pecho!
Tranqui, solo es mi maltrecho corazón
Que se encabrita cuando oye tu voz

¿Qué coño le pasara que ya no sale a volar? 
¿Tal vez le mojó las plumas el relente de la luna? 
Le volvió loca el sonío de las gotas de rocío 
Cuando empieza a clarear y aún no se ha dormío 

Y me enamoró, aunque era un hada alada y 
Yo seguía siendo nada no importó
Eramos parte del mismo colchón 
Hasta que juró,""nos querremos mas que nadie 
Pa que no corra ni el aire entre tu y yo""
Sentí que me iba faltando el calor

Le hizo un trato al colchón, con su espuma se forró 
El corazón, que anoche era de piedra y al alba era 
De mimbre que se dobla antes que partirse 

Amaneció, la vi irse sonriendo, con lo puesto 
Por la puerta del balcón, el pelo al viento 
Diciendome adiós, porque decidió que ya 
Estaba hasta las tetas de poetas de bragueta y revolcón
De trovadores de contenedor",Corazón de Mimbre,2000

Verse
Like a flower in the morning turns towards the sun
I'm just hoping and praying that you're the one
Thoughts keep rushing
I see all the possibilities
And I'm down
I'm down on my knees

Chorus
What I won't do for love
What I won't do just because
Please baby put my soul at ease
Are you the one for me
And have you come to set me free
Cause I'm down here
I'm down on my knees

Verse
Like a wave in the ocean comes to the shore
I'll just be wanting you forever more
Anytime you touch me
I get so blind I can't see

With no proof anyone could hear

Hope seemed like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve

You will when you believe

And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way here through the rain
We’re small, but still, we’re singing far
Says help is very near

But you can't carry on
You need to break that cycle now
And rise above the rest

And rise again for me

What if the world were
A little more perfect
Would you stop crying or
Would you take the leap
What if the world 
Were a little more perfect
Would you open your eyes
And blink again for me

What about friendship
What about friends
You said the whole world
Was against you
And it all had to end

What about love
What about family
What about all that
You have to live for

Maren Ord,"You stroll along
Retrace your footsteps
You see a child
He's left alone

Alone to stay
Alone with no one there to play
You recall your childhood
Still lonesome today

All he wanted was a friend
Someone he could talk to
Relate to

You attempt to reach
But then you look away
Nothing's accomplished
Two shadows fade

What to grow as?
What will you grow up to become?
Where are these answers?
Oh they'll come along

All he wanted was a friend
Someone he could talk to
Relate to

You wonder why you're still alone
You cry all night on your roof top
What are you hiding?
Is it something I must know?

Maren Ord,"She drives herself through the streets
Watching eyes so blindly
Taking pictures
She can't see or show

Who to meet

Wondering is she'll ever have
Or need to know

What they talk about
At the back door
They say she can't hold her own
And her Mama's never home

At the back door
You wonder why she feels so alone
How could a young girl feel so old.
You know
Sarah doesn't care anymore
You know what they say
At the back door
But it's not that way

Sarah walks along silently
On her own

Sealing those pictures of the past
How time's flown so fast

Mean nothing to me
Mean nothing at all

Don't you go away
You can't deny it

And you speak in such a way
That it doesn't faze you
Well, it fazes me
Are you scared of me?

Speak only to me and
Don't hear my words

So when you go
Don't you swallow
All the words that I've spoken
Because it's all ok

Between you and me.

Don't ask me tonight
Sometimes I'll take the hand that's out
And I will never figure out
What took me there
Even when I look up high
I must always use my head
Of all the little things I've ever sadi
I don't know anything.

Somehow you came along
You lifted up my head
and then you wre gone
You're not yourself
Where have you been
I'm all alone
Your story is wearing thin tonight.

Curled up on the couch alone
Just sitting, waiting there pathetically

Mareva Galanter,"Nous avions dix ans à peine
Tous nos jeux étaient les mêmes
Aux gendarmes et aux voleurs
Tu me visais droit au cœur

Bang bang, tu me tuais
Bang bang, et je tombais
Bang bang, et ce bruit-là
Bang bang, je ne l'oublierai pas

Nous avons grandi ensemble
On s'aimait bien il me semble
Mais tu n'avais de passion
Que pour tes jeux de garçon

Bang bang, tu t'amusais
Bang bang, je te suivais
Bang bang, et ce bruit-là
Bang bang, je ne l'oublierai pas

Un jour tu as eu vingt ans
Il y avait déjà longtemps
Que l'amour avait remplacé
Notre amitié du passé

Et quand il en vint une autre
On ne sait à qui la faute
Tu ne m'avais jamais menti
Avec elle tu es parti

Bang bang, tu m'as quittée
Bang bang, je suis restée
Bang bang, et ce bruit-là
Bang bang, je ne l'oublierai pas

Quand j'aperçois des enfants
Se poursuivre en s'amusant
Et faire semblant de se tuer
Je me sens le cœur serré

Bang bang, tout me revient

Bang bang, je ne l'oublierai pas

I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me

Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie

Marga Sotirovska,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Margaret Bailey,"I wondered alone one night. 
Till I heard an orchestra play.
I met you when lights were bright,
and people were carefree and gay.
You were the beautiful lady in blue.
I was in Heaven just dancing with you.
You filled me with strange delight,
and softly you strolled away.
 
I dream of that night with you,
lady when first we met.
We danced in a world of blue.
How can my heart forget.
Blue were your eyes,
and blue were the skies.
Just like the blue skirt you wore.
Come back blue lady come back.

When love has come why do you still resist

A thousand books of stories told
All were black but one was gold

Through drops of salt on every page

And my body was breaking

Be a light in the darkness
Be a heart to the heartless
When the world's lost its meaning
Be the one who will still go on believing

Another dream in black and white
A gentle man of flesh and bone
He says this world is not our home

To cut down my point of view
Maybe then I could concentrate
On just living my life for You

Whether to bow to the temple wall
Or to the spirit locked inside

Tonight I've got my heart
By the throat
I'm gonna stay here
Till my whole body knows

I commit my heart to the heavens
I stand to praise Your name
I commit my heart to the heavens
I am here to praise your name

I say this simply with no regrets
I was born to testify
There's no shame in being Your servant
It's the highest call in life

Still I need to remind myself
That I'm happiest on my knees
When I am thanking You for who You are
And all that You've done for me

Before these words burn a hole
On my tongue
I'm gonna praise You
For all You've done

Down on Bleeker Street

Whose chances are thinner

From the Kingdom's throne

Fascinated with the love

We're fighting over stuff that's here and gone
There's so much
We both could share

Pointing out the cracks
And I don't need another tongue
Shooting flames behind my back

Can conquer anything

Somebody somewhere swore that train would be coming back

And I could feel her gentle guidance
I could feel her hold me tight
Seems like too many years since she kissed me goodnight

But it was hard, so hard to believe
Standing among the ruins of a dream

But from here looking back, you can see clearly that
You can gain from things that you lose
And learn many ways by many means

What I'm sure You already know
How my throat is tight with crying
Yet my soul is arctic blue
'Cause I've seen some tears that didn't move me
Whispered words I didn't mean
Held back all my love for anger
Grown so weak in all these things
So in all these things

Deliver me from me
And deliver me to You
Come and set me free
Come and find me tried and true
Come on now
Deliver me from me

I was just about to run away
As far as far could go
When I recognized the cruelest captors
Living right inside my soul
And I can't escape their endless movements
Cannot shed them like a skin
Can't control all these emotions
Cannot live while they're within

Coming for my soul
Taking me to places
I wasn't ready yet to go, no no

Last night, I dreamed of silence
The silence that I keep
All the things, I could've said
Well, they stole away my sleep

I need to remember
The horses will come
(I need to remember)
I need to remember
How quickly they run
(I need to remember)

I want no regrets
When the horses come for me
I cannot forget
That the horses come for me

Last night I dreamed You with me
You put Your finger to my lips
And You told me to be brave now
And I felt like I'd been kissed

I need to remember
You're always with me
(I need to remember)
And I need to remember
You're the reason I breathe
(I need to remember)

I want no regrets
When the horses come for me
I cannot forget
That the horses come for me

Last night, I woke up crying
But I knew I'd be alright

I want no regrets
When the horses come for me
Oh, I cannot forget
That the horses come for me

No regrets
I cannot forget

Last night, I dreamed of horses

All tied up and twisting, I told you sit and wait
That I would be right there with a heart and soul to listen
Don't want to see you down and you know no matter what you do
I'll always be around, all I got to say, all I got to say

I want to be the one to tell you, to tell it like it is
To let you know the God of love will never leave your side
I want to be the one to lead you with everything I am
And see the day when you let Him in and make a friend for life

You're telling me your heart is in pieces on the wind
And you've been cast away again, I see it in your eyes
The haunted look of loss that comes when dreams meet their end
I don't want to force you to have faith and you know no matter what you do
I'm gonna love you any way, all I've got to say, all I've got to say

And the only thing that matters is you know you're not alone
'Cause love will stay here with you long after I'm gone

Fulness of God in helpless babe!

Scorned by the ones he came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied 
For every sin on him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground his body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as he stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am his and he is mine 
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

Margaret Cho,"When the earth was still flat, and the clouds made of fire
And mountains stretched up to the sky, sometimes higher
Folks roamed the earth like big rolling kegs
They had two sets of arms, two sets of legs
They had two faces peering out of one giant head
And they could watch all around them
And they talked while they read
And they never knew nothing of love
It was before the origin of love
Origin of love

And there were three sexes then
One that looked like two men glued back to back
Called the children of the sun
And similar in shape and girth were the children of the earth
They looked like two girls rolled up in one
And the children of the moon were like a fork shoved on a spoon
They were part sun, part earth, part daughter, part son
Origin of love

Now the gods grew quite scared of our strength and defiance
And Thor said:
""I'm gonna kill them all with my hammer
Like I killed the giants.""
And Zeus said:
""No, you better let me use my lightning, like scissors
Like I cut the legs off whales
And dinosaurs into lizards.""
Then he grabbed up some bolts
And he let out a laugh, said:
""I'll split them right down to the middle
Gonna rip them right in half.""
And then storm clouds gathered above
Into great balls of fire

And the fire shot down
From the sky in bolts
Like shining blades of a knife
And it ripped right through the flesh
Of the children of the sun
And the moon, and the earth
And some Indian god
Sewed the wound up into a hole
Pulled it 'round to our belly
To remind us of the price we pay
And Osiris and the gods of the Nile
Gathered up a big storm
To blow a hurricane
To scatter us away
In a flood of wind and rain
And a sea of tidal waves
To wash us all away
And if we dont behave
They'll cut us down again
And well be hopping round on one foot
Looking through one eye

Last time I saw you
We had just split in two
You were looking at me, and I was looking at you
You had a way so familiar
But I could not recognize
'Cause you had blood on your face
And I had blood in my eyes
But I could swear by your expression
That the pain down in your soul
Was the same as the pain down in mine
That's the pain
Cuts a straight line down through the heart
We call it love
So we wrapped our arms around each other
Trying to shove ourselves back together
We were making love
It was a cold dark evening such a long time ago
When by the mighty hand of Jove
It was the sad story
How we became lonely two-legged creatures
It's the story of
The origin of love
That's the origin of love, origin of love, origin of love",Origin of Love,2006

Margaret Far,"Walking barefoot on the shore
Hypnotized by the ocean roaring
Thoughts of you drifting in and out
Never fails to calm me down

So blue, ocean blue

I keep moving to the distant sounds
And visions of you drifting in and out
Clouds mixing with the sand and the sea
Sounds get carried on the ocean breeze

I still hear your voice from across the horizon
And wasn't that you walking into the shadows?

In time I'll believe it was just an illusion
In time I'll believe it was only a dream

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

My hat from my glove

Margaret Harris,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

",Where Do You Start?,1998

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near

The story to me you revealed
You said you could live without loving
In your loveless mansion on the hill

Margaret Whiting,"I used to dream that I would discover
The perfect lover someday,
I knew I'd recognize him if ever
He came 'round my way.
I always used to fancy then
He'd be one of the God-like kind of men
With a giant brain and a noble head
Like the heroes bold
In the books I've read.

But along came Bill
Who's quite the opposite of all
The men in storybooks
In grace and looks
I know that Apollo
Would beat him
All hollow

And I can't explain,
It's surely not his brain
That makes me thrill
I love him because he's wonderful,
Because he's just my Bill.

He can't play golf or tennis or polo,
Or sing a solo, or row.
He isn't half as handsome
As dozens of men that I know.
He isn't tall or straight or slim
And he dresses far worse than Ted or Jim.
And I can't explain why he should be
Just the one, one man in the world for me.

He's just my Bill, an ordinary man,
He hasn't got a thing that I can brag about.
And yet to be
Upon his knee
So comfy and roomy
Seems natural to me.
Oh, I can't explain,
It's surely not his brain
That makes me thrill
I love him because he's, I don't know
Because he's just my Bill.",Bill [From Show Boat] [*],1960

You take romance. I'll take Jello.

With no insults, and all the morals.
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France.
I never get the chance.
This is a fine romance.

A fine romance, my friend, this is.
True love should have the thrills that a healthy crime has.

You never give the orchids I send a glance.
No, you like cactus plants.

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,

Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?

And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd,
So that people are apt to stare.

Do they know, do they care, that it's only 
That I'm lonely, and low as can be?
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all.

So I smoke a little too much, and I joke a little too much,
And the tunes I request are not always the best,
But the ones where the trumpets blare.

I could hear the distant drums

And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

Tu m'as donné l'envie de croire à l'amour

Marge,"Oh, the bases were empty on the diamond of my heart
When the coach called me up to the plate
I'd been swingin' and missin' and lovin, and kissin
My average was point double-o eight

So I spit on my hands
Knocked the dirt from my spikes
And pointed right towards center field
This time I'm hittin' the home run, this time love is for real

I'll slide, I'll steal, I'll sacrifice a lovin' fly for you
I've been slumpin' off season
But now I've found the reason
I've struck on a love that is true

I used to play the field, I used to be a roamer
But season's turnin' around for me now

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

It hurts so bad, cause when I see you, I start crying,
I've tried everything to stop, but there's no denying,
That falling in love with you, girl, is just like dying.

Oh, don't walk away,
How, how can I make you stay?
Don't turn away,
I can still hear you saying those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.

Girl, don't you know we could work it out with talking?
You won't look around or slow down your walking,
I've given you everything with kiss to seal it,
You had to get your kicks out of trying to steal it.

Now, I'm standing here,
Strange, strange voices in my ears,
I feel the tears,
But, all I can hear are those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through, ahh.

Where do you go
To get to know
The reason why a brand new feeling
Comes to take you
Away from reason

The things you do
You do not only from need
And not from greed

And live without hurting
Someone you love
Why do we grow
And never show

Sunny days, happy times
Take a picture so we can remember
The way it feels to love each other
Just in case of cloudy days to come

See the smile on my face
Take a picture so we can remember
The things you do to make me smile this way

Ask a stranger to take a picture
We should have one side by side
Look at me, and say `I love you'
Aren't I the picture of pride

Sunny days, happy times
Take a picture so we can remember 
The things we share, the dreams we're dreaming of
Come and take a picture of love

Love
What does it mean
To live between
The beginning and ending of love
Where do you go
To get to know
The reason why a brand new feeling
Comes to take you
Away from reason

Love
How do you know
The things you do
You do not only from need
And not from greed
But only from love

Love
When do you get to be
Someone who can give
And live without hurting
Someone you love
Why do we grow
And never show
The little that we know love

I knew the man well
We used to be good friends a long time ago

He was one of a kind
The kind of a man a man would be lucky to know

As I recall it all, it all happened fast
It was as though he had seen the American dream
And thought that the dream would bring him fulfillment at last

He put on a shirt
He put on a tie
He kissed his child
He kissed his wife
He kissed his life good-bye

Melon-rising California sun
Drifting in a day not yet begun
Six o'clock and peaceful and serene
Floating in a Technicolor scene

Something nearly peaceful in the sound
Rising from the San Andreas ground
Overground, it starts to feel strange
Underground, it starts to rearrange

You'd better get up
And run for a doorway

No time for thinking
Your life is at stake
Everyone's doing the California Shake
California Shake

Nonbelieving, everybody waits
Shifting on the continental plates
Thunder far below the ocean floor
Damned impartial sub-terrestrial war

Wond'ring if you're going to survive
God, it feels like eight point four or five
Fifteen seconds holding your breath
Living through a microscopic death

You'd better hold on
The worst isn't over

						Words and Music by Margo Guryan

The heat is down and the lights are low
The East is buried in an icy snow
The West is following crisis rules
They can't go swimming in their swimming pools

And the tapes go hmm-mm-mm-mm…..

The prices rise and the Market falls
The trucks go slow and the Congress stalls
The V.P. left with the dough he took
And the P. tells the world he's not a crook

And the tapes go hmm-mm-mm-mm…..

The A.G.* said he'd do anything
To help the President become the King
The kingdom then became cold and empty
All except for San Clemente

And the tapes go hmm-mm-mm-mm…..

The rich save money and the poor save gas
We vote for an elephant and get an ass
He hires and he fires, he appoints and sacks
But he can't figure out his income tax

And the tapes go hmm-mm-mm-mm….

I'd like to see the bad guy get the girl

He's well-behaved, and he's so sincere
But she don't even get what he gives a horse

I'd like to see the bad guys get away
They're always getting shot or hung

To let the bad guys win

Most of my life I fell in love in one minute flat
Falling in love most of my life was as easy as that
And losing someone I loved was part of the game
Until I lost you and found you again

And now it seems I?ve loved you most of my life
And I don?t want to lose you ever again
And now it seems I?ve loved you most of my life
And I don?t want to lose you ever again

Most of my life I thought that love was only a way
Of killing the time, filling the gap, or spending the day
And then you showed me how beautiful love could be
And for the first time love happened to me

And now I know I?ve loved you most of my life
And I don?t want to lose you ever again
And now I know I?ve loved you most of my life

The fact that I?m true to you is perfectly clear
Please believe me, you?re just a kid
Therefore you must believe I did, I did it all for you

It was wrong for you to ask them at the Watergate Hotel
If Sue and I had been there, it was wrong for them to tell
I know you?ll understand it when the facts are yours to see
I swear I never touched her; she was making love to me

Please believe me, I love you a lot
I?m gonna take care of you, if you like it or not
Please believe me, you?ll never get rid
Of someone who did, he did, I swear, I did it all for you

Margo Hennebach,"When I lived in London, I used to love singing this on my way home from the 
Blackhorse Road Tube stop
As I roved out on a May morning
On a May morning so early
As I roved out on a May morning
On a May morning so early
T'was then I spied a fair young maid
And the sun was shining clearly wid me
Too ray al, fal the diddle dah,
Die re fal, the diddle darry oh

And who are you me pretty fair maid
And who are you me honey
She answered me quite modestly
I am me mother's darling wid me...
Will ye come to me house in the middle of the night

When the moon is shining clearly
I'll open the door and I'll let you in
And divil a one shall hear us wid me...

So I came to her house in the middle of the night
When the moon was shining clearly
She opened the door and she let me in
And divil a one did hear us wid me...

She took me horse by the bridle and the bit
And she led him to the stable
Saying there's plenty of oats for a soldier's horse
To eat them if he's able wid me...

She took me by the lily white hand
And she led me to the table
Saying there's plenty of wine for a soldier boy
To drink it if he's able wid me...

Then I got up and I made the bed
And I made it nice and aisy
And I picked her up and I laid her down
Saying, lassie, are ye able wid me...

And there we lay till the break of day
And divil a one did hear us
Then I got up and put on me clothes
Saying lassie I must leave you wid me...

And when will you return again
And when will we get married
When broken shells make Christmas bells
Then we might well get married wid me...",As I Roved Out,1998
Margo Hennebach,"You need a man to get lost in

Wild and free
Room to grow

On the solid rock of trust

And still be side by side in love

You may have come so easy and happened so fast

You have many people fooled about your motivation
But I don't believe your lies

Margo Price,"When I rolled out of town on the unpaved road
I was fifty-seven dollars from being broke
Kissed my mama and my sisters and I said goodbye
And with my suitcase packed I wiped the tears from my eyes

Times they were tough growing up at home
My daddy lost the farm when I was two years old
Took a job at the prison working second shift
And that’s the last time I let them take what should be his

Cause all I want to do is make a little cash
Cause I worked all the bad jobs bustin' my ass
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine
And turn back the clock on the cruel hands of time

When I hit the city I joined the band
Started singing in the bars and running with the men
But the men they brought me problems
And the drinking caused me grief
I thought I'd found a friend but I only found a thief

Soon I settled down with a married man
We had a couple babies, started living off the land
But my firstborn died and I cried out to God
Is there anybody out there looking down on me at all?

Cause all I want to do is make something last
But I can't see the future, I can't change the past
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine
Turn back the clock on the cruel hands of time

Still I keep a'running fast as I can
Trying to make something honest with my own two hands
And I ain't got the breath to say another bad word
So if I ever said it wrong won't you forget what you heard

Cause all I want to do is make my own path
Cause I know what I am, I know what I have
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine

I killed the angel on my shoulder with a fifth of Evan Williams
When I found out you were never coming home
I killed the angel on my shoulder
When you left me for another

No darling, I won't speak your name
And I hope that you will do the same
But I hope my voice will haunt you above the ground
If I see your face again don't consider me a friend
You made me feel like an orphan and act like a clown

I killed the angel on my shoulder with a handle of tequila
So I wouldn't have to spend my nights alone, all alone

Since you left me for another

They're just sucking all of the good blood out of this town
But I'm an outcast, and I'm a stray
And I plan to stay that way
And even if I fall from my grace I'm gonna land back on the ground

Spending all my weekends here
Far from my good-timing friends
Things just went from bad to worse
But I don't know when
The only thing I know for sure
Is I ain't going back again

They took me down to cellblock B
After stripping off my clothes
Put me in a monkey suit
And threw me in the throes
Like a rat in a maze
A cow in the herd
Or a sparrow with a broken wing
Now I know the reason why
The caged bird has to sing

'Cause I'm just a weekender
In the Davidson County Jail
And my old man, he ain't got the cash
To even go my bail
Should have listened to my mama
And quit my life of sin
Before I went backsliding again

This bed is hard and the room is cold
And my cellmate's got a cough
She takes her meds and sleeps all day
Got six more weeks til she's off
She said she beat her boyfriend up
While high on crack cocaine
And now she sits and watches
Her life go down the drain

Mighty soon was sent back to her room
And I bet you know the rest

Margo Timmins,"Born and raised in a prairie town
Just a kid full of dreams
We didn't have much but an old radio
Music came from places we'd never been

Growing up in a prairie town
Learning to drive in the snow
Not much to do so you start a band
And soon you've gone as far as you can go

Winter nights are long, summer days are gone
Portage and Main fifty below
Springtime melts the snow, rivers overflow
Portage and Main fifty below
Portage and Main fifty below

All the bands in a prairie town
Try to outdo the next in line
Learning records out of Liverpool
Dreams of England on their Minds

On the other side of Winnipeg
Neil and The Squires played the Zone
But then he went to play
For awhile in Thunder Bay
He never looked back and he's never coming home

Just a band from a prairie town
Sometimes we'd drive from coast to coast
One call from LA and we'd pack and fly away
But in our hearts we're always prairie folk

Looking back at a prairie town
People ask me why I went away
To fly with the best, sometimes you have to leave the nest
But the prairies made me what I am today",Prairie Town,2004

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone

It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around

She wants to get real fucked up. 
She used to laugh and smile, 
But the years of denial. 
Have taken their toll on her dial. 

But, me, I do as I please. 
I caught you and set you free. 
Cause I have been left alone by the people I've known. 
And I don't know when they're coming home. 

And Jen don't wanna be seen, 
But I saw her in a swank magazine. 
She had an airbrushed face, 
But the lines of distaste 
were crossed without crossing of legs. 

And I don't wanna be found. 
So when you get home, 
I'm skipping town. 
I'm leaving to go someplace 
where nobody will have any clue where I am.

Margot & the Nuclear So and So's,"That's no way to live
All tangled up like balls of string.
And we woke at dawn
And watched the sun glide over the hill.

I just said the first 
Three words that popped into my head.
Let me off the bus; I'm tired and soar and should probably change clothes.
And the circuits are blown, 
My woman is cold,
Our children are stoned and worthless.
All waiting for you to tell them the truth. The truth is a line, that you'll never use.

And her dignity 
Shown so bright like a light on a hill.
And she burned for me, 
And no other man came near the flame.
And back country songs the deafening twang of the rich-white-kid blues
You can own the stage, 
But the lights and glares will not make you real.

She whispers to me, I was meant to be free. 
This life that we've built is deadly. 
She crawls from my bed, with a comb cross her head. 
She crawls to the train and drives herself home",A Light on a Hill,2005

My lack of loyalty, it swallowed her up.

She left her man unattended to me. 
Don't call me that. 
Don't claim you love me 
cause you know that ain't true. 

And you're finally free 
to twist and turn like a skeleton key. 

You've gotta let me know. 
You've gotta let me know. 

I did a horrible thing to that girl. 
I bread my misery and drowned it in her. 
And she got me high, 
And I hardly noticed there were tears in her eyes. 

And I miss you less and less everyday. 
This stream of whisky helps to wash you away. 

And it's clear to see, 
You're nothing special. 
You're a skeleton key.

im choking on the fumes of my wayward back

she was a witch in disguise
and she dressed her wounds
in sackcloth and ashes
the children weep
at their dead mothers feet
her husbands drunk

it didnt feel poisonous

Your tender kiss,
And the wonderful things we would do.

Marguerite Krull,"Don't know why I'm frightened
I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say not just today but always
We'll have early morning madness
We'll have magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye
Oh, please don't ever ever make me say goodbye",As If We Never Said Goodbye [From Sunset Boulevard],1996
Marguerite Krull,"Anything but lonely, 
Anything but empty rooms.
There's so much in life to share --
What's the sense when no one else is there? 

Anything but lonely, 
Anything but only me.
Quiet years in too much space:
That's the thing that's hard to face, 
And ...

You have a right to go, 
But you should also know
That I won't be alone for long.
Long days with nothing said 
Are not what lie ahead --
I'm sorry, but I'm not that strong.


Anything but lonely, 
Anything but passing time.
Lonely's what I'll never be,
While there's still some life in me, 
And ...


I'm still young, don't forget, 
It isn't over yet --
So many hearts for me to thrill.
If you're not here to say 
How good I look each day,
I'll have to find someone who will.

Marguerite Krull,"Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every streetlamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters, and a streetlamp gutters,
And soon it will be morning.

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me!
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day
Has begun",Memory [From Cats],1997

In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there,
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

It's me they hear

My/your spirit and my/your voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my/your mind

He's there
The phantom of the opera
Beware the phantom of the opera

In all your fantasies you always knew
That man and mystery

Were both in you

And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the opera is here/there

Inside my/your mind

Sing, my angel of music!

We loved each other tenderly
Like we loved all lovers

Ever since I've been desperate
I see you everywhere in the sky
I see you everywhere on the earth
You are my joy and my sun

You are everywhere because you are in my heart
You are everywhere because you are my happiness
Everything that is around me
Even life does not represent you
Sometimes I dream that I am in your arms
And you speak softly in my ear
You tell me things that make me close my eyes
And I find that marvellous

Maybe one day you will return
I know that my heart waits for you
You can not forget
The past days we spent together
My eyes never stop searching for you
Listen well, my heart calls you
We can love each other again
And you'll see life would be beautiful

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Said Jermaine likes it, and I like it

[Mariah] (JD) {Jadakiss}
{Uh, uh huh, yeah}, (uh huh, yeah), uh huh, yeah (uh)
(Uh huh, yeah, yeah)
You know I'm really missing you baby, uh huh, yeah (MC)
You know I'm really missing you baby, uh huh, yeah (So So Def)
You know I'm really missing you baby, uh huh, yeah
Baby baby I'm missing you (heh heh, come on)

[Verse One: Mariah]
Longing for you everyday and I reach for you every night (uh huh, yeah)
Baby nothing's been the same since the day, we, said, good-bye
And I can't go on like this for too long
Baby baby I'm missing you (uh huh, yeah)
Boy I need you next to me and I'm hungering for your touch
Caught up in the memories and you're all I'm thinking of (uh huh, yeah)
'Cause I can't get past, what we used to have (yeah)
Baby baby I'm missing you (come on)

[Chorus: Mariah]
I'm talkin' bout how I used to like it when you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me and those beautiful things
Baby won't you come here 'cause I'm really in need
I'm lost in your love and I don't know what to do with myself
I don't want to be with nobody else
I just think about you, think about us, think about how much
I miss you

[Verse Two: Mariah]
All I do is reminisce of the love that we used to share (uh huh, yeah)
Can't recover from your kiss because nothing, else compares (uh huh, yeah)
Ain't no substitute, when it comes to you (come on)
Baby baby I'm missing you
Visions of us hand in hand come to me when I close my eyes (uh huh, yeah)
Baby I don't understand how we let, it, all slip by
Tell me can we try, baby one more time, baby, baby I miss you

[Chorus]

[Mariah] + (JD)
Remember when, our eyes first met (uh huh)
I knew I'd never be the same again (this part's sexy right here)
Why can't it just be like it was (yeah)
Enough is enough (yo)

[Jadakiss]
Uh, uh huh
Yo, I remember when I first kicked it to you
We hit it off well, then I used to whisper to you
It was all swell

Said you came from a family with money
Me, I was fresh off the block handling twenties
When I smile was you open or what (uh huh, yeah)
Say you can't judge a book by the cover 'til you open it up

Past hot, we was more like lava-ble (uh huh)
Used to chill and the smoke didn't bother you
Beauty of a rose, scent of a flower
Love when I tell her to, get in the shower, hit it for hours (wooo)

When I thought you was able to cope
that's where things fell apart ma, then it stagnated us both
And now the pain is killing you crazy
While all the time in your mind, you knew I was feeling you crazy

But Kiss is official boo and I'mma come clean 
You miss me, well I miss you too, come on

[Chorus: x 4]",Miss You,2004

Mari,"I spend my time these days just thinking of the past
I spend my time just wondering why it never lasted
I count the days til I can see you once again
If nothing else you were always my best friend
But I miss you now my friend
I long to kiss your smile again

Will you run, runaway with me
And leave your world behind
Will you come, come and stay with me
Just you and me until the end of time

Unlucky in love, well at least that's what they say
But it's been so bad, sometimes I need to, need to runaway
I want to ask you, will you run, runaway with me
I'll look after you, oh baby, baby can't you see

Will you run, runaway with me
And leave your world behind
Will you come, come and stay with me
Just you and me until the end of time

Mari Boine,"Eagle man, climbing the skies. 
Red light of evening falls like rain.
Rainbow's my yarn the sky is my loom
I will weave sunsets later on. 

Snow woman, climbing the wind. 
Blue light of winter fills her baskets.
Changing woman, dance on the weather lightening and feather mark her trail

Life lovers, splitting the worlds. 
Healing the broken and the lame. 
Reach out to me, give me your hand
We close the circuits of time 

Angel ranger, stay here by me.
Guide my transmission of energy. 
Oldest religion simple and clear.
Pour out a lesson into our dreams

To take care of the shoes you wear 
With his hammer, nails, and glue

Stop playing games, and wasting my time

We've tried to hide that something still is going on

I still feel you when you're gone
Should I still want you if it's wrong
'Cause though I've tried, baby, my heart won't be
Can't fight what I feel

So no matter what I say,
And no matter what I do
And no matter who I love, I'm always loving you

That just one thing will do when I'm in this mood
And what I'm craving is, you flavor on my lips
So won't you fill me up, 'cause I've waited for this

All day long it's on my mind
There's no way to unwind
Until I get back home, and you put it on

I like my coffee in bed
It only takes one sip to go to my head
I never have to say no sugar or cream, baby
'Cause you know what I need, my black coffee

Now if I seem selfish, it's 'cause I can't resist
Even though I've tried, I still crave I crave that high
And yeah, it's obvious that I can't get enough
So if you serve it hot, I'll say when to stop

Could turn the clocks back, we'd realize
That what we have has gone from worse to bad
It's clear, things are not what they appear
Tell me what happened to butterflies
I used to get them, when you'd walk by
And I'd just have to touch you
To know that you were mine, ain't it funny how time flies

I hate to love you, but I get the feeling
When I'm thinking of you, it's crazy but true
I hate to love you, but I keep believing
It's the way to you, like I do

I keep on choosing to never learn
Can't win for losing so I return
To what I know, and even though
I pray for change, same old story, same old game
There's no denying that we both tried
But what good is trying, if every time
We breakup to makeup
I'm tired of the trend, I feel it coming 'round again

How many times will I say goodbye
How many tears so I have to cry
How many wrongs will it take to make it right
Baby, I wonder why",Hate to Love You,2003
Maria,"If you cut, I will bleed
Bring me down to my knees
Make me feel what I am is never good enough
Can you help me understand
Thought I made you a better man
Guess somehow another way things just change

It seems just like a distant memory
That you used to be good for me
But baby now it's clear

I give, you take
Somehow it's gonna break
I pray for the strength 
I hate to say I know it can't go on this way
I give, you take
I know we're gonna break
And it hurts my soul
I hate to say we can't go on this way

With your words, you pull me in
I always lose I just can't win
And though I see, my heart is blind it gives in every time
You got me on constant repeat I need a cure or a remedy
'cause if I stay there won't be nothing left for me

It seems just like a distant memory
That you used to be good for me
But now it's clear

I give, you take
Somehow it's gonna break
I pray for the strength 
I hate to say I know it can't go on this way
I give, you take
I know we're gonna break
And it hurts my soul
I hate to say we can't go on this way

Now there's nothing left for us to save
And only bitterness remains
What we have is like a house of cards
And it's falling apart
Now it's impossible to get it back with the bridges that you've burned
I guess it's time to walk away

Right where I want to be
With you inside of me
And I can't hardly breath

Constantly you've got me craving, I can't get enough of you
'Cause you're so intoxicating, I'm loving everything you do
Constantly you've got me craving, just another hit of you

I'm surrendering, and you can tell that I'm about to melt
Better than a dream, I lost myself, now I'm in so deep like a breeze
You come over me, if I had the strength to speak
I'd whisper to you softly, that I'm

That every time you do, i get so lonely
I know you know, and you know i know

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Com muito amor, com emoção
Com explosão e gol, gol
Sacudindo a torcida aos 33 minutos
Do segundo tempo
Depois de fazer uma jogada celestial
Em gol, gol
Tabelou, driblou dois zagueiros
Deu um toque driblou o goleiro
Só não entrou com bola e tudo
Porque teve humildade em gol, gol
Foi um gol de classe
Onde ele mostrou sua malícia e sua raça
Foi um gol de anjo

Only had a little taste
But I remember how it felt
And all the phonecalls late at night
Though we tried, we couldn't make it right

When the seasons changed
Everything got colder
Everyone could hear, our illusion crush
It was all we had

[chorus]
So every minute that I've spend with you
Like the winter, is bringing the blues
You and I were like the spring
Brief and beautiful

when we knew we had to let it go
And our love turned in to snow
We never had a chance to begin
Brief and beautiful
So....
Brief and beautiful
So....

[verse]
When flowers bloom in may
I go back to yesterday
When I woke up next to you
I would bring it all back if I could

make it good or bad
I know it is too late
So I'm movin'on
But I won't forget
All that is unsaid

[chorus]

it was so short(?)
It was so sweet
Like every good thing
It's not yours to keep

oh, things fades away
And now its gone

Maria Arredondo,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook when it trips 
And falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night 
Like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more",Sound of Music,2008

You do
",Baby,1968
Maria Bethânia,"Foi assim
Eu tinha alguém
Que comigo morava
Mas tinha um defeito que brigava
Embora com razão
Ou sem razão
Encontrei 
Um dia uma pessoa diferente
Que me tratava carinhosamente
Dizendo resolver minha questão
Mas não
Foi assim
Troquei essa pessoa que eu morava
Por essa criatura que eu julgava
Pudesse compreender todo o meu eu
Mas no fim
Fiquei na mesma coisa em que estava
Porque a criatura que eu sonhava
Não faz aquilo que me prometeu
Não sei se é meu destino
Não sei se é meu azar
Mas tenho que viver brigando
Todos no mundo
Encontram seu par
Por que só eu vivo 
Trocando?
Se deixo de alguém 
Por falta de carinho
Por brigar
E outras coisas mais
Quem aparece
No meu caminho
Tem os defeitos iguais

Se deixo de alguém
Por falta de carinho
Por brigar e outras coisas mais
Quem aparece no meu caminho
Tem os defeitos iguais",Foi Assim,1975
Maria Bethânia,"Chega de tentar, dissimular e disfarçar e esconder
O que não dá mais pra ocultar
E eu não posso mais calar
Já que o brilho desse olhar foi traidor
E entregou o que você tentou conter
O que você não quis desabafar
E me cortou

Chega de temer, chorar, sofrer, sorrir, se dar
E se perder
E se achar
E tudo aquilo que é viver
Eu quero mais é me abrir
E que essa vida entre assim
Como se fosse o sol
Desvirginando a madrugada
Quero sentir a dor dessa manhã

Nascendo, rompendo, rasgando, tomando meu corpo e então
Eu chorando, sofrendo, gostando, adorando, gritando
Feito louca, alucinada e criança
Sentindo o meu amor se derramando
Não dá mais pra segurar
Explode coração
",Explode Coração,1978
Maria Bethânia,"Eu sou a chuva que lança a areia do Saara
Sobre os automóveis de Roma
Eu sou a sereia que dança
A destemida Iara
Água e folha da Amazônia
Eu sou a sombra da voz da matriarca da Roma Negra
Você não me pega
Você nem chega a me ver
Meu som te cega, careta, quem é você?
Que não sentiu o suingue de Henri Salvador
Que não seguiu o Olodum balançando o Pelô
E que não riu com a risada de Andy Warhol
Que não, que não e nem disse que não

Eu sou um preto norte-americano forte
Com um brinco de ouro na orelha
Eu sou a flor da primeira música
A mais velha
A mais nova espada e seu corte
Sou o cheiro dos livros desesperados
Sou Gitá Gogóia
Seu olho me olha mas não me pode alcançar
Não tenho escolha, careta, vou descartar
Quem não rezou a novena de Dona Canô
Quem não seguiu o mendigo Joãozinho Beija-Flor
Quem não amou a elegância sutil de Bobô
Quem não é Recôncavo e nem pode ser reconvexo",Reconvexo,1978
Maria Bethânia,"Terno eterno de Reis
Nagôs e malês

Cantando encantei
Encanto a cantar
Menina me ninei
Sonhos que sonhei
Castelos no ar
Sons dos maculelês

De tudo que há

Cores de toda cor
Carnaval e dor

Maria Bethânia,"Ah, meu amor não vás embora
Vê a vida como chora
Vê que triste esta canção
Ah, eu te peço não te ausentes
Porque a dor que agora sentes
Só se esquece no perdão

Ah, minha amada, me perdoa
Pois embora ainda te doa
A tristeza que causei
Eu te suplico não destruas
Tantas coisas que são tuas
Por um mal que já paguei

Ah, minha amada, se soubesses
Da tristeza que há nas preces
Que a chorar te faço eu
Se tu soubesses um momento
Todo o arrependimento
Como tudo entristeceu

Se tu soubesses como é triste
Eu saber que tu partiste
Sem sequer dizer adeus
Ah, meu amor, tu voltarias
E de novo cairias
A chorar nos braços meus",Apelo,1992
Maria Bethânia,"Como será pois se ardiam fogueiras 
Com olhos de areia quem viu 
Praias, paixões fevereiras 
Não dizem o que Junhos de fumaça é frio 
Onde e quando é genipapo absoluto 
Meu pai, seu tanino, seu mel 
Prensa, esperança, sofrer prazeria 
Promessa, poesia, Mabel

Cantar é mais do que lembrar 
É mais do que ter tido aquilo então 
Mais do que viver do que sonhar 
É ter o coração daquilo

Tudo são trechos que escuto, vêm dela 
Pois minha mãe é minha voz 
Como será que isso era este som 
Que hoje sim, gera sóis, dói em dós 
Aquele que considera
A saudade de uma mera contraluz que vem 
Do que deixou pra trás 
Não, esse só desfaz o signo 
E a rosa também",Genipapo Absoluto,1994
Maria Bethânia,"Hoje eu ouço as canções que você fez pra mim
Não sei por que razão tudo mudou assim
Ficaram as canções e você não ficou
Esqueceu de tanta coisa que um dia me falou
Tanta coisa que somente entre nós dois ficou
Eu acho que você já nem se lembra mais

É tão difícil olhar o mundo e ver
O que ainda existe
Pois sem você meu mundo é diferente
Minha alegria é triste
Quantas vezes você disse que me amava tanto
Quantas vezes eu enxuguei o seu pranto
E agora eu choro só sem ter você aqui

Esqueceu de tanta coisa que um dia me falou
Tanta coisa que somente entre nós dois ficou
Eu acho que você já nem se lembra mais
É tão difícil olhar o mundo e ver
O que ainda existe
Pois sem você meu mundo é diferente
Minha alegria é triste

Quantas vezes você disse que me amava tanto
Quantas vezes eu enxuguei o seu pranto
E agora eu choro só sem ter você aqui",As Canções Que Você Fez Pra Mim,1994
Maria Bethânia,"Não adianta nem tentar me esquecer
Durante muito tempo em sua vida
Eu vou viver

Detalhes tão pequenos de nós dois
São coisas muito grandes pra esquecer
E a toda hora vão estar presentes
Você vai ver

Se um outro cabeludo aparecer na sua rua
E isto lhe trouxer saudades minhas
A culpa é sua

O ronco barulhento do seu carro
A velha calça desbotada ou coisa assim
Imediatamente você vai lembrar de mim

Eu sei que um outro deve estar falando ao seu ouvido
Palavras de amor como eu falei, mas eu duvido!
Duvido que ele tenha tanto amor
E até os erros do meu português ruim
E nessa hora você vai lembrar de mim

A noite envolvida no silêncio
Do seu quarto
Antes de dormir você procura
O meu retrato
Mas da moldura não sou eu quem lhe sorri
Mas você vê o meu sorriso mesmo assim
E tudo isso vai fazer você lembrar de mim

Se alguém tocar seu corpo como eu
Não diga nada
Não vá dizer meu nome sem querer
À pessoa errada

Pensando ter amor nesse momento
Desesperada você tenta até o fim
E até nesse momento você vai
Lembrar de mim

Eu sei que esses detalhes vão sumir
Na longa estrada
Do tempo que transforma todo amor
Em quase nada

Mas ""quase"" também é mais um detalhe
Um grande amor não vai morrer assim
Por isso, de vez em quando você vai
Vai lembrar de mim

Não adianta nem tentar me esquecer
Durante muito tempo em sua vida
Eu vou viver
Não, não adianta nem tentar
Me esquecer

No ganas al intentar el olvidarme 
Durante mucho tiempo en tu vida yo voy a vivir 
Detalles tan pequeños de los dos 
Son cosas muy grandes para olvidar 
Y a toda hora van a estar presentes, ya lo verás 

Si otro hombre apareciera por tu ruta 
Y esto te trajese recuerdos míos, la culpa es tuya 
El ruido enloquecedor de su auto 
Sera la causa obligada o algo así 
Inmediatamente tu vas a acordarte de mi 

Yo se que otro debe estar hablando a tu oído 
Palabras de amor como yo te hable, mas yo dudo 
Yo dudo que el tenga tanto amor 
Y hasta la forma de mi decir 
Y en esa hora tu vas a acordarte de mi 

En la noche envuelta en el silencio de tu cuarto 
Antes de dormir tu buscas mi retrato 
Pero aun cuando no quisieras verme sonreír 
Tu ves mi sonrisa lo mismo así 
Y todo eso va a hacer que tu te acuerdes de mi 

Si alguien tocase tu cuerpo como yo no digas nada 
No vayas a decir mi nombre sin querer 
A la persona errada 
Pensando en el amor de ese momento 
Desesperada intentar llegar al fin 

Y hasta en ese momento tu iras a acordarte de mi 
Yo se que mientras existamos recordaremos 
Y que el tiempo transforma todo amor en casi nada 
Mas casi yo me olvido de un gran detalle 
Un gran amor no va a morir así 
Por eso de vez en cuando tu vas a acordarte de mi",Detalhes,1994
Maria Bethânia,"Eu preciso de você porque tudo que eu pensei
Que pudesse desfrutar da vida sem você não sei
Meu amanhecer é lindo se você comigo está
Tudo é mais bonito no sorriso que voce me dá

Eu não vivo sem você porque tudo que eu andei
Procurando pela vida agora eu sei
Que andei sabendo que em algum lugar te encontraria
Pois você já era meu e eu sabia

Como a abelha necessita de uma flor
Eu preciso de você e desse amor
Como a terra necessita o sol e a chuva
Eu te preciso e não vivo um só minuto sem você

Nem por uma vez amei alguém assim

E é por isso que eu preciso de você",Eu Preciso de Você,1994
Maria Bethânia,"Podem me chamar e me pedir e me rogar
E podem mesmo falar mal, ficar de mal que não faz mal

Podem preparar milhões de festas ao luar
Que eu não vou ir, melhor nem pedir, que eu não vou ir, não quero ir
E também podem me intrigar e até sorrir e até chorar
E podem mesmo imaginar o que melhor lhes parecer

Podem espalhar que estou cansado de viver
E que é uma pena para quem me conheceu
Eu sou mais você e eu

Maria Bethânia,"Meu povo, preste atenção
Na roda que eu te fiz

Quando almoço, não janto
E quando canto é assim

Agora vou divertir
Agora vou começar

Quero ver quem vai ficar
Não é obrigado a me ouvir
Quem não quiser escutar

Quem tem dinheiro no mundo
Quanto mais tem, quer ganhar
E a gente que não tem nada
Fica pior do que está

Deixe o dinheiro do pobre
E roube outro ladrão

Agora vou divertir
Agora vou prosseguir
Quero ver quem vai ficar

Se morre o rico e o pobre
Enterre o rico e eu
Quero ver quem que separa
O pó do rico do meu
Se lá embaixo há igualdade
Aqui em cima há de haver
Quem quer ser mais do que é
Um dia há de sofrer

Agora vou divertir
Agora vou prosseguir
Quero ver quem vai ficar
Quero ver quem vai sair
Não é obrigado a escutar
Quem não quiser me ouvir

Seu moço, tenha cuidado
Com sua exploração
Se não lhe dou de presente
A sua cova no chão
Quero ver quem vai dizer
Quero ver quem vai mentir
Quero ver quem vai negar
Aquilo que eu disse aqui

Agora vou divertir
Agora vou terminar
Quero ver quem vai sair
Quero ver quem vai ficar
Não é obrigado a me ouvir
Quem não quiser escutar

Agora vou terminar
Agora vou discorrer
Quem sabe tudo e diz logo
Fica sem nada a dizer
Quero ver quem vai voltar
Quero ver quem vai fugir
Quero ver quem vai ficar
Quero ver quem vai trair

A roda que eu te fiz
A roda que é do povo

Maria Bethânia,"Olha Maria
Eu bem te queria
Fazer uma presa
Da minha poesia
Mas hoje, Maria
Pra minha surpresa
Pra minha tristeza
Precisas partir

Parte, Maria
Que estás tão bonita
Que estás tão aflita
Pra me abandonar
Sinto, Maria
Que estás de visita
Teu corpo se agita
Querendo dançar

Parte, Maria
Que estás toda nua
Que a lua te chama
Que estás tão mulher
Arde, Maria
Na chama da lua
Maria cigana
Maria maré

Parte cantando
Maria fugindo
Contra a ventania
Brincando, dormindo
Num colo de serra
Num campo vazio
Num leito de rio
Nos braços do mar

Vai, alegria
Que a vida, Maria
Não passa de um dia
Não vou te prender
Corre, Maria
Que a vida não espera
É uma primavera
Não podes perder

Anda, Maria
Pois eu só teria
A minha agonia
Pra te oferecer",Olha,1994
Maria Bethânia,"Quem já passou por essa vida e não viveu,
Pode ser mais mas sabe menos do que eu.
Porque a vida só se dá pra quem se deu, 
Pra quem amou, pra quem chorou, pra quem sofreu. 

Quem nunca curtiu uma paixão 
Nunca vai ter nada, não. 

Não há mal pior do que a descrença,
Mesmo o amor que não compensa 
É melhor que a solidão. 

Abre os teus braços, meu irmão, deixa cair.
Pra que somar se a gente pode dividir. 
Eu francamente já não quero nem saber 
De quem não vai porque tem medo de sofrer.

Ai de quem não rasga o coração,
Esse não vai ter perdão. 
Quem nunca curtiu uma paixão, 
Nunca vai ter nada, não.

Maria Bethânia,"Eu caio de bossa

Um instrumento do seu prazer
Sim, e de tua glória
Pois se é noite de completa escuridão

Provo do favo de teu mel
Cavo a direita claridade do céu
E agarro o sol com a mão
É meio-dia, é meia-noite, é toda hora

Lambe olhos, torce cabelos, feiticeira vamo-nos embora
É meio-dia, é meia-noite, faz zumzum na testa
Na janela, na fresta da telha
Pela escada, pela porta, pela estrada toda a fora

Anima de vida o seio da floresta
O amor empresta a praia deserta zumbe na orelha, concha domar
Ó abelha, boca de mel, carmin, carnuda, vermelha
Ó abelha rainha faz de mim um instrumento do seu prazer

Maria Bethânia,"Sonho meu, sonho meu
Vai buscar que mora longe
Sonho meu
Vai mostrar esta saudade

Sonho meu
Com a sua liberdade
Sonho meu
No meu céu a estrela guia se perdeu

A madrugada fria só me traz melancolia
Sonho meu
Sinto o canto da noite
Na boca do vento

Fazer a dança das flores
No meu pensamento
Traz a pureza de um samba
Sentido, marcado de mágoas de amor

Um samba que mexe o corpo da gente
E o vento vadio embalando a flor
Sonho meu

",Sonho Meu,1999
Maria Bethânia,"E aí eu comecei a cometer loucura
Era um verdadeiro inferno, uma tortura
O que eu sofria por aquele amor
Milhões de diabinhos me martelando
Meu pobre coração que agonizando
Já não podia mais de tanta dor

E aí eu comecei a cantar verso triste
O mesmo verso que até hoje existe
Na boca triste de algum sofredor
Como é que existe alguém
Que ainda tem coragem de dizer
Que os meus versos não contêm mensagem
São palavras frias, sem nenhum valor

Oh! Deus, será que o senhor não está vendo isto
Então por que é que o senhor mandou Cristo
Aqui na Terra semear amor
Quando se tem alguém que ama de verdade
Serve de riso pra humanidade
É um covarde, um fraco, um sonhador

Se é que hoje tudo está tão diferente
Por que não deixa eu mostrar a essa gente
Que ainda existe o verdadeiro amor
Faça ela voltar de novo pra o meu lado
Eu me sujeito a ser sacrificado
Salve seu mundo com a minha dor",Loucura,2001

É cantiga de cigano

Não sei quando é de ninar 
Nem sei quando é de rezar 

Quando eu ouço alguma voz 
Na janela do horizonte 
De alguém cantando por nós

Maria Bethânia,"O arco da velha flecha
Inda é marco na floresta
O arco da velha índia
Vale ainda o que retesa

O arco é croa e roca
Coroa a índia que tece
O arco ainda acontece
Corta o céu numa prece
O arco em forma de boca
Sustenta a oca e a taba
Roca o fim, mas não acaba
E finda sempre afinado

O arco anarco da índia
Narcótico tico avoado
É o arco iris da vida
Em monocordo tornado

O arco da velha índia
E corda vocal insubmissa
Rabeca de uma corda
Que em desacordo atiça
A aldeia contra o futuro
Duro de dar dó
E preguiça

No arco a flecha de fogo
Incendeia o escuro
Parco parceiro do tempo
Toré em estado puro

Parece até que tá pedindo socorro
Como tudo aqui nesse lugar

Só falta ela ser um lar
Não me falta o tempo que passa
Só não dá mais para tanto esperar

E a nuvem a desenhar um coração flechado
Para o chão voltar a se deitar
E a chuva batucar no telhado

Sopra a vida quando as horas mortas
Homens e mulheres vêm sofrer de alegria
Gim, fumaça, dor, microfonia
E ainda me faz ser o que sem ele não seria
E eu quero, quero, é claro que sim
Iluminar o escuro com meu bustiê carmim
Mesmo quando choro
E adivinho que é esse o meu fim

Plena do dom que Deus me deu
Sei que é ele a mim que me ausenta

E o silêncio cava grotas tão profundas
Pois mesmo aí na pedra ainda

What if I want to lose control?
What if I take the blame and become the drug
And dissolve as you swallow?

Covered in your silhouette
Elated for your bitter end
Don't hide the shame from our lips

A burning lust to touch the flame

We've played this role a thousand times
The same old script, just different lies
You disappear without a trace
Concealing the crimes on your face

Beneath all the pleasure, all you are is pain
And you deserve every second of your suffering
But yet I can't stop, crawling to your doorstep
Every time you beckon
I'm self destructing, trust in nothing
Save me

You burn like a cigarette
I took my time to suck you in
So take me out of my head
And spread your ashes on my skin

Against the wall, we fall from grace
The pain we love is taking shape
A burning lust to touch the flame
Over and over again
We’ve played this role a thousand times
The same old script, just different lies
You disappear without a trace
Concealing the crimes on your face (crawl)

Your skin like winter
I felt you shiver
I heard you whisper
But the pills were quicker
I watched you wither
I am the killer

Against the wall we fall from grace

Money, the fame, the boose, the girls

I turned in to a devil, you could see it in my eyes

I couldn't take all the lies I was living with

You're not a husband, not a father, just a pig
And you can't never change all the things that you did!""

You tore me down, wished that I was dead
Said you wanna sleep alone in another bed
But when I push away, you only pull me closer
It's only over when we both wanna say it's over

I helped you up, like I always do
I forgave you for your sins and I carried you through them
No matter how hard we fought, we always knew

diedi fiori agl’altar.

Nell’ora del dolore
perchè, perchè, Signore,  
perchè me ne rimuneri così?

Diedi gioielli della Madonna al manto,
e diedi il canto agli astri, al ciel,
che ne ridean più belli.

Nell’ora del dolor
perchè, perchè, Signor,
ah, perchè me ne rimuneri così?",Act 2. Vissi d'arte [Tosca],2002
Maria Callas,"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle
Que nul ne peut apprivoiser
Et c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle
S'il lui convient de refuser
Rien n'y fait, menace ou prière
L'un parle bien, l'autre se tait
Et c'est l'autre que je préfère
Il n'a rien dit, mais il me plaît
L'amour (× 4)
L'amour est enfant de bohème
Il n'a jamais, jamais, connu de loi
Si tu ne m'aimes pas, je t'aime
Et si je t'aime, prends garde à toi
Prends garde à toi
Si tu ne m'aimes pas, si tu ne m'aimes pas, je t'aime
Prends garde à toi

Prends garde à toi
Mais si je t'aime, si je t'aime, prends garde à toi
L'oiseau que tu croyais surprendre
Battit de l'aile et s'envola
L'amour est loin, tu peux l'attendre
Tu ne l'attends plus, il est là
Tout autour de toi, vite, vite
Il vient, s'en va, puis il revient
Tu crois le tenir, il t'évite
Tu crois l'éviter, il te tient

Version Homme : Mets 
Version Femme : Vite

une robe claire
Voici venir l'été,
Les parfums de la terre
Sont pleins de volupté.
La chambre est trop petite
Pour notre grand amour,
Allons nous en bien vite...
Il parait qu'alentour.

REFRAIN

Chérie, les jardins nous attendent,
Car ils ont besoin d'amoureux,
Que feraient les pauvres rosiers
S'ils n'entendaient plus nos baisers.
Les fleurs, sans qu'on le leur demande
Font des parterres merveilleux,
Et dans tes bras, je suis (mes bras tu es) heureux!
Les oiseaux sont jaloux, ouh ! ouh !
Mais ils chantent pour nous.
nous.

J'emporte des sourires
Pour les petits enfants
Les pigeons vont se dire :
Pourquoi tardent-ils tant ?
La douce coccinelle,
Notre ami de toujours,
Viendra sur ton ombrelle
Protéger nos amours...

Et, pendant la semaine,
Vous tous qui m'écoutez,
Fredonnez ma rengaine
Sans vous impatienter.
Car voici les dimanches,
Le ciel pur, le beau temps,
Vous irez sous les branches
Murmurer tendrement:

Maria Cecília,"Pode ser, que um dia eu esqueça
O seu ato inconsequente
Pode ser, que eu enlouqueça
E te carregue pra sempre
O sonho se quebrou
Junto com o vidro
Do porta-retrato
Que jogou na parede

Marcas pelo chão, desse furacão
Que me fez voltar atrás
Várias vezes
Desistir de nós
Já ouvi demais
Abaixa o tom de voz
Quero a minha paz

Só um novo amor
É capaz de juntar meus cacos
É chuva de medo
Por todos os lados
Só um novo amor
É capaz de reacender o sol

Só um novo amor
É capaz de juntar meus cacos
É chuva de medo
Por todos os lados
Só um novo amor
É capaz de reacender o sol
Que você, apagou",Ato Inconsequente,
Maria Cecília,"Deixa eu fazer outra vez
Te amar no chão da sala
Do jeito que a gente fez
Eu quero por toda casa
Deixa eu fazer outra vez
Você 'tá virando vício

'To te querendo de novo
Me queimar no seu fogo
E perder meu juízo
Quando o coração dispara
Se apega e se amarra, só pensa em amor

Maria Cecília,"Me pegou desprevenido
E foi certeira a flecha do cupido
Tão de repente chegou devastando tudo
Bagunçou meu mundo
Perdi o chão quando me rendeu
E hoje sou um prisioneiro, olha no que deu
As nossas brincadeiras de amizade, o amor nasceu
Me perco todo nesses olhos verdes
Seus lábios são o poço pra matar minha sede
Me dê a mão, me deixa te levar
Te levar pra voar

Voar bem alto pra sonhar
Pois você já virou o amor
Se joga e deixa acontecer

Perdi o chão quando me rendeu
E hoje sou um prisioneiro, olha no que deu
As nossas brincadeiras de amizade, o amor nasceu
Me perco todo nesses olhos verdes

Maria Cecília,"Já é madrugada você foi embora
E eu aqui, lendo suas cartas
E tentando traduzir
O que escreveu não deu pra entender, direito

To num vôo sem asas, caindo
Que pena não do seu lado, mais indo
Te buscar amor, te buscar amor

Noites escuras, falo com a lua
Peço a ela iluminar e te trazer
Noites escuras, falo com a lua
Só ela que sabe o quanto eu amo você

Eu te amo, eu te quero, eu preciso
Saudade de você chegar me abracando, me beijando
Respirando meu ar
Já faz mais de um mês que você se foi
São lembranças que eu tenho de nós dois

Quando eu fecho os meus olhos eu tento te encontrar
No pensamento ou em qualquer lugar
Quando eu fecho os meus olhos eu morro de saudade
De saudade de te amar

Maria Cecília,"Veste um sorriso no seu rosto e vem
Acende um brilho no olhar e vem
Essa tristeza não combina com a sua beleza, não

Constrói sua casa no meu coração
Pra não ter medo de abrir o portão
Tente me aceitar
Sem medo de errar

Se pra você amar é o mesmo que correr perigo
Vem que eu assumo o risco
Se amor de verdade é sonho
Vem sonhar comigo
Serei seu ombro amigo
Serei o seu abrigo",Seu Abrigo,2015
Maria Cecília,"Uma gota não é chuva
Uma pétala não é uma flor
Grão de areia não é praia
E paixão não é amor

Tá difícil explicar o sentimento tão voraz
Tenta, se não encontrar palavras, inventa
Tá tão fácil de me convencer
Só preciso de ouvir dizer
Se quiser eu posso te ajudar

Falar o primeiro eu te amo
Respira fundo e diz
Eu te amo
Não pode ser difícil assim, se já se entregou pra mim
Agora só falta dizer, um eu te amo

Falar o primeiro eu te amo

Maria Cecília,"Quando te vi eu já gostei de você
Obedeci, meu coração quis viver
Já vi a gente juntos
Foi um querer, uma vontade no olhar

Tem só um mês já decidi, vou ficar
'To dentro do seu mundo
A minha vida não existe mais
Agora é a nossa

E todo tempo a gente se completa
O nosso amor é massa
Todos os dias vou sorrir com você
Cada segundo vamos fazer valer

Todos os dias quando amanhecer
Minha rotina vai ser amar você
Amar porque amar é viver
Amar porque amar é viver

A minha vida não existe mais

Maria Cecília,"Eu percebi que mentia quando dizia que me amava
Enquanto tanto te queria, você só me enrolava
Trapaceou, me enganou, você só me iludiu

Maria Cole,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In,1954
Maria Cole,"I'm Mrs. Nat King Cole
And what a joy it's been
To be asked by Brian McKnight
To remember some of the christmas' with my husband
We were married 17 years and 15 of those years
We spent every Christmas the same way
It was God, love, and our children

And our closest friends
It was always the same menu
He got up at 5 o'clock in the morning
And with me and my children
We opened gifts

We have really, so much to remember in our family
I hope that some of you do too
I hope you will remember the love first
And then your family
It is just so important

When you don't know what to do?
Read a book?
Play a game?

Whadda you say if I tell you
How to keep from feeling blue?
My advice is good to take,
And it's easier to do!

When you're all alone, any old night,

It's a man every time it's a man
Who brings the heartaches and takes all the joy 
It's a man every time it's a man

While she has to suffer as long as she lives
Then who's to blame if her head hangs in shame

Pero no me pidas que te crea mas
Cuando llegas tarde a casa no tienes porque inventar
Pues tu ropa huele a leña de otro hogar

Tomame o dejame
Si no estoy despierta dejame soñar
No me beses en la frente
Sabes que te oí llegar why tu beso abe a culpabilidad

Tu me admiras porque callo why miro al cielo
Porque no mevez llorar
Why te sientes cada dia mas pequeño
Why esquivas tu mirada en un lugar

Tomame o dejame
Ni te espío ni te quito libertad
Pero si dejas el lecho
Si me vaz a abandonar also antes de que empiese a clarear

Tu me admiras poque callo why miro al cielo
Porque no me vez llorar
Why te sientes cada dia me pequeño
Why esquivas tu mirada en un lugar

Why si vuelves trai contigo la verdad
Trai viva la mirada
Trai contigo mi rival si es mejor que yo podre entonces llorar
