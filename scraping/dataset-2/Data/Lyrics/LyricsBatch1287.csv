Yann Tiersen,"It's hard
Hard, not to sit on your hands 
Burrow your head in the sand
Hard, not to make other plans
And claim that you've done all you can
All alone
And life
Must go on

It's hard
Hard, to stand up for what's right
And bring home the bacon each night 
Hard, not to break down and cry
When every ideal that you tried
Has been wrong
But you must
Carry on

It's hard
But you know it's worth the fight
Cause you know you've got the truth on your side
When the accusations fly
Hold tight
Don't be afraid of what they'll say	
Who cares what cowards think? Anyway 
They will understand some day
Some day

It's hard
Hard, when you're here all alone
And everyone else's gone home
Harder to know right from wrong
When all objectivity's gone
And it's gone
But you still
Carry on

'Cause you
You are the only one left
And you've got to clean up this mess
You know you'll end up like the rest
Bitter and twisted, unless 
You stay strong
And you
Carry on

It's hard
Hard, when you're here all alone
And everyone else's gone home
Harder to know right from wrong
When all objectivity's gone
And it's gone
But you still
Carry on

It's hard
Hard, when you're here all alone
And everyone else's gone home
Harder to know right from wrong
When all objectivity's gone
And it's gone
But you still
Carry on",Les Jours Tristes,2001
Yann Tiersen,"Another day to live
Another way to go
Nobody's in this room
Nobody's here for now

Wake up early
I know it's too late
Too late for the parade
Look at my feet

Moving slowly
I'm afraid it's over
Naked
A bit sleepy

In
A single room
I
Open the door

Call up
Call up the lift
Sometimes I fill my skin
Sometimes I hear a voice

""Please try to be friendly""
But I'm too old inside
I'm so jealous
But proud to be

An ordinary girl
I'd like to talk
But you know I hate
All ordinary words

Naked
A bit sleepy
In
A single room

I open the door
Call up
Call up the lift",La Parade,2001
Yann Tiersen,"Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long
You'll always be in my heart

Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you

What can I do
What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say we're through
You'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same

Maybe I'm right
Maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you",Guilty,2001
Yann Tiersen,"Si tu n'étais pas là
Comment pourrais-je vivre?
Je ne connaîtrais pas
Ce bonheur qui m'enivre
Quand je suis dans tes bras
Mon cœur joyeux se livre
Comment pourrais-je vivre
Si tu n'étais pas là?

J'ai parfois malgré moi
Des craintes folles
Même un soir sans te voir
Je me désole
Tu reviens et soudain
Plus de tristesse
Car tu sais l'effacer
D'une caresse

Si tu n'étais pas là
Comment pourrais-je vivre?
Je ne connaîtrais pas
Ce bonheur qui m'enivre
Quand je suis dans tes bras
Mon cœur joyeux se livre
Comment pourrais-je vivre
Si tu n'étais pas là?

Les projets que je fais
Presque sans trêve
Les beaux soirs où l'espoir
Berce mon rêve
Nos tourments si charmants
Bien loin du monde
C'est à toi que je dois
Ces joies profondes

Si tu n'étais pas là
Comment pourrais-je vivre?
Je ne connaîtrais pas

Mon cœur joyeux se livre
Comment pourrais-je vivre
Si tu n'étais pas là?",Si tu n'étais pas là (Fréhel),2001
Yann Tiersen,"De tes amants bien revenus 
Dans tes beaux habits neufs 
Tu devrais bien quand même 
Voir l'entrée ou alors 
Tu n'a sans doute rien compris 
Même si t'a quand même tout détruit 
Dans le pavillon nord 
Que t'avais redouté 
La grande sortie offerte 
Que tu m'avais refusée 
On allait se le dire 
Qu'on n'était pas bien là 
Et aller bien au fond 
Et revenir encore 
Sans jamais dépasser 
La porte et le corridor 
Do bâtiment d'ici 
Son allure extérieure 
Quand tu chialais tu faisais moins peur 
Comme si tu effaçais tous mes erreurs 
Et j'imaginais bien 
Ça ne tenait à presque rien 
On aurait pu faire face 
À ce qu'on avait vu 
Le jour de l'ouverture 
De notre grande surface 
On aurait dû s'achever 
Pour ne pas avoir à en pleurer 
Se retrouver dehors 
Sans doute elles seront là 
Peut-être sortie des salles 
En face en plein milieu 
Pour enfin se préparer 
Il suffisait d'why croire 
À nos belles retrouvailles..

Yann Tiersen,"Do you recognize me
Here on this sleeper train

Together throught the fields

Yann Tiersen,"I walked into the street
To see myself looking back at me
So many eyes

Just wanna be touched in the right way

Like everybody else
Like everybody else
A secret place in a lover's arms
I know a place not far from here

In each others' arms
And for this cause we will light the fire

It's growing (groping)
Push it down with one hand
The other fanning the flames

To a rage
Of love and hate
And of betrayal
In the life of a man who's blown his last chance
Some secrets are too great to keep to yourself
For it jumps and tickles[?] inside my skin

Scratching like a dog in ???

Yann Tiersen,"Je nous vois tous assis devant
Mais le front baissé les épaules en dedans
Avec dans les yeux toutes les larmes d'avant
Et ça crève et ça crève d'ennui, devant

Je nous vois tout transis dedans
Et le froid qui s'échappe et qu'on sent devant
Immobiles comme au lit, dormant
Et la vie qui s'éteint doucement

Je nous rêve tous debout devant
Descendant dans la ville, marchant
Tu le prends, tu le vois dedans
Dans le cœur, la colère des gens

Là debout et la rade devant
Là devant, le vent d'ouest entrant
Tu le prends, tu le vois maintenant
Dans le cœur, la colère des gens

Là debout et la mer devant
Là devant et la vague venant

Falling deep inside of me
Drowning in my soul

through the dark, can you hear me calling
Holding on when I'm dreaming
Love is all, Love is all
Thundering on high
Love was all I knew before I fell

Are echoing inside myself

Que en mis sueño
La veo junto a mi

Siento
Que me haces tanta falta
Sin tu mirada
Yo desapareci

Yannick,"Avec des si, on pourrait refaire le monde
Ouais ou on pourrait le parfaire
Revenir en arrière et le parfaire
Pourquoi je peux pas le faire
Avec des si je serai astronaute ou peut-être autre chose
La seule chose de sure, c'est que tous les jours je verrai la vie en rose
Avec des si y'aurait un job pour les vieux comme pour les jeunes
Avec des si je ferai de longues études mais que pour le fun
Avec des si il n y'aurait pas de famine, pas de conflit sans fin
C'est au sens figuré qu'un gosse pourrait mourir de faim
Avec des si il n y'aurait pas de divorces, marié je le serai
Le sida n'existerait pas et sans pote-ca on le ferait
La vie en rose on pourrait voir comment c'est
Si tu me donnais une chance bébé pour tout recommencer

Refrain
Tout serait différent
Je verrai la vie autrement
Des joies, mes yeux brilleraient à chaque instant
Avec des si 

Si l'argent ne faisait pas le bonheur mais voyons on le saurait
Heureux on le serait, la guerre pourquoi les hommes la feraient
Moins de drames, de faits d'hiver, de mères en larmes il y'aurait
Honnête, même en temps de crise mes frères le resteraient
Si j'allais plus souvent en cours je ferais plaisir à mes parents
Bosser dans un bureau peut être que j'trouverais ca marrant
Je suis ni médecin, ni avocat je gagne ma vie autrement
Si j'rappe, j'fais tous ces efforts, t'sais qu'j't'aime si fort maman
Avec des si j'ferais peut être autre chose, non non non rapper c'est ca que j'aime
Et tu me dirais encore Yannick c'est toi que j'aime
Toutes nos erreurs on pourrait les effacer
Si tu me donnais une nouvelle chance, on pourrait tout recommencer

Avec des si c'est sur on serait encore ensemble
Non non tu n'voulais plus tu m'l'as dit il me semble 
Tu crois vraiment que c'est de ma faute si on est plus ensemble
Tu remets tous sur mon dos, ca ca te ressemble
Ca serait fini aujourd'hui si tu m'avais fait confiance
Si tu ne m'avais pas menti et inspirer la méfiance
Arrête
Tout est fini, dis moi pourquoi je ferai semblant
Je serai pas déçu à ce point si je n't'aimais pas vraiment
Si tu m'aimais je l'aurai su tu me l'aurais dit non
Je te l'ai dit à ma manière j'ai cru que tu l'avais compris
La vie en rose comme Edith, on pourrait voir comment c'est
Si tu me donnais une nouvelle chance on pourrait tout recommencer

On ne dirait plus tant pis c'est ainsi

De toutes les femmes que je connais, que j'ai connu c'était la number one
Dans mon coeur pour elle à tout jamais durera la flamme
J'ai mis 20 piges à le reconnaitre
Et pour lui rendre hommage, des rimes j'en écris des kilomètres
C'est la femme qui m'a mis au monde
La femme pour qui mon coeur bat à chaque seconde
C'est pour elle que les rimes en nombre
Coulent de ma plume, sur la feuille abondent
C'est elle qui me réconfortera sur quand la peine m'envahit
Quand les soucis minent mon moral, quand le ciel me trahit 
Quand justement les cieux s'acharnent sur moi
Quand dans l'malheur j'me noie, provoque en moi l'émoi
Quand je vois du noir, que de mes yeux les larmes coulent
Quand tout s'écroule, que l'existence me saoule
Quand sous la pression, les soucis, les dettes je croule
Pour continuer à vivre me donnent la chair de poule

Où on s'dit tout et n'importe quoi, des trucs qu'on pense même pas
Bête et méchant dur comme fer si on t'connait pas 
Elle est tout pour moi, heureux j'le suis, quand l'bonheur ses yeux rayonnent
Dans mon coeur la joie y est aussi
Elle est tout pour moi, c'est grâce à elle que je suis celui qu'aujourd'hui je suis 
Où je l'en remercie, sans elle j'aurai été sans doute et sûr
A la merci d'l'influence malsaine du quartier, où je la remercie
Si aujourd'hui je ne suis pas un bandit
Malgré l'environnement  dans lequel j'ai grandi
Si malgré les soucis je raisonne comme Gandhi
C'est grâce à elle et pour elle que le MIC je brandie
Car elle est tout pour moi et le sera toute ma vie

Celle qui de mon chagrin sera le sérum
Celle qui d'bonheur me donnera un maximum

D'être guidé par ses sentiments, c'est mieux,
Ça c'est l'infiniment, on fuit au fond de nous on a tous des remords
Plein d'choses qu'on aurait du faire parfois on se remémore,
Combien de filles n'ont pas su à quel point je les ai aimées,
P't'être qu'aujourd'hui avec une autre je serai marié
Mais j'ai pas tenté ma chance ni en amour ni au jeu,
J'm'en veux si je l'avais fais j'serais millionnaire ou heureux,
Je l'serai un jour si Dieu veut, je sais que le meilleur reste à venir,

Long ago when I was a little boy
Didn't know where Jamaica was
Spent my time with a racket as a toy
And Arthur was my wizzard of Oz
Then this music came with the wind
I could feel it moving right inside
I started to hit the ball in rythm
And I learned oh I learned
How to dance on the court

Yannick Noah,"Until the philosophy which hold one race superior 
And another 
Inferior 
Is finally 
And permanently 
Discredited 
And abandoned
Everywhere is war
Me say war. 

That until there no longer 
First class and second class citizens of any nation 
Until the colour of a man's skin 
Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes
Me say war. 

That until the basic human rights 
Are equally guaranteed to all, 
Without regard to race
Dis a war. 

That until that day 
The dream of lasting peace, 
World citizenship 
Rule of international morality 
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued, 
But never attained
Now everywhere is war, war. 

And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes 
That hold our brothers in Angola, 
In Mozambique, 
South Africa 
Sub-human bondage 
Have been toppled, 
Utterly destroyed
Well, everywhere is war 
Me say war. 

War in the east, 
War in the west, 
War up north, 
War down south
War, war
Rumours of war. 
And until that day, 
The African continent 
Will not know peace, 
We Africans will fight, we find it necessary
And we know we shall win 
As we are confident 
In the victory

Cette urgence qui me pousse en avant

Yannick Rieu,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2006
Yannick Rieu,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

Fast money on a roll,
Then I think you be mistaken.

Got more that I'm needing,
It's not like that at all,

Please tell me and I will go,
I'm not gonna waste your time,
Please tell me if you want to be mine.

Got a room full of clothes  so?
Got a house that I stay  so?

Got a box full of shoes  so?
Got a brand new phone  so?
Got the studio booked  so?
I ainÂ´t got you. 

Now you know what I'm about,
And the streets that I come from,
Unreasonable doubt,
Don't tell me that you have none.

On top of the world,
Like nothing's missing,
Never thought I need a girl,
But then I found myself wishing,

If I'm not what your looking for,
Please tell me and I will go,
I'm not gonna waste your time,
Please tell me if you want to be mine.

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Der Akku blinkt, er ist bald leer.
Und mein Mund schmeckt nach Kabelbrand,
3 Minuten dauern wieder mal 5 Tage lang.
Und dieses Ding in meiner Hand schreit mich an,
Wie wird dafür ein Krieg und irgendwo da oben explodiert ein Satellit.

Hallo, kann mich irgend jemand hörn?

Die Du sagst, durch den Äther jagst
Kommen nicht wirklich an
Doch die Drähte glühn.
Dieser Apparat rechnet digital
Irgendeine Zahl und nimmt ein Kopfgefühl.
Ich kann Dich sehn und hörn, sogar mit 3D Effekt
So viele Farben, alles wirkt so Lebensecht.
Doch wir reden schlecht, irgendwas fehlt
Es wär so einfach, Dich in den Arm zu nehmen.

Then escape to Havana with Assata I do what I gotta
Planes get shot down in Cuban air space over the water
I got insight it's a clear case of reading your aura
Man what you got for us as my Black men stand in line like a chorus
Makin' these MC's our sons like Horus
I'm always taking shots like a Japanese tourist, get the picture?
Flyer than Keyser Soze and no exposure

I'm sippin' wishing well water imported from Pluto
That's why my eyes is glassy, so ain't got to ask me
The interplanetary Illuminati move your body
I trekked the stars first, so fuck Kirk and Scotty
I threw basement parties on the Mothership
Now I'm on planet Earth on some other shit
Many 'habitants of this world be strivin and struggling
Tryin to eat food and keep the rights to they publishing, huh
Ghetto red hot, man that shit is like bubbling
Can't get no peace 'cause the Beast keep troubling
Youth, they oppose and the blows they be doubling
Nike heads is trife and the shots, they be thundering
Ways and customs don't make any sense
They be givin' me stress and they test my maintenance
Use the sand and the Ummah as my sustenance
No, this style will never lack, melanin's my evidence

In order to effective, with your words you must be selective
'Cause showin' and provin' is the Prime Directive
Movin those who are outdated with vernaculated thought, so
Every time I take a turn MC's take a loss
My point across, I gotta get to where I want to be
As the wickedest public speaker since '73
Or '74, which was the year I first touched ground
As the physical manifestation of sight and sound
So gather 'round, to hear the profound brown vomiter
Absorb the sonic energy manifestin' through your monitor

MC's is high on they supply, sounds like they takin' drugs
Y'all trippin' like mescalin and killin' the feeling like penicillin
Switchin' to Lionel Rich' and dancin' on the ceilin'
Go ahead and be a heroin, your own mind
Fuck your internet, coke is it when you on line
Smokin dirty weed, ignorin' the medicinal herbals
So we in your ass like you was Richard Gere or we was gerbils
You get stepped on like crack vials by ghetto children, plus
Swept under the rug, we turnin' niggas into dust
You done came out of the earth, what your life worth?
When you get left with what you had on the day of your birth

Ha, yo, it's the super scientifical, high-powered prolifical
Lyrically a miracle, mentally I'm physical
Massively I'm critical, verbally invincible
These kids wanna battle but the material's pitiful
The only original, wicked individual
Whenever I rhyme, I break it down into syllables
Simply because it's coming straight out of Brooklyn
It sounds so out of sight I got the blind people lookin'
It's Mr. Man the act, boy what? You get stolen
I'll cut your ass in half and leave you with a semicolon

We cold-crushin' MCs that's gold-rushin' for the cheese
They see a flash in the pan waitin' for royalties

But kings and queens get overthrown when they grab the microphone
Shootin' videos in homes that they know they'll never own
I guess they cannot work alone, they forever with crew
L sparking, steady barking 'bout the wildness they do
Posin' in photographs shot at complimentary angles
Be playin Mr. Tuffy when they feminine like bangles
Practices is fraudulent, fallacies record to tape
Step in my zone, your spot'll get blown like Watergate

Wait, my blastin' rate is past a state of rappers who procrastinate
Mr. Man is great, so every time I rhyme, I fascinate
Masses hate to have to wait for me to unload
So I flip into my mode and rhyme long like a road
See, I drop the greats like clumsy waiters drop plates
I got rhymes by the crates to erase the duplicates
'Cause, I blow wack rappers out like afros
My shit is so phat it be stretchin' my asshole
But huh, that's not the point because I'm better than most
I make MCs wonder like bread but then, bread gets toast
It's like that, Mr. Man, Mos Def, and Kweli
Represent for every single real MC, you don't stop
(Yo, yo, yo, this is the mighty Mos Def)

'Cause I like the way we kick it 
And I don't want this night to ever end 
Said I only wanna be with you 
I was just thinking that...

Tell you what's in my heart 
Tell me what's on your mind 
Boy I know you're feeling me 
'Cause I can see it in your eyes 
I've been digging you for a while 
And I really wanna try 
To make this forever tonight 
And I hope that you can truly see what it is that you mean to me 
We ain't gotta rush 
Let's take it slow 
Boy I just want you to know... 

When it's only right 
Do you feel like 
There's no place you'd rather be?
And it so obvious 
The two of us 
Go together so I was just thinking...

Just thinking that
Maybe we should be a little more than friends 
'Cause I like the way we kick it 
And I don't want this night to ever end

Yasmeen,"We've been closer than lovers, Better
Than friends have ever been
And When I think about it I can't say
When this happened, oh, baby!

Your love and your kiss is, all I desire
One look into you eyes and I feel the fire
And it warms my heart and heals my soul
Always, always

[Chorus]
And you don't have to worry, you don't
Have to cry
You won't have to look for another
And don't be afraid to put love on the line
Cause you'll never find disappointment this time

I spend my nights in sorrow wondering
When the light will shine through
The clouds
Then your love comes with no
Questions and erases all my doubt

Every step, every breath's taking me
Higher, the brightest of angels must
Have conspired to
Cross our paths for a love that lasts
Always, always

[Chorus]

And when I look in your eyes,
I see a world where we share our dreams together

My kiss will be waiting, my heart will
Keep beating for you - forever

So you don't have to worry

Don't cry cry baby, you won't have to look for another

Whoa 
And don't be afraid (don't be afraid) to put love on the line
Cause you'll never find disappointment

Y me fue imposible de mi mente arrancarte
Era tan hermosa, perfecta, buena amante
Que no dudé un minuto con ella enredarme
Era obsesionante ver su cuerpo sobre el mío
Respirando el mismo aire
Que aún no llenaba este vacío sin final

Estuve con otra y me quedó la soledad
Y yo la hice mía y en ella te veía
Que absurdo y que tonto pensar
Que con otro cuerpo te iba a olvidar

Aún lloro tu partida como un niño abandonado
Han sido noches frías buscándote en mi cuarto
Y no encuentro más que a un alma hecha pedazos

Quiero abrigarme en tu piel
Y contigo amanecer de nuevo

I'm through with all the crying

Let's say goodbye and walk it out

'Cause I just can't seem to find enough
I think this is the end of us

Let's not fake this any longer now
We should let go, turn back, walk away and
Leave this all behind

Naar een bank aan het water
Duizend schepen gaan voorbij
En toch word het maar niet later
En je weet dat ze gek is
Want daarom zit je naast haar
En ze geeft je pepermuntjes
Want ze geeft je graag iets tastbaars
En net als je haar wilt zeggen
Ik kan jou geen liefde geven
Komt heel de stad tot leven
En hoor je meeuwen schreeuwen
Je hebt steeds van haar gehouden
En je wilt wel met haar mee gaan
Samen naar de overkant
En je moet haar wel vertrouwen
Want zij houd al jou gedachten in haar hand

En Jezus was een visser
Die 't water zo vertrouwde
Dat hij zomaar over zee liep
Omdat hij had leren houden
Van de golven en de branding
Waarin niemand kan verdrinken
Hij zei ""Als men blijft geloven,
kan de zwaarste steen niet zinken.""
Maar de hemel ging pas open
Toen zijn lichaam was gebroken
En hoe hij heeft geleden
Weet alleen die visser
aan het kruis...
En je wilt wel met hem mee gaan
Samen naar de overkant
En je moet hem wel vertrouwen
Want hij houd al jou gedachten in zijn hand

Je onthoud waar ze naar kijkt
Als herrinering voor later
En het zonlicht lijkt wel honing
Waaraan kinderen zich tegoed doen
En het grasveld ligt bezaaid
Met wat de mensen zoal weg doen
In de goot liggen de helden
Met ene glimlach om hun lippen
En de meeuwen in de lucht
Lijken net verdwaalde stippen

En je wilt wel met haar mee gaan
Samen naar de overkant
En je moet haar wel vertrouwen

Yasmin,"Listen, yeah
A lifetime of dreaming, visualizing paradise
I woke up, rolled over and told my girl we're leaving
It's time to sacrifice a lot
'Cause you ain't happy with your job
And round here it's like nothin' seems appealing
So let me know you feel the same
Throw your life into a case and we'll depart from Victoria this evening
And then embark upon a path of rediscovery
Searching for the fruits from the lost garden of Eden
I'm wondering if I runaway and came back another day,
Then would the young men who roll with metal put the guns away
And would the devil have took charge or would the slum be safe
I pray the latter's right for everybody's mumsy's sake.
And if I disappear for years and reappear
Would my natural intuition still be crystal clear?
Or would I have lost clarity?
In this trivial pursuit we're walking through so casually

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.

We share a last cigarette, then walk into the station
Purchase two tickets to an alien destination
Board the train and witness pain on all the faces of multi-cultural races
But not me and my girl we're breaking free
Like an escapist, 'cause we need to escape this
And I for one have got my mind made up,
Even if where we stay is make-shift
I can't remain in this domain of semi ape shit, because all I see is hatred
I wonder if I disappeared how many men would miss me
Or would they all forget like I erased my name from history?
I'm still trying yet to make a break within the chain of pain and misery
And vanish off the planet like a mystery.
And if I did return and things were the same or worse?
You'd see the gear stick shift and
Then the I would reverse and I'd be straight back on my travels
Burning rubber over gravel 'til we see the English Channel

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.

As the carriage pulls away,
I pull my lady closer and I tell her she's okay
'Cause if we never broke the barricades today we'd always be afraid
And left to feel threatened in this dark and deadly maze
But now I've come of age,
And as the train starts enterin' suburbia a smile comes across my face
The unwinding of eternal rage,
That was locked up inside just like my mates behind prison gates
If I could runaway and come back another day,
I'd let the song play, on the summer's longest day.
Kick back and just enjoy the raves,
With a lager and a spliff to blaze.
If I ever contemplate returning to this crazy place
I'd leave it long enough so they don't recognize my face
I'd let the song play, on the summer's longest day
While I roll upon the roads along the motorway

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.",Runaway,2010

But light one candle for the wisdom to know
When the peacemaker's time is at hand

And light one candle for those who are suffering

Light one candle for all we believe in
That anger not tear us apart
And light one candle to find us together
With peace as the song in our hearts

Don't let the light go out!

That we keep it alive in that flame?
What's the commitment to those who have died
That we cry out they've not died in vain?
We have come this far always believing
That justice would somehow prevail
This is the burden, this is the promise
This is why we will not fail!

Spanish eyes and soft brown curls

Come to me

I believe I'm in the power of st. Lazarus
And he holds me in his sight

But they'll last for a long summer night

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",2001
Yasuko Agawa,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,2001
Yasuko Agawa,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2001
Yasuko Agawa,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001
Yasuko Agawa,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,2001
Yasuko Agawa,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,2001
Yasuko Agawa,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay,2001
Yasuko Agawa,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2008
Yasuko Agawa,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2008
Yasuko Agawa,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2008

Wit the matching rims on it, man that bitch so clean
Gotta skittle Drop Jag and a fruity Chevelle
If I drop the top back, bubble kush you goin' smell
Every flip I cop another whip
Every trap I cop another chain
Every play I cop another tool

Packed up her suitcase started to run 
Looking for someone looking for none 
Pack up and drive away 

It was her birthday Tuesday morning 
Realization gradually dawning 
A man in a gray suit whispered 'I'm calling' 
Pack up and drive away 

Woman of thirty, husband and kids chained like a dog she had to rid 
No point in coping off came the lid 
Pack up and drive away 

Three thousand miles of honesty dreaming 
Perfect imagery is a gleaming 
No more shattered clouds were deeming 
Pack up and drive away

In her heart it wasn't easy 
Mumbled words and feeling dizzy
Reasons fight against excuses driving slower she was losing 
Dream was stirring only dozing 
Eyelids awaken to the daydream 
Just an illusion broken sunshine

Well I was, still on a buzz
In the back of the van
With my head in my hands

If only my brother could be here now
He'd get me out he'd sort me out alright
I knew I should have stayed at home tonight

Locked in the cell, feeling unwell
I talked to a man,
He said it's better to tell
Who sold you the blow,
Well it was no one I know

If only you'd tell us we'd let you go
We'll make it up for you my son,
So tell us what you know,
We'll make you wish you'd stayed at home tonight

She knows what I've done
Just tell them the true,
You know where he's from,
You've blackened our name,
Well you, you should be ashamed

He'd breakdown and he'd throw you out for sure,

Yazoo,"If I wait for just a second more, 
I know I'll forget what I came here for, 
My head was so full of things to say, 
But as I open my lips all my words slip away 
And anyway, 
I can't believe you want to turn the page, 
And move your life onto another stage, 
You can change the chapter you can change the book, 
But the story remains the same if you'd take a look. 

[Chorus:]
For the times we've had I don't want to be, a page in your diary babe, 
For the good, the bad I don't want to see, a page in your diary babe, 
For the happy, the sad, I don't want to be another page in your diary. 

Perhaps if I held you I could win again, 
I could take your hands we'd talk and maybe then, 
That look in your eyes I always recognize, 
Would tell me everything is gonna be fine, 
You're gonna be mine 
For a long time

Yazoo,"When he moves I watch him from behind 
He turns and laughter flickers in his eyes 
Intent and direct when he speaks, I watch his lips 
And when he drives I love to watch his hand 
White and smooth almost feminine, almost American, I have to watch him.

[Chorus:]
In his face age descends on youth, exaggeration on the truth 
He caught me looking then but soon his eyes forgot 
And everything he seems to do reflects just another shade of blue 
I saw him searching into you and ached a while

I watch his lips caress the glass, 
His fingers stroke its stem and pass 
To lift a cigarette at last, he dries his eyes 
From a shadow by the stair 
I watch as he weeps unaware 
That I'm in awe of his despair, but I am there

Yazoo,"Woman of thirty seeing the sun 
Packed up her suitcase started to run 
Looking for someone looking for none 
Pack up and drive away 

It was her birthday Tuesday morning 
Realization gradually dawning 
A man in a gray suit whispered 'I'm calling' 
Pack up and drive away 

Woman of thirty, husband and kids chained like a dog she had to rid 
No point in coping off came the lid 
Pack up and drive away 

Three thousand miles of honesty dreaming 
Perfect imagery is a gleaming 
No more shattered clouds were deeming 
Pack up and drive away

In her heart it wasn't easy 
Mumbled words and feeling dizzy
Reasons fight against excuses driving slower she was losing 
Dream was stirring only dozing 
Eyelids awaken to the daydream 
Just an illusion broken sunshine 
Woman of thirty there's no choice 
I can't help our helpless voice",Tuesday,1999

Said think about it please
'Cos I love you and I need you
And I should have thought of that before I did you wrong

Heartache, heartache yeah
When I saw his face I could see how bad I'd let him down
Cheating when he was working hard, I just had to mess around
I knew from the start he ain't got much money
I should have stayed content with all that good sweet honey
He's a good strong man and I love him so
so how on earth can I let him go

[Chorus]

And now it's midnight it's raining outside
And I'm soaking wet, still looking for that man of mine
And I ain't found him yet

But nothing can replace all of those wasted years
In all of this I tell you I have learnt
Playing with fire gets you burnt
And I'm still burning

Gentle hate within the love you bought.

There beneath your wall
Wind cries from every angle
Dead leaves left to wait for fall.

My goals are out of sight
And nothing warms the night.
I close my eyes

Bears the scars that never faded

Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell momma I'ma quit, but I love cash (ayy)

I'ma just get it and get it again
Come ups I split with my friends, ayy
Twenty's them twenty's them twinny twin twin
Tryna flip Ford to a Benz
I'ma get it, I'ma get it regardless
Bussin' jugs and used to trap out the college
Give me brain, I swear that bitch is a scholar
No snakes around me, only snake on my collar
I'm a thief in the night, pray to Jesus to Christ
Better hope he believe in your life
Free my lil' nigga Saudi, was catching them bodies
He fighting his demons to light
All my niggas be trapping, your niggas be rapping
They robbed you, you asking what happened
Got a new bitch from China, she wearing designer
I'm lacing her in the new fashion (ayy)

Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil' hoe, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil' nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans (ayy)
Hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it 'til the sun rise (ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat (ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell momma I'ma quit, but I love cash

I've been all around the fucking globe
Baby what ya know?
Motherfucker better tuck and roll
Got places to go
And niggas missed the last flight
Livin' in the fast life
Momma said you never act right, Goddamn
Guess I'm a bad guy
But I'm on my grind like a halfpipe
'Cause I switch it and flip it and cook it up mad nice
'Til I see them flashlights, then I'm gone
Fast flash like, my future's a tad bright
Because when they rent is due, and your Benz is new
And your old friends be resenting you
Like my women brown, and my Benjies blue
Shit is fucked up when they envy you
'Member niggas got killed over Penny shoes
Where I'm from niggas dying like Kenny do
Take a hit of this PAC and this Henny juice
Only one of me, but there's plenty of you
It was all a dream, reminiscing of a smaller thing
Grandma cooking like Paula Deen
It ain't all it seems, grew up with the starving teens
And growing plants, still watering

Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu

Uh uh
Daytrip took it to 10

I was cruising in a 6-4 with all of my hoes
Two niggas with a pistol that's ready to go
New bitch named Crystal, steady to blow
My team way too official, with Chevys and Rolls

Seen the red and blue lights, and I got pulled over
Redneck-ass cop asked me was I sober
I said hell nah nigga, stupid question to ask
I got a half pound of weed in the messenger bag
But I couldn’t tell ‘em that, I was wantin' to laugh
That's the number one rule, don’t be flauntin' your pack
And stop asking all these questions, now I'm tauntin' yo ass
And, if you want to search my car, you need a warrant for that
As soon as I said that stupid shit, my gun had slip into his grip
My nigga, I plead the fifth, I don't mean to diss man, but I gotta dip
He said ""what in tarnation,"" hit the gas, I'm car racing
Plus I'm high in the sky, gas got me stargazin'
So here's a little advice, my sugar n’ spice, and you can get nice
Free my nigga T-Mac, that shit is so whack, they tryna indict
I just paid off all my debt, I'm gettin' them checks, it's changin' my life
I need a little respect, just copped a Patek, just look at my ice
So he ran up, ""put yo hands up, you in handcuffs
You done lost your mother fuckin' head like you got dandruff
Woman lie, a nigga lie, fuck the cell, that shit is dry
Why you pull me over doing 60 in a 55?
All y'all is suspects, you knew that homes
Five niggas in the car, and y'all got durags on
Plus y'all bumpin' all the really loud new rap songs
That's three fuckin' strikes, I wanna go back home
How the fuck my straps slip, I be grounded and tight
He said, ""boys it look like y'all at the County tonight
And the canines comin', you can stop with the jokes
So while y'all in there tonight, don't be droppin' the soap""

I know that you hate me, I know that you jealous
I know you crazy, hiding behind an umbrella
Man I know I'm a target, shit I know I’m a threat
And I know y'all tryna stop me, 'cause you know I'm up next, nigga

Et c’est à perdre haleine
Que je piétine mon rôle 
En convoitant la reine

L’envie me dévore fort
Ca me démange je m’ennuie
De toujours garder le nord
En mire de ma vie

Refrain :

Alison sonne sonne
Dans ma tête comme une douce mélodie
Qui jamais ne s’arrête (non) qui jamais ne s’enfuit
Mon corps résonne (non non non  non non)
Et dans mes veines bat cette douce mélancolie
Et si j’en abuse quand même, elle m’rapprochait du paradis

Une vie d’soleil c’est un désastre
Mais la lune me répond « dit !
Ne suis-je pas un bel astre ?
Y’en aura un pour toi aussi
Et celui-ci ronronne
A ton oreille meurtrie
Que ce n’est pas d’ta faute
 Si c’est elle seule qui brille »

Refrain (x2)",Alison,2009
Ycare,"Brune brume vapeur de ton corps
Va dans l’ombre danse dans le noir t’as tort 
Virevolte oui j’aime ca j’adore
Dense chaleur d’un beau soir d’automne.

Sinueux cherche à s’évader,
On croirait à la félicité
Attraction de ton moi sur mon corps
Mais tu n’sais pas qu’tu danses avec la mort

Aube Epine,
Quand je danse avec ton corps qui se dessine
Aube Epine,
Fichu espoir qui se résigne.

Déportée de ton corps tu frissonnes
Ricoche dans les ombres que tu me donnes,
Gesticule et montre du doigt,
Mais je suis là et tu n’auras pas froid

Vivre une vie pour être vieillie,
À vingt ans être seule dans son lit
Voir ses courbes se rider faiblir
Mais toi t’es là, tu refuses de vieillir

Aube Epine,
Quand je danse avec ton corps qui se dessine
Aube Epine,
Fichu espoir qui se résigne.

Quand tu t’levais le matin c’était moi
Quand tu t’couchais l’soir c’était encore moi,
Tu n’t’débarrasseras pas d’moi comme ca,
Tu m’as dans la peau et même au-delà

Puisqu’on n’peut pas vivre l’un sans l’autre chacun
Puisqu’j’ai décidé d’un avenir commun
Tu resteras soudée à ma vanité,
Tu restes avec moi et pour l’éternité

Des hommes de terre,
Nimbés de lumière
Forment une ronde

Tomber du sol 
Vers un autre ciel

Qu’avaient pressenti

Quelques barbus,
Fous qu’on disait
Tant de blessures,
Inexpliquées.

Au bord du monde,
Je m’envolerai
Voir si ailleurs monte
Une ombre de paix,

Puisque la vie
Fragile comme fer,
On peut le croire
N’est plus sur terre.

Au bord du monde,
Des hommes en l’air,
Plus de lumière
Et plus de ronde,

Des trombes de sang
Rougissent l’univers,

Loin d’être lumières,
On peut le voir,

Que tu m’as descendu d’un cran
Et je ne peux pas croire
Que tu m’aies plumé comme un con

Je ferai une croix sur ma tombe
Un oiseau sait brasser du vent

A vouloir gifler le matin

Que j'avais enterrées la veille

If I was upset would you know how to make it last

Numb myself to sleep again

There I go, here I go, where I go, I don't know
I just can't help myself, so
Why do I do, what I do, when I do
Well, I can say so or I just don't know

Boys will be boys and what they usually say
That's the how and the why, that I act this way
That's the end of the line, I run out of rhyme
That ain't no crime so it's milk it out time

Let's see, I know it's some cosmic force
Causing my mind, you go,
Just wait out of course to another dimension
Not only of site and sound but of being a clown

Or an alley cat, or a dirty rat or a loud mouth brat
Well, I am all that, so if you ask me, why
I'm always in such a mess
Well, ha, I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

A very great lady, once said it right
A woman needs a man, like a fish needs a bike
There I go again sister know it all
No friends at all, 'cause I make them crawl

I can help showing off, all that I know
The whats can do, well is the wheres I could go
I know, it's makes the family very uptight
I know, it isn't right, but I do it every night

I'm probably don't belong here, I'm certainly were wrong here
Every night I have a dream, more like a nightmare
I see myself being born, Mum and dad are there
But it's not Marge and it's not Homer

Switched in a cradle, no wonder I'm a goner
I feel like a book, that's on the wrong shelve
I know, I shouldn't think it, but
I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

Hey, you know, I kinda like this thing
It's sort of like music, but you don't have to sing
You got none of the work and all of the fun
Like a low cal donut or a fat free bun

By the way, that's reminds me, how about a snack
Just a small sandwich or a cold six-pack
A big pack of pork rinds that couldn't hurt
A cake for dessert will keep my mind alert

Oh, it takes a lot of energy to do this rap
I feel kinda sleepy, better take a nap
Not too long a nap, two hours, that's a winner
I wouldn't wanna sleep to a roast beef dinner

Roast beef with gravy and potatoes
Hot rolls and butter, lettuce and tomatoes
I know, I shouldn't eat it, I got to keep my health
What's the hey, I can't help me

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

Yehudi Menuhin,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals

With no insults and all morals

In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance

Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,

Yehudi Menuhin,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Daylight, is coming again
Whiskey, woah whiskey
Whiskey, my only friend

Got me a bottle, lookin' out at my El Dorado
Smokin' a 'Baro, whip up an egg and avocado
I'm on the porch like a slummy Ralph Lauren model
Flannel shirt like a lumberjack choppin' a log-o
Pistol next to the ashtray, no bow and arrow
Got blah blah though, knock the beef outcha top nacho
I'm livin' life like there is a tomorrow
I'm slow motion, I'm slow cookin'
The crock pot holds potatoes
I smell the storm comin', I like watching a sorrow
I like watching that muddy water fillin' up the potholes
I like hearing the woods cry, moan, whisper and sing songs
So I can think long; an aficionado
Raindrops on the string hit: a pizzicato
I'm free-fallin', the airplane pilot's on idle
Freezer lookin' like I hit the lotto
And I got beer colder than a Colorado hollow
Do you follow?

And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do
You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof
'Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute

I complicate the uncomplicated
My drinkin' partners are the greatest
Me and my buddy, Jack Davis
Daniels, whatever, we Jimmy Beamin', if we get lucky, maybe
We get a visit from the baby King 13 and go fuckin' crazy
Ten racks for a crystal chandelier full of liquid Swazy
Now Patsy Cline got me walkin' after midnight
I'm tippin' the neck, gotta make sure to keep the lid tight
Was sittin' up with attention and now I just sit like
Slump down in my chair like a pimp, pondering this life
I'm the great grandson of Otis Williams
Part of me's Cherokee, the other part is a pilgrim
So me and firewater's like splittin' me up the middle
One's tryin' to love him, the other one's tryin' to kill a man

Momma's in the slaughter house with a hatchet helping daddy chop early morning hog
I'm catching Zs like an early morning saw when I woke up to the racket yawn and pause
What the fuck man I can never get sleep man, peeped out the window what's wrong with y'all?
Stood up in my Crimson Tide Alabama sweat pants and threw my pillow
Looks like daddy caught the motherfucker that tried to sneak in and steal his elbows
They don't know that old man don't hold hands or throw hands naw he's rough like a brilo
Went to the Chevy and pulled out a machete and that gun is heavy and tall as the midget willow

11:30 and I'm pullin' up dirty smoking babbage out the back of my buddies Monty Carlo
Spittin' over some super hot beats with a super hot freak we call the parking lot hoe
You know we sippin on that old brown bottle, bass in the trunk make the whole town wobble
So when we ride around bitches follow, but tonight one of the bitches is giving us problems
Well one of them bitches be fuckin' one of my homeboys favorite bitches
And has been on his hit list for a minute and I think he's ready to handle his business
He told me Yelawolf get this and he handed me the Cartier watch that was on his wrist
He said watch this shit and he jumped to the trunk and grabbed his biscuit, biscuit!

Two men stand, one's gotta go
One falls down to the ground, one walks down to the road
Momma better call the police
Now he's screaming no
Took a buckshot to the chest with a rock salt shell and he's moving slow
All this blood has spilled, enough to give a penguin chills
Hot enough to make a potato smoke at the tip of a hollowed steel
In the valley of the hollowed field
In the valley of the hollowed 'til
This ain't a figment of my imagination buddy, this is where I live Bama!

Dear Mr. President, have you seen FEMA?
Have you seen the lower 9th Ward, post Katrina?
Niggas scufflin' tryin' to find something tangible
The MP's is treatin' all the youth like animals
Then wonder why the cops gettin rocked like Mosley
Why niggas on the TV in the spot like cozy
Now Houston got a problem, Atlanta got a problem
Dallas, Alabama and Miami got a problem
Niggas wildin' out, livin' free, yellin' sovereign
.38 revolvin', crack rock ballin'
Tats on they face that say Uptown New Orleans
Blastin' on sight, fuck fightin', fuck arguin'
Meanwhile boat loads of cash go to Israel
Soldiers in Iraq pray to God for a miracle
Sam Cooke said that change was comin'
If not, you can bet your ass, danger's comin'

Both of us was in the same class in oh two Antioch Nash-Ville,
And I wanted you so bad
That I forgot to mind my manners
Everybody wanted them panties
Every guy was hopin' to land it
We would flirt around and touch hands
Until we fucked around and took Xanex
And that's when you began to drive me bananas
I was in denial it's apparent
You began to lie to your parents
You should know that I can't live
Without you holdin' my name
Now my heart's in control of my brain
And I can't hold it in the lanes

With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck
And I'm doin 120 man

But love is not enough, love is not enough, love is not enough

Used to fuck so much we missed school
You was there when I needed you
I was there when you needed me
We were inseparable
And I was broke with no fuckin' food
You was tough enough to be cool
Skate holes all in my shoes
Dope boys had me confused
I was in love with hip-hop
You was in love with that to
What made it come to a stop
Had to have been the money issue, bitch
And I really miss the rain
I gave you all of my soul and I got left was a key chain

Rollin down 20 man
With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck
And I'm doin 120 man
Maybe I'm givin' up, baby I'm givin up
Baby what is happening?
Don't you believe in us? Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough, love is not enough, love is not enough

Who the fuck are you fuckin' now
Bet he's always takin' you out
College educated and proud
Me, well I'm just a drop out
Can't really blame you for buggin'
Ain't I the dirt on your rug and
Just a place to wipe your shoes
And give me all your thrown away lovin'
Back to my buzzin' and druggin'
Back to my gutter with nothin'
Back to the rut all of a sudden
cracks in the covenant trust in me
You ain't gotta worry bout sharin' this success with Wayne
Now it's just petty change
But I still feel the pain

Rollin' down 20 man
With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck
And I'm doin 120 man
Maybe I'm givin' up, baby I'm givin up
Baby what is happening?
Don't you believe in us? Don't you believe in us?

They gave me a budget, I bought a bicycle frame.
I rode that bitch around Walnut park,
Put a stack in my pocket and then blew it at Wal-Mart.
On a jacket, a pistol, and a packet of blow darts.
If you enter my skull, you gonna need a strong heart.
Strong art, the heart of Dixie got history.

Mother goose broke a wing and still flew the coup.
She gave Jimmy 20 bucks and threw him a deuce.
Left Jimmy on the string like a loose tooth.
See these the type of people that I'm used to.
Hard knock country boys fuck a new suit.
Fuck a new coop when you need a new roof,
Give me the whole stake from the ruler to the two.
Give me the ruler too, measure it up.
There's good money in the pyrex mesurin' cup.
Ricky Bobby's on the corner he's tearin' it up.
If he don't slow down, he'll be wearin' a crutch.
Ricky needs to take it to tha highway,

You ain't gotta lay down on your bed to know you already fucked up
Lettin' me in the motherfuckin' game is lettin' me drunk-drivin' your truck
When Yelawolf arrived in this club, already had five in my cup
I done took another hit, I done ran into a bitch that's lookin' lifeless and stuck
Baby, what's wrong with' you now? What, you ain't happy with' red bottoms?
Mad 'cause I'm in VIP with' a fuckin' Jack bottle!?
With' Tom, Dick, and Harry
But I got up in this bitch with' a tank top 'cause I spit so very darn quick and scary
That's why they're so quick to compare me
But fuck the critics with' a spiked dick when it can fit barely
They probably think I'ma Limp Bizkit, their spit's jelly
But I put 'em in the woods, I'm a redneck, I'm a hick, tell me
Go ahead, what the fuck does it matter to me?
'Cause after me, there'll only be wannabes, and mostly ain't-never-gonna-bes

I don't know what to say after that first verse, I mean, like, damn, I just killed it
What the fuck am I supposed to do with this cow? I done already milked it
Smoke another cigarette, unfiltered, let go of anything that I'm feelin'
They done broke me down so many times before that I'm no longer rappin', I'm buildin'
With' one brick, two brick, three brick, four
Underneath the steps of my single-wide door
Raised by them dope boys, so I know how them things look
Thanks for the recipe, rest in peace, Wayne Bush
I don't cook my shit, I don't break it down for you motherfucker out there waitin' around
For some rap savior, you better look up at what it is that you facin' now
'Cause Jesus drives a Harley, the devil wears Prada
If God was one of us, he'd prob'ly drink vodka
I still kick it at the party when I get rich
'Cause rich or broke, I'm still as dope, the realest ain't as real as this
Dead or alive, I'll put a stamp in this bitch

Yeah! Problematic, I’m so problematic
That I’m probably a problem addict
Pop an aspirin cause my head is hurting

Sheets everywhere like a storm has passed
In fact it looks like I got into a wrestlin' match
Empty bottle of Jack, I could tell after that
I could smell it in fact, it's like death and ass
Think for a minute if I look over and look

To my right is a guilty conscience and her name is Brooke, my rival
At least I think her name was Brook
She’s asleep, and I’m givin' her the lamest look
Move her hair back so that I could see your face
Cause it was dark and I met her at the game it took
About five minutes to get her inside the whip
Another five minutes to get up inside the lips
Never try really, man not tryna slip, ah! But it was just thighs and hips

In a house that never runs out of boxes
Knowing that if I put on my tennis shoes
And a fresh fit, I’ll end up sockless
By the end of the night, flip flopping

And break a bottle with the bullet, yes I'm 'bout it motherfucker
Not a single solitary thing is missing from my southern roots
I'm liable just to take a Chevrolet and run it through the mud for giggles
Huh, what a son of a bitch my momma raised into a rapper 
That could tell story like my uncle when he's drinking
Product of a working enviro-nment, fuck is y'all thinking?
Meaning I'm working-working harder than any artist can ever do it simply 
'cause I'm made that way
I build a house around your ass before you could realize, 
That you were in the neighborhood that Yelawolf made
So call me a redneck and tell your boys about it, tell 'em I'm an Alabama wanna-be, 
I be that, I'll just take it to the studio and drop a bomb on you from a motherfucking beanbag, 
I need that

Drink some, smoke some
You won't have to get away from me
Load up the guns, load up the guns
Feign you will have to get away from me

Cause them up there, don't want to play fair

Or gutter enough, fast enough to keep up wit’ me
The most retarded motherfucker in the whole wide world
Ain’t stupid or dumb enough to fuck with me
If you in say you in, and if you is handle your mutherfuckin’ business

Like I could girl, like my good girl

Here I go again, on my shit again

You had a halter top, I had my Famous socks
You came to shop, I came to ho hop
You had your girl with you, both looking great
I wanted both of y'all, how 'bout a double take
She was hating, looking at me like a scumbag
But something made you wanna turn around and come back
Probably cause I just don't give a fuck
I just wanna see one of these hookas in my truck
So tell your girlfriend ""tough luck""
She just wanna see you with somebody dressed up well

But you continue to text message me
Right after saying that we should move separately
But you don't wanna see me go
Even though I've only given you dick and cold cereal
So you must have a thing for Lucky Charms
Or the bad girl in you just fell in my lucky arms
You love to cuss me out and call me crazy
Say I'm no good and all of your friends hate me
Then you show up to my room and damn near rape me
And then it goes from ""fuck you"" to ""fuck me baby""
You leave early so nobody sees you out the spot
Now you stuck between a hard place and a rock
You call me a player but I have lied to you not
Cause I'm not a player, I just crush a lot, holler

I'm in jail again, on my Johnny Cash
Some dude was talking shit, I had to whoop his ass
Called you in the morning and you just fucking laughed
You think this cute, you love my crazy ass
And I wonder if you'll ever leave my side
Cause the more that I ignore you, the more you wanna ride
I tell you that I'm bad but you never ask why
Cause you just want the good from a really bad guy
You wanna rock, let's rock and roll, just know
I'm only good at one thing and that's not control
But I am consistent, that's something to be proud of
Cause I ain't shit with you and I ain't shit without you

No such thing as a good girl gone bad

I'm a sex addict, it's a disease
There's medication for it and everything
I take pills",Good Girl,2011
Yelawolf,"Once upon a time in an apartment home
Lived a little girl with a heart of stone
Cause part of her heart was partly gone
Rarely seen and hardly known
Treated like a mat on a boxing ring
Blood drop stains on the twin box springs
Daddy came to visit it's not a dream
She thought to herself what is happening?
Above her head is a crucifix
But Lucifer loosens up his wrist
Lays her down with an open fist
And all that was left was hopelessness
Little girl, where's your loving mother?
Under the covers,under the covers
Little girl what have you discovered
She stuttered 

[Chorus]
Growin' up in the gutter
No more, fairy tales, and so
No place like hell, no place like home
Growin' up in the gutter
Black and white, in a frame
There we are, safe and sound
Stray guns, no aim, yea!
Growin' up in the gutter!

(And you ain't gotta be from the projects, to deal with this nonsense)
'Cause even in suburbia somebody will murder ya
Over nothin' leave your body slumpin'
In the parking lot of your complex
Violence is a hard pill to swallow and digest
My town is full of drug dealers
Most of them get shot in the process
Hustlin' and stackin' up profits
They robbin' motherfuckas like they havin' a contest
Shit, he took a bitch to his apartment to brag
A week later he tied up on the carpet and gagged
Cause he showed her all the pills he had for sale for the low
She told her cousin then her cousin grabbed a Glock and a mask
Kicked in his door laid him down
Then he shot him and dashed
Ran off with all that he had
He used to be ballin' now he got a colostomy bag
What you know about that
Middle class white bitch slangin' her body for crack
Mexican drug cartels, you hear the buck shot shells and then the blood clot fails
There ain't no healin' the wounds
Biggest meth bust on the east coast right here in Duluth
My lyrics are proof
Of growin' up in the gutta

You think you can define how hard you got it?!
By what neighborhood you live in muthafucker
Wake up in the gutter!

[Chorus]

Slumerican indeed, I am
Drug through the mud like a weed, what I am
Was child who was beat, I am
Leather belts that made me, I am
Home alone again at eight, I am
Somebody's life to rate, I am
Given to the beast by fate, I am
The one who did escape, I am
A voice for the cold in the dark, I am
The one who sold his heart, I am
From a family torn apart, I am
A target for your dart, I am
Sick again from the whips, I am
Head to the gun and click, I am
A soul that don't run from shit, I am
Exposed to the goats of sin, I am

In the basement in red, I am

You just got to know some words to Fleetwood Mac
Horror movies turn you on, pull the sheets back
Fuck it, I role play, do it to you in a Jason mask
You switch walkers like a switch blade
You walk into the room and it's like these other bitches get hit with a grenade
With that said, let me pull the spandex pants off you with my teeth like Ozzy did a bat head
I rock and roll, baby let's go

[Chorus]

You ain't concerned with new clothes or salaries
You would rather run across the country like Mickey and Mallory
Being the natural born killer that you are
We'll hang out the window with a pistol and I drive the car
Who would bother to bother the general with nothing but snack food
Shooting everything that moves, dogs and cats too
Reenact the hardest movie scenes, bloody shirts and holy jeans
We the hardest you and me, rock and roll baby

Yelawolf,"Everybody's asking me lately where I'm from
They wanna know what I've been through and what dirt I've done
But man if I told you what I've seen and been through then you probably run off
If your scared of the truth so instead in secret lined in chalk
See I've been lost ever since I could walk
Looking for my daddy and anyone of mamma's boyfriends who would talk
Or listen to me when I spoke instead of looking at me like a joke
Leaving me behind leaving me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho
But I learned quick that my daddy wasn't ever gonna come around
And I didn't give a shit 'cause me and my momma we held it down
No new kicks first day of school I'm goodwill bound
But when you come from the trench that's how you learn to walk around
So I don't give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homey
I just wanted you to know I didn't need a dollar from you I got 'em myself
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinking yourself lonely
Then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the shelf turn the page

Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show
In the magazines, hear me on the radio
So what do you think huh?
(Well I hope that your proud now, to watch it all go down)
I'm sorry daddy you didn't get to watch me grow
Now I'm always on the road no time to say hello
Bye (and I hope that your proud now, to watch it all go down)

Yeah mamma you look great, perfect
Be safe on your first date, for certain
If he brings you home too late, I'll hurt him
Don't worry bout me I'm safe I'll close the curtains
And I feel like I'm raising you but what do I know baby blue
All I know is that I was made in you so I put all my faith in you
Yeah I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go
All I wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl
So I turned into an asshole young and dumb smoking weed
Vandalizing, robbing houses, stealing cars, that was me
But everything I did I had to see
Feel the pain, had to grieve
To become who I am and I'm proud of the man I came to be
What I've learned cannot be taught
What I've earned cannot be bought
Justified deserve it all
So don't be concerned it's not your fault
I never counted sheep I count my blessings
So if you see him now momma don't give him the cold shoulder just give him my message just tell him

Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show
In the magazines, hear me on the radio
So what do you think huh?
(Well I hope that your proud now, to watch it all go down)

Now we got ten year-olds sitting back in a chair like ""those were the days""
And though it seems so amazing to me that the labels lost the touch
And I'm in the AM, flipping through the A.M. like I lost my crutch, limpin'
Cause I can't walk straight if I can't turn it up, sippin'
I need some Gin and Juice, Snoop Dogg, I brought my cup
What's up, ah ha, okay, shut up
Cause I think we had enough of radios and lunch with the love bugs
Well let me give you a big hug
Bag of mushrooms, here, take some drugs
And play some group home or something
And shit goodie mobs sould food is bumpin'  rewind

[Chorus]

You'll never hear Black Star cause the program director is mostly deaf
And you'll never hear triple six cause we live in the midst of the Bible Belt
But that's when the light is filled, so let it shine
Let em' rhyme, let em' hustle, let em grind
Nothing wrong with the truth sometimes
Sometimes, the truth is dark but the darkness sparks the truest art
And you didn't even know you a window till a tornado blew it apart
If Eric Clapton could sing about cocaine, then there's no harm
Then I can write about guns, I can rap about girls
I can sing about money and cars
Not that my money is large
Let's talk about broke is a joke
Let's talk about gettin' evicted, everything owned thrown out on the road
And maybe that there goes gold
Shit maybe it's platinum sold
But they don't want to see the green leaves from pirates gold
Oh no, hold up rewind

[Chorus]

Pick up the change, pick up the change
Ride in a Chevy cause I'm sick of the Range
Catfish Billy come pick up the name
Come inside, if your sick of the rain
Turn the radio off and don't complain
It's all a replay, it's all the same
Got one drag, on a runaway train
On a one way street better pick your lane

Yeah, but you could let me pick your brain
And we could be that Rolling Stone
Mix 'em up with Janis Joplin
Let 'em harmonize like Bone
Or we could just leave it alone
Let it take on a life of it's own
Or we could be that World Class Wreckin' Cru
Tell 'em to turn the lights back on
C'mon

Yelawolf,"The United States Army has issued a warning
Three nuclear bombs have been launched from North Korea and will hit
Orlando, Florida, Las Vegas, Nevada, and New York City, New York
This will expire at five o'clock A.M. Eastern Standard Time
Please get to an underground shelter or a fallout shelter at this time
Once again, three nuclear bombs have been launched by North Korea
And will hit Orlando, Florida, Las Vegas, Nevada, and New York city, new york
This warning will expire at five o'clock am eastern standard time

I am 
I am the American Eagle, eyes of a sparrow
Right hand branch, left hand arrow
Chasing a dollar, in an Impala
White trash heart throb, mellow yellow
Drinking hard liquor, brauds get on my level
I'm hotter than the bottom side of a whistlin' kettle
They threw a mountain at me, I got hit with a pebble
Sent me to hell, and I shit on the Devil
Try to bury my Chevy box but I won't buckle
And that's a deep hole bitch, bring your own shovel
Long gone, I'm grown up, and I'm gone cut you
With a chrome blade, if you want a play then holmes fuck you
Fuck you till you can't take a shit
Yeah I'm a fucking a tsunami, better anchor the ship
Aim for the ankles and wrist, I came for the dangerous shit
I claimed to be named for the hits, the game is a chain that I grip
Slang from the pain of a trip it took to see Wayne in the whip
I became what I came to get the chains for the chain I give
A quarter for your thought, appreciate the contribution
Slumerican, I'd appreciate the Constitution
Alleviate the crew when, I leave a page in ruins
To each is own, I guess I own each and every room in
The house I built is full of hopes, no ifs
So I stand with a giant like a king, no stilts
If I'm Generation X, I'm sellin' Ex, no pills
Dopeman chopping up lines you don't sniff
Read 'em, I'm bringin' back booklets and hookless, lyrics
So you can be certain just in case you didn't hear it
But what he says, come again? What is that?
Come to Earth, touchdown, I might be your running back
Because you hot then run it back, stay cool enough to wear
Toboggans as a summer hat
Steady on the throne I rap, hope there's no one under that
Rock that I roll, mosh pit flow
Girls on your shoulders get topless at the show
Fuck your mop and glow, can't mop a dirt road
It only makes mud, raised around a deer
I know how to chase bucks
Babysitter, sixteen, taught me how to make fuck
At seven, I've been raising hell
So I can make it to Heaven
Pick up a two-Liter but I only need the plastic
I know how to make bombs with aluminum and acid
Butterfly effect over hurricane's magic

I'm on the sidewalk with this fuckin' skateboard and these dirty ass jeans
I'm the boy that stole a pack of Twinkies And a bottle that's green
I never gave a fuck about environmental shit throw my empty bottle in the gutter
Rednecks four' wheelin' screaming “skate or die dude” 
Fuck you motherfucker (fuck you motherfucker)
I'm a car wreck in a swamp I drown victims slow With these words that I lay
Pigs on the corner got an eye for my kind 'cause we ignore laws everyday
What do you mean I'm white trash? Grab my nuts and kick your poodle in the face
I'm sick to the soul with hate
'Cause I'm the bitch that society raped
So what'a ya say?

My body is covered in tattoos that are totally offensive
If I did It, I did it for life No regrets, you know that I meant it

You motherfuckers are lost, get your maps out and follow me into the creek water
I didn't forget where I came, jus' how to ignore my musical calling
That crack on the window on the Chevy's been there for over seven months
Along with Jon Newport's beer bottle caps and the Roaches of Will Power's blunts
So what'a ya say?

People is why shit is so wrong
Why they won't let all our soldiers come home
Why them boys who get caught with such small amounts of dope on the Ave do bids so long
They bids so long by the time they get to come home
Mamas is gone and babies is grown
And baby mama that was tight in that thong
Fat as a fuck and her body all gone
Pay for it cash her ass is gone
She never worked so the stash is gone
Government rations she gets on
Year after year she get check after check
A gangster come home already in debt
The government say you owe fifty K
For all the free lunches that yo baby ate

You expect me to be proper?

Was locked, what about some shoes I thought, great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what'dya know, they didn't carry a size eight in hoes!
Oh! This is ugly boy swag, puttin' toe tags on you motherfuckin' ho bags

May never be the first dream on a champion team

You're richer than you think in that old small town
