I said, ""What?"" 
She said, ""I love you but I'm leavin' you"" 
And I said, ""Baby?""

What you say, girl? 
(Whoa-ooh baby, I love you) 
Ooh, I love you 
Ooow! Somethin' wrong here someplace 
(Whoa-oh baby, I love you) 
Wait a minute! 
She said, ""Here's the key to all of your locks, 
take my name off of your mailbox 
Here's the key to your Cadillac, 
I got my own parked right out back"" 
I said, ""What?"" 
There somethin' wrong here 
And she kept talkin' 'bout 
I love you 
(Whoa-ooh baby, I love you) 
Fellas, let me tell you somethin' 
Ha, ha, ha 
Wow! Woo, somethin' wrong 
(Whoa-oh baby, I love (need) you 
Wait a minute! 
Let me tell you what else she told me 
She said, ""You know one thing, Diddley 
I got all my bags packed, 
in the middle of the dining room floor 
I'm all packed and ready to go"" 
I said, ""But baby, whoa baby 
Baby, baby"" 
And then she told me 
she said, ""Got my own place, 
with some brand new lock 
I'm gonna tell the mailman, 
I got a brand new box"" 
I said 
(Whoa-oh baby, I love you) 
""Woo you ain't

are you?"" 
There's somethin' wrong some place

Catched me playin' with my ding a ling

I slipped and had a terrible fall
I fell so hard I heard bells ring
But held on to my ding a ling

Many snappers all around my feet
Sure was hard swimming cross that thing
With both hands holdin' my ding a ling

He was sitting in the witness stand
The judge's wife called up the district attorney
Said you free that brown eyed man
You want your job you better free that brown eyed man

Flying across the desert in a TWA,
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She been a-walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay.
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

Way back in history three thousand years
Back every since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shed a tear
For a brown eyed handsome man
That's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man

Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man

Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

Two, three count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game; it was a brown eyed handsome man",I Don't Know Where I've Been,2013

So I told her softly and sincere

So we both decided to take a stroll

The soldier blues fell in behind
I looked across and there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line
And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancee
From where I stood I saw she was cryin'
And through her tears I heard her say

Billy, don't be a hero, don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero, come back and make me your wife
And as he started to go she said, Billy, keep your head low

The battle raging all around
The sergeant cried, We've got to hang on, boys!
We've got to hold this piece of ground
I need a volunteer to ride up
And bring us back some extra men
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgettin' all the words she said

Then I grab the tool and take your jewels
And I'ma watch this blew the same as Jigga's
It ain't the liquor I'm really sick, smokin' Shwag eatin Crystal chicks
On a rollercoaster with Bo and Kosha
Can't even fuck witch'all pencil dicks
Ain't this some shit?
Every time we step inside the club y'all tryna guess 
Which one of us gon' snatch your bitch
And leave you strokin' all by yourself
Understand this Bubba Sparxxx, S-P-A-are-triple X
I sprinkle soul in your pussy hole 
And put some coal on your nipple and neck
Tell your man, if he flex it's gettin drastic, legend has it
I know this mob spell G-A and with no delay they'll let him have it
It's just a habit, reppin' Athens and LaGrange, it's in my veins
I'm mixin Beam with Coke and (?), and every time it's still just the same
I tend to aim towards spittin' thangs, it's classical so masterful
When it comes to this here make the shit clear
Heard to y'all comes natural

Drink Bourbon in a cup, if it's bumpin' turn it up
We gon' weave, we gon' roll, watch the Franklin faces fold
Chasin multi-platinum plaques while y'all settlin' for dough
Drop that liquid on yo' tongue, put that reefer in your lungs
Close the curtains here we come, boy hush until I'm done
We gon' drink, we gon' smoke, keep that floss on they toes
When these broads start some lickin', we just might end up with your

Step in the club it's on
Nevertheless gonna find the somebody I could sip on
A seat with a view in the V.I.P., and got two tight things to grip on
A bag of trees to put my lip on - gotta cut it, roll it, light it, pass
And me and Bubba gettin' crunk in the club 
With a tape full of Bud in a champagne glass
Puttin' it down for the B.C., in the backwoods where we be
Better call a producer when you see me
And get your ass right back in the GT
Y'all lame boys, hangin up lookin' just for a name boy
Goin upsize with the Game Boy
Witcho' mind right go out lookin' for a cane boy, it's a shame boy
You the main one tryna stall right, sold the broads out the game boy
I beat 'em down like chop chop chop
Yessuh, cut 'em up and leave 'em alone
On my cell phone they callin', talkin' 'bout ""Kosha baby, call me""
Leave your name and your number at the sound of the beep
And I'll get back witcha shawty
Most hated by baby daddies for breakin' up happy homes
When the men is on and she don't say no then that mean she wanna bone
So partna don't get me wrong, I'm just bein Kosha
That Southern playa with a stroke that keep 'em wet like a ocean

And me and Bubba get bout it (bout it)

You the ones be payin' hoes and buyin' them gifts (trick ass)
You mad when you find out some other niggaz get it
Ain't payin' no bills just stayin' real and still be hittin' it
I'm a old school playa I just pay for her dinner
Maybe buy a little liquor I spend some talk in the mirror
This the playa from the soul; love to gang up on hoes
I'm tryna let this pimp shit go cause I don't even like it no mo'
See these niggaz that I hang with they just run through these skanks
Talk about 'em over dinner, pass women like dank

On the them ol' fire ass Mercedes Rolls
That don't never come 'round no mo' that shit right dere

Man, I'm gon' tell it like it is, I'm gon' sit the rear
I stand true to high live, this a quest for a mil'
It done took a nigga different places, seen plenty of faces
Whatever may have been the cases I thank God for his graces
See my knife'll tell the fakers, kept me spinnin' like breakers
And every day I play awake a nigga learnin' by haters
See I take a ho, and shake a ho, that's how we live

As the night approaches I, decide that I'm a call my favorite guy
Cause I don't want to be at home alone, I wish that you would hurry home
So baby trust me It's going on , better hurry home to me
Gotta surprise for you... there's nothin' that I won't do... for you so

Tonight I'll sleep with nothing on
So make sure that you hurry home
Cause I'll be waiting for you, waiting for you, waiting for you
With nothing on

[Rap by Chyna Whyte]
I'm hittin' you on the two-way, shit, cause I want it bad
And I ain't thinkin' bout nothing but
You and me blowing hash in the midnight hour
I know you thugging in the streets bout your money

But best respect this pussy got the power
You can't deny the way I twurk this here
I'm talkin' freaky on this here come one and work this here
And bust it open like I'm bout to get burnt in here

I do my dirt in here, you know what I'm workin with
These titties perky, I ain't a virgin you ain't gotta worry bout a thing
Just lay back cause I'm on a mission to please
And I got plenty doe whodie so I ain't lookin for cheese

Not tonight I got a quarter pound of that weed
And we can go to the verge, come one put it all in me
I like it real deep, wit no rubber so that you can feel me, you feel me?
I got your bitch wantin to kill me behind the snapper

'Cause I fucks like a master, and suck like I'm dracula
And I ain't caught up in the rapture

[Chorus: x 2]

(Shawty!)My baby momma sleeping (yea)so tonight I'm creeping (uh huh)

You make a preacher man sin

Now we butt naked fucking all on the floor (uh huh)

Ya came 3 times, how that dick girl (oobie whispers: TITE)

[Rap]
Girl I hit the door with nothing in my mind
So when you feeling freaky baby call me anytime
You say tonight, no small talk or foreplay
On that purple 'dro, allassy, and hennessy
All the freaky things you do got me going crazy
Got me thinking to myself can you be my lady
But hell naw, cause I can't fall in love wit the cut
Just stop by to hit it quick and get enough, a-get enough

[Rap by Bo Hagon]
I'll beat the pussy up and leave you in bed legs shaken
Wake up alone by 2 in the morn' like damn, Hagon
Careful what you ask for cause you just might get it
And once I came would you swallow or spit it

I know you freaky you don't have to admit it
I take 'em petite , or thick in the thighs
I like to fuck 'em while I look in they eyes
So go on, cut up , girl toot your butt up and do your thang
Sad but I knew your pussy before I knew your name

Bo Hagon,"Once again up in that south from my motherfucking mouth
And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherfucking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

Buster me and me's clicks, always making those hits
We never straight jam with no busters our no tricks
Getting in trouble from the sounds of my trunk
And keeping it crunk, keeping it crunk

(What, What)
Now drop them bozs' on 'em [Repeats]

Nigga bozs' bout to turn out the show
Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

[Chorus]

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

I really ain't givin' a fuck and even if I did,
I still wouldn't even hesitate to split yo wig, pop back
In the whip like ain't nothin' happened 
It'll appear as magic I disappear in traffic,
A lot of folks goin' hate 'cause they know I'm a fool
And they know I'm the shit, I finally got out the school,
If I spit out the tools, I'll spit out the blues,
Don't bug it and confuse, I will not lose,

It to the streets, it's about to go down when I pull the heat,
If you can't stand my click you can kiss my ass (kiss ma ass)
Fuck around make you jump in the grass, 
But that ain't it and that ain't all,
My name is scrappy I love to brawl,
Got's to say that I'm a hard head,
Got best in my blood 'cause I'm a thoroughbred 
Yeah!

[Chorus: x2]

We bout to crank it up city to city,let me know if you wit' it,
If the girl is pretty,could you show us
Some titties, if the hoes are silly,
If the hoes are dilly, put the hoes to a coast where they ? bin business,
I'm a country legend GA I'm reppin', I pull ma weapon, 
They girl ain't nothin', she blew my brains, 
Bitch do your thing, got the pussy before I knew yo name,
Most niggaz are fake, most niggaz are hate,
They can't wait, they try to take what's on yo plate,
What you thank this is must not thank dis real,
I pull the steel, don't you think yo cap can't get killed

Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there alright
But they all go native on a Saturday Night

Their music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples lookin' for romance
Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellah packs a gun
Ev'rybody does his best to act just right
Cause there's gonna be a funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight

It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1991

At the house of blue lights

But the treat of the treats 
Is when they serve you all those fine eight beats
You'll want to spend the rest of your brights

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

People passing

Ring a ling hear them sing

Blink a bright red and green

Und damals konnte mich nicht mal die Polizei hindern
Ich wurde kriminell, es hieß sie schließen mich ein
Ich hab' nichts daraus gelernt und ich ließ es nicht sein
Ich weiß, dass nahm dir viel von deiner Kraft
Doch du bist stark geblieben und schicktest mir Briefe in den Knast
Ich bin der Grund für dein graues Haar
Lieber Gott danke dir, diese Frau ist stark!
Ich hatte noch 'ne Menge zu lernen
Doch was ich wusste ist, Mama ist ein Engel auf Erden

Mama, nur für dich sprech' ich zu Gott
Du bist raus aus den dreckigen Blocks
Heute bin ich älter und ich raste nicht mehr aus
Ich will, dass du weißt, ich passe auf dich auf
Dein Sohn ist ein Gangster
Dein Sohn ist ein Gangster

Mama weißt du noch? Schon wieder wurd' ich eingelocht
Und schon wieder saßt du bei den Cops
So bin ich, Einbrechen wurde zu 'ner Übungssache
Immer dicker wurden Batzen, aber auch die Führungsakte
Ich hab' mir das von Papa abgeguckt, als er durchdrehte
Aber heute kannst du ruhig leben
Ich geb' mein Leben für deins
Ich gebe alles dafür, dass du keine Träne mehr weinst
Nur deinetwegen würd' ich über Leichen gehen
Leute die mich kenn' wissen, dass ich kein Scheiß erzähl'
Ich bin kein guter Junge, soll ich mich mal so äußern?
Mama zog mich in 'nem Ghetto groß zwischen Hochhäusern
Wir haben's raus geschafft, Mama Augen auf
Es geht nur noch vorwärts, ich hab' dir ein Haus gekauft
Es tut mir so leid
Mama, sag kannst du mir verzeihen?

Mama, nur für dich sprech' ich zu Gott

Ich seh' die Welt jetzt mit anderen Augen
Ich bräuchte kein einziges Gramm mehr verkaufen
Kein Besuchstag und nie wieder Handschellen
Nie wieder ""Hände hoch und bitte an die Wand stellen""
Dein Sohn ist ein Gangster
Es tut mir leid Mama
Dein Sohn ist ein Gangster
Ich hatte kein' Papa
Dein Sohn ist ein Gangster
Kannst du mir verzeihen?
Dein Sohn ist jetzt erwachsen und das alles ist vorbei

Ich kam mir vor wie allein auf der Welt ohne Papa
Mama zog mich in 'nem Ghetto groß, obwohl sie raus wollte
Denn über unserem Block schwebte eine Rauchwolke
Ich fing an mit Raubüberfällen
Ich dachte, ich kauf' Mama bald ein Haus von dem Geld
Ich kenn' das Business mittlerweile wie meine Westentasche
Doch damals zog ich Koks in der 6. Klasse
Meine Freunde waren 10 Jahre älter

Also sag mir was Bushido dieser Bastard erzählt
Eine Kahba die bläst ist für 18 Karat rein gar nichts
So was kriegt er acht mal am Tag
Heute heißt es jeden Tag Steak essen
Mir einen frischen Shake pressen
Damals hieß es abhängen mit Fakefressen
Heute blättern Cops 'ne Million, damit sie mich mit Haze catchen

Für mich und die Jungs, die die Straße leben und für sie bluten

Kommt mir nicht mit Beef, ich lebe fuck-the-police

Ich lasse Hunde bellen, während ich buntes Geld zähl'

Hier ist der erste Rapper, den du auf der Straße triffst
Hier ist der erste Rapper, der wirklich mit Ware tickt
Der erste Rapper, bei dem Echtes auf der Waage ist
Der erste Rapper hier, der kein Rapper ist
Wollt' ihr Beef? Nein, besser nicht, ihr seid lächerlich
Ein Messerstich reicht, ich bring' Fleischfresser mit
Und schlag' dir mit dem Basy in dein' scheiß Stresserblick/
Sag dein' Jungs: ""Die Supremos haben übernommen!""
Ihr Hurensöhne könnt mit allen euren Brüdern kommen

Tüte übern Kopf, du landest im Lieferwagen
Mach Scheine in lila Farben durch Handel in Tiefgaragen
Ich zahle Cash, scheiß auf Master- oder Visa-Karten/
Ich rauche Bobbys auf meinen eigenen Weedplantagen
Meine Träume hat mein Vater nie verwirklicht
Und deshalb ist mein Album eine AK47

Und deshalb mach ich ""FSK18 Brutal"", drück' auf Wiedergabe
Ich bin von der Straße und liebe diese lila Farbe
Keine Chinaware, die ich um den Hals trag'
Auch wenn's draußen kalt war, die Straße war Alltag
Ich bin so tief in dieser Szene drin
Und war damals so tief in meiner Lehrerin

Und fett Haze kiffen, geht ihr Flatrate ficken

Sie war ganz normale Schülerin, nichts zu tun mit bok[?]
Sie war eine die ihr Abi hat, hatte kein Plan von Abiat
Eine die kein Money hat
Ein ganz normales Mädchen bis sie ihn kennen lernte
Und sich langsam von ihrer Family entfernte
Er hat es ausgenutzt, machte ihr schöne Augen
Sagte sie darf bei 'nem Mensch nicht immer an das Böse glauben
Sie hat sich schnell verliebt
Er hat nur daran gedacht wie viel Geld er kriegt
Er ist selbstverliebt, wollte ein' Benz oder Jeep
Diese Bitch war ihm egal, weil ein Gangster nicht liebt
Er lies sie dieses wunderschöne Leben kosten
Zahlte ihr den Strom, die Miete und ihre Nebenkosten
Wollte, dass sie ihm ihr Vertrauen schenkt
Und das tat sie auch, obwohl sie wusste wie viel Frauen er bangt

Er ist ein Arschloch und untreu, ich weiß
Doch Nicole schenkte ihm ihre Jungfräulichkeit
Er hat sie therapiert bis sie sein Koka zog
Absichtlich konfrontierte er sie mit ihrem Monatslohn
Sie hat sich an das hohe Standard gewöhnt
Sie fuhr sein' Film mit und sie fand alles schön
Er hat direkt ihren Nutzen erkannt
Er erkennt eine Nutte, Nutten lutschen am Schwanz
Er hat sie so krass mit Kokain zugedröhnt
Erzählt er hat Schulden bei irgendwelchen Hurensöhnen
Hat gewusst, dass sie ihm aus der Patsche hilft
Ihr größter Fehler war, dass sie sagte, dass sie's machen will
Er hat gesagt, dass sie 10.000 herzaubern muss
Und so brachte er sie in die besten Saunaclubs
Sie kam anfangs nicht darauf klar
Doch er fickt diese Welt und das ist ihm egal

Er brachte sie von Magnum nach Yin Yang
Er brachte sie von Essen in die Schweiz
Sagte, dass das Geld für unser Essen nicht mehr reicht
Sie hat ihm diese Scheiße abgekauft
Er ist krank, deshalb hat er auch die Maske auf
Sie hat für ihn die Uni geschmissen
Er wurde aggressiv und zwang sie ohne Gummi zu ficken
Um den Umsatz zu steigern
Er schmiss mit 500ern um sich rum
Weil er Grund hat zu feiern
Sie wurde schlanker und bleicher
Es war genug was diese Schlampe erreicht hat
Keine Kunden mehr, doch weil er krank und gemein war
Gab er diese Nutte an 'ne Rocker-Bande weiter
Kein Plan was sie heute noch macht
Auf jeden Fall hat sie ihm eine Menge Euros gebracht

Deutschland ist mittlerweile, krasser als Chicago
Ghetto-Capitano von hier bis nach Bremen Hemelingen
Brüdern, Ott in die Zellen bringen
Weil wir kriminelle sind, Gangster wie Ostdorfer Born
Hinfallen, aufstehen und nochmal von vorn
Gesetzesbrecher, Messerstecher, Multikrimineller
Mit nem Auge aufs Geschäfft und das Pulver liegt im Keller
Gangster wie die Straßen in Wedding
Kids tagen ""18 Karat"" mit nem Edding
Gangster wie Dortmund - Drogenmetropole
Gangster von Außerhalb, holen bei uns Großes
Gangster wie Leipzig und Offenbach
Wo ein kleiner Junge, heimlich den Stoff verpackt
Ghetto-Kinder zünden sich hier Joints an
Ich bin ein Gangster wie die Politik in Deutschland

"Bob ""Mr. 18 Karat"" Wingate","An schlechten Tagen wenn die Sonne nicht scheint
Sind ich und du, wie Bonnie und Clyde
Du bist loyal geblieben, wie ein Soldat an meiner Seite
Dich ersetzt keine zweite
Du hörst auf Kommando, wie ein dressierter Schäferhund
Du bist bei mir geblieben, alle waren gegen uns
Ich gehe nicht links, nicht rechts, ich gehe gerade aus
Denn hinter jeden starken Mann ist eine starke Frau
Sie hat mehr geraucht, als andere verkauft haben
Sie kennt meine Finanzen, Einnahmen, Ausgaben
Denn sie ist mittendrin und sie ist Gangster, Gangster
Sie fühlt diesen verfickten Film
Und ja
Ich weiß ich habe sie oft schon verletzt
Doch sie weiß was ich mach' und hat trotzdem respekt
Sie ist Gottes Geschenk, auch wenn ich viel nicht vertrau
Kann ich mir vorstellen eine Familie aufzubauen

Nur neben dir hab ich nicht meine Make auf
Geld, Macht, Respekt, das ist alles was ich brauch
Du bist meine Frau, ja ich schenk' dir das Lied
Aber mehr auch nicht, weil ein Gangster nicht liebt

Schlechte Tage sind vorbei an denen die Sonne nicht scheint
Ich kauf dir die Welt, Geld spielt keine Rolle du weißt
Ich vertrau dir blind, du bunkerst die Batzen
Du denkst nur an mich und daran Umsatz zu machen
Du hörst auf Kommando, wie mein AMG Performance Paket
Zeit nach Vorne zu sehen
Ich bin auf Partys und du passt auf die Ware auf
Denn hinter jeden starken Mann ist eine starke Frau
Ich weiß es haargenau weil sie mir den Rücken stärkt
Weil ich schlechte Tage mit ihr einfach überbrücken werd'
Sie ist 'ne Raubkatze, unser Sex ist animalisch
Sie bringt mich jedes Mal dazu auszurasten, ja
Ich weiß ich hab sie oft schon verletzt
Doch bei ihr stirbt die Hoffnung zuletzt
Sie ist Gottes Geschenk, auch wen ich viel nicht vertrau

I could live without love
Now I must admit,

It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1987

Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Love is all is alright
But you left it a little to late
Love is all is alright
But you've got to find a little more hate.


Take the man in the white cloak
A pointed mask to hide his face
Murders in the name of religion
If you're not the right colour or race.
Take the man in the black cloak
He's holding justice in his hands,
Lets the man in the white cloak go,
Calls it the law of the land.

Love is all is alright.......etc


Take the man in the brown shirt
A burning hatred in his eyes
Fired by ignorant reaction,
Fanned by political lies
Take the man in the blue cap
His back's against the wall
Links arms with the man in the brown shirt
He's trying to break his own fall.

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,

Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,

Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,

Bob Belden,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me

Now Santa is a busy man, he has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas Day
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Because he's getting ready his reindeer's and his sleigh

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list and checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

Little tin horns, little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Curly head dolls that cuddle and coo
Elephants, boats and kiddie cars too

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

The kids in girl and boy land
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy land
All around the Christmas tree

Why let him upset us?
Caiaphas, let him be
All those imbeciles will see
He really doesn't matter

Jesus is important
We've let him go his way before
And while he starts a major war
We theorize and chatter

He's just another scripture
Thumping hack from Galilee

The difference is they call him King
The difference frightens me
What about the Romans?
When they see King Jesus crowned
Do you think they'll stand around
Cheering and applauding?

What about our people?
If they see we've lost our nerve
Don't you think that they deserve
Something more rewarding?

They've got what they want
They think so, anyway
If he's what they want
Why take their toy away?
He's a craze

Put yourself in my place
I can hardly step aside
Can not let my hands be tied
I am law and order

What about our priesthood?
Don't you see that we could fall?
If we are to last at all
We can not be divided

Then say so to the council
But don't rely on subtlety

You beat him so hard that he was bent and lame,
And I know who everybody's going to blame.

No riots, no army, no fighting, no slogans

One thing I'll say for Him, Jesus is cool
We dare not leave Him to His own devices
His half-witted fans will get out of control
How can we stop Him?

His glamor increases by leaps every minute
He's top of the poll, I see bad things arising
The crowd  crown Him king which the Romans would ban
I see blood and destruction, our  elimination because of one man

Because, because, because of one man
Our elimination because of one man

How do we deal with the carpenter king?
Where do we start with a man who is bigger
Than John was when John did his Baptism thing?

Fools, you have no perception
The stakes we are gambling are frighteningly high
We must crush Him completely
So like John before Him, this Jesus must die

For the sake of the nation this Jesus must die
Must die, must die, this Jesus must die

I burn like a rose on fire
This secret storm in me is humbled by your desire
I swallow your kisses deep
A million voices rise up
They cry they cry they cry out to me

Fill me up with a promise come to me
Won't you come to me

I'll fly when you call my name
Give me Heaven while I'm sleeping

Bob Brookmeyer,"If you could have told me
I wouldn't find my way back home
Never would have closed the door
I never would have left the phone unplugged all night
Waiting for the sunrise to take me out of here
Back to nowhere

Wish you could have told me
Who knows if I could have heard
Love don't make the reasons why
Some people just don't find the words to convey the truth
Of the passion that they're feeling
Why do I keep falling back?
Back to nowhere

Wishing you could hold me
Like you used to in the dark
Lay your body next to mine
But does it anywhere, does your star?
Are you sure you're fine?
But in case it's me you're missing
You should know I'd gladly go
Back to somewhere
Back to anywhere
I go
With you",Back to Nowhere,1999
Bob Brookmeyer,"I'm just a little defensive
But I'll be okay tomorrow
This happens once in awhile
Till I'm back on my feet
Once I get out of bed
I'll come to my senses

A pair of shades can change it all
Maybe Superman will jump the wall
Whatever it takes to get on with the world

'Cause I'm bored with myself
So very bored with myself
More and more everyday
And I wonder if Marilyn ever felt this way

We're moving so fast
Why do I feel so empty?
There's clothes in my closet
But nothing to wear
It's a mysterious thing
The more that I acquired, the less hungry
I am but not more satisfied
There's India where I can chant
Therapy to rave and rant
Whatever it takes to distract me from being so

Bored with myself
So scary bored with myself
More and more everyday
And I wonder if Jacqueline ever felt this way

I'm a little uninspired
It happens to the best of us
I know I shouldn't take it hard
But I'm so afraid this time I'll never change
Won't shake it off, I'll just go insane

Callous, murderous, malignant, belligerent, ignorant?

So everybody grab a oar, we can make it to shore

And there is no way back in
You got nothing snake eyes
The house always wins

A drowning man does not die silently
You can feel the final warning
And the black money follows
Through the veins of the shallow
Change the name to protect the guilty

Where you are the King

In this room of shame
You could sink this town
And breathe another day

Bob Brookmeyer,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Bob Brookmeyer,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Bob Brookmeyer,"Tristeza nao tem fim Felicidade, sim...
A felicidade é como a pluma 
Que o vento vai levando peloar
Voa tao leve Mas tem a vida breve       
Precisa que haja vento sem parar...

A felicidade do pobre parece 
A grande ilusao do carnaval, 
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro
Por um momento de sonho 
Pra fazer a fantasia
 
de rei, ou de pirata, ou jardineira 
E tudo se acabar na quarta feira
Tristeza nao tem fim Felicidade, sim...
A felicidade é como a gota de orvalho 
Numa pétala de  flor
Brilha tranqüila Depois de leve oscila     
E cai como uma lágrima de amor
A minha felicidade está sonhando 
Nos olhos da minha namorada
E como esta noite 
Passando, passando 
Em busca da madrugada 
Falem baixo por favor
Pra que ela acorde alegre como o dia   
Oferecendo beijos de amor 
Tristeza nao tem fim

Bob Brookmeyer Quartet,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams [#],1998

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last

With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

Like the way he warms my chop

And I would only laugh
But he means too much to me

Oh, his jelly roll is so nice and hot
Never fails to touch the spot

How I like his sausage meat

No one else is can touch my ham

Why, he can use my sugar bowl

Never fails to satisfy

When the stars seem to shine

Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

My life, but most of all, for

A little more every day.

To perfume and makeup,
From ribbons and curls.
Trying her wings out in a great
Big world. but I remember

But if you don't mind,
I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time.""

And I'll give her away.

Just staring at her,
She asked me what I'm thinking,

About time""

Cause?.
He was a rock

He was the one that she ran to
And when he said the word ""forever""

He was a man,
A man of his word

Found a family undivided, divided
On the war.
Turning son against his elder, debating 
Wring and right,

He was the image of his father, though they
Would not see eye to eye
Still?
He was a rock

He was the one the boy ran to
'Cause' when he said the words ""I love you""
He knew that it was true
And even in the worst of storms

There was an anchor in his world
He was a man, a man of his word
Clutching a strong belief in the Bible,
Through all the sweetness in his life, and the

Bitterness of war,
He knew what God has made him for?
In the final days of summer, 1994,
Surrounded by his family, and the presence 

Of the Lord,
He set out to find his future, the one he'd 
Always known,
He didn't want to leave his family, but he 

Knew deep in his soul,
The Lord had called him home.

A man of his word?

Bob Carlisle,"

You should know me by now.

I've always been straight with you.

I've always tried to sing about the truth the way I see it,

In a mixed up world where truth is

hard to find.


I ain't no spiritual superman.

Don't always give a shiny, bright example

of what a believer ought to be.


I ain't never parted the ocean, though I really think I could

if I had the faith of a mustard seed, like the Bible says I should.

I ain't never moved a mountain, I ain't never felt that need.

But the one thing God has tought me to see...


I can have faith

A mountain of hope

I can even speak with tongues of angels

Tell you everyting I know

But it doesn't mean a thing in this world

Without a mighty love


I can be strong

I can stand tall

I can point squarely at the mountain

And command that it be gone

But it doesn't mean a thing in this world

Without a mighty love


I ain't standin' no mount.

I'm not tryin' to preach to ya

and tell you that I've found all the easy answers.

when half the time I can't even

find my keys.


But I feel like a regular Billy Graham

when I start talkin' bout my Jesus,

and all that he's done for me.


Don't you know that I've received forgiveness through no

effort of my own.

I've been given so much mercy, so I'll be the last to throw a stone.

And I apologize, if you think that I'm coming on too strong.

But there's just one thing I want you to know...

Truth it must be blind so I sacrifice my heart to god in prayer lay my

Sometimes this tired old world
Starts bringing my heart down

I'll be following my heart
Following my heart

To the market ten miles away, the journey took its toll
And every day he passed a monastery's high cathedral walls
And it made his life seem meaningless and small

And he wondered how it would be to live in such a place
To be warm, well fed and at peace; to shut the world away

So when he saw a priest who walked, for once, beyond the iron gate
He said, ""tell me of your life inside the place""
And the priest replied

We fall down, we get up
We fall down, we get up
We fall down, we get up
And the saints are just the sinners
Who fall down and get up

Disappointment followed him home; he'd hoped for so much more
But he saw himself in a light he had never seen before

Then there must be some hope for the rest of us
There must be some hope left for us

Bob Carlisle,"Let me tell you 'bout a young boy from Santa Ana
Playing music with the band was the only thing that ever mattered
I never really listened much to rock-n-roll
Grew up on James Brown, Motown and Latin soul
And that's the truth

Se all my homies were of seriouls Latino persuasion
They taught me how to find the groove despite my sole lack of pigmentation
They took a little white boy with shiny shoes
And they anointed me with salsa and rhythm and blues, and

That's the truth, the whole truth, so help me God
I can't pretend to be something I am not
So if my midnight confession seems peculiar to you
Well it may sound crazy but it
Ain't nothin' but the truth

Now me and Jesus had our own kind of understanding
You see He knew I wasn't no choirboy but I guess He wasn't all that demanding
He knew I didn't always walk the line
But He was right there to catch me every time
And that's the truth

You may say it's impossible
""Hey that ain't Butterfly Boy""
I know it sounds so incredible
But it's the truth

I saw the news today

The world seemed to stop

Fear was everywhere

And hope was so lost

In the circus of darkness

May I reply

I see him coming in the sky

Yes, I do

I see him coming in the sky

Watching and praying

And waiting all the day

With all it's abilities

It walks away

God speed that moment when I can stand and cry

I see Him coming in the sky

I see Him coming in the sky

I see Him coming

I see Him coming

Splitting the heavens in the twinkling of an eye

I see Him coming

I see Him coming

I see Him in the sky

I see Him in they sky

People are trying to find what they need

Hopeless illusions, where will it lead?

Well, I've found the answer in the sweet by-and-by

Won't be very long

I'll trade a broken heart for a beautiful song

And the angels singin Egypts lullaby

Bob Carlisle,"Down a cold and darkened hallway
A doctor stood alone
With a young and frightened father
Who knew something was wrong
He said, ""Son this isn't easy
But we really need to talk""
So he put his arm around him
And they began to walk

He said, ""Your wife is finally sleeping
She just needs to be alone right now
And your baby, well she's healthy
But there's something you should know
Son, she's slightly less than perfect
And there's nothing we could do
So before you go to see her
I thought I'd talk to you""

As the young man held the warm 
And sleeping bundle to his chest
He saw the imperfections
And although he tried his best
He couldn't stop the tears from falling
As he held his little girl
And in a low and trembling voice
He gently said these words

""You're beautiful in every way, so beautiful
How I've waited for this day
If the world was offered to me
I just couldn't make the trade
'Cause you're beautiful""

When I think of how I've fallen
And all the tims I tried
To hide my imperfections
From my father's eyes
There's a voice that still is calling
Deep inside of me
And I can always hear it
When I get on my knees

And you're beautiful in every way, so beautiful
How I've waited for this day
When the world was offered to me
I just couldn't make the trade
'Cause you're beautiful

You'd be amazed at how
Some things matter and some things don't
When you're seen through the eyes of God
Though we try to hide our darkness
And fill our dreams
He only sees what's in your heart

And you're beautiful in every way, so beautiful
How I've waited for this day

Bob Carlisle,"You see these work boots in my hands, they'll probably fit ye now my son,
Take them, they're a gift from me, why don't you try them on?
It would do your old man good to see you walking in these boots one day,
And take your place among the men who work upon the slipway.

These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled,
When a feller needs a job and a place in the world,
And it's time for a man to put down roots,
And walk to the river in his old man's boots.

He said, ""I'm nearly done and asking this, that ye do one final thing for me!
You're barely but a sapling, and you think that you're a tree.
If ye need a seed to prosper, ye must first put down some roots.
Just one foot then the other in these dead man's boots.""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They could walk there themselves, and they probably will.
There's a place for ye there to sink your roots,
And take a walk down the river in these dead man's boots.

I said, ""Why in the Hell would I do that? And why would I agree?""
When his hand was all that I'd received, as far as I remember.
It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness up to then ye see.
I'd a plan of me own and I'd quit this place when I came of age September.

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves, and they probably will.
I'd plenty of choices, and plenty other routes,
And he'd never see me walking in these dead man's boots.

What was it made him think I'd be happy ending up like him?
When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left, or a broken pot to piss in.
He wanted this same thing for me, was that his final wish?
He said, ""What the hell are ye gonna do?""
I said, ""Anything but this!""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves and they most likely will.
But they won't walk with me 'cos I'm off the other way,
I've had it up to here, I'm gonna have my say.
When all ye've got left is that cross on the wall?
I want nothing from you, I want nothing at all.
Not a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through,
Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you,
I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more dispute,
And ye'll die before ye see me in your dead man's boots.",Dead Man's Boots,2013
Bob Carlisle,"It's all there in the gospels
The Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects 
But her mind is awhirl when she finds the tomb empty 
The stone had been rolled
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still

""Tell me where are ye going Lord, and why in such haste?""
""Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste!
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
And I have to be there before daybreak
Oh, I cannot be missing, the lads'll expect me

For nothing will stop me, I have to prevail
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale
May the angels protect me if all else should fail

Where the porters, surprised by her lack of Royal baggage,
Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage,
For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility,
And there's none of them famous for their compatibility.
There's a fight over seats, ""I beg pardon Your Grace,
But you'll find that one's mine, so get back in yer place!""

""Aye, but where are they going?"" All the porters debate,
""Why they're going to Newcastle and they daresn't be late,
For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide,
And they've come from all over, from far and from wide.""
There's the old Dalai Lama, aye and the Pontiff of Rome,
Every palace in Europe, and there's nay bugger home.
There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales,
Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails.
""Why, they haven't got tickets,"" ""Come now, it's just a detail,
There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail,
For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail!""

Bob Carter,"What do you do when they turn on the light?
You guard your heart, so they steal your sight
You reach out in blindness, touch the alone
His icicle fingers chill you to the bone

What do you do when the cat gets ya tongue?
No way to tell it's all going wrong
Mouth out the words on the telephone
Nobody answers, nobody's home...

What's done has been done, and I won't be the one
Who despairs in the wheelchair, resigned to ""If only""
No, I'll stand up again and I'll run
I'll jump up till I touch the sun
Because I won't be the one to be bound
By the sound of ""If only, if only, if only""

Well, I reach out in blindness now, but what do I care?
I'll walk into walls and I'll stumble downstairs
I'll laugh like a fishwife, I'll cry like a clown
Up is the only way to go when you're down

When I reach a mountain top, then I start to climb
I'll walk on the water, I'll turn water to wine
Hope is the one thing we got on our side
Hope can be salvaged when all else has died

What's done has been done, and I won't be the one
Who despairs in the wheelchair, resigned to ""If only""
No, I'll stand up again and I'll run
I'll jump up till I touch the sun
Because I won't be the one to be bound
By the sound of ""If only, if only, if only""

",If Only,1980
Bob Carter,"What kind of things are you that deliver papers
White papers that you say apply to me
Reams of rules constructed for protection
Protection for yourselves, but not for me

You hide behind your walls of bureaucracy
I find that you've nothing to do with me
You're all aliens
I opened up my eyes, and saw to my surprise
Monsters in disguise, wearing bowler hats and old school ties

Today you went out to inspect your servants
I saw you wave and rave from my T.V.
You promised soon that they would have a paper
Give them the right to kill quite legally

So you hide in your palace of bureaucracy
I hope that you never come terminate me
You're all aliens
I opened up my eyes, and saw to my surprise
Monsters in disguise, wearing bowler hats and old school ties

I opened up my eyes, and saw to my surprise

",Monsters in Disguise,1980
Bob Carter,"Round and round and round again
Increasing circles, what a fun game!
We think we're different, we're not the same
As you and me and she and he

And we always believed that we're something unique
Our new little rich friends want us in their clique
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

There's you scratching my back, me scratching yours
Rub up the right way, it always ensures
We'll know the right people, open right doors
To the land of the famous incredible bores

And I got no respect for you, you're just a fake
Gave up your lot for a bite of the cake
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

How could we feel? We're so unreal
Stuck at the top of the wheel
You're the sucker who fell for their spiel
You're the crawler who fell for their deal

Your smug little cliches, they get up my nose
Your hair dyed, your fine clothes, they're all for the pose
Naked before me, your cover is blown

Here come the robots, the mindless, the clones
And you sold up our insides, body and soul
Do as you're told now, and we'll play our roles
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

How could we feel? We're so unreal
Stop at the top of the wheel
You're the sucker who fell for their spiel
You're the crawler who fell for their deal

Who needs it?
Find no shelter from that kind of shower
Who needs it?
Nuclear rain, melting my brain
Who needs it - not you, not me, who needs this insanity?

At the top of the tower there's a creature who wants power
Who needs it? (Who needs it?)
If he gets in the dungeon, he could just press the button
Who needs it? (Who needs it?)
He'll flee inside, and you'll have nowhere to hide
Who needs it - not you, not me, who needs this insanity?

Who needs it, who needs it?
I need it like a hole in the head
Don't need it, don't need it
Here comes the era, the era of the living dead

Makes me shiver, 
Makes me quiver, 
This moment I am so unsure, 
This moment I have waited for, 
Well is it something you've been waiting for, 
Waiting for too?

Bare your soul, 
Gather me to you and make me whole, 
Tell me your secrets, 
Sing me the song, 
Sing it to me in the silent tongue.

1.
Je suis né dans la cité
Qui enfante les usines,
Là ou les hommes turbinent
Toute un' vie sans s'arrêter,
Avec leurs haut's cheminées
Qui s'élancent vers le ciel
Comm'pour cracher leur fumée,
En des nuages artificiels.
Et dans le bruit des sirènes
Des hommes vont, des hommes viennent,
C'est la grand'ville qui surgit,
C'est la grand'ville qui surgit.

REFRAIN

Comm' c'est drôle
Ces gens qui marchent dans la rue,
Comm' c'est drôle
La vie perdue dans la cohue,
La sérénade des fauchés
Monte comme une mélopée
La sérénade des gens biens,
Et puis des ceuss' qui n'sont pas bien,
Et moi je les regarde viivre
Et j'trouv' ça drôle.
J'trouv' plus ça drôle.

2. Juste au bout de la cité
On ne voit plus les usines,
On ne voit que la fumée
Des bateaux et leurs machines
Il y a la gru' géante
Qui des quais jusqu'aux bateaux
Avec sa marche obsédante
S'amuse à cracher dans l'eau
On dirait un' drôl' de fête
Où se promène la tempête
Et le Bon Dieu qui est là-haut
Doit trouver ça rigolo.

3. Mais il y' a dans la cité
Une fille à la peau douce,
A la va comm' je te pousse
Un' fill' toujours mal peignée,
Elle a sa rob' déchirée,
Mais j'ai trouvé dans ses yeux
Un bout de ciel égaré
Et qui n'appartient qu'à nous deux,
Je ne vois plus les usines,
Et je n'entends plus les machines
Qui donc se dress' sur la cité ?
C'est l'amour et sa liberté.

Ils faut les voir le jour du rodéo Ya oh ! 
Par les cornes saisir le plus fort toro
Mais quand le jour tombe à l'horizon
Loin de la douceur d'une maison

Refrain :
Dans les plaines du Far-West quand viendra la nuit
Les cow-boy dans le bivouac sont réunis
Près du feu, sous le ciel de l'Arizona
C'est la fête aux accords d'un harmonica
Et leur chant, plein d'amour et de désir
Dans le vent porte au loin des souvenirs
Dans les plaines du Far-West quand viendra la nuit
Les cow-boy dans le bivouac sont réunis

Dans les plaines du Far-West quand viendra la nuit
Les cow-boy dans le bivouac sont réunis
Près du feu, sous le ciel de l'Arizona
C'est la fête aux accords d'un harmonica
Mais bientôt sous la lune aux rayons blancs
Dos à dos et fermant les yeuxd'enfants
Dans les plaines du Far-West quand vient la nuit
Les cow-boys dans le bivouac sont endormis



2EME VERSION :

Sur leurs grands chevaux, ils jouent du lasso ya o !
Bingue, Bongue ! Bingue, bongue !
Rien n'est pour eux plus beau
Sous le soleil qui leur brûle la peau ya o !
Crânement, ils vont sans trêve ni repos,
Qu'ils soient de New York, de Chicago
Ce sont tous des as du rodéo.

Refrain:
Dans les plaines du Far-West, quand vient la nuit,
Les cow-boys près du bivouac son réunis ;
Ils fredonnent au son d'un harmonica
Une vieille chanson de leur beau Texas,
Et leur chant que répètent les échos,
Est scandé par le rythme des banjos.
Dans les plaines du Far-West, quand vient la nuit,
Les cow-boys près du bivouac sont réunis.

Du matin au soir, dans l'immensité, yé é !
Bingue, Bongue ! Bingue, Bongue !
Il faut les voir sauter.
Rien ne les surprend, fleuves ou rochers, yé é !
Courageusement ils bravent le danger,
Mais, dès qu'arrive la fin du jour,
A leur campement ils font retour.

Refrain :
Dans les plaines du Far_West, quand vient la nuit,
Les cow-boys dans le bivouac sont réunis.
Avant de dormir sur leur harmonica,
Ils fredonnent une chanson du Texas.
Le fracas des sabots de leurs chevaux,
Doucement les berce dans leurs repos.
Dans les plaines du Far-West, quand vient la nuit,
Les cow-boys dans les bivouacs sont endormis.",Dans Les Plaines du Far-West,1998
Bob Castella & His Rhythm,"Je suis né avec des yeux d'ange
Et des fossettes au creux des joues
J'ai perdu mes joues et mes langes
Et j'ai cassé tous mes joujoux.
Je me suis regardé dans une glace
Et j'ai vu que j'avais rêvé
Je me suis dit : faudra bien que je m'y fasse...
Tout finira par arriver...

Et je m'en vais clopin-clopant
Dans le soleil et dans le vent,
De temps en temps le cœur chancelle...
Y a des souvenirs qui s'amoncellent...
Et je m'en vais clopin-clopant
En promenant mon cœur d'enfant...
Comme s'envole une hirondelle...
La vie s'enfuit à tire-d'aile...
Ça fait si mal au cœur d'enfant
Qui s'en va seul, clopin-clopant...

Tout l'amour que l'on a vu naître...
Tes lèvres douces, parfum de miel...
Nos deux fronts contre la fenêtre...
Nos regards perdus dans le ciel...
Le train noir hurlant dans la gare...
Le monstrueux désert des rues...
Tes mots d'adieu, tes mots bizarres...
Depuis dix mois, tu n'écris plus...

Et je m'en vais clopin-clopant
Dans le soleil et dans le vent,
De temps en temps le cœur chancelle...
Y a des souvenirs qui s'amoncellent...
Et je m'en vais clopin-clopant
En promenant mon cœur d'enfant...

Ça fait si mal au cœur d'enfant
Qui s'en va seul, clopin-clopant...",Clopin-Clopant,2002
Bob Castella & His Rhythm,"Es milliers des milliers et des milliers d'années
Ne sauraient suffire pour dire
La petite seconde d'éternité
Où tu m'as embrassé
Où je t'ai embrassée
Un matin dans le lumière de l'hiver
Au parc Montsouris
À Paris
À Paris sur la Terre
La Terre qui est un astre

À Paris
Quand un amour fleurit
Ça fait pendant des semaines
Deux coeurs qui se sourient
Tout ça parce qu'ils s'aiment
À Paris

Au printemps
Sur les toits les girouettes
Tournent et font les coquettes
Avec le premier vent
Qui passe indifférent
Nonchalant

Car le vent
Quand il vient à Paris
N'a plus qu'un seul soucis
C'est d'aller musarder
Dans tous les beaux quartiers
De Paris

Le soleil
Qui est son vieux copain
Est aussi de la fête
Et comme deux collégiens
Ils s'en vont en goguette
Dans Paris

Et la main dans la main
Ils vont sans se frapper
Regardant en chemin
Si Paris a changé

Y'a toujours
Des taxis en maraude
Qui vous chargent en fraude
Avant le stationnement
Où y'a encore l'agent
Des taxis

Au café
On voit n'importe qui
Qui boit n'importe quoi
Qui parle avec ses mains
Qu'est là depuis le matin
Au café

Y'a la Seine
A n'importe quelle heure
Elle a ses visiteurs
Qui la regardent dans les yeux
Ce sont ses amoureux
À la Seine

Et y'a ceux
Ceux qui ont fait leur nids
Près du lit de la Seine
Et qui se lavent à midi
Tous les jours de la semaine
Dans la Seine

Et les autres
Ceux qui en ont assez
Parce qu'ils en ont vu de trop
Et qui veulent oublier
Alors y se jettent à l'eau
Mais la Seine

Elle préfère
Voir les jolis bateaux
Se promener sur elle
Et au fil de son eau
Jouer aux caravelles
Sur la Seine

Les ennuis
Y'en a pas qu'à Paris
Y'en a dans le monde entier
Oui mais dans le monde entier
Y'a pas partout Paris
Voilà l'ennui

À Paris
Au quatorze juillet
À la lueur des lampions
On danse sans arrêt
Au son de l'accordéon
Dans les rues

Depuis qu'à paris
On a pris la bastille
Dans tous les faubourgs
Et chaque carrefour,
Il y a des gars 
Et il y a des filles
Qui, , sans arrêt,
Sur les pavés
Nuit et jour, 
Font des tours
Et des tours
A paris !",Á Paris,2004

Et je fais ""Oh !"",

C'est si bon
De partir n'importe ou,
Bras dessus, bras dessous,
En chantant des chansons.
C'est si bon
De se dir' des mots doux,
Des petits rien du tout
Mais qui en disent long.

En voyant notre mine ravie
Les passants, dans la rue, nous envient.
C'est si bon
De guetter dans ses yeux
Un espoir merveilleux
Qui donne le frisson.

Tell'ment, tell'ment c'est bon.

De pouvoir l'embrasser
Et pui de r'commencer
A la moindre occasion.
C'est si bon
De jouer du piano
Tout le long de son dos
Tandis que nous dansons.

C'est inouï ce qu'elle a pour séduire,
Sans parler de c'que je n'peux pas dire.
C'est si bon,
Quand j'la tiens dans mes bras,
De me dir'que tout ça
C'est à moi pour de bon.

Des jours heureux où nous étions amis
En ce temps-là la vie était plus belle
Et le soleil plus brûlant qu'aujourd'hui

Tu vois, je n'ai pas oublié
Les feuilles mortes se ramassent à la pelle

Et le vent du Nord les emporte
Dans la nuit froide de l'oubli
Tu vois, je n'ai pas oublié

C'est une chanson qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais, et je t'aimais

Bob Castella & His Rhythm,"Un gamin d'Paris, c'est tout un poème
Dans aucun pays, il n'y a de même
Car c'est un titi, petit gars dégoudi que l'on aime
Un gamin de Paris, c'est le doux mélange

D'un ciel affranchi du diable et d'un ange
Et son oeil hardi s'attendri devant une orange
Pas plus haut que trois pommes
Mais lance un défi à l'aimable bonhomme

Qui l'appelait mon petit
Un gamin de Paris, c'est une cocarde
Bouton qui fleurit dans un pot d'moutarde
Il est tout l'esprit, l'esprit de Paris qui musarde

Pantalon trop long pour lui
Toujours les mains dans les poches
On le voit qui déguerpit
Aussitôt qu'il voit un képi

Un gamin de Paris, c'est tout un poème
Dans aucun pays, il n'y a de même
Car c'est un titi, petit gars dégourdi que l'on aime
Il est l'héritier, lors de sa naissance

De tout un passé lourd de conséquences
Et ça il le sait, bien qu'il ignore l'histoire de France
Sachant que sur les places, pour un idéal
Des p'tits gars pleins d'audace

À leur façon firent un bal
Un gamin d'Paris, rempli d'insouciance
Gouailleur et ravi de la vie qui chante
S'il faut peut aussi comme Gavroche

Entrer dans la danse
Un gamin d'Paris m'a dit à l'oreille
Si je pars d'ici, sachez que la veille
J'aurai réussi à mettre Paris en bouteille.

Bob Catley,"Drawn by the sound of that wild raving pound
No one has told me
I gotta know all about hell and below
They never told me
The quest for nexus
In your life and for all that's beyond

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more and the more
That I want to know
I know what I'll never know

From far away, from the state of decay
You've come to wisdom
Many've been led, into madness instead
Toll of my kingdom
The quest for nexus has brought
Many men of genius to insanity

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees

Then you're asking for more, and the more that
You want to know
You know what you'll never know

As long as you long for the whole
You can't get a part of at all
How proud would the buildings of Rome
Look without a single stone

Smiles at me

Wind in her hair
Need to catch my breath
Hold her there just for a while
And as we walk I still hear the rhyme
Now I'm lost in her beatiful mind

""They call me the lady
Close your eyes I'll be there
So fall asleep your soul I'll keep
I'm the answer to your prayer""

Right or wrong
Tell me is it the cure
And as I sleep I still hear the rhyme
Still lost in her beautiful mind

Close your eyes I'll be there
So fall asleep your soul I'll keep
I'm the answer to your prayer""

Oh I take what you give
Without you I can't live

And the price that I pay
Is to live all my days

Bob Cats,"This is the story of a young girl
Who was the hippest chick in town.
They call her Big Noise from Winettka.
Miss Birdie's sure to get around.
Big Noise flew in from Winnetka,
Stole each fellow's heart and then
Big Noise flew in from Winnetka,
Big Noise flew right out again.
Stop! Look! Listen! Here comes the Big Noise!
Stop! Look! Listen! Here comes the Big Noise!

I am the one they call the Big Noise.
I'm looking fine and feeling sharp.
I just flew in from Winnetka, don't you know?
I'm gonna blow this joint apart!

I got my high heels! I don't need no wheels!
My footwork is an art!
You know the joint is jumpin',
My heart is pumpin',
And this is just the start!
Whoa! I was a big noise from Winnetka,
I'll be a big noise in your heart!
Whooooa!

Tempting when she's walkin',
Tempting when she's talkin'!
Listen to her squakin'!
There she goes 'round again,
Up and then down again,
In and then out, ooooh, bop!

""Hi! Welcome to another foul evening with the Divine Miss M! 
""After many a summer dies the swan,"" 
But not when their stuck in a turkey as big as this one! 
Watch us as we scratch and claw out hour 
Upon the stage in yet another feeble-minded attempt 
To turn chicken shit in to chicken salad. 
Make no mistake about it, eggs will be laid tonight! 
Ain't that right girls? Oh, my girls. 
My three favorite schochkies on the breakfront of life. 
I'll never forget the first time I found these girls, 
Selling their papayas on 42nd Street. So flushed, so filthy. 
The astonishing verbal abuse they heaped upon me made me certain 
We were destined to share the stage someday. 
Not only are my girls fine singers and dancers, 
Not only are they gorgeous and talented, 
But they also think I'm god! 
Ain't that right, girls? 
They function as a greek chorus. 
These girls don't know shit about Euripides, 
But they know plenty about Trojans. 
Ladies and gentlemen, a rousing hand for the semi-classical 
Harlettes! Laides! 
Alright girls, sing 'em your siren song, go ahead. 
Turn them men into pigs. Not the band, you idiots. 
Those, that bunch right over there in the front row. 
Not much of a challenge, huh? 
This group is already well on its way to oink oink land. 
Oops, so sorry. Once again behaving in a manner I had sworn to aschew. 
Thank you. Once again falling into the vat of vulgarity. 
Oh tut tut. I did so want to leave my sordid past behind and emerge 
Form this project beathed in a new and ennobling light. 
I wanted to come out and be the sweet, pure, honest, 
Unadorned person that I really really am. 
I wanted to show you the good beneath the gaudy, 
The saint beneath all this paint, the sweet, pure, 
Winsome little soul that lurks beneath this lurid exterior. 
But fortunately, just as I was about to rush down the path 
To repectability and righteousness, 
A wee small voice called out to me in the night 
And reminded me of the motto by which I've always tried to live my life: 
F$CK 'EM IF THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE!""

[From the soundtrack:] ""Hi! ""After many a summer dies the swan,"" 
But not when she's stuck in a turkey the size of this one!

I am the one they call the bi-I-I-I-g noise!
I am a living work of art!
I just flew in from Winnetka, daddy-o!
I'm gonna blow this joint apart!

Everyone has a bit of big noise in his heart.
Everyone loves a little sin.
Well, I'm gonna be the first girl in the line
When the festivities begin!

I was a scandle, too hot to handle!

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

I've never done before (You're up too late, please, it sure is late)
(Miss, you'll catch a cold)

I'll never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he (Put down your book, the work'll keep)
Began to dance with me (Now settle down and go to sleep)
I could have danced, danced, danced all night

(I understand, dear)
(It's all been grand, dear)
(But now it's time to sleep)

I could have danced all night
I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more
I could have spread my wings
And done a thousand things
I've never done before

I'll never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced all night",I Could Have Danced All Night,2010
