The Bobs,"I know that you have gone
But to me you linger on
'Cause i see you everywhere
Your footprints on the carpet
Your fingerprints on glasses
The bathroom sink still clogged up with your hair
You were messy from the day I met you
You even told me that you had no sense of smell
I'm so sorry that I ever tried to change you
I'm even sorrier that you said, ""Go to hell.""
I scrub and wash and dust but your memory lingers
Here in my heart your stains remain
And I'm afraid I'll never clean forget you
Please come back and mess me up again
When you split, well I started cleaning
I tried to lose myself in busiwork
But every little smudge just makes me think of you
Maybe you're right I guess I am an anal jerk
You were messy from the day I met you
You even told me that you had no sense of smell
I'm so sorry that I ever tried to change you
I'm even sorrier when you said, ""Go to hell.""
I scrub and wash and dust but your memory lingers
Here in my heart your stains remain
And I'm afraid I'll never clean forget you
Please come back and mess me up again
And I'm afraid I'll never clean forget you
Please come back and mess me up again",Mess Me up Again,1994
The Bobs,"In the white room with black curtains near the station.
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes.
Dawn light smiles on you leaving, my contentment.

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

You said no strings could secure you at the station.
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
I walked into such a sad time at the station.
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.",White Room,1994
The Bobs,"Excuse me"" she said, it took him by surprise
That first taste was bitter and sweet
They had to share a table by the window
Backpacks sitting like hounds at their feet
Her lips were redder than a new Miata
His mustache held flecks of foam
They hung out in the corner cafe
Tapping on a laptop, don't they have a home?
 In the morning that fine aroma
 Wakes me from a nightly coma
 In a cup or in a mug
 Coffee is my favorite drug
All around people are getting wired
The room is ringing you can hardly hear
A caffeine current running in his veins
He moves over to whisper in her ear
Drummin' on the table he sings a little song
Her fingers dance in a delicate way
Talking and tasting turns to touching
Coffee breaking is the highlight of the day
 In the morning that fine aroma
 Wakes me from a nightly coma
 In a cup or in a mug
 Coffee is my favorite drug
 Let the buzz of conversation
 Be a steaming background sound
 Can the jukebox -- fan the chatter
 Aiming for a higher ground --
 They're gonna do it
After two weeks meeting for a cup
They have an outing of a different kind
At her apartment they can't open up
That fire in the body is only in the mind
They need much more stimulation
Pump the pressure -- perk em up
Espresso aphrodisiac
Hope to get the juices flowing with another cup
 In the morning that fine aroma
 Wakes me from a nightly coma
 In a cup or in a mug
 Coffee is my favorite drug",Cafe,1995
The Bobs,"Elwood Decker died the other day
He was abstractly struck by a train
He lived in Nipomo but he painted his own way
He was tragically killed in the rain
For 88 years he walked on the track
For 88 years he never looked back
Now he's gone, that's the end of Moy Mell
He's gone and there's no more to tell",Elwood Decker,1995
The Bobs,"Meat on the Moon
A barbecue tune
It's out of this world
I hope we get there soon
Stranded by Apollo Seven
I'm a hungry astronaut

Left alone up here in heaven
munching what I brought, no burgers to be bought
I long for lunar butchers carving every kind of cut
Flanks and chops and roasts and brisket
loin and tongue and butt
Meat on the Moon
A barbecue tune

It's out of this world
I hope we get there soon
Back on Earth too many people go without their daily bread
Don't they know that they don't need to
they could all be fed by herds above their head
Lift the livestock up in rockets 
beam them to a better place

Pork has left the planet, pigs in outer space
Meat on the Moon
Baloney balloon
It's out of this world
I hope we get there soon

Aliens in cowboy hats
Aliens ropin' calves
Aliens they work for cheap
Aliens they don't need sleep
Aliens are milking cattle up on the milky way
At night the stars don't twinkle

Yippee ti yi yo yippee ti yippee yeh
Suited up in silver helmets cows are grazing in the grass
Gravity is but a rumor
Move that mighty mass, lord, they're free at last
Moos and oinks and squawks are muted
There's no barnyard sound

In a vacuum you can't smell the things
they drop around
Meat on the Moon
Braunschweiger balloon
It's out of this world
I hope we get there soon",Meat on the Moon,1995
The Bobs,"We had a spark and we had fire
Kisses that sizzled on our lips
Beatnik poets rolled their own
Rich folks had filter tips
We had time enough to live forever
You lit me up with every beer
Devil may care like Bogey and Bacall
With a wink, a flick and a sneer
Now I'm only smoke
A faded second hand joke
Now I'm only smoke
Why am I banned from public places?
Made to hang round outside?
Tell me what it was I did to you
I never cheated and I never lied
Now I'm only smoke
A faded second hand joke
Now I'm only smoke",Smoke,1995
The Bobs,"Barking and grunting and shouting like fools
In stairwells and bathrooms and dry swimming pools
Places where reverb resounds with a ring
Why do the cops come when we start to sing?

At the party we were wailing
It was getting late and we were getting pretty pissed
We hit a chord and how it buzzed
It felt as good as being kissed

The four of us have a group
But we're not always a hit
Sometimes the guests aren't too impressed
The ask us ""please"" won't you quit all that

Barking and grunting and shouting like fools
In stairwells and bathrooms and dry swimming pools
Places where reverb resounds with a ring
Why do the cops come when we start to sing?

We took ourselves out to the parking lot
And tried to find that sweet sound again
""Cut out that noise"" the next door neighbor yelled
As he turned his stereo up to ten

There's a place for us
Somewhere where we'll find our sound
An empty church with a holy echo
Or a subway tunnel underground, we'll be

Barking and grunting and shouting like fools
In stairwells and bathrooms and dry swimming pools
Places where reverb resounds with a ring
Why do the cops come when we start to sing?

At four in the morning if your window's open
We'll be crooning in your dreams
Searching for chords and moaning the blues
Sorry if it sounds like screams

Barking and grunting and shouting like fools
In stairwells and bathrooms and dry swimming pools
Places where reverb resounds with a ring
Why do the cops come when we start to sing

The Bobs,"Is it something that I said
That's made you feel bad?
I'm so sorry that I hurt you and made you so sad.
Is it something that I said?

A year ago I was a happy man.
She was my supervisor at the post office,
But she was also my secret lover and my friend.
And then that other mail man came between us,
He's the one that brought  our happiness to an end.

I surprised them together in the package room.
She  jumped and said, ""Baby, it's not what you think, we were only sorting.""
But he was kissing on her and she had her hands in his mail pouch...
Tears fogged my vision, I felt  a burning pain in my throat,  I punched out
my time card and went  home and got my pistol.

I drove my step van  back and parked in a handicap! zone  and charged to the
main counter -- I didn't even take a number --and there he was all ready for
his route, and I yelled ""Here, hold this!"" and ""POP,"" I plugged him and the
postal patrons all dove for the floor crying ""help""and ""not again"" and she
came around the corner and ""POP, POP"" I plugged her twice and she went down.

...and as she lay there she rolled over and looked at me again with those
big brown eyes and whispered with her last breath....

Is it something that I said
That's made you feel bad?
I'm so sorry that I hurt you and made you so sad.
Is it something that I said?

As I sit here today preparing my defense - diminished capacity caused by an
overdose of Rogaine -  I can see her face before me and I'm sorry when I
hear her ask me.....

That's made you feel bad?

I can see where I'd like to be.
But  repeated blows to my feathered little head
Have taught me not to fly straight.a",Like a Parrot,1997
The Bobs,"If you ever finish college
You'll have lots of knowledge
You can use to social benefit,
You'll make a lot of money,
Never talk to me
Why not try right now?

If you drive yourself to be successful
You could find it stressful,
Break out in a  rash
You shouldn't scratch it in a meeting
With your supervisor
Why not try right now?

That's how it will be - You won't have time for me

By next Friday you will be a robot
Who will work and work
And never lie around relaxing
Drinking tea and watching MTV
Why not try right now?

Bye and bye manana
We will die na na na
Never taste the sweet pie
In the sky blah blah blah
We should try before we say goodbye
Wah Wah Wah 
Why not try right now?

That's how it will be - You won't have time for me
There's no future in my fantasy of how it's gonna be so why not right now?",Why Not Try Right Now?,1997
The Bobs,"I've been around the world
Had my pick of any girl
So you'd think I'd be happy
But I'm not
Everybody knows my name
But it's just a crazy game
Oh, it's lonely at the top

Listen to the band playing just for me
Listen to the people paying just for me
Oh, all the applause and all the parades

And all the money that I made
Oh, it's lonely at the top

Listen, all you fools out there
Go on and love me
I don't care
It's lonely, oh, it's lonely
Ah einsam
It's lonely at the top",Lonely at the Top,1998
The Bobs,"I am a lonesome hombre
I spend my time driving my truck around town on Saturdays
I moved here from the city
I thought that maybe
All of my luck would change here in Boomtown
But it seems my face is wrong
I don't fit in
'Cause I don't have
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips, 
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips ...

Cowboy lips are all right, all right by me
Strap me on a pair of lips and I'll leave you be
High in the saddle, my Chapstick in hand
Through snow and wind and rain and sleet and sand,
Cowboy Land...

When I'm with all my buddies
My snakeskin boots and my belt buckles shine
But they won't talk to me
Even when I know their song I'm in the wrong key
'Cause I don't have
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips, 
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips ...

Cowboy lips are all right, all right by me
Jack Palance has got a sneer that's collagen-free
If I had his mustache I'd wax up the tips
To keep it off my cowboy lips, cowboy lips

When I'm out honky-tonkin'
I smoke my Marlboros with the filters off
It makes me cough
I can stomach Lone Star Beer
But not shots of rye
Rye can only get by
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips, 
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips ...

Cowboy lips are all right, all right by me
Painted, pierced and puckered are for sissies, you see (I likes 'em)
Weathered and blistered and kissed by her brand
The kind of lips they wear in Cowboy-- 
(Way up there in Cowboy--)
Lots of facial hair in Cowboy Lannnnnnnd ...

The Bobs,"I was sensitive before it was in style
But that was never enough
Ever new philosophy that you'd adopt
Seemed to make sense to me too
When we tripped together I thought we were in love
When I saw colors, you saw pigs
Then you took me to the sit-in at the pentagon
How you opened up my eyes
You got into knowing yourself
I got into knowing myself
Everything I did was
Everything you did
I always was one step behind
In my personal growth
When we pulled the last troops out of Vietnam
I thought you'd have more time for screwing
How could I have been so blind to women's rights and such
There's always so much to be doing
It was so hard for me to give up wearing fur
But in my heart I feel much better
The whales are safe for now, but Nicaragua burns
I just can't share your concern any more
Just give some attention to me
The world is o.k., let it be
Just give some attention to me
Please let me be your third world country
And I'll be:

Donate all your co-op dividends to me

Hold a benefit for me, a benefit for me

You and Jackson Browne can write a song for me

The Bogmen,"I haven't seen you since the big burn
Now you look like a Boston fern
We had a pig roast with the earth
and it spun on its axis like a pig on a spit

The older you get - the younger you look
Slide me a rexipe from your cookbook
It's all lies - it's all axioms
but thats life in a microwave

Sign today
In a microwave - sign today

Button your lip - you're talking out of turn
Another cell out of your brain - another marble from the urn
Certain things we can't replace
Once you're a raisin you can never be a grape

The entire world is counting on a team of scientists
to figure the solution if they do indeed exist
Fallacy and fantasy and anonymity turned on us all at once
Viola! Viola!
Fricassee - rock soup every day
You can read it in the dead sea discs
You can read it in the dead sea discs

I really don't know what I'm going to have to say
It's only the beginning of a shitty day
What am I to do - and how am I to prepare
For the loneliest beginning on this day of despair

I haven't seen you since the big burn
No you look like a Boston fern

The Bogmen,"Colorblast the beautiful 
I feel antsy and political
Always doubt the cynical  
They want to ruin the world

The air is so polluted, like Poseidon's halitosis
All the bellies that are blowing it
Whose necks are hung with pearls

The time of our arrival
Is key to our survival
And I have not yet been bitten
By the flies of pessimism

Castigate the criminals
Bury the subliminal
The overflow of undertow 
Has got us by the balls

But I don't care about negative 
It sells but doesn't sacrifice
And why should we all pay the price 
To build these prison walls

The time of our arrival

As the burden gets lighter the man become able

A hole in my shoe - my skin hits the ground

Not about worry - ""In a hurry?"" - make things blurry 
Clear above the clouds all the time

You've created your boundaries - it's okay to explore them 
Within the fences in your head 
But if you stray outside you'll wind up dead 
Tell me of your childhood 
Did you learn to take a shit right? 
Did you always wear your pants too tight? 

Was it insubordination? 
An Oedipus relation? 
Why'd you slay your daddy? 
Why'd you total the caddy? 
You've gone above the clouds - you've left the okay corral and now 
I'm sitting in the lower - talking you down to the runway

Although you've pioneered those natives in those dark undiscovered 
lands inside your head are waiting to pounce on you

revived

The Bogmen,"I just finished putting my seventh drink away
A week now since her death and a drink for every day
Soon it will be fifty and I won't be worrying about ulcers

No longer do I dream and my mind is far away
I'm thinking like an animal - almost unconsciously
Soon I'll be nocturnal and knocking over your garbage

And I'll walk and I'll find solace
And the sun will shine upon me like a mother keep me warm - my pulse
   goes...

I see hallucinations of figures like yourself
I feel like I'm on acid and you're alive and well
Hope you get well soon - wait 'til you see your new grandson

We'll walk and we'll part in a nice way
Because  I don't think I was ready when you left so suddenly
And if I could just set this date up
It would out my mind at ease to say the things I had failed to say
and my pulse would slow hut hut hut hut hut hut...

Dirty water
Drink it all down - smell the surprise

I just finished putting my fiftieth drink away
I think I've been patient and waiting for this day
I'll have another before I go into the party

I think I've been patient in waiting for this day
After putting my fiftieth drink away
Forget the girl and take the drink like a real man

Out of the door and on to the new day for the day

I'll just step back and study the dance - these feet are not ready to
lead
I'll step back and study the dance - these feet are not ready to lead

Light a candle for me - I haven't yet gotten to the end of this maze
There are no jeanie escapes - your rubs would all be in vain
But you could relieve me of my pain - by lighting a fire in my name

The Bogmen,"Suddenly a woman leaves me - I've got no job - a machine relieved me
Suddenly I've lost my piece of pie
I'm now in mourning and I wear all blue
That's the color you wear when the dead one's you

Suddenly I am living in a lie
My woman's off with some other guy
I can remember the first time I saw her. 
She was hanging out in one of those singles bars. 
Wearing a really fancy dress 

Drinking a really expensive mixed drink smoking one of those 
Marlboro 100's with the big fancy plastic filters on the end 
Made her look like she had class, least I thought so. 
But then suddenly the bitch left me 

All of a sudden like something suddenly
Suddenly I'm on my own
I don't hear no rings on the telephone
And all the rings I've given her have been returned
I cling to clothes she used to wear

Then I try them on and style my hair
Suddenly I could never be as fine as she
I've got her eyes 
But I sure don't have her teeth

I can remember when we would take walks around the public pool  
and the way she would look at me - and the way she would do this 
whistle and how I would feel - I'm gonna try and show you what it was 
like 

Suddenly I found myself drinking from the lowest shelf
And all of a sudden I just could not believe my eyes
There goes some guy walking down the street wearing my tie
Suddenly I'm not gonna let another man take my woman. 

Not even death can do us part. Because when I'm an angel 
I'm gonna come down from heaven and I'm gonna buy her a brand new Cadillac 
I'm gonna buy her a brand new Cadillac

Let me tell you why, let me tell everybody why
Because in the 50's it was pompadours 
And in the 60's it was peace
In the 70's bellbottoms, I don't know why 
In the 80's Ronald Reagan, BMW's 

Sushi, back home we used that for fertilizer, but in the 90's LOVE  
Love is the new fad, I love you, good God almighty I love you Ya

The Bogmen,"Dear Mr. Good I'm writing to tell you about my child
He's in the fifth grade and very dangerous
He thinks he's smarter than you and I and everybody else

So play him as a Maestro would play a cheap violin
Let him think he's the ringleader
Then in mid-circus pull the rug out from under him

My fear is that he's nearing the third rail
He's kneeling to another angry idol
And I can see it as his face is getting pale
That he's on his way out of this world

This sudden spat of insanity - needs a good fat dose of humility
Otherwise a dictator will arise in class and rule by fear
So before he gets too old to know what we're doing right now
Before he gets too old to turn a deaf ear - turn it back my way

My fear is that he's nearing the third rail
He's kneeling to another angry idol
And I can see it as his face is getting pale
He's getting nowhere on no one's referrals
Getting nowhere on no one's referrals

He's on his way out of this world

The Bogmen,"He says that he's an honest man
Taxes not included
He's pinstriped and naturally tan
Tan from all of the shine he's running under your noses

He says that he's a moral man
It's easy when you've got the money

What's so great about that when you control the law?

Let me see your hands this particular fellar
Says he's a religious man
And he sips his wine with reverence
His faith is locked in the can

And he drinks it down until it's almost empty
There's a rumor this one's a second-class man
And pushed into the corner
It's all part of the suppression plan

This is after he ditched his wife and family

You say that you're a hard working man
And the rest of the world is lazy

You lead the world in production

It tastes just like it smells
From the first bite I could tell the cake was poison

Now in order to get around in a matter that's sound
I have to throw all suckers
But the thing that sucks is that it only works once
On one dumb sucker
And it tastes just like it smells
From the first bite I could tell the cake was poison

I don't know why...
I took that bite...

With moves like an alley cat - ""Hey are you gonna finish that?""
We'll be knocking over garbage cans
But if they're home there'll be a change in plans

I'm a habit former - should I structure my life 
With all good habits and a motherly wife?
It's just another excuse so I can never grow up
And can pee in my pants like a two-week-old pup
In my eyes my tears are all wellared
And I'm proud to admit that I'm a cowardly fellar
You'll be taken care of if you admit that you're yellar
Admit that you're yellar you admit that you're yellar
You're yellar - you're yellar - you're yellar - you're yellar

When your brought up and stung like ooh and I can see your pain
Young thugs stay focused cause we can get this money young thugs
Even though the end of days are comin' (comin') we can get it right
Right now do somethin' for somebody just hold on for me I promise
There's a better place for all us t-h-you-g's if he don't believe
Then, don't call yourself a thugs cause thugs believe who don't
Believe, who don't believe

Victim of the struggle everyday tryin' to piece this puzzle and every
Second I'm out on the hustle I sit and I guzzle hopin' reality'll

We love the Reggae and Jazz, the Rock n Roll could be cool, Alternative too/ We love the Rhythm and Blues/ But I'm a Hip-Hop Baby, from the heart, I never flip flop baby

-Layzie Bone-
If it wasn't for my music, tell me where would I be? (Where would I be?)/ Prolly standin on the hot block, sellin crack rock, runnin them streets, runnin them streets/ I say ""My music is my best friend, my confidant""/ I love the way we live us one together we the perfect bond/ Me and my radio, doin 90 on the freeway, knowin the way to go/ And I like to feel the rhythm, the beat be bumpin, don't it? And I love to give it to y'all, because I know you want it/ And if you feel like I feel, you love the Rhythm and Blues, Reggae and Jazz the Rock n Roll could be cool/ But, I'ma Hip-Hop baby, this from the heart, I never flip-flop baby/ Give me a drank and a song and I be stress free kickin it, all night long

-Krayzie Bone-
It ain't nothin like Hip-Hop music/ Careful how you use it and please don't abuse it, when you do it/ Music can keep you party people dancin and put your mind in a trancin, keep ya happy, give it a chance come on/ Just flow with the music, get blowed off the music/ When I was 13, like Dr. King ya had dream' to be one of the greatest musicians alive/ To be remembered, when I die/ I love, I love, music...it's got me stayin alive/ And if you took my mic right now, one thing you'll never do is take my love away/ Cause I'm a Hip-Hop baby, from the heart I never flip-flop baby

-Chorus-
-Bizzy Bone-
Tossin and turnin, I'm burnin with different melodies, words my niggas tellin me sellin it to the world/ Been rappin, since the day I heard Rakim, and Dana Dane, Doug E Fresh, Slick Rick, always been a singer mayne/ Late night foster home, workin on perfection my selection of the songs that I heard was my direction/ It's when Tommie was my girlfriend, rolled or go back/ Said ""I'm the baddest mama jamma"", half white and black/ Have my babies: D'Jodecy, sick with Serena, little breed born Bryon, Miss Moe, and Shanika/ Little Trey-Trey, Destiny, and plus Aaliyah, and the newest one is Shelby/ I can't wait till I see em (Dada), they are the music in my physical form since they was born, I've been singin wit tears in my eyes as I perform, for the whole world/ Until I die like Confuscious, tell the world my name is Bryan, I'm in love with my music/ (Yea, uh) Cause I'm a Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop

-Layzie Bone-
Now everybody got that jam, that make ya get up, want to boogy to the beat now/ And if it wasn't for the drums and the strings and the lyrics that we sing what would life really mean now?/ Would it be just as fun? Would ya, kick it the same? Could ya, live without it? Could ya still maintain? My thang, is crank up the volume because it help me escape from my problems/ Till I solve em', and I'ma solve em'/ It's all music, Bone Thugs music

Bitch I'm flipping work, hand in hand, I think they call it trappin'
Racin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack
Face the fact, there's always niggas out there tryin' to knock the hustle
I guess that's why they say we trap, don't let niggas hold you back

Out for what we all want, lots of L.S.D.
He also had a camel, stole it from a zoo
How he loved the camel, and the camel loved him too
(Oh, how the how the camel loved Ali Bar Bar!)

Ali Baba's camel loved Ali Baba so
No matter where he went to, the camel had to go
Some say that he's in Heaven, but this I know is true

Poor old Ali Baba cursed and swore, because
He was so very thirsty, and everybody knows
It's horrible to walk for miles with sand between your toes

Ali Baba's camel turned round and licked his hand
He said, ""Oh, Ali Baba, I surely understand
We must find an oasis and get a drink somehow
But, hark! I hear the temple bells, they'll all be open now""
(Bleah bleah. Glorious beer, fills you right up with it... aaahh)

They entered for the races at the desert sports
There goes Ali's camel in his filthy cotton shorts
The starter cracked his pistol, off the camel's hared
Ali Baba's camel wins by half a camel's hair
(Hey Ali Baba! Hey Ali Baba!)
(Your camel loves you! Your camel loves you!)

Ali Baba's camel had run for miles and miles
His tail was pointing backwards, that's how a camel smiles
But Ali and his camel, they both were out of breath
They'd run so far, they laughed so much
They laughed themselves to death
[Sounds of crying and wailing)

Oh! Gather round the campfire! Sing a roundelay!
But don't sing out of tune, though
('Cause eggs are cheap today!)
Sing of Ali Baba, sing about his men
Sing about his camel, and then sing it all again

Percy Rawlinson seemed to spend more and more time with his alsatian owl.
His friends told him 
""You should get out more, Percy, or you'll wind up looking like a dog, ha ha.""
He was later arrested near a lampost.
At his trial some months later he surprised everyone by mistaking a policeman for a postman and tearing his trousers off with his bare teeth. 
In his defence he told the court ""It's hard to tell the difference when they take their hats off.""

Mrs Betty Pench was playing the trombone when she heard a knock on the door.
""I wonder who that is at eleven o'clock in the morning"" she thought, but cautiously opened the door and instead of the turbaned ruffian she had expected, she found a very nice young man. 
""Mrs. Pench, you've won the car contest, would you like a triumph spitfire or 3000 in cash?"" He smiled.
Mrs. Pench took the money. ""What will you do with it all? Not that it's any of my business,"" he giggled.

With a geranium behind each ear and his face painted with gay cavalistic symbols, six foot eight seventeen stone police sergeant Geoff Bull looked jolly convincing as he sweated and grunted through a vigorous triscutine at the Fraga Gogo Viachella.
His hot surge trousers flapped wildly over his enormous plastic sandals as he jumped and jumped and gyrated towards a long-haired man. 
""Uh, excuse me, ma'am, I have reason to believe you can turn me on.""
He leered suggestively.
As if by magic dozens of truncheons appeared and they mercilessly thrashed him.
Poor Geoff, what a turnout for the books.

Much as he hated arguments or any kind of unpleasantness, Ron Shir thought things had gone too far when, returning from a weekend in Clapton, he found that his neighbour had trimmed the enormous hedge dividing their gardens into the shape of a human leg.
Enraged and envious beyond belief, Ron seized his garden shears and clipped his white poodle Leo into a coffee table.
""That'll fix it,"" thought Ron, but he was wrong. 
The following Wednesday his neighbour had his bushy waist-length hair cut and permed into a model of the Queen Elizabeth and went sailing. 
Everywhere he went, people said ""Hooray!""

And I wish I could leave

But tonight,
Under the stars
The building's burning bright
A heavy hope
That once was ours
And nevermore

But I'll let go
With nothing left to show
What once slept hard
Will come down
At midnight

But tonight
We'll pull it away
The stars'll be burning bright
Nothing more
But this house
Will tell the story

And I'll let go with nothing left to show
What once slept hard
Will come down
At midnight

The Books,"Thinking clearly never came,
As easy as it did for you,
Driving this route out of town,
I wish you were still around,
And in the dead of night I always,
wondered whether you were true,
Someone better than myself,
An offer you just can't turn down,
A morning fight,
And a wasted night,
You crept back to your room

Run along back to your new man

Limassol, hold on I couldn't trap you,
We're gonna head for new horizons,
Limassol

When its all good keep things close at hand

I could never bear to hear you,
Struggling against the tide,
Promises I couldn't keep,
I couldn't admit I was in too deep
Saw the lights on in your window,
Even though they'd said you'd gone,
The darker nights have come again,
Quicker than the year before
A morning fight,
A wasted night,
You slipped back to your room

You better run away back to your new man

Limassol, hold on I could never catch you,
We're gonna head for new horizons,

When its all good you've gotta keep things close at hand",Pagina Tres,2005
The Books,"Strange face, with your eyes
So pale and sincere
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong

And sing my song
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud",Cello Song,2009

The Boom Circuits,"One more body left all alone
She's made another heart her home
Lost between the sea and the sky
An angel learning how to fly

She floats above our bodies asleep in their graves (Save me from her)
Dancing in the moonlight glow (Save me from her)
Our memories hide in vain hoping they can be saved (Save me from her)
But she leaves the ones that won't let her go (I can't have her, save me from her)
I always hear her voice when she calls
Guided by her tears as they fall
She loves everything and nothing at all

Why does this girl live in my dream
More happy than she's ever seemed (I can't have her, save me from her)
Lost between her moon and her sun
What am I supposed to love (I can't have her, save me from her)
She floats above our bodies left cold in their graves (Save me from her)
Wrapped beneath the moonlight glow (Save me from her)

Our memories die in vain knowing they won't be saved (Save me from her)
She forgot the ones of us long ago (Save me from her)
I always hear her voice when she calls
Getting by her tears as they fall
She loves everything and nothing at all

I've pulled apart my heart
I've taken all the love out (I can't save me from her)

It was a summer I will never forget
You told me you loved me, I told you the same

We had fun for a little while
But right away, I knew it could never last
In five days I'd be back at school
I never knew five days could go by so fast

It felt just like a photograph, a picture in my mind
Now all I have is the memory, it seem so long ago

But tonight, I feel like you are here with me
As I sit here alone, looking at pictures of you

It makes me smile all over again
I wonder if you ever think of me too

The Boomtown Rats,"
Here they go, lying again
Beating everybody at their favourite game
But in the end nobody wins no

Here they go let's pretend the rules have changed but the
Names the same
And in the end nobody wins no

Do you think they don't know what they're doing
Do you think they don't know who they're fooling

When I was a boy and I was told that heaven was hot and hell was cold
If I told lies I'd freeze my soul but it didn't seem to matter

Do you think they don't know what they're doing
Do you think they don't know who they're fooling

There they go lying again
They want it just as much as us
And in the end nobody wins no

There they go lying again
They pulled the wool and we all fell in
And in the end nobody wins no

There they go lying again (you're telling lies)
There they go lying again (you're telling lies)

The Boomtown Rats,"There was a lot of rocking going on that night
Cruising time for the young bright lights
Just down past the gasworks, by the meat factory door
The five lamp boys were coming on strong

The Saturday night city beat had already started
And the, the pulse of the corner boys just sprang into action
And young Billy watched it all under the yellow street light
And said ""tonight of all nights, there's gonna be a fight""

Billy don't like it living here in this town
He says the traps have been sprung long before he was born
He says ""hope bites the dust behind all the closed doors""
And pus and grime ooze from its scab crusted sores

There's screaming and crying in the high-rise blocks""
It's a rat trap Billy, but you're already caught
And you can make it if you wanna or you need it bad enough
You're young and good-looking and you're acting kind of tough

Anyway it's Saturday night time to see what's going down
Put on the bright suit Billy, head for the right side of town
It's only 8 o'clock but you're already bored
You don't know what it is but, there's got to be more
You'd better find a way out, hey kick down that door
It's a rat trap and you've been caught

In this town Billy says ""everybody's trying to tell you what to do""
In this town Billy says ""everybody says you gotta follow rules""

Deep down in her pockets she finds 50p
Hey is that any way for a young girl to be?
I'm gonna get out of school work in some factory
Work all the hours God gave me get myself a little easy money
Now, now, now na na

Her mind's made up, she walks down the road
Her hands in her pockets, coat buttoned 'gainst the cold
She finds Billy down at the Italian cafe
And when he's drunk it's hard to understand what Billy says

In your doorways I have shivered
In your alleys I have gone to ground
But I will be delivered
Someday I will be mercy bound

On a crowded street on a hot summer day
She was alone
Three months late and beginning to show
In a midriff blouse she would soon outgrow
She had no one to call and no way home
And in my mind I knew I'd seen myself
But in our blindness it always seems like someone else
There I was a rag a bone
A remnant in your lost and found
I was for once truly alone
Longing to be mercy bound
And I knew that I would wander
As a child in the forest till they found me
And I called out to them but could not penetrate
The silence all around me
And when I wake I know you'll comfort me
And I won't sleep again for an eternity
But others lie awake at night
In desperation more profound
And the coming of the morning light
Will not see them mercy bound
And some will never dream again

Wishes you and yours the same thing too",Away in a Manger,1998
The Boss Brass,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1998

The Boss Brass,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie

The Boss Brass,"Nothing seemed to matter any more,
Didn't care what I was headed for.
Time was standing still,
No one counted till
There came a knocking at the door.

Love walked right in and drove the shadows away 
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day.
One magic moment, and my heart seemed to know
That love said ""Hello!"",
Though no a word was spoken.

One look and I had found my future at last.
One look and I had found a world completely new,
When love walked in, with you.",Love Walked In,2003
The Boss Brass,"Through the trees comes autumn with her serenade.
Melodies the sweetest music ever played.
Autumn kisses we knew are beautiful souvenirs.
As I pause to recall the leaves seem to fall like tears.
Silver stars were clinging to an autumn sky.
Love was ours until October wandered by.

Let the years come and go, 
I'll still feel the glow that time can not fade
When I hear that lovely autumn serenade.",Autumn Serenade,2004
The Boss Brass,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2005

You find it happens all the time

Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
""I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo""
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man, I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222
I got an answering machine that can talk to you
It goes

Yo, check it, exit the old style, enter's the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear
The tales of limousines and pails
Of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, ""Yo black, just play me the tape""
But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask
""Was it def?""
And with the straighest face I be like, ""Hell yes""
I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul

Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles

All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here bi-da miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing""

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny
Jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me Myself and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like
""Yo I got a tape to play you back at the hotel""
I be like ""Oh swell""
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer
Who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone
She'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem

""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak""
So no problemo, just play the demo
And at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind
Cause I'll just lay it down the line

The Bosshoss,"We jumped onto the van, had this job to do
The other night quite far to go
Put the pedal to the metal, let the engine rattle
Just headin’ for the very next show

Just tryin’ to get a little bit of sleep
But Russ just said ""Boys it’s beer o’clock""

Well, the party in the van just started to boil
We still had one hour to got
When a cop-car passed and they pulled us out
And a little fat sucker just started to shout
""We don’t like you kinda folks around here,
So you better hit the road, fuck off""
So we payed our bill, put the pedal to the metal

We arrived at the club quite late that night
The whole crowd’s waiting for us to start
We played a rock’n’roll show way out of control
Kicked asses and the girls kept fainting in the first row
The party backstage just blew our heads off
Wished that we could have a day-off
But no way, next gig’s quite far to go
So we hopped into the van, put the pedal to the metal
We smelled like a bar, hung over in the car

Warm, sweating, it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top, on at this point
You with a winner so baby you can't loose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun

To make Salt Lake by night

Near the state line

A way cooler space

Hit something slick
About took a spill
On the plateau
In snow axle deep
Still got to Rock Springs

It's all there in you. 

Just like a break in the clouds when the sun come shining through, 
Momentary glimpse of the divine sometimes when I look at you 
And everything just cancels out 
And for that moment there's no doubt 

Dreams of a better life can come true, 
It's all there in you. 

Sometimes a new day can bring a new beginning you took me to a place no time can erase. Yesterday I was a loser, today I'm winning today you're mine and the world is ours. 

Dreams of a better life can come true 
It's all there in you",Better Life,2001
The Bouncing Souls,"""I don't want this anymore""
Is all I heard her say
As I grabbed my stuff
And headed out the door

With my music in my phones
And my bike under my feet
Things started to look different
As I got out on the street

Sometimes I see her face
In the new people that I meet
We're not who we thought we were
When we saw this dream

Sometimes when I just can't sleep
I hear the words you said to me
""How did you get so deep inside of me?""

I wake up and I move on
I admit the past is gone
I wake up and I refine
Moving foward to the next lifetime
I leave it all behind

Sometimes when I just can't sleep
I hear the words you said to me
""Sometimes it takes a painful loss
To realize you are free""

How did you get so deep inside of me?
How did you get so deep inside of me?

Skipping like a broken record, 
I love you all but I gotta get out and change this scenery. 
I've got to find 
What I'm living for, 
I've got to change this life that I'm living.

Nowhere to run from myself, 
No where to hide from the truth
 
I tried to find someone, 
Someone who knew, 
Somebody to give myself to. 
I learned the hard way, 
When you give yourself away 
You give away your life too. 

Nowhere to run from myself, 
Nowhere to hide from the truth 

I tried to find someplace 
That seemed right for me,
I walked the streets until I lost my mind 
And that was

Set me free

Goin' out meeting up at the punk rock show
Where the air is hot and the music is loud

The dough his brother left town with his girl she ain't his girl no more

In his home town ready to burst open into driving burning exploding sound.
And If these walls could sing they would sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk they would say

They would have seen it coming all along, all along, all along

No, she can't turn back!

Stepping through the darkness, it's a new day light.

Tonight!

Stepping out of a Asbury Lanes in a midnight snow.
Standing in a missile town. Feels like it's coming alive
Riots and corruption, New Jersey roots!
These songs were the key to the engines of our growing up.

And we wanna say, thanks to the music in our lives,
forgive ourselves for all those lies.
Send some love to all the lonely,
Don't forget we're all one family.
Thanks to the music in our lives, for helping us to survive.
Lost in one lonely dream, born to run and LIVE FREE!

The sun shines brightly on us this afternoon.
Walking in our own footsteps, a search for something more.

We can't turn back.
No, we can't turn back!

-Oui Monsieur, je le crains
Je me souvins alors 
Des événements vécus la veille
 
Je la reçus au salon
Elle paraissait fort troublée
Les yeux baissés, elle balbutia
Qu'il me fallait l'aider
Son mari l'avait chargée
De venir me demander
De leur prêter une certaine somme
Pour un motif obscur.
 
Je restai stupéfait
Je les savais fort bien nantis
Était-elle par hasard
En train de se moquer
-Voyons, lui dis-je, réfléchissez
En êtes-vous bien certaine
Elle alla même jusqu'à mentir
Qu'il lui avait écrit
 
Je prétendis ne pouvoir
Disposer de telle somme
Elle se mit à trembler d'angoisse
Sa voix se resserrant
-Trouvez-les, je vous en supplie
Mon cousin, trouvez-les
Je dus me rendre à l'évidence
De son réel désarroi.
 
Elle se rendait malade
J'eus pitié d'elle
Vous les aurez tantôt lui dis-je

Thinking about the hard times we've seen.
We've been through it; there ain't nothing but good times ahead. 
I walk into walls, forget things,
Forget too match my clothes; my ears ring.
It circles in my head, did you listen to what I said, now? 
Yeah, Lord now? 

[Chorus]",I See Only Sunshine,1996
The Box Tops,"I keep waiting? 
For you to do something I don't like 
I keep waiting? 
But everything you do, you do all right 
You give me love when I want you; 
You leave me alone when I don't 
Something says I ought to leave you, 
But something tells me I won't 

CHORUS: 
'Cause you keep tightening up on me, and I can't break away 
'Cause you keep tightening up on me, with a sweeter love every day. 
It scares me just a little bit, knowing I'll never be free 
Woman, I'm at your mercy, 'cause you keep 
Tightening up, tightening up, tightening up on me 

Yeah? 
O-o-o? yeah? 
La-la-la? 

Your kind of love? 
Makes it hard for a man to say no to you 
One look at me? 
And I know I've got to go to you 
Even when I'm looking away 
In my mind I can see you 
I ain't sure that I love you, baby, 
But I know that I need you

A town we all know well,
And every Sunday evenin'
Out in her home I'd dwell.

We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town,
I picked a stick up off the ground,
And knocked that fair girl down.

She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry.
""Oh Willy dear don't kill me here,
I'm not prepared to die.""

She never spoke another word
I only beat her more,
Until the ground around me
Within her blood did flow.

I took her by her golden curls
Dragged her 'round and 'round.
Then threw her in the river
That flows through Knoxville town.

You Knoxville girl
With dark and rolling eyes.

I've been hearing all my life
Every night, at sundown
I hear its lonesome cry

When I look through the screen door
I see a rocking chair
My mama's sitting in it
Thinking 'bout that world out there

She wants to go over that mountain
To see what's on the other side
She said, ""I want to go over that mountain
Before the day that I die""

Well she's never set foot
Out of this poor valley holler
Though she talks about her dreams
Of some other way to fly

Eighty seven years of living
And never had much of anything
Is it asking too much to see
A damned old diesel train?

She wants to go over that mountain
To see what's on the other side

Before the day that I die""

Twenty years ago, today
My daddy left this holler
He said, ""I'll be coming back
Tomorrow night""

Of his boot heels in the gravel
Well, he ain't been back since
And he never said goodbye

Hopelessly trying to
Retrace our footsteps in the snow.

And when to let go.

And butterfly blues.
From little acorns you..
You quietly made me..
Made me into you.

Holding it under
My tongue 'til it stings.
From all of my demons
You quietly saved me
Again and again.

And surface again.
Yes, I can feel
And surface again.

Little air bubbles,
Little embolysms grow.

That's what I'd like to know
You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could

It was in the early morning hours
When I fell into a phone call
Believing I had supernatural powers
I slammed into a brick wall

I said hey, is this my problem?
Is this my fault?
If that's the way it's going to be
I'm going to call the whole thing to a halt

You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could
You don't feel you could love me

When I thought I heard this voice say
Say, ain't we walking down the same street together
On the very same day

I said hey Senorita that's astute
I said why don't we get together
And call ourselves an institute

The Boys Choir of Harlem,"I watch the world; it breaks my heart
How many lives are thrown away
To change the world
We'd have to start with each of our children
We'll never stop our ways of war
If we don't stop to love a child
We've got to give them something more
More than we've ever given before

Sing for the children
Take time for the children
And love can be learned if we just teach it
Bring to the children 
A dream to believe in
And then have the strength to help them reach it

I close my eyes
My father's face is always there
Though he is gone
He sees me through my darkest days
He lives here inside of me
If we could give each child that much
The world would be a better place
A tender word and a loving touch
Are a small price to pay for saving the life

Sing for the children
Take time for the children
And love can be learned if we just teach it
Bring to the children 
A dream to believe in
And then have the strength to help them reach it

The children need us now
If you think that they can wait another day
You're wrong as you can be
They have just so long to be children
We must be strong, strong for the children

A single spark can start a fire
A single voice begins the song
That turns the world into a choir
As over and over the voices are raised

Sing for the children
Take time for the children
And love can be learned if we just teach it
Bring to the children 
A dream to believe in
And then have the strength to help them reach it",Sing For the Children,1993
The Boys Choir of Harlem,"Oh, say, can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming
And the rockets red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the, of the brave",The Star Spangled Banner,1995

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

I want your love
I'm trying to show you
Really, really want to know you

I want your love

I got a funny feeling, honey
That you're kinda digging me
But every time you see me
You seem to be ignoring me

I know your name, yes, I do
Because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet
Because your girls showed me

But I'll parlay
And stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant
I'll catch you the next day

When I focus, I notice you
Only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up
With insatiable you

I never figured you
For the quiet type
On the down low
The low profile type

I always thought you
Was a rah rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion
Causing drama

What's the matter, huh
Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung
Or maybe I ain't the one

I want to know cause if I don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up
You got me thinking you want me

I'm standing, picking my brain
Trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me
Where you're coming from

The whole picture is strange
So I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see
Yeah, and I want some

So tell me what's your plot
What's your plan
You're looking for
A rubber to get got
I'm not your man

But believe in me
You want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me
To tell me what it is you see in me

I gotta hear it from you, girl, sometime
The word got around from my crew
In Brooklyn and in the boogie down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date
And wait, swing with me

I got your cards
You're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong
And if it's on
I keep it soft and wet

Let me know cause if you don't
It's gonna haunt me

Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party
Look at all the cuties

I never stumble cause I mumble
And I'm ready to rap
You got me feeling like I'm sleeping
And it's keeping me trapped

But still in all, you want to stroll
And have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's
Something for me to stay away
It was your trip
Scared a grip
Because I'm losing it
I did what's clear
Had it in gear
Now you're confusing it

I had the thought
That you were caught
And you were going steady
Wasn't checking for me
Cause you had a friend already

But I'm-a put it all aside
Cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride
And follow my guide

I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile.
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And, maybe, they'd be happy for a while.

But february made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver.
Bad news on the doorstep;
I couldn't take one more step.

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride,
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died.

So bye-bye, miss american pie.
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Did you write the book of love,
And do you have faith in God above,
If the Bible tells you so? 
Do you believe in rock 'n roll,
Can music save your mortal soul,
And can you teach me how to dance real slow? 

Well, I know that you're in love with him
`cause I saw you dancin' in the gym.
You both kicked off your shoes.
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues.

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck,
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died.

I started singin',
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone,
But that's not how it used to be.
When the jester sang for the king and queen,
In a coat he borrowed from james dean
And a voice that came from you and me,

Oh, and while the king was looking down,
The jester stole his thorny crown.
The courtroom was adjourned;
No verdict was returned.
And while lennon read a book of marx,
The quartet practiced in the park,
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died.

We were singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter.
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter,
Eight miles high and falling fast.
It landed foul on the grass.
The players tried for a forward pass,
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast.

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune.
We all got up to dance,
Oh, but we never got the chance!
`cause the players tried to take the field;
The marching band refused to yield.
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died? 

We started singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Oh, and there we were all in one place,
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again.
So come on: jack be nimble, jack be quick!
Jack flash sat on a candlestick
Cause fire is the devil's only friend.

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage.
No angel born in hell
Could break that satan's spell.
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite,
I saw satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news,
But she just smiled and turned away.
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before,
But the man there said the music wouldn't play.

And in the streets: the children screamed,
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed.
But not a word was spoken;
The church bells all were broken.
And the three men I admire most:
The father, son, and the holy ghost,
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died.

And they were singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

You overlook the bad and
you keep all the good in mind

When we couldn't get on
And tho't I'd have to admit
the feeling was gone
But you just closed your mind
to all the seeds of doubt
And somehow you found a way
to make it all work out

at the close of the day
You gotta a way of lookin'
that sends message my way

And the thing that make me feel so well
is you meant it just for me

It's no fun being left alone

Staying out all night long
Wondering when you'll be back home
Tired of being on my own

Mind trips, I can do without
Mind trips pushing me around
Mind trips turn me upside down

Always talkin' about how good
About how good you can make me feel
How can you tell me it's true love
When you're out there playin' the field

I don't need the pain no more
Break my heart, I'll close the door
Ain't livin' life just like before

Playin' with my heart

There'll be sharp turns and uphills and closed doors
Then she said hold onto your faith
'Cause in this world you've got to go and get yours

So you stand up
Be strong go out there
Hold on to the real thing that matter
'Cause no one's gonna hand it to you on a silver platter
There's no need to feel you're on your own
Just let your intuition guide you through
Take one step toward what you believe
Don't be afraid to make your move

The way you come alive, when you are all alone

Whenever you want it, wherever you want it
Whenever you want it, wherever you want it
Whenever you want it, wherever you want it

Anywhere you are, my love
Let me comfort you, your eyes dripping blue

I'll be the night fly looking for your sin
You be the bright light drawing me in
No room for doubt, so just stubbornly keep on
But for how long?

But for how long?

To be here alone, tonight, tonight
To be here alone, tonight, tonight
To be here alone, tonight, tonight

And I can't say no
Not until I reap the seeds I've sown
Not until I take that long walk home
And stare you down

Words that appeased you
Words were always, dressed up to please you
Promising ""someday"", whispered to you so desperately all night
Walk out the door, get rid of the tells
You say it's okay, but we're kidding ourselves
Trick me to thinking, that you could be all mine
All mine, all mine

To be here alone tonight
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)

I was down you taught me to stand

When I wonder if I'm still alive 

I was dead in the water 
They left me dead in the water

Tell me lies with a tongue like a needle
And every word's shot down my throat
A face like an iron fist

I learned it all by rote

Words of wisdom, from your tyrant mouth

I'm stuck just like a pig
Roasting in your eyes

You better teach me how to live
'cause you make me want to die
You took it all, now you're all I've got

At all of the lives that I never have led
There's one where I stayed with you across the sea
I wonder, do you still think of me?
I carry your image always in my head
Folded and yellowed and torn at the edge
And I've looked upon it for so many years
Slowly I am losing your face

Oh, The ocean rolls us away, away, away
The ocean rolls us away

Sixes and sevens, we live on jet planes
So many faces, I don't know the names
So many friends now and none of them mine
Forgotten as soon as we meet
All of these moments are lost in time

But you caught in my head like a thorn on a vine
To forever torment me and I wonder why
Do I wish I'd never known you at all

Oh, The ocean rolls us away, away, away
The ocean rolls us away

Oh, The ocean rolls us away, away, away
The ocean rolls us away

The sun and the moon, an ocean of air
So many voices and nothing is there
But the ghost of you asking me why, why did I leave?

Until you belong to me
You don't have to be afraid to come my way

I've seen it all time and again
Surprise jumps from behind every corner
So stop before you get roped in

It will become deceptive and make you think you can fit in
And you will look quite pathetic when you become receptive
And then it smacks hard right on the chin

A fall from grace at the speed of a plane
From as high as you'll ever be

Don't get caught now with your head in the clouds
Singing everything's turning out great
'Cause if you decide that you feel good inside
Thing's are surely to change and you know I can't have it that way

So wise up and come to your senses
There's only one way this can end
You can't be seeing things clearly
Or else you'd be covering your skin

It's the strong combination of fear and elation
That makes you not able to think
So get on the right side and forget about the bright side
There's only so much you can take

The signs are out, they're plastered outside of your house
In the hopes that you'll wanna see

Don't get caught now with your head in the clouds
Singing everything's turning out great
'Cause if you decide that you feel good inside
Thing's are surely to change and you know I can't have it that way
Dams do break on the worst of days

The Brent Fischer Orchestra,"She's pulling out the pin
That lets her hair fall down
She's pulling out the pin
She shakes her head
And it goes tumbling

Her smile was out of place
So she swept it off her face

Let me find the words and say them
Like some softly whispered ""Amen""

But she starts to pull away
And the lights begin to dim
Is she thinking of me?
Or is she thinking of him?
She's pulling out the pin…

She's slipping off the hook
Unbuttoning her dress
She's slipping off the hook
There's just enough to make some man a mess
She tears away the veil
With her fingernails

She came out high and kicking
While the band played ""Hey, Good Looking""
Do you hear something ticking?

Did somebody tell her she could really be redeemed?
And could she actually be as desperate as she seems?
She's tearing at the seams
She's going to extremes
Nobody told her it was a sin
So she's pulling out the pin

She's taping up her hands just like a boxer will
And they started laughing
But if looks could kill
She'd take them down right now
She's covering her mouth
With some unholy vow
There's nothing more to say
This is her wedding day

Full of shattered glass and mayhem
Not some softly whispered ""Amen""

While the shock announcement dawns
And the smoke begins to thin
Where the world without ends
And the next one begins

She's pulling out the pin
She's pulling out the pin
She's pulling out the pin",(She Might Be A) Grenade,2013
The Brent Fischer Orchestra,"I stood at the kerb trying not to disturb
The dark carnival crew and a glittering voice
Far off there said, ""Rejoice""
""As the casualties are but few""

Before I forget myself
I could let you loose
But the key won't undo the lock
And the face of the clock
Seemed to merrily mock
These five minutes with you

Mi padre sabía
Y me lo susurro
Vete a Montevideo y espérame ahí
Por dónde empezar?
Escuchando siempre están
Por cinco minutos o mas
Si te atreves

La sirenas lamentan
La plaga que encuentran
Las balas caen
Y te harán desaparecer
El faro oscurece hay poca esperanza
Cinco minutos con vos

The propeller was droning, I woke up alone
They opened the door and they threw me through
And down I went down, like the twist of a screw
Down into the silver, above me the blue
And you stood there waiting but you never knew
Five Minutes With You

They can scatter the earth and find nothing of worth
Wipe out those years of triangular tears
The colors will fly
And the wild wind will cry I'm strapped to that mast
Knowing they wouldn't last for

Then just losing you
Would be my punishment
But in the hour of disgrace
I might see his face
If I could believe

If I could believe
Then I know I might
Sleep all through the night
But how many times must I wake in fright
Nagging doubts still tugging on my sleeve

Where I can tell the time by the color of my skin
And I know my neighbor 'cos he's the one, yes he's the one
Who always turns me in

A woman works the tunnel in the middle of the night
Picking up every lost object in sight
Handbags, toupees, lost legs and fingernails
The black market eats up all your failures
Her transistor offers no salvation or regrets
No pool, no pets, no cigarettes
Just non-stop Disco Tex and the Sex-o-lettes

The Liberation Forces make movies of their own
Playing their Doors records and pretending to be stoned
Drowning out a broadcast that wasn't authorized
Incidentally the revolution will be televised
With one head for business and another for good looks
Until they started arriving with their rubber aprons and their butcher's hooks

There's no name, there's no name
There's no name, there's no name
There's no name, there's no name
For the pain we'll cause you again and again
For the pain we'll cause you again and again

They're hunting us down here with Liberty's light
A handshaking double talking procession of the mighty
Pursued by a T.V. crew and coming after them

And pretend that he is Parson Brown

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made

It's the hap-happiest season of all

There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And carolling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of glories of Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And carolling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories of Christmases long, long ago
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoe-ing and hearts will be glowing
When loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time

The Brian Setzer Orchestra,"You know Dasher and Dancer, Prancer and Vixen
Common and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous Reindeer of all?

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how all the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history?

If you've been good all year, maybe Santa Claus'll visit you

A happy sleigh ride, and a merry, merry Christmas time

The Bridge Project,"Somebody asked me 
Who made the mountains 
Somebody asked me 
Who made the trees 
Have they ever asked who spoke peace to your dying soul 
Well I dare not asked who it was 

Didn't they ask the blind man 
Who gave you eyes to see 
They even said to the impotent man 
Who put life in your legs and feet
Have they ever asked who spoke peace to your dying soul

I am a witness 
It was Jesus 
There's no doubt 
Nobody but the lord 
I have an assurance, in my soul 
And I dare not ask who it was

I am a witness 
It was Jesus

Nobody but the lord

The Bridges,"There is a world of difference, you've got someone to grow on
Don't think the sun won't notice your shade's under my shadow
Get your heart back here and try this
Unsyncopated visionaries won't buy this

You've got me wrapped up in blue
That's how the sky will do and I've been down before 
You've got the sunset in your eyes
This comes as no surprise and I've been down before

You think our hearts are ready to push the limits of the sky
I think the wind will blow us out of proportion 
Get your heart back here and try this
Unsyncopated visionaries won't buy this

You've got me wrapped up in blue
That's how the sky will do and I've been down before 
You've got the sunset in your eyes
This comes as no surprise and I've been down before

There is a world of difference
You've got someone to grow on
Ohhhh ohhhhh

Get your heart back here and try this
Unsyncopated visionaries won't buy this

You've got me wrapped up in blue
That's how the sky will do and I've been down before 
You've got the sunset in your eyes
This comes as no surprise and I've been down before",Blue,2008
