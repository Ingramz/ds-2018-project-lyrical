Underwater,"While the dust that arises
Just to glorify itself
When we're ash and we're lifeless
No excuse will be of help

If we all got
What we deserved
We all would pay
You can be sure

You are the one to blame
You threw your life away
No matter what you say
One day you'll have to face it
A fallen one
You never pull your weight
No one can take your place
You threw this life away

If you knew all my secrets
And could read all my thoughts
If you could feel all my feelings
You would put me to a stop

For every deed I should have done
Every mile walked I should have run
For every careless word I said
Bury me deeper when I'm dead

You are the one to blame
You threw your life away
No matter what you say
One day you'll have to face it
A fallen one
You never pull your weight
No one can take your place
You threw this life away

I am like fallen icarus
And my only prayer is grace

You are the one to blame
You threw your life away
No matter what you say
One day you'll have to face it
A fallen one
You never pull your weight
No one can take your place
You threw this life away

If we all got what we deserved
We all would pay you can be sure",Fallen One,2008
Underwater City People,"Even if I am in love with you
All this to say, what's it to you?
Observe the blood, the rose tattoo
Of the fingerprints on me from you

Other evidence has shown
That you and I are still alone
We skirt around the danger zone
And don't talk about it later

Marlene watches from the wall
Her mocking smile says it all
As the records the rise and fall
Of every soldier passing

But the only soldier now is me
I'm fighting things I cannot see
I think it's called my destiny
That I am changing

Marlene on the wall

I walk to your house in the afternoon
By the butcher shot with the sawdust strewn
""Don't give away the goods too soon""
Is what she might have told me

Marlene watches from the wall
Her mocking smile says it all
As the records the rise and fall
Of every man who's been here

But the only one here now is me
I'm fighting things I cannot see
I think it's called my destiny
That I am changing

Follow me now
To a place you only dreamt of
Before I came along

When I first saw you
I was deep in clear blue water
The sun was shining
Calling me to come and see you
I touched your soft skin
And you jumped in with your eyes closed
And a smile upon your face
Você vem, você cai

E vem aqui pra cá
Porque eu quero te beijar na sua boca
Que coisa louca
Vem aqui pra cá

Underworld,"(The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm)

The rhythm of legs moving in the sun
The rhythm of an engine deep and throating
The rhythm of a summer that you walked in

The sound of a barking dog on a loop
A plane rises in crystal blue
The rhythm of keys swinging in your hand
The rhythm of light coming out of your fingers

Heaven heaven
Heaven heaven
Heaven heaven

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Heaven heaven

The rhythm of wheels, the rhythm of heels
That we fall into the sun
She walk on silver, she walk on gold
Paints ""I love you"" on the alley walls
For the eyes that hide behind black glasses
Sunlight hits everyone she passes

Heaven heaven
Heaven heaven
Heaven heaven

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

And I don't know if I love you more
Than the way you used to love me

Underworld,"Come with me
To the bright white flame
That you knew by name
And you will again

Take my hand
We're getting out of here
No more time for tears
For the wasted years

No more crumble in the night
No more tears on an empty pillow
Voices out of sight cryin' hard - runnin' scared
No more tears in the gloom
No more gurus that I just can't follow

Older than the sun

If I die before I go this is the way
Older than a heartbeat
Older than the sun

Now she could not stand
To be near that man

I'm invisible and a razor of love

You know what I mean
This electric stream and my tears in league
With the wires and energy
It's my machine, this is my beautiful dream

I'm hurting no one, hurting no one
Hurting no one, I'm hurting no one

I want to give you everything
I want to give you energy
Want to give a good thing
To give you everything

Everything, everything
Everything, everything
Everything, everything
Everything, everything

One final scream of love
Who couldn't climb this high
She looks beautiful like a child
A feel of tears and I want to scream

Let go, let go

Shooting behind the glass eyes

Craving company and legs

You look good to me

I see you in an alley shop
And clean and focus like a hope
When he smoked a cigarette
Looking away smelling something surgical
That leaves a mark upon his neck
Where the place where you were talking
When you looked so upset
Why were you hiding
When I saw you in an alley shop
And clean like a hope

I want someone pretty to give me time
Mmmm pretty and fit, smelling good
An unknown lie
Animal calling
Hungry eye
Change the way I feel, on a wheel
And (bang?) jesus loves me on a yellow xylophone
Going home
Outside you look at me with your brown eyes
Lest we forget
Angel at the hotel

I was born with a cartoon eye
And a savioury style

In a place where ball games are strictly forbidden luxury two bedroomed apartments overlook the traffic lights next to the rails it's a hot day, it's a, it's a hot day a lazy day for some but I'm bringing from the inside all these things I see a wall, I know it's gonna fall down maybe hurt somebody after it's been tagged I fly post it, it's a rush job, it looks good for long enough Knock 'em out, sell 'em, move on, it's a fast buck and the race is on to get in, get out, get what you want, get out it's the short term, the long term can look after itself unless you happen to be living here, I've gotta stop.

I found a new door, I didn't know where it went I went through, I came out in this shopping mall where boys wear England shirts and West Ham shirts and Arsenal shirts and the boys from Dagenham wear jackets called Harlem grinning at the door of the Anne Summers sex shop it's St.Georges day and all the old people smile, the young people look hungry looking for a new door I'm in the sun at the back of the shops where the purple wheelie bins are pushed up against the doors that say ""fire exit""
The smell of grease, there's a broken glass thing under my feet the boys stop for a smoke in the sun and watch girls cross from the job centre to the station a drunk stands in the door of a pub, a bunch of pea sticks in one hand a cheery carrier bag hanging in the other, hanging in the other.

Girls in England shirts read the papers and giggle at the table in a cafe offering home made dinners, it's good food, but your clothes come out smelling of grease I got my back to the rail at the end of the alley by the by-pass you might just see me scratching all these things inking it out, deliver us from temptation and doubt there's an abandoned trolly called safe and radio one on and on and on and on and on and on and on and another England shirt out in the sun spring falls in pink on the black top and cracks black and yellow tape covers the scene of a break in and every time I think of you I get my peace back.

Im Sonnenstrahl der Dankbarkeit

Zwischen Licht und Schatten

Zwischen Licht und Schatten

Das Geschenk der Freundschaft
Hab ich durch dich erlebt
Hab an kein Ende gedacht

Alles was schön ist
Geht leider viel zu schnell vorbei
Wie ein Freund der plötzlich geht
Was bleibt ist Dankbarkeit

I possess the privilege of pain
Perpetual motion of perpetual unrest

Untouchable is the unholy one
Wolflike vigour of bearsome mind
Ecstasy beyond your serpent tongues""

To the shores of primeval sea
To the water that once came to be

Seem slightly aware of the role they
Must play through this global affair

Who have everything but, with nothing to lose
With nothing to lose
They're not part of the game that we play everyday

There's too many of us to compromise

The side effect is I see how they control.

Trust me, just come closer, I'll begin to tell you.
I've somehow gained entrance, I've seen things that I wish I hadn't.
What is the difference in knowing and the common judgment.
Drawing from reason to get a handle on the moment.
There's no truth in advertisements
Why can't we trust our judgment.
There are many sides to every illusion.
Can you draw your own conclusion?

Acusado como un criminal.
Rechazado por la sociedad
Cargando una cruz esperando nuestro final
Cada paso que das nuestros dias terminan
Lo que ves es verdad
El sufrimiento de nuestra humanidad

Al morir sera un placer pero solo nos queda
Esperar encontrar nuestro destino
Encontrar nuestra verdad
Muchas lagrimas se han derramado
Muchas vidas se han sacrificado
Viviendo entre pesadillas buscando como despertar

Hombres de saco why corbata buscando como controlar
Why nosotros encadenados de las manos why los pies
Buscando como despertar

These thoughts are amounting to nothing of value,

tell me where I'd have to stand
To hold your gaze for awhile

And skies are filled with hate and waste
Flowers bloom for our salvation

To nurse my inner wounds 'til dawn
And when I sacrifice she prays
Crying like my heart was torn

No idea how this will end
But maybe ignorance is bliss
More an angel than a friend
I've never known a love like this

She sat me down and made me sing
She blessed my soul with a kiss
I've had enough fair weather friends
I've never known a love like this

Very lonely and I'm tired
'Til She moves me with a thrust
Though She has me so inspired
I need my sleep as much as lust

I haven't held her hand again
But once by midnight's soulful glow
She's been inside of me since then
I can't forget a taste I know

She signed my paper, smiled at me, and walked away
Then we met in an empty hall the size of my lonely heart
Optimism called my bluff and that dream fell apart

Now I've been told
If you're in love then go ahead
But ever since, I sing instead

Many times I've bet my pride and ventured to the door
And though I've failed I'll here confide, I wish to seek once more
I'm lonely and I need a hand to help me through the day
And with her strength, I'd rise and stand ? so help me Lord, I pray

E'er the days of my boyhood, I scarcely had spent.
From it's cool shady forests and deep flowing streams,
Ever fond in my mem'ry and sweet in my dreams.

Oh, my dear little sister, I still see her tears.
When I had to leave home in our tender years.
And my sweet gentle mother, so dear to my heart,
It grieved me sincerely when we had to part.

Said my kind-hearted father as he took my hand:
""As you go in defence of our dear native land,
""Son, be brave but show mercy whenever you can.
""Our hearts will be with you, 'til you 'turn again.""

In my bag there's a bible to show me the way,
Through my twelfth year on earth and to Heaven some day.
I will shoulder my musket and brandish my sword,
In defence of this land and the word of the Lord.

So happy and free at God's right hand

On heaven's bright shore
Pilgrims on earth someday will go
To live in that home forever more
Trusting in Him who died for sin,
And rose from the grave

On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore),
There's gonna be no more dyin' (over there)
Not one little grave (not one little grave),
In all that fair land (that wonderful land).
Not even a tear will dim the eye,
And no one up there will say goodbye
Just singing His praise through endless days
On Heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore)

When I must cross that rolling tide,
There'll be someone on the other side
Welcoming me to that fair land, made perfect by love
When I walk up the milky white way,
I'll see that home coming in a ray
How great it must be for angels to see
A pilgrim reach home

I paid the fare in billet on her maiden voyage to Vicksburg
And talked my way to hand the tiller on the course
In her planks I carved a notch and sealed the vow 'Be my Bonita'
And her dowry was my life between the shores

I was born with rouging ways, and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades, made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
The striker's boast would fain me loss, about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl's got poor Billy's ransom saved

On the lake at Bistineau, she set the wharf at Dixie
With a thousand bales of cotton on her main
As the great raft disappeared, the watermark went sinking
And she was stuck right hard, a listing on the bank
With the furnace still a blaze, I stood my last upon her
Then climbed the prow and took a landsman's trade
'A derelict now Milady' said the watch log I've concorded
'Have the bosun sound us eight bells for the change'

Cause I was born with rouging ways, and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again

Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do

Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Yo stop actin' stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new shit (EWW!)
Yeah I think I did too much, this substance equals cups
Red pills, blue pills, and green, big pills (that's ill), mescaline!

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some, somethin', some'un, some'un, some'un

Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was Incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm, old and gray look for dope to smoke
No okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I gotta strangle a (you're crazy!)

I pop fo' E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine
(Yeah, you got any shrooms?) Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggaz think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
And if you like smack (uh-huh) then I might too
(Swift, chill) I just wanna get high like you! (ewww)
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue (uh-huh)
Speed, 'shrooms, down the valiums (uh-huh)
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin back soon

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

I'm at rave lookin' like a slave, high off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope-headed guy
Heroin mescaline, pencilnecks, wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin' ill
Drugs kill (yeah right) bitch, I'm for real!!!
Shut your mouth you dirty slut, you know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt, let Bizarre nut!

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up?  Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No""
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S.: We should be together too

Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim
Shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog,
Come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you

United States Navy Band,"O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream,
’Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion
A home and a Country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their lov’d home and the war’s desolation!
Blest with vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land
Praise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto - “In God is our trust,”

I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

I never conquered, when you came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try

Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour

She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
I'm kind of nervous cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and that made it I swear

Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation

I waited for her call

I'd still ask her to dance

And I'm still more amused by TV shows

I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops
And your husband's in jail

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,2004
United Studio Orchestra,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,2004

How to navigate through a perilous tide

So long as I reach the air and finally feel my colours change.

So jump in while the flame is bright

Think of this not as fire but lights of coming dawn
Coming dawn
Coming dawn
Fall up into the wind if she offers a ride

I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day. 

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones, 
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep.

Or should I say she once had me

Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

And I noticed there wasn't a chair

Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

Whatever your problems might be
Come and get with me
And get it off your chest

Come get with me and I'll make it worth your while
Get in between and be trippin' with a smile
Let me make you feel so right!

Whats up ma, how you doin'?
24 in the waist; that's how you do it?
Rockin' them sell with the waistline low
The kind I like, that let the crack show
I ain't neva' did shit but rob a pocket for a ho
Between me and you, this shit's gettin' old
I could see me and you, in this grill,
Or ridin' shotgun while you whippin' the wheel

Come take a trip
With your boy Unk, I want what you want
Don't be talking about what you don't
Open that bottle; shots of patron
Let's get it on
Foreplay my way and she bumpin' my song
5 in the morn'
She holla' one more round before lickin' my cone

So whats up ma, is you down and wet?
I can see it in your eyes that you ready to cut
Meet me at the crib if you ready to cut
The lights down low if you stressin' for what
If your car messed up, you can borrow one of mine
You got credit card debt, you can borrow one of mine
Just say yes; you can have a piece of mine
That nigga ain't ready, I told the Glock 9

And if the show don't 
Blowin' kush, we can do it in slo-mo
From the front to the back if you say so
Just don't say no 'cause I'm feelin you
Four Five 'cause your eyes got me hypnotized
Thick thighs, you don't wanna' come and get your prize
And that's you and me, in a life of luxury
Say yes and that's just how it's gonna' be

Come get with me and I'll relieve your stress
Whatever your problems might be

Come get with me and I'll make it worth your while
Get in between and be trippin' with a smile
Let me make you feel so right!

Baby girl, don't lie to me
I know you wanna do it
Saw the way that you were lookin' when we was cruisin'
I know I ain't the type to buy you a tulip
Give you a blunt and weed; let's get woozy
Don't say maybe, 'cause I ain't askin' you to be my lady
Might as well say yes and you get another sex, roughed up; 
With our clothes, we'll make it

If you wanna go to war, the gun's my pleasure
Even Jesus had 12 disciples on the level, trigger, whatever
Pumm you don't want now dega 3 thou
I'm like jury duty your new to this part of town
Your white tee well to me looks like a nightgown
Make you mama proud take that thing to sizes down
Then you look like the man that you are or what you could be
I could
I give a damn 'bout your car but then that would be
If it was considered a classic before the drastic change in production 
When cars were metal instead of plastic value
Is what I'm talking about
Take two of these and walk it out
You'll be the reason they talk it out
You can't be the king in the parkin' lot, forever
Not saying I'm the best but till they find something better
I am here no fear write me a letter 'till then
I walk it out

That's what my teachers call me predictions like they Cleo
So I did my dance for 'em
They make about 40,000
I do that in a month I'm no resorts and islands
I make them walk it out yeah it's me again
But I'm with Jones that phat stacks and Benjamin
I roll with made men
That brakes the stage in
And keep the girls happy
So you all can get the nappy
Gangsters they do they dance they do it to my song
See I was up in cali crip walking it all night long
Drop 20 on my neck got 10 on they wrist
A billion dollar look a million dollar kiss
I'm nation wide homie you're still at home homie
With no promotions on me man that's Bologna homie
The album off in stores I'm beating down you block
Now going walk it out and they're still on my jock

After I floss it out I bring my air forces out
I'm blowing purple smoke I cough it out
Ball it up and ball it out tap the bottle and then pour it out balling'

Now do the fade away, throw some paper away.
And we can skate away, tell the hoes I'll be late today.
Or I can thug it out or star stud it out.
I take a trip with my bitch and Louie luggage out.
I'm talking magic city or even body taps.
You know that money ain't a thing, we're throwing thousand stacks.
Oh yeah we toss it out, you know what I'm talking about.

And with the number one single, I'm feelin' my wealth
Yeah, Now what you know about me
Call me Mr. '08, 'cause this year about me
I'm rookie of the year, but a major in the league
So, how you doin' haters stay away from me
You don't wanna see the chopper
When the boys get silly 
And they rainin' on ya block, and ya brains like Chile

My house so silly, my money so silly
I make more in a week , than your parernts do yearly
My ring so silly, my ice so silly
The roc's on my watch makes the hatas wanna kill me
The hundred round drum on my gun so dumb
That it'll fly yo head all the way to London
I'm sick with it, rich like Lil' Weezy
I'm a milli, got a short fuse and I'm throwed like a frisbee

Get peeled like a dutch, and split like a philly
Oh really, them boys on the block, them boys in a row
Them boys at the trap they know the dilly
Make it rain for days, for the nights
And now when I'm at the strip club
When you them choppas out the back window

JD, the biggest thing in the A, since Martin
The Barack of College Park, I mean what more can I say
I switch my chains with my cars, switch my cars by the date

But I'd rather get some head, but I'd rather get some head
(I said I love havin sex, but I'd rather get some head)
(But I'd rather get some head, but I'd rather get some head)

[Verse One]
Ridin down the street man I whip my big car
I scoped a little sexy little minx, little bra
She make my dick stand like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
I hit that brake so hard, that I dropped my cigar
Pussy print fat like cash in a wad
I'm lookin like, ""Damn baby girl, don't start!""
I'ma take you to my crib girl and screw you like a fraud
Or maybe get some head while I'm ridin in the car
Either way it go man a nigga gotta bust some
Storin my dollar, a nigga got some dust some
High as the moon, I'ma a goon like Plies
Spray it like Big Oomp spray, dead in your eyes
In your eyes

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I'm the one that supply that D
I'm the one that keep freaks with me
I'm the one that be ridin clean
That be on the scene with that Texas tea
I'm the dude that took yo' girl
I'm the fool that changed the world
I'm the mayne with the twelve inches
She love to lick and it made her earl
Always fresh when I'm at the club
Sippin Goose the plan keep a buzz
From the hood so I throw it up
And the other side they don't mess with us
Love a girl that do it right
Make my toes like curly fries
In the bathroom or in the car
Or behind the bar she dy-no-mite~!

[Interlude]
Give me head [4X]
In the dorm room make me pass out, make me dead
Give me head [4X]
Wake me up then put me back to sleep, I ain't scared

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Unk]
Ayy~! Three 6, what's happenin, yooo
Hold on, hold on, hold on hoe! Stop lenme borrow yo' lips that's what I told her
Girl got that Aquafina with a good head on her shoulder
She whispered boy I'm hungry, so I told her she could come
And I didn't feed her nothin but some dick and bubblegum
She want mo' I give her some, I keep them magnums, I'm strapped
And if she tired, lay down, just place yo' head in my lap
Ay Big Oomp Records on the map, we keep that mouth wide open
I Clarence Carter that pro, from the East to the West I'm strokin
From the North to the South I'm pokin, every time this a hit it gets greater
Two choices that she got to make, she can chew me now or later
I'm 'bout that puh-puh paper, but see I love havin sex
And the mo' puh-puh paper, I know that head is the best

The dirty dime know that, off in Memphis Ten
With my dudes gettin' throwed stuff that white up they nose
Take that kush, break it down, sprinkle meth on the low
With my homies ridin' high with bump in the back
Sometimes my rap with a body, back
Every click in the club, our side ain't jokin'
In the parking lot, I toke we smokin'
And we smash out, dog barkin' under the bumper
Ten cars deep got it sounding like some thunder
Riding 28's, UGK in the back,
And the smoke still blowin' out the barrel of the gat

First day I got out the slave plantation
My niggas and my bitches gave me a donation
Next day bought a spur, sliver not black
Look at me and that yay in that candy red lac
And all I can remember I was draped in stones
Everyday I drive a Bentley now look at the grows

Bun B the, hopin' out the slab 100 carrot jewelry
Ready to protect it baby strapped up with my toolery
Boys like to play but I ain't with that Tom foolery
I lay 'em down quick, thats just the old school in me
They don't wanna see a nigga go, I might not come back
When I beat 'em down like a Paul and Juicy J track 

[Chorus: x2]

Its the first of the month, I wanna stunt so playa I'ma kick it
Straight to the car lot this Cadillac I gotta flip it
And I ain't playin' with stress I just unzip and hit it
And I ain't payin' for all the weed nigga we gotta split it
Wanna hood ride then you ridin' with a bounce
I got them suicide doors, 26's on the front
That patron and that goose I drink it from the hip
Cause im always at the bar thats why all my money spent

I'm the trap man, trap man
Lookin' for a girl with fine cap man, cap man
Fallin' in the club you know I'm rollin' I'm rollin'
I feel like santa clause I bring the hoes in, the hoes in

Guess the stake

For the sake of [you for me]

Into the picture
Of another scandalous creature
And all you do is sink

I went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirt and some Khakis
Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, See
The bell rang and I got my dash
Feelin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No mom's trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride, ain't you da Mac I
says I am what I am that's who I be
And Ya'll should have seen how they were tryin' to get to me
Kool, cause dissin' them don't pay they're the reason why we are
who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Kris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's Alright

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one's that used to do the dirt done turn good
Lil kids tryin' to be like me, with the braids, the shades
Some pants like nike's gee
Ain't nothin' mo better than a letter sayin'
I'm your number one fan, can you write me back man
Yes I try not to pass on an autograph, I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood and ain't nobody
dissin' sayin' the nigga thinks he's too good
Cause, I'm down like four flat tires
Just a til nappy headed kid from the briar showin'
I can do right and not do wrong
Representing the Bee Gee's comin' up strong
and we ain't got no love for the other side, we only live this that
love us back right.

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast, cause I'm always on
the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know really doe the pressure it is for some kids
tryin' to make it in this here biz
Early morning interviews, then we step to school
Step from School, back to interviews
then it's on to other dues
So warm it up Kris, I said warm it up Kris
That's what I was born to do

Now throw your hands in the air and wave 'em from side to side if
the feelin' that ya feelin' is a feelin' that's right
See I ain't come out wack, I came out right
Unlike those moes that chose to pass the mic
It's the Daddy Mac, Big Baby everything is real
but you want to want to diss because

And just take a peek at the next life, I'm about to be replaced with
Turn down the light so I can dim this life

Into the right direction, towards changing correction
Away from mental infection and away from deception
And make that spiritual connection, get my shit together
Use my faith to shelter me from this stormy weather

I wake up lonely, there's air of silence

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

Riding the beat
Beats walking on the street
I can hop a train
And move in that vehicle
But the metaphor is better for traveling quick
To any destination and any location
In the known universe of my imagination
Confined in a verse
I'm a powerful combine
Who got to bomb minds like a war flick
On time when my jaw spit raw shit
Hella fit,halibut,had to fit
Grab a chalice to sip, then slip
Through the sands of my 'cholosis(?)

Still swinging on vines in the tree

Rather be caught in a void, nullify
What if I delve a blade
I left my sickle at the airport 'cause I felt sick
Whether you felt it or not
I don't give a shit
But if you leave it on the shelf then it might get spoiled
Take it to health, Lord knows I toil

I can see you in the doorway
And you're crawling through the void

I've been thinking too much
And I feel like I'm pushing through
I sit alone all night
So why do I still feel you?

And your face is buried

In your trembling hands
The cold water is running
Keep your heart from feeling
You want to love but never can

But you
Were my true love
And you
Put yourself up above
I'd die for you
Take a bullet for you
And I'd lie to you
Because that's all you ever do

When laughter feeds the silence
As the morning comes into the view
And were standing at the gates
But you don't want me walking through

Slightly approach you

Constantly on a roll

I'm like, ""Un momento"" mami, slow up your tempo
I got this black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talkin' out her neck, makin' her fingers snap

Asked her what tribe she with, red, dot or feather

Gotta toss a couple dollars, just to shut up her holla

Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARC's, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma, she's always on the scene
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tahoe
That means I'm new school, pop pills and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first class seat
I love

A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out
Got a chick from Peru, that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that get shit through
Got this weed-head chick, she always catch me doing shit
Crazy girl want to leave me but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like, ""Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?""
I'm like excuse me Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked, and now you one half

The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn

And I'ma make you beg, cause you look pretty when you beggin'
So meet me on the campus, I`ll be there around 11
So let me put my books down, excuse me if I look down
Guess I'm a little nervous, but I'm at your service
Look at what you took down
Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything, other niggas never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
That's why I hold you down, every time you hit me up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
I make you beg for it, until I give it up
You say that same thing, every single time

Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything, Other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fucking best
You the fucking best
You the fucking best
You the fucking best
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
I say you the fucking

Sex, Love, Pain, baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop, bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too, claiming they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee, cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make yo pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix then you should really get yo fiend on
Yea just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back, and make yo fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots

Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything, Other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

Unwritten Law,"I remember the way when we used to play
All our troubles seemed so far away, yeah
That was when I lived from day to day
Do you remember the times
When all on our minds
Was having fun
And catching a buzz
That was life for you and for me

[Chorus: ] 
Whoah, oh, oh I want it back
Whoah oh oh I want it back, now
I've got my life to live

Looking back now at all of my friends
And asking myself why these times had to end
Well, I'm older now than I was then
And it makes no sense to try and deny it
There's no use to try and defy it
That's the way life goes for you and for me

[Chorus: ]

Hey
Whoah, oh, oh I want it back
Whoah, oh, oh I want it back, now

Unwritten Law,"Completing life 
With
Cold blank eyes
My final thoughts race through my mind
With brief visions 
Of
What's to come
Is there a light
Is it just done

I'm running away
From what
I can't explain

A new location
Strange vibration
From a different time and age
On a trip
In a dream far away
Forgetting the preceding day

I'm being chased
Can't move
I'm running in place
Running away
These endless days

The words were said
But I can't hear these voices in my head

Am I running away
I can't move
I'm running in place",Kill to Breathe,1994
Unwritten Law,"Tell ya what I do inside of my bedroom
I wrap my arms around myself
As I'm feeling these pains void from healing
I only wish I could hold back this aggression
Please hear my confession
I try to keep myself from thinking about you
I can't live without you
You turned away from me

All of the lessons that I've had to learn
All the respect that I've had to earn
You're the one that makes me understand

Unwritten Law,"Caught in this endless trap
You neglect to see
All the aspiration
Built up inside of me
I wanna express myself
And say what's on my mind
You're the perfect person
And that's so hard to find

Something burning inside of me
Obsession depression
Why won't she fall for me
Obsession depression
All I wanted was to e with you
I can't believe it's true
Obsession

Obsession depression
Killing my mind

You won't give me a chance
You just say leave it be
I want to get in your pants
Is all you think and see
You have a new guy now
What am I supposed to do
I guess I'm fucked
Cause I've been played by you

Unwritten Law,"So I'm not good enough
To hang with your friends
You say it's a bluff but
It's no lie
You want to be cool
And hang with both side
But what would they say
I'm the fool

It's a superficial society
And it's a bunch of bullshit can't you see
Why won't you wake up to reality
I guess backstabbing ain't the way of life for me

Open your mind and close your eyes
To the things that really persist
It's not your hair or the things you wear that
Make someone socially exist
It's hard to find yourself sometimes 
Around people with a cool policy
Why don't you let yourself unwind and
Leave that lame society

Well it's all superficial to me

Just tellin' ya what I'd like to do
I'll get a 12-pack and sit on the beach
And look at all the hookers that I'll never meet
They're sayin'
Look at me
Look at me now
Look at me
Look at me

Maybe I'll bleach my hair or grow it out long
I'll buy a surfboard and lay out all day long
Well I'm the mammoth for you to nurture
And I just want you to think you'll be screwin' a surfer
Loot at me
Look at me
Look at me 
Look at me",Switch,1994
