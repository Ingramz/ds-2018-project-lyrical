Mel Tillis,"Maybe tomorrow I won't come home maybe you won't even care
At seven you'll throw a kiss toward the door and smile at my empty chair
For there's nothing here for a man to cling to nothing to keep me at home
Only a girl that's a stranger to me breathing on flames that're gone
Home isn't where I hang up my hat every night
And home isn't anything like cold arms holding me tight that's not right
And home isn't some place to go just to feel all alone that's not home
Maybe you might never see me again maybe that's the best way
I'll join myself to some south blowing wind leave here and find my own way
And maybe I'll find home someday",That's Not Home,1969
Mel Tillis,"May the fruit of my toil be yours love may the food from my soil be yours love
And from this moment on may a love that is strong and lives on and on be yours love
May the sons that I raise be yours love may the comforts I praise be yours love
If I ever get weak may the love words I speak and the arms that I seek be yours love
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love may the happiest face be yours love
May the last fingertips that touch these two lips as life from me slips be yours love

May the last fingertips",Yours Love,1969
Mel Tillis,"Emotions what are you doin' oh don't you know you'll be my ruin
You've got me crying crying again when will you let this heartache end
Emotions you get me upset make me remember what I won't to forget
I've been so lonely lonely too long emotions please leave me alone

You worry my days you torture my nights never a dream turns out right
Emotions give me a break let me forget that I made a mistake
Oh can't you see what you're doing to me emotions please set me free
You worry my days
(Set me free)",Emotions,1970
Mel Tillis,"I'd like to make everyday with you a holiday for love
Every hour of the day you're all I'm a thinkin' of
All week along when you're gone I sit around so blue
I just can't wait on Saturday that's my holiday with you
Monday Tuesday Wednesday wonder if you miss me too
Thursday Friday Saturday makin' plans just to be with you
Oh I'm a gonna be so sweet to you neath the moon above
And I'd like to make everyday with you a holiday for love

Mel Tillis,"Oh Mary don't you weep for me oh Mary just await for me
The war's gonna soon be over oh Mary don't you weep

Jimmy sent a letter to his bride back home for three long years he's been gone
He left her crying on her wedding day
And went to fight the battle of the Blue and Gray
Oh Mary don't you weep for me

Mary's young heart was filled with joy when she got the letter from her soldier boy
His words of love made her heart beat fast but little did she know it would be the last
Oh Mary don't you weep for me

On that same day Atlanta burned down her soldier boy he fell to the ground
Now Mary sits alone by the candle light and reads his letter over every night
Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary don't you weep oh Mary don't you weep oh Mary don't you weep","Mary, Don't You Weep",1970
Mel Tillis,"Waitin' waitin' for the redcoats to come
But all I hear in my frozen ears is ten thousand drums
Ten thousand drums
Johnny Johnny don't be afraid
We can whip those redcoats settin' in the shade
Settin' in the shade

We've got the best of all the rest of Genereal Washington
And when we meet those redcoats watch them redcoats run
Goin' down their drum goin' down their drum
Listen listen Johnny better get your gun

Cause there ain't puttin' soldiers behind ten thousand drums
Behind ten thousand drums
Runnin' runnin' Johnny watch them run
We finally whip those redcoats finally stop those drums
We stop ten thousand drums

We're the best of all the rest such Yankee son of a gun
We can tell our mommies how we made them run goin' down thir drum
Goin' down their drum goin' down their drum
Ten thousand drums ten thousand drums",Ten Thousand Drums,1970
Mel Tillis,"There's a thousand miles in back of me and many more to go
Ridin' on a freight train feeling mighty low
I keep a wonderin' why she quit me but I guess I'll never know
Yes she used to be my baby a thousand miles ago
A thousand miles ago I started feeling bad
'Cause I just lost the future I thought I really had
I know I shouldn't feel this way cause I still love her so
And I can't keep from thinking about a thousand miles ago

I know I've held her in my arms a thousand times or more
Promised her a world of love till I learned the score
That's why I'm feeling lonesome that's why I'm feeling low
She used to be my baby a thousand miles ago
A thousand miles ago
Yeah I can't keep from thinking about a thousand miles ago",Thousand Miles Ago,1970
Mel Tillis,"I wonder what the power is that you hold over me
I never get to love you long, just your memory
And I make a vow each time you leave that this will draw the line
Then you come back and just like now I'm falling one more time

One more time my lips may kiss you
One more time my arms will miss you
But it won't belong until you're gone with a memory left behind
And I just know that when you go I'll be lonely, one more time

Your nearness makes me weaken and I give into you
And I'm doing all the things, I said that I wouldn't do
And I make a vow each time you leave that this will draw the line
Then you come back and just like now I'm falling one more time",One More Time,1970
Mel Tillis,"If mem'ries were gathered like flowers each day I would pick a bouquet
To last through these long lonely hours but mem'ries aren't gathered that way
For mem'ries don't grow like the roses when kissed by the sunshine and dew
And mem'ries aren't carefully chosen they've bloomed from the love that once grew
There's mem'ries as sweet as the roses and sad as the violets of blue
But the lingering lingering mem'ries are the mem'ries that I have of you

That mem'ries would wither like flowers fall to the earth and decay
Each day I would pray for the showers to wash all my mem'ries away
There's mem'ries as sweet,
But the lingering lingering mem'ries are the mem'ries that I have of you",Lingering Memories,1970
Mel Tillis,"Everywhere there's a memory mem'ries made this house
The chairs and the table standing in the corner it seems were always filled
With good food and happy people where laughter used to live
I look at the cast through tear filled eyes at the marks our baby's Nell
Everywhere there's a memory mem'ries made this house
This house would die without the heart we gave it you and I
It came aloud as a love inside me grew stronger as the years went by
The bed's still standing in the same old place haven't changed the way we have
Everywhere there's a memory mem'ries made this house

You can tell that love lives here and that's why we can't leave
The house is solid but we heard it cryin' when love left you and me
The clothes in the closet so tell the true stories like the linings on the shelf
Everywhere there's a memory mem'ries made this house
Everywhere there's a memory mem'ries made this house
Everywhere there's a memory mem'ries made this house",Memories Made This House,1970
Mel Tillis,"(Lord they're on their way on their way)
Saw a man an angry man killed his brother with his own hands
Brother laid on the ground sinner man you'd better kneel down
He's on his way Lord on his way on his way Lord on his way
He's on his way Lord on his way oh oh Lord he's on his way (on his way)

So a girl a pretty girl disgusted with her next of world
And over those attractivity forever ends reality
She's on her way Lord

Two young boys black and white each one thinks his world is right
Fighting for color of skin they'll never know which one will win
They're on their way Lord
(Lord they're on their way on their way)",On the Way Lord,1970
Mel Tillis,"Pour me hard liquor over soft music at a table with only one chair
From the first lonely song till the last drop is gone she'll be hanging round somewhere

She may appear like an angel through a smoky crowd
Or fall in a teardrop I can't hold back now
Pour me hard liquor over soft music and she'll be hanging round somewhere

She may dance softly in the candle light reflecting her old mem'ries everywhere
You may find me glancing in a sparkling wine but she'll be hanging round somewhere
Pour me hard liquor,
She'll be hanging round somewhere",She'll Be Hanging Round Somewhere,1970
Mel Tillis,"Standing alone at an old country crossroad
Wondering which way will lead me to home
Ever so weary from chasing a dream
Thinking of Mary sweet Mary and the miles in between
Crossroads around me tell me you found me
Found me to lead me to the end of my dreams
Three roads would lead me from the one who may need me
But the other to Mary sweet Mary and the miles in between

One lonely night I left out of anger drifting and wasting life's precious hours
But only last night I dreamed that a stranger
Is gathering for Mary sweet Mary beautiful flower
Crossroads around me",Sweet Mary and the Miles in Between,1970
Mel Tillis,"You're the sweetest mistake I ever made
I've heard it said your life is strewn with broken hearts
Of fools like me who make mistakes and aren't very smart
But I took the chance and threw my life away
For you're the sweetest mistake I ever made
You're the sweetest mistake I ever made the price of loving you I'll gladly pay
The decent life I lived before you came I'll gladly trade
For the sweetest mistake I ever made

There's been many times that you have made me cry
But still you took the cold out of my empty lonely life
But the things most people treasure I would give away
For the sweetest mistake I ever made
You're the sweetest mistake
You're the sweetest mistake I ever made",Sweetest Mistake,1970
Mel Tillis,"As I walked through my garden today picking flowers for a pretty bouquet
Never many shades of blue white lilies and violets too
But I've picked these long stem roses just for you
I'm sending roses twelve long stem roses will you not let them wither and die
I've picked them just for you so I'm sending my love to
I hope these long stem roses cheer you when you cry

I could send just any rose you've had them all before
But somehow in a different way long stem roses mean more
So I'm sending roses
I'm sending roses
I hope these long stem roses cheer you when you cry",Twelve Long Stem Roses,1970
Mel Tillis,"I tried so hard to make you love me and all alone your love's been dying
I'll let you go because there's nothing I can do what's the use in just me trying
I'd give the world just to hold you if you could say you love me without lying
I know there's no chance for us to ever love again what's the use in just me trying

Goodbye may God will walk with you I'll still love you when I'll lay dying
My world will end with the closing of the door what's the use in just me trying

I'd give the world
What's the use in just me trying",What's the Use in Just Me Trying,1970
Mel Tillis,"My children come sit here and hold to daddy's hands
For I must tell you something that I don't understand
Lately we've been living in the shadows of surprise
Since I'm not the only man in your mother's eyes
I can't say it's my fault and I won't say it's hers
Cause I might have neglected when her need for me occurs

But we're still a family and must realize
That I'm not the only man in your mother's eyes
No I'm not the only man in her eyes anymore
And soon she'll be leaving walking out the door
And things won't be easy with her not around
And the shame that's now with us will be hard to live down
So children bear with me promise daddy you'll try

Since I'm not the only man in your mother's eyes
Since I'm not the only man in your mother's eyes",Your Mother's Eyes,1970
Mel Tillis,"See that house across the street from this barroom, bottle
The people who live in it, I love so
So I come here every night and I pray that I'll see them
Think I'll have one more drink and then I'll go

There's the lights in her bedroom tonight, bottle
Just like me, she's lonely, I know
Just to hold her in my arms, posses all her charms
Think I'll have one more drink and then I'll go

Yes, my children're already sleeping, bottle
And how much I miss them they'll never know
But the judge won't let me see them
That they think that I don't love them
Think I'll have one more drink and then I'll go

Oh, she blames all our troubles on you, bottle
But anyone can see that isn't so, I can take you or leave you
Heaven knows that I don't need you
Think I'll have one more drink and then I'll go
Think I'll have one more drink and then I'll go",One More Drink,1971
Mel Tillis,"Go on look down your righteous nose at me
But you've made me everything that I've turned out to be
In very few words I can tell you where everything went wrong
Two arms two lips too lonely too long
Two arms that almost died from loneliness
Two lips that cried from hunger for your kiss
For too many empty nights I laid awake till dawn two arms two lips too lonely too long

You'll never know how much it hurts to know you've never tried
To wake all over for your touch and then be denied
With other arms were offered me it was easy to go wrong
Two arms two lips too lonely too long
Two arms that almost died
Two arms two lips too lonely too long",Too Lonely Too Long,1971
Mel Tillis,"I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time but that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved but that was before I met you

I wanted to ramble and always be free but that was before I met you
I said that no woman could ever hold me but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging

They tell me I must reap just what I've sown but darling I hope it's not true
For once I made plans about living alone but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging,
But that was before I met you",Before I Met You,1971
Mel Tillis,"Keep the cold lonely world to my bedroom for a while
Sit here beside my and let me see you smile
For when I'm alone minutes are eternity so for a few fleeting moments cling to me
Cling to me and let the sunshine of your sweet love come in
Before I remember what a fool I have been
Even though we have started a love that just can't be
For a few fleeting moments cling to me

Cling to me and let the sunshine,
For a few fleeting moments cling to me",Cling to Me,1971
Mel Tillis,"I thought about walkin' thought about talkin' thought about singin' singin' the blues
Thought about tryin' once I even thought of dyin'
But baby most of all I thought about you
Thought of just bein' people I'm seein' thought about doin' the things they do
Thought about livin' thought about forgivin' but baby most of all I thought about you

Thought of bein' born thought of bein' warm
Bout all the things a man can go through
Thought of winds a blowin' and rivers overflowin'

Most of all I thought about you",I Thought About You,1971
Mel Tillis,"Mama's workin' now I'm playing games it's sunny outside but I don't care if it rains
Cause soon she'll be back home where I want her to be
And it's hard to add one and one and make it three
Daddy went away some time ago and though it seems so long I love him so
Mama said that daddy won't be back soon
And I'm a gettin' new shoes when they fix mama's hair at noon
Mom try so hard that I can see with half full heart she waters the family tree

Now here I stand my face pressed to the glass
As thoughts of tender years with mom go past
A cry rings in my heart the world's a lie as I stand and worship my first born tonight
Mom tried so hard now accept to me

Now it stands real tall and straight for all to see

Mel Tillis,"(Love is where you find it when you find no love at home)
And there's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is gone

The bottle's almost empty the clock just now stuck ten
And I just had to call you to our favorite place again
(We know it's wrong for us to meet but the fire's gone out at home)
And there's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is gone
Love is where you find it

(Your lips are warm and tender your arms hold me just right

Mel Tillis,"When the years show in our faces from the thoughtless hand of time
And our youth is just a mem'ry to revive
(We'll spend many happy hours thumbing through the past desires
And we'll bring each tender mem'ry back to life)
But every day we live we add a mem'ry and we store it in the corner of our minds
And when life's fire is just a dying ember
We'll bring each tender mem'ry back to life

When we know our days are numbered that we live on borrowed time
Our hands will search the darkness to entwine

And we'll bring each tender mem'ry back to life)
For every day we live,
We'll bring each tender mem'ry back to life",Back to Life,1972
Mel Tillis,"Now life is filled with ups and downs and we both had our share
And everytime I slip and fall you're still there to care

And we'll go on through life together living and learning)
Let's call all the fun we've had living living
Let's call all mistakes we've made learning learning
Reach out together and the love light's still burning
And we'll go on through life together living and learning

Well everytime old trouble comes a knocking on our door
We stand and face it hand in hand like everytime before

And we'll go on through life together living and learning

Mel Tillis,"I called, collect on the phone
You say you're tired and alone
But it sounds like someone else is lying there

She said, ""Don't call me no more""
Don't you knock on my door
Its too late now and I know you'll never change

She said, ""You're just a Coca Cola cowboy""
You got an Eastwood smile and Robert Redford hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
And you taught me how to say I just don't care

She said just leave me alone
And let me hang up this phone
'Cause he'll see me cry and think I still love you

Please don't call me no more
I changed the locks on my door
It's time you understood that we are through

She said, ""You're just a Coca Cola cowboy""
You got an Eastwood smile and Robert Redford hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
And you taught me how to say I just don't care

Cause she loves him still she's giving up fine
While he's spreading on the charm with a new love on his arm
Ill be helping Angel make it through the night
And I'm holding Charlies Angel tonight
I'm in heaven while I'm holding her tight
Charlie acted so unwise walking out on paradise
And I'm holding Charlies Angel tonight

Mel Tillis,"There she lies still sleeping d
Dreaming the whole world is in her hands
What she thought was love last night
Was just the wine and the weakness in a man

But now the passion's gone and all that's left
Is cold gray facts and cold gray morning light
As I promptly close the door I wonder
What did I promise her last night

I guess I should have wakened her
And told her that I must be moving on
But I told myself the truth might hurt her
Worse than waking up to find me gone

But my conscience knows the truth
And it's so hard to convince myself I'm right
And as I slowly drive away
I wonder what did I promise her last night

I guess by now she's waking up
And packing up her things and heading home
With memories of a temporary love
She wishes never came along

How many one-night stands must she go through
Before she finds a love that right?
And as I'm driving down the road I wonder
What did I promise her last night

I guess by now she's waking up
And packing up her things and heading home
With memories of a temporary love
She wishes never came along

How many one-night stands must she go through
Before she finds a love that right?
And as I'm driving down the road I wonder
What did I promise her last night

Mel Tillis,"Last night I dug your picture out from our old dresser drawer
I set it on the table and I talked to it till four
I read some old love letters right up to the break of dawn
Yeah, I've been sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones,
Exhuming things that's better left alone
And I'm resurrecting mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

And I went through the closet and I found some things in there,
Like that pretty lingerie that I bought you to wear
And I recalled how good you looked each time you had it on
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones,

River walkin' talkin' western swingin' singin'
Songs of love and yellow roses
There's nothing quite like Texas on a Saturday night

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

Then daddy pulled it to the sky, behind him as he ran
And said, ""Girl don't be caught waiting on the wind""

The time comes when a young girl wants to leave the nest and fly
I stood there sad and proud and smiled through tears and said goodbye
I gave you boosts, I gave you wings and girl I understand
An eagle can't sit waiting on the wind

If you rise for every challenge, if you run to catch your dreams
That star that you keep reaching for is closer than it seems
Heaven and earth reward all those who try and try again
And will not be caught waiting on the wind

Whatever strength you find in me I thank my father for
His wisdom faith and courage set me on a steady course
And when my sails are empty their words lift me up again
And I will not be caught waiting on the wind

If you rise for every challenge, if you run to catch your dreams
That star that you keep reaching for is closer than it seems
Storms of life may force you to change courses now and then
But never be caught waiting on the wind
Never be caught waiting, never be caught waiting on the wind

Is she as happy as I?
Does she spend her afternoons just playing bridge
Or baking her children a pie?

I never wink back at fireflies

But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark

I never saw rainbows in my wine

Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan

It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view

In the wilds
And starve together, dear

And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

Mel Tormé,"Though you vacation in Hawaii
Or go to Switzerland to ski,
When you're scanning the snow-covered mountains
Or fanning yourself by the sea,
Don't dream of anybody but me,
Nobody but me!

Though you may fly to Scottish Highland,
Or try some isle near Napoli,
When you're whistlin' ""The Campbells are Coming""
Or humming ""The Isle Of Capri"",
Don't dream of anybody but me!

In a cafe on the Rhine,
Any place along the line,
I'll forgive you if a stranger
Puts your little heart in danger,
If her face resembles mine!

When you visit a nightclub in 'Frisco,
And the singer keeps singin' off-key,
Won't even mind if suddenly she
Reminds you of me!

No matter where you care to travel,
Any place, no matter who you choose to see,
Whenever your head hits the pillow,
Whatever the hour may be,
Don't dream of anybody but me!
O-oh no, don't dream of anybody but me!
Oh no, don't dream of anybody but me!
But me,
Nobody but me!",Don't Dream of Anybody But Me,1959

Just for a tender while, I kissed a smile - upon her face

Never dreaming that we were parting
Then I lied as a whispered ""mañana""

Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

They danced with me, and while I held them,
All I did was to talk about you.
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There is just no getting over you.

Till wrong is right, till birds refuse to sing
Beyond the years the echo of my only love
Will still be whispering, whispering!

Should ever start repeating
That it is tired of beating
Then I'll be tired of you!",Then I'll Be Tired of You,1983
Mel Tormé,"After the waltz is over
After the music ends
After I held you so close in my arms
We'll be much more than friends
After the waltz is over
All conversation dies
What could our lips say
That we haven't said with our eyes

I could waltz through life with you

We'll make wedding bells chime
In three-quarter time

I don't care if the party's ending
Or if the clock's striking one
I never dreamed when we danced at the start
One little waltz could go straight to my heart
After the waltz is over
We'll find that love has begun

I don't care if the party's ending
Or if the clock's striking one

Mel Tormé,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream/Darn That Dream,1985
Mel Tormé,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1985
Mel Tormé,"The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart!
How white the ever constant moon, take care, my foolish heart!
There's a line between love and fascination,
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they give the very same sensation.
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss.
Your lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart!
But should our eager lips combine, then let the fire start.
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart,
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart!",My Foolish Heart,1985
Mel Tormé,"Somewhere, someday
Well be close together, wait and see
Oh by the way,
This time the dreams on me

But as things stand
This time the dreams on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dreams on me

Mel Tormé,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

A beautiful theme of ev'ry
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.
Let our hearts take wings
Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing,
For your returning.
Till our love is safe and sound.
And old midnight comes around.

Really gets bad

Mel Tormé,"Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood

And their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies, under the evergreens
But I know what I'm needin'
And I don't wanna waste more time

Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1990

Get your favorite one to sit by your side
Cuddle up in a sleigh
Giddyap Nellie Grey
And away we go.

While you listen to the sleigh bells ring
You're yodeling to your baby
You'll feel nice and warm
no matter how cold it may be

Take a look at little Jack and Jill
They ski down a hill that's a snowplow turn
And look there's a spill
There's a spill on the hill 
When you're down it's a thrill to go up again.

Ev'rybody ought to learn to ski for that is how we first met
We were that Jack and Jill that came down a hill,
When I looked at you my hearttook a spill
Took a spill on a hill
It's a thrill that I can't forget

It Happened In Sun Valley not so very long ago
There were sunbeams in the snow
and a twinkle in your eye
I remember oh so clearly
that you nearly passed me by

Then It Happened In Sun Valley
when you slipped and fell and so did I
Now ev'ry year we go back
and then we recall that fall and that moment
When we were there on a hill
So we both take a spill and we're Jack and Jill again.

It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day.

Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene

I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Still it holds a goodly share of bliss
When the sun gives way to April showers
Here is the point you should never miss

Though April showers may come your way
They bring the flowers that bloom in May
So if it's raining, have no regrets
Because it isn't raining rain, you know

And where you see clouds upon the hills
You soon will see crowds of daffodils
So keep on looking for a blue bird
And list'ning for his song

And the note he sings was this, ah

Poor Johnny, one note
Sang out with, ""Gusto""
And just overlorded the place

Poor Johnny, one note
Yelled willy nilly
Until he was blue in the face

For holding one note was his ace
Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class by himself, by gum

Poor Johnny, one note
Got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave

He took his one note
Howled like the North Wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned 'round in his grave

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Ev'ry one was mute
Johnny stood alone

Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo, all were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping
Traffic ceased its roar

And they tell us Niag'ra stood still
He stopped the train whistles
Boat whistles, steam whistles, cop whistles
All whistles bowed to his skill

Sing Johnny one note
Sing out with, ""Gusto""
And just overwhelm all the crowd

The blues, they send to meet me won't defeat me,
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me.

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

You made me so very happy,

And misery was all I knew
Trying so to keep my love from showing

Your heart filled with dark despair
Thinking love would flame in you forever
And I'd never, never know the flame was there

Then one day we cast away our secret longing
The raging tide we held inside would hold no more
The silence at last was broken
We flung wide our prison door
Every joyous word of love was spoken

And now there's twice as much grief
Twice the strain for us
Twice the despair
Twice the pain for us
As we had known before

The silence at last was broken
We flung wide our prison door

And after all had been said here we are, my love
Silent once more and not far, my love

Call new days near for all here's the Japanese

Sandman sneaking on with the dew just an old second hand man
He'll buy your old day from you 
He will take every sorrow of the day that is through 
And he'll give you tomorrow just to start a life anew 
Then you'll be a bit older in the dawn when you wake 
And you'll be a bit bolder with the new day you make 
Here's the Japanese Sandman trade him silver for gold 
Just an old second hand man trading new days for old.",Japanese Sandman,2006

That's all she wrote
On the quest to qualify for these inquisitive quotes
Quirk ass M-C's be as Queer as Folk
Talkin' about, ""Nigga can rap""
No shit Sherlock, y'all just can't see me like Matt Murdoch
I'm the pinnacle rhyme kid and any line of mine is criminal mind
And I blind 'er with original rhyme shit
Fall in line with the sick, cynical grime shit
Clinically approved for you to move your behind with
Timeless are world girls who get inspired with Pharoahe
Do you need to be reminded now?
Stick 'em up, it's that
Get 'em up, it's that
Put 'em up, it's that
Let's go!

[Chorus]
Get up, how we rock
Don't know how we roll, yeah
Let's go!

Line 'em up
Light it up, fire it up
Wire me up, let it blow
One for the money, two for the show
Three to get it crackin' in the hood
Let's go!

They research my step cells, clone ten of me
Send one of 'em back in time just to get rid of me
Stop Pharoahe Monch from having verbal epiphanies
Now that's new definition to ""your own worst enemy""
I glisten man, stop snitching man
You use sex to sell, your Nextel to Sprint
Everything you represent is immoral
Cingular, not plural
You and your Sidekick get rid of that whack Trio
I freeze M-C's zero degrees below
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
You need to get loose, to the heat of produce
From Long Beach to Boston
Your chicks text us like Dallas and Austin
I spark tireless illumination
Fire sixteen bars, wireless communication
Let's go!

[Chorus]",Let's Go [Album Version (Explicit)],2007
Mela Machinko,"In my heart and in my mind
I'm gon' win, in due time
Show me the way, give me a sign
And I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine

Look man, do not get my block pissed, we'll blast your brain
Two hundred thousand dollar whips and chains
Crooked cops, Crips, crack cocaine
2Pac, Chris, I'm still feelin' the pain
Seven year old girl, shot and slain?
What does it all mean? We go insane
In the struggle, the stress make him asthmatic
We're I'm from, we do not eat organic (talk about it)
You see my mama can not afford Whole Foods
She break fast for the bread, call it soul food
Where I come from ? let it breathe
Where I come from, no one runs when funds run low in lump sums
We chose to dump dumb dumb but live dunn dunn
We livin hum drum in the slums
Where scum conceal stun guns
The words mum for fun son
Conundrums, ain't pretty!
In this cess pool called New York Shitty
I call it that cause it smell like shit!
Walk around hunchbacked or you might get hit (talk about it)
I knew a nigga sold crack to his moms
That same motherfucker sold crack to his kid
Lookin like three hundred comin back from his bid
Like ""Pharoahe, let's get this money for real""

In my heart and in my mind
I'm gon' win, in due time
Show me the way, give me a sign
And I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine

He said ""Pharoahe, let's get this money up""
What the fuck, what you need me to holla at Steve Rifkin?
Hit him, ""Escape from New York"" like Snake Plissken
I told you from the gate that you needed more marketing
And these major labels are not listenin'
Stood in a B boy stace, teeth glistenin'
From the gold in his mouth, the summer breeze was whistlin'
I contemplated my retort, eyes fixed in
On a crucifix around his neck, I guess he was Christian
Just then, the police siren had pitched in
To the soundtrack of the hood, so I spoke with conviction
Spoke as if I was 6'10"" with thick skin
Put a little bass in my voice like pitchmen
Cause where I come from
Where I come from, we all come from
Sky, moon, the stars, the Earth and Sun
Multiple skin tones, your blood is one
The pen is the ammo to my automatic gun
Bring to fruition what I write to get me out of the slums
And I'm a shine, sh-sh-shine, shine, shine
Shine like the Sun, the world is mine
Each line of speech designed to transcend time
And reach, the unborn to transform your mind
And I'm a shine, shine

In my heart and in my mind
I'm gon' win, in due time
Show me the way, give me a sign
And I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine

Now New York if ya in the house and ya turnin' it out
Without a doubt, know what I'm talkin' about
Just scream and shout and everybody say
Sh-sh-sh-shine, shine, shine

Now Detroit with the funky beats, gettin' wild in the street
See the mark of the beast, say fuck the police
What up X?
Shine, sh-sh-sh-shine, shine, shine

Chi-town with the funky sound, soul by the pound
Just get on down with the w-w-woo! w-w-whoa!
Say sh-sh-sh-shine, shine, shine

West coast, side with the most
Holdin your toast, ya brag, ya boast
What the ?, what the whoa!
Everybody say, sh-sh-sh-shine, shine, shine

Dirty, ah ah, dirty (ya know)
Dirty, ah ah, dirty (ya know)
Dirty, ah ah, dirty (come on) 
Dirty, ah ah, dirty (come on) 
Dirty, ah ah, dirty (come on) 
Dirty, ah ah, dirty (come on)

Melachrino Orchestra,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Melachrino Orchestra,"How I love the kisses of Dolores
Aye-aye-aye Dolores
Not Marie or Emily or Doris
Only my Dolores

From a balcony above me
She whispers ""Love me"", then throws a rose
Ah but she is twice as lovely
As the rose she throws

I would die to be with my Dolores
Aye-aye-aye Dolores
I was made to serenade Dolores
Chorus after chorus

Just imagine eyes like moonrise
A voice like music, lips like wine
What a break if I could make Dolores
Mine all mine.

Melachrino Orchestra,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2009
Melachrino Orchestra,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile

Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me

I would swear I was falling

Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""

While I'm alone and blue as can be

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing
