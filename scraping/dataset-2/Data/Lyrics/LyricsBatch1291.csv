My 24's Spinnin', The Sticker's Still On 'Em
The Same Ol' Hoes, But A Nigga Still Want 'Em
I'm Parkin Lot Pimpin' On Another Nigga Woman
She Pullin Up Her Skirt, Tryin Show A Nigga Sumthin
Ya' Car Cloudy, My Niggas All Rowdy
This Heinesy Got A Nigga Drowsy, I'm Outty
Now Where Them Hoes At, Look I'm Tryin To Take You Home
So What'cha Got Ya Girlfriends, Bitch Bring 'Em On
Hoe I'm Tryin To Break A Bone, When I Get In Them Draw's
To The Window, To The Muthafuckin Walls
What A Nigga Don't Know won't Hurt Him'
If Ya' Got A Old Man, Bitch I Ain't Worried
And I Got Plenty Room If Ya Think You want to Roll
See This Is What They Make Caddillac Trucks For
Let's Go To A Place You Ain't Never Been, Down In The Country
I Bet Ya, I Have Ya Sayin' Ya Love Me

Get Ya Ass On This Bike, I Can Show You I'm'a Ryder
The 600 Coupe, With The Old School Wires
Geovanni Rims, With Perely's On The Tires
They Said 22's Wouldn't Fit, But They Liers
We Can Take A Trip To The Hood And Back
Then Go And Get A Room, How Hood Is That?
What'cha Waitin' On Shorty? This The Chance Of Your Life
What I Mean What I See In Them Jeans, I Like
You Don't Know What Your Missin', Just Quit Talkin And Listen
See I'm Just Holdin Up Traffic, I'm Just Right Here Sittin'
Think About It 'For I Bounce, And You Holla, I'm Wrong
And Ya' See Your Best Friend, In This Impala, Ridin' On Chrome
If Your Ballin In Your Money Long, You Can Relate
But All Them Broke Ass Niggas Gon' Hate

It's All On You, If You Gon' Trick, Or You Gon' Get Yo' Dough
I Know I Got These Haters Mad, I Can Love That
When You Got Love For The Streets, They Give Ya' Love Back
Look In My Eyes, You Can Tell I Ain't Never Scared
Poppin' Them Thangs, I'm Rockin My Chain Anywhere
If You Gon' Represent Your Hood, What You Waitin On?
Security Better Back Up, When They Play This Song
And We 'Bout 50 Strong, Please Don't Make Us Do You Wrong
My Click Of Gorilla's, They Got They G-Unit's On
All Of That Mean Muggin' Really Don't Mean Nuthing

Muthafucka, I'm A Monster In This Game, Similar To The Lachness
My Rhymes Is Nappy Rooted, Sum Verses Gotta Process
The Truth In This Booth, Ain't No Doubts When I'm Rappin'
If I Say It, I've Either Done It, Or It's 'Bout To Happen
When I Pull Up In The Louis Truck On 26's, People Dumb Out
If Lifes A Crap Game, I'm Rollin' 7's On The Come Out
These Rapper's Think I'm Ig-nent, Love Sayin' My Name
'cause Maintainin My Fish Tank, And They House, Cost The Same
Ask Me, I'd Say I Made It, And It Sure Wasn't Luck
Becuz Hustler's Relate To Me, And Some Are Younger Than Buck
You See I'm Married To My Music, But We Got A Prenupt
So If That Bitch Don't Act Right, I'm Still Gettin My Cut
My Deals Never Get Screwed, My Contracts Practice Abstinence
I'm Masterin This Program, Hazin' These Undergraduates
So, Pimpin' Be Easy, Quit Catchin' Feelings
'cause You Worth A Couple Hundred Grand, And I'm Worth Millions
Nobodys Thinkin' About You, Plus Your Beef Ain't Legit
So Please Stay Off The T.I.P. Of My Dick

I need some sleep, the fiends still comin'
Bush 'bout to blow this bitch up
Better get money, dead bodys get picked up
I'm David in teen's now
Niggas we're digital, but they work triple beams now
I'm livin' for me now, 'cause I done went to war with the other side
Lucky me, 'cause the enemies mother and brother died
Hot shot gun shell's and teflon chest plate's
It's tatt'ed on my arm nigga, thugin' till my death day
Ya'll niggas just wait, right after my court date 
It's gonna get grimey, like new york say
Bitch niggas horse play, real niggas gon' spray
Bang the fo', change clothes, and come back the same day
Better holla mayday, 'cause we comin'
And we gunnin at any muthafucka want sumthin

They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel
'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill

I'm already dead, can't kill me nigga
And even if I do die, I'm still gon' kill ya
I'm unfamiliar with a lot of these soldiers
I go out in the road, and niggas think that it's over
Runnin, the fiends all puttin too much soda on the d'
You would think niggas know, 'cause they older than me
Been here longer than me, and still peace'n a ounce out
How can ya' be a birdman, if you don't know how to count
It's back to the black gloves, and home invasions
Puttin holes in a nigga, the size of a gold dayton
No I'm not waitin on nothin, no more
Eather you pay me what you owe me, or I'm cuttin ya throat
Nigga ya baby momma know me, go and ask the hoe
How I done tied her ass up over a bag of dope
I'll be glad to go to the pen over revenge
I'm comin' out the same way, a nigga went in

They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel
'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real

Real niggaz from the turf, shit I know y'all feel that
We won't talk, ain't no need for that (fuck that)
The word on Snoop is I'm a G for that
A 'G' for what? Fuckin niggaz up with no talkin
See the best way to leave a nigga's off in a coffin
And now I'm back on the set and I'm walkin

Wouldn't feed me when I was hungry, I couldn't ignore it
But I stay to my lonely, and didn't show it

Cristal I let you po' it while I fuck with the Hennessey

Welcome to the life of a young thug nigga (yea)
Only hang out wit' them criminals and drug dealers (ayyy)
I'm from even where dead die (die)
But try an' do it big like the kid from Bedstuy
I see death around the corna and I ain't scared
I got a carbon 15 and I'm fully prepared (that's right)
Lord a mercy 20 rounds in a clip (yea)
Outta line get 20 rounds in ya hip (ayyy)
Shoot first and ask questions lata' (lata)
The answer is it was all about the paper (yea)
Everything the game is shit to lose
And a new forty-five that I'm dyin' to use (yeahhhh)

[Chorus - Ill Will]
If ya real like me (like me)
Throw ya hoods in the air so the whole wide world can see (ay)
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed
And if ya real like me (like me)
Keep that thang on ya hip that's just the way that it's gotta be
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed

[Verse 2 - Young Buck]
I done seen niggaz come and go
Shit the whole world done seen what I done before
We do anythang when the funds is low
I'm the reason outta towners don't come no mo'
Let me show you niggaz how to break down the whole thang
My nigga B.G. know Buck been a birdman
It's got to be in ya blood to be a thug
If I ain't makin' enough I'ma jack my plug
We was born in it
Not sworn in it
You can go against it or you can join wit' it
Made my mark so the streets gon' remember me
Now come and get it nigga Cashville Tennekee holla back

[Verse 3 - Trick Daddy]
Some of the dudes we thought was real O.G.'s was O.B's
Cause they talked pleas and included G's like you and me
The first step was going to set a trap
So in a short period, they convinced the grand jury to allow a phone tap
And if they listenin'
Not once did they hear us mentioning
Murder and a cocaine distributing
Through all that was dividends comin' in
I'm strict legit, and better yet we too smart for ya bullshit
Callin all cars (callin all cars)
Hit your brother along
And tell 'em hurry up and come them niggaz got gunz
Man down, shots fired, only fuck niggaz and cops died
First stage of a riot
And them fucks couldn't sneak by
Oh you want to witness some shit
Fine bitch, be quiet
Because they only got what you tell 'em
And only witness that they had, the bitch was layin' there dead
Shot in the street all red, with two shots to his head
Cause he was workin for the feds
And the last informant, informed us
They had it out for us
For a bird that he got popped for
So ride or die for him (ride or die for him)
Better yet, you better kill 'em
Cause I think he's gonna be the bitch to tell 'em
And he probably done all ready told 'em
But then again with out a witness them bitches ain't got shit

Car pull out the phantom
Niggas can't stand it but them hoes gon' come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my cheese

Stop at the light and pause on 3
Hit the mall and it be all on me
But gotta keep one eye out for the po-po
Close the window when I roll the indo
Know they mad 'cause I roll the Benzo
It's that purple not pretend-o
Three 6 Mafia and they my kin folks
So when I'm in Memphis, Ten-a-key

'Cause them niggas still let me smoke for free

Since I have met you girl you ruined my brain (Ruined my brain)

Yo girlfriend wanna ride with me
In the car wit a pimp where she supposed ta be
You ain't met no dudes spittin' cold as me
With a bag of kush that cost six-fifty
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughin' and choking constantly
Tastes like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That should be the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit,
Hit that shit, hold that shit,
Blow that shit out slow
Then pass it to me bro

MJ gonna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, leave a nigga runnin' back
Where the nigga really good sticky number at
Cuttin' through the cigarillo like a lumberjack
In the morning what I need is to breath again a whole lot of weed
But maybe somebody can give me what I need when I want no less than the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, 8-ball and M-J-G
And Young Buck we don't give a fuck
We must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessey

And we be like Bill Clinton girl take it out ya mouth

One in the chamber on the table when you chillin for lunch,
And head up with your door open feelin your blunt,
Where I'm from 20 gone by the end of the month,
I get drunk smoke the weed to the end of the blunt,
Make sure 10 shells done been in the pump,
If its on-first draw that's a nigga wit luck,
All niggas playin games start endin em up,
'cause your block young buck will start bendin em up,
As soon as your adrenaline pump,
Make way dear lord 'cause I'm sendin em up

Stack your cheese in all different ways,
Tote your strap and keep your khakis creased,
Yeah nigga, you a thug like me?

Put em all up, 
Got 2 so we got you but we don't give a fuck,
Seals comin gunnin out the cut,
Spittin at you cats,
Spittin 50 rounds like I'm spittin on a track, 
Y'all niggas know that you can't hold that,
Ima spit the gat till the gat click-clat,
Then chit chat,
Niggas gun learn that you beef with this here this heat gone burn,
Ima show ya cats how to bus y'all guns, 
Hit a nigga up and leave his ass left numb,
Don't play with me, 
You know I spray the heat,
The A.K. gun niggas down fatefully,
You think expectfully, just wait and see,
Young buck and D-tay nigga ready to g,

Oh you don't wanna holla?
Well whatever bitch,
Don't say shit when the bezzle flip,
See a nigga tote straps for the hell of it,
I ain't givin a fuck about jealous shit,
And I don't smoke weed for the smell of it,
Just before I kill, I inhale the shit,
You can't trail me bitch I be in 50 states,
Paranoid, with about 50 cakes,
Once a nigga find out its all heart no shake,
That's when I infest the place,
I'm thugged out, 
Up in the drug house,
Got it all-from the beer to a quarter ounce,
We da real ass niggas, all work no slouch,
Can I get that there? all that count,
All they amount,
But when it go down and a nigga make all ya say all that out, 
What you gunna do nigga what you about,
Either ride or die, when I'm raised in the south,
Love the block, when a nigga wake up,
I wash my face and then hug my glock,
Brush my teeth and scream south side,
Smoke a blunt and put on my socks,
But it still don't stop, from dusk to dawn,
A nigga been out here on his own-livin day to day,
See I'm only 17 but a nigga out here just gains farm

Dem gangsta niggaz from J.C. center court 12th, 3rd Avenue, my block
Nigga, murder, murder mayne

I come nake faceded, ain't no need for a ski-mask
From neck down, I'm black down, eye to eye when I blast
No question, I got the code
Now how many bodies out there, take out before I reload, hit 'em below

His fuckin' knees, before we leave, we gon' locate them ki's
A nigga gotta eat, ya heard me?
You know the player when we get there, kill everything in there
Leavin' no clues, like we never even been there

Life ain't fair but fuck it, it's a new year
I'm grabbin' my strap, cockin' it back and boo-yaa
We almost thay, lock down the spot
Put your vest on punk, we in the parking lot
One of them, all day killers, who's hard to spot
Jackin' all y'all whether it's dark or not

It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about

We did our job, now we on the next mission
The next victim, go on, see if the tec spittin'
No bullshittin', see they don't know just how we livin'
I'm goin' all out, I ain't scared to go to prison

Make your own decision, it's gon' be a long ride
I need the money, I can't wait a long time
Keep a strong mind 'cause we done waited in a long line
Just to get our shine on, now it's our time

Believe that, it's our turn
Pull out your weapon to burn, get what you earned
We all must learn, that money is the key to life
And niggaz gon' die if we ain't eatin' right

Life lookin' like my momma said it would
Whether or not, I still ride for the hood, I'm on my block

My niggaz they slang rocks, shoot it out with cops
From J.C., the center court life's hard knocks
Hold on, grab your glock, did you see the car stop?
Which one? The black Benz with the top dropped

Fuck 'em, the mac-10 with the infrared dot
Represent how I'm livin', keep on drivin' down the block

I make one move, hit your block, and your whole spot hot
Uh-huh, if you're lucky have your whole block cocked
Now I ain't sayin that's gon' stop all my niggaz that chop
Cause in they mind, ain't no dyin, niggaz flip to get flopped
Shootin more than 50 shots and my heart catch not
When the gunfire a-start it ain't no callin the cops
Besides, you started beef, I'm just bringin it back
All my niggaz you hunt around so what you packin a gat?
Just leave that where it's at, or leave here on your back
Make one move like you're reachin and I'm leavin you flat
Warnings I'm givin you, but you never did listen
So I'm spittin Smith & Wessons 'til they out of ammunition
I'm clip totin, holdin rollin with my cousin Priest
I'm back, and ridin in the candy painted 'llac
We max, and gettin all these hoes for they cheese
We jack, and gettin all these ballers for they ki's

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Didn't think that I would make it this far, throwin rocks at the pen
Left niggaz layin dead and I did it in sin
And I'd do it again, thugged out 'til the end
Still we gon' keep ridin 'til we caught in the wind

[Rizin Sun]
Nigga I'm gon' make it if I gotta rob and steal
Cock back my grill, let 'em know this burner's for real
When the coast is cleared that's when I plan my escape
Wanted in 50 states, my first shot is debate
Don't be late, Buck we got hits to make
50 is you with me, if they really want me they'd come and get me
Now I'm a fugitive on the run, killers don't leave home
Without the gun, blaze one
They got me nationwide all over the world they tryin to turn me in
But the pearls, I think ahead on that
Fuck the pen, I'm tryin to see my money stacks
If you lookin for me I'm where the ballers at
Drinkin Cristal gettin smoked out
Try not to take the bar out, but they done, tapped my house
I'm goin all out, got me on some major shit
Dressed in black, when I attack, please believe that

[Chorus]

[Young Buck]
I need to get my hands on somethin, I suggest you play it low
Get your last words in when the soldier's rag over my nose
Look the anger done build up, I'm damn near about to blow
Tryin to unhook a time bomb when I'm right at zero
Fuck a stolen vehicle, we gon' pull up in luxury
Bubbilize somethin, survive nigga you're lucky
When shit get ugly, bustin e'rythang that rush me
Swingin this fuckin chopper 'til my arms get musty
This occasion calls for military issue buddy
My fetti took a slight fall now y'all gon' be bloody
Young Buck, a.k.a. Frank Nitti of the city
Ain't fakin none to DT's, you got it then come and get me
But the form I come in, I swear it's hard to hit me
Not a face bein shown, just a chrome tucked in my dickies

This for the block nigga
E'ry nigga out there who God damnit maintainin
Off slangin 'caine and all dem, thangs
And why'knowwhatI'mtalkinbout I feel that (I feel that)
See I done been in that situation where niggaz flip birds
Y'all know the gangsta, lil' young nigga
Who thugged out all night on the curb, came up from a GRAM

And bitch I got 'em warrin for 10-5, the new nigga in town
I'm the king of this drug ring, just waitin to be crowned
You havin money by the ton, I got thousands by the pound
And the urge to splurge for all you niggaz want an ounce
Ain't no problem with the product, long as you got the amount
And every bit of my fetti, cause every bit of it count
I'ma roll in the low, rain snow hot or cold
Finish my narcotics and put my bitches on the road
First nigga try and jack, watch murder go kill them hoes
All white, no crack, how I get it, how it go
17 years old, I'm rappin 10 at a time
To me, front shit ain't punk shit, long as I get mine
And we can get down to shine, no more sellin them dimes
Put 20's on our rides, fuck hoes with thick thighs
Then maybe you can see, how it is to be rich
You ain't heard about a nigga? I be servin them bricks

[Chorus]
Nightfall to sunshine, 24 hour shifts
If crime didn't pay, I'd be still on the strip [repeat 2 lines 3X]
Nightfall to sunshine, 24 hour shifts
Look - if crime didn't pay, I'd be still on the strip

[Young Buck]
I've survived off this cocaine game, and it's a strain to my brain
To front a nigga a thang, 'bout mine he won't complain
Conversation rule the nation, y'all niggaz know the sayin
Prayin I don't catch ya wit'cha watch I'll take ya out the picture
Money run the country, similar to Adolf Hitler
Always been to drugs but see it's different kind of dealers
You pay what you weigh, or should I say, get my scrilla
Not tomorrow but today, okay, it's on the real'a
I ain't tryin to be a killer just a nigga 'bout his cheddar
And I ain't got it, you can't cancel the bill collector
Coulda been did your rump, put your family in the middle
But I chose to be a man and keep it on that level
Your potnahs done told you about this young runnin rebel
And the load he carries behind if I can't get mine
So robbin niggaz blind is the way I'ma play the game
Gotta respect my mind and if you don't you still payin

[Chorus]

[Young Buck]
I'm a 100% for the Presidents
I never been hesitant, to leave 'em layin with no evidence
Gotta make the best of this, stack my cheese
Then come back and get the rest of it, transportin ki's
In the Benz with the leather kit, ride with me
When you hear that Desert Eagle click it's world war 3
This ain't how it 'posed to be, but ain't no fuckin role model
Besides people down in hell still want ice water
Now how you livin nigga? When hard times come
Can you stand prison nigga, or you gon' run yo' tongue?
What's that on yo' arm? You feel like it make a man?
Well let me get that and yo' charm, but turn around and count to 10
Can't turn soldier in one day, the thug gotta just be within
Your blood or yo' family, the streets gon' tell how good you been
But see I'm a young nigga {edited} in his face
Since 12 I had a triple beam servin them cakes

[Chorus]

",Crime Pays,2005
Young Buck,"See nigga we thugged out for a reason
Niggaz ain't thuggin, because, they like the look nigga
Or they like to be on these streets nigga
Nigga we thuggin cause we gotta eat out'chea where I'm from
Ca$hville, gangsters nigga

[Verse One]
I had to step back and regroup myself, overlook employees
And see how much juice was left cause niggaz came for me
Revolvers to fullies increasin my ki' movings
Soakin game from Baby watchin old mob movies
Two all gold clips, go with this platinum uzi
To keep you bitches losin 'round Christmas time when the jackers choosin
Niggaz refusin feel that heat first, shit gets deeper
See when we beef we make yo' street hurt, check yo' beeper
The job is done when you get 911's
Receivin calls talkin 'bout son your lil' brother all alone
My attitude can quickly change potnah
Heads get bust open like Priest when he poppin bottles
No role models to look up to when you ghetto raised
Leavin no clues, stack revenues in different ways
Trade that deuce 57 and get yourself two K's
Then let a nigga know how much mo' you made in two days

[""Infrared on all straps"" sample repeats]

[Verse Two]
How can a nigga blame another nigga for the way he would plan
His operation led to destination under sand
Some niggaz playin with me are scared to stand behind their steel
Shake up and break up what was organized for years
Shed tears, when white folks hand a nigga a L
Ball up and fuck all up a nigga mail
Beeper reportin low, when you put in a Duracell
Put it in your mind, cause that's the first sign they on the trail
Where I dwell, there's plenty money shit be hard to tell
Who doin the yap yappin so they tappin up the cells
When you lived on the hill, was never late payin yo' bills
Now you back to the projects, shit out here gettin real
Somebody lackin they skills and they street smart
Ain't no sunshine playboy, they life dark
It takes one star, one car, one nigga who made it far
One thug, one grudge and it's life behind bars

[""Infrared on all straps"" sample repeats]

[Verse Three]
I stand all man nigga, though a child in age
I got my own brain, my own ways to go and get paid
Niggaz want you in the shade but when you come out and shine
Then here it is you owe 'em somethin, but what about mine?
I never signed a dotted line, therefore just let me be
T.I.P. took me under and we headed to the highest peak
I might as well just speak, for the soldiers with Buck
Load your artillery, prepare to put your guns up
You think it'll get to this, Bowre told me it would
Said it's all good no more, puttin on your black hood
Still the same frustration that stay beatin my chest
If it ain't one of these bitches then these niggaz won't test
A meal ticket nuttin less, that's what I'm shootin for
And in my quest for chips, there's some shit you can't ignore
So I load up the 4, if you want it then let it be
All these fake niggaz tryin to be just like me

[""Infrared on all straps"" sample repeats]

",Dickie Fits,2005

You niggaz got me fucked up, it's time to go to war
Nigga so what's up, I bust up, any muh'fucker feelin he rougher
I can't get enough of, showin niggaz what time it is
Go inside his crib, find his kids 'til we find the shit
Go ahead and keep buyin shit, act like you run the town
On the worst day, your birthday, that's when I cut you down
Let me show you how, to make this money by the pound
Get a black dickie fit, can't forget the hundred rounds
Still a murder man, told myself I'd never hurt again
Niggaz out here hoes, so I'm kickin in they do's
And nobody knows when a nigga like me be comin
Nigga stop drop and roll when a nigga like me be gunnin
Wanna live to see tomorrow? Better calm down your woman
And that shit in that plastic bag better be all hundreds
When my mask down, that mean I'm ready to blast now
Taught your ass a lesson, bet you'll learn how to act now

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Get your murder on - cock it back and let it go
Bitch I represent them killers who be kickin in them do's
Get your murder on - black down from head to toe
See I tried to tell you once niggaz don't want war

[Verse Two]
Just look at life from my point of view, run where I call home
Feel what a gun do and I'll bet you {?}
Wonder why my mind strong livin the life
When niggaz really don't live long playin me sheist
See I'm goin all out, like straight hoes to dykes
Switchin the game around like Reeboks from Nikes
Stayin in my black dickies, t-shirts all white
Thugged out, what it's all about, all right
Let's just shoot it out now, we can do it all night
It don't matter, the 50 caliber gon' bite
Watch 'em scatter, the loud sound got 'em all fright
Get the cheddar, then let them cowards hear the dual pipes
When we bite, we fight like pits on red meat
Is this life the shit nigga? Yes it fuckin be
Freaks take a glimpse, they scream Buck's the shit
Now fiend for the dick, as I lean in the 6

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Back in my 'llac the auto fo'-fo's and Optimos
Kickin in do's on the one stressin {?}
Let me get that out you hoes, me and my snub nose
Bonnie and Clyde, when we ride, both of us have open eyes
Realized I'm a young nigga, puttin it fuckin down
Never goin to sleep without a hundred fuckin miles
Layin it down, my name is known throughout town
Blaka blaka, blaka blaka

Is it my turn to show them niggaz we be stars on tracks
Start up beef, we in yo front yard with gats
So don't go with that, we leave you flat paralyzed from the neck
With a motherfuckin' hole in ya back
It ain't my fault if you balled hard
Start slimin' up the walls, leave him in his draws
Nigga you know the protocol
We were born for hard ball
Stealin' cars and livin' life hard ya heard me

[Hook]
If y'all gon' ride with me, get high with me
Then go and get the straps nigga gunfire with me
You'll die quickly, when we apply all fifty
My real niggaz, hard hitters they ride with me
If y'all gon' ride with me, get high with me
Then go and get the straps nigga gunfire with me
You'll die quickly, when we apply all fifty
My real niggaz, hard hitters they die with me

[Verse 3]
We did it all in our lifetime
Dealin' drugs, bustin' them slugs
Runnin' with thugs, when it get down to them broads
They ain't showin' no love
Put his face in the mud
Fuckin' with the hard hitters, D-Tay my nigga
Got contracts to get 'em, lyrical spitter
We slaved on the figures found out who's better
From Nashville to Chucktown we go round for round
City to city and then we knock it down

[Verse 4]
Yeah we'll lock it down
Then we hit these niggaz spot up with fifty rounds
The best pound for pound
Representin' the town
That'll clown when it's time for the showdown, better slow down
(D-Tay unload the four pound)
This shit's about to go down nigga
Whoa now leave these niggaz shit tore down
Whole town be locked down
Got the whole world shocked now
T.I.P. on top now

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I'll put it all on the line for these gangsta ass niggaz of mine
First Born, D-Tay we hard hitters combined
Talk shit and ya dyin' if ya think that I'm lyin'
Ask that nigga named Bryan, caught six in the spine
And we ain't hard to find we just sleep in the daytime
After the sunshine we duckin' for war time
You said you want what now
See go to war nigga, hard hitters we buck wild
Just us four niggaz
See we live for gunfire, kick in ya door nigga
If we come at lunchtime, we afternoon killers
Who that playa with mine

Who done did some time and wanna mitch new figures
Get the tools niggaz, let's show the world how we abuse niggaz
Cock back the hammer and just shoot nigga
All for the loot nigga

And sag my jeans, da average gehtto childs dream,
Turnin some cream and rollin vitwizy wil lizzy, why still he's a team,

Affiliated wit Mobb niggas, and blood spillas

Find him in the car leakin from dope over split wigs
Deadly lyrics to spit
Makin sure the killas feelin my shit
Explicit lyrics an adult content
Shot callas representin at all the major events
And gang bangin' got the streets juss way too tense
I learned to deal wit it
I'm in the fields, windows tinted on my wheel wit the steel in it
We keep puffin an rollin real wit it
That jury linin, showcasin our diamonds to benifits
Of a long time grindin, enjoyin the fruits of our labor
And rented suits from my tailors
Some young playas, strivin for greater

No disguise, in the middle of the street
Buckin at police
Fuck police
Got a Range Rove jeep
Wit tweleve open faced gold teeth
A Rolex piece
Cuban Links, crops, an bracelets
But that ain't shit, to leave a nigga naked, duct taped wit they bitch
In the basement
Where the safe is?
Big faces
Cops raided, but ended up gettin they fuckin' squad car grenaded
You want blazed shit?
I spit the nitroglycerian
That's smoother than a pair of new cinnamon Timberlands
Get Benjamin's
But be no P Diddy

Shock the world like Snoop at No Limit

First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya

In the club 'til they coughin' on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin' up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke, my boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an RIP shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin', reminiscin'
Holdin' my weed in, never listen
If I see him I'ma lift 'em

I took 30 off a pack and I made them sales

Look man, it's a hood thang; that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug 'bout, born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet

[Trick Daddy:] 
Our father who art in heaven 
Hallowed thy be thy name, thy kingdom come 
All our G's would've been gone (would've been done) 
If it wouldn't for thug holiday (ahh man) 

[Verse 1: Trick] 
In this life I live, I done see niggaz deal 
Seen niggaz steal and done seen niggaz kill 
And them same niggaz there, them be the main ones that tell 
There's a lotta tension in the air, so nigga easy on them pills 
I rather be the bitch that's squeezing than the nigga that's bleeding 
See I'ma drink my liquor and I'ma smoke my weed 
And I'ma stay far away from y'all buster motherfuckers 
Y'all sucker motherfuckers, man fuck you motherfuckers 
I'm being convicted of a thug living and drug dealing 
Been a two time convicted felon ever since I was a lil' nigga 
My first words was curse words, shit, the first bid I did I was just a lil' kid 
And I was raised by pimps, hoes and mobsters 
Taught the game by dope boys and robbers 
I ran the steets with goons, I broke the rules with fools 
I used to take my motherfucking tool to school 

[Chorus: Trick] 
See I been thuggin all my life, trying to live right, you ain't even got ask 
I got that Hen in my cup, smoke in my lungs, what you know about that 
You already know (straight up), You already know (straight up) 
You already know (straight up), You already know (straight up) 
You alread know (straight up), Straight up (straight up) 

[Verse 2: Buck] 
These feds crazy trying to take me down and book me 
Throw me on death row and do me like Big Tookie 
Got me running from them rookies and poppin at the seargent 
Tried to tell not to push me now look what you done started 
And you got these rap artists thats beefing on these songs 
But I really will kill so I'm leaving that alone 
I'm a grown ass man that ain't about playing 
Ten G's will get you killed, family will die for twenty grand 
Blow my nose with a Gucci rag smoking on a cuban 
You damn right I know they mad, cuz half of em' losing 
I slip a another clip into my A.K. 
Stay with Trick in M.I.A. when I come and get the yae 
See the Chevy got a stash spot 
I can fit a hundred in the back and just mash out 
Hope I make it home, it they catch me then I'm gone 
So we put it on the line 
Everyday we on the grind gotta hustle til' you shine 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3: Trick] 
My blood line is a level above the thug line 
And according to the cat scan I ain't a ordinary man 
See I run off oil and I breathe off chronic 
I power up off money like a motherfucking bionic 
I travel through time with a military mind 
Strapped with a Russian A.K. and a German made nine 
And don't mad at the [?] they ain't the one trying to attack us 
It's slimy ass niggaz and red neck ass crackers 
Y'all better lower your weapons (lower your weapons) 
Before my niggaz get to steppin 
Cuz shit can get real crazy if it was a thug invasion 
Imagine a whole bunch of Cuban niggaz and Haitians 
Rebellion on your ass 
For the shit you did to us in the past 
See y'all [?] and even arrested fiends 
It took you fifteen years to close the ave 
It's going to be twenty more before they close the ? 
Now where my motherfucking twenty one soldiers at 
Now where my D Boy big gun toters at

If you gon' give it to me baby, give it to me
Don't play games, jus' give it to me baby

Don't hurt nobody when you move that thang
You a make a nigga jus' lose his brain
When you make that ass clap and swing your hips
Put your head in my lap then lick your lips
Come on dip baby dip, yeah I'm about my pimp
With a whole lotta ice twenty-fours on my whip
You can all take a trip the after party
Thirty two room mansion and ten garages
Make a home flick, how them real minages
So tell your girls it's just me and my partners
We don't throw dollaz we start with twenty's
And there's more where that came from, come get with

[Chorus]

Yo yo
I just wanna get you hot and wet
I'm so seductive I make 'um fiend for the sex
I just wanna stroke your brain
For the first half hour then I smoke your thang
This is exclusive sex we a star couple
On the lee-low though we too much trouble
And your friend's is hot, and my friend's is the shit
We can have our own private party at the crib
The haze the licks, your legs can sit
On top of my shoulders while I'm goin' in
Yeah I talk dirty and we jus' met
But you feelin' the vibe you gotta admit

A nigga thinkin' bout change contemplating my death
Fell my pain as it reigns all over a nigga
And the only way I can get away is weed and liquor
Fuckin' niggas up on the daily if they didn't pay me
Niggas pullin' guns on me damn near drove me crazy
Young nigga went to school just to sell some dope
A lil' crazy ass nigga wit a knife in his coat
And in the streets broke heathens went through drama especially
Momma swung on a nigga, I stabbed the bitch in her head (nigga)
I dun scratch my head unless it itchs
An I dun smoke unless I'm bustin' at you hatin' bitches
Nigga we was brave to die, dont be askin me why

Franklin, ain't the end, I was here when it begin
See if ya ridin' davin rims, celebrate by lettin' em' spin
I bought some new ones in, to replace the older rims
What type of rims? that depends is it the truck, the bike, or van
Had to hop out, and stop my spinners on the rims
My alarm kept detecting motion pokin' out of them
Man, I'm just sayin', y'all know koopa don't be playin'

Fiends don't give a damn, they want who got the cheap price
I'm trying to get right, get it and go
You see people is dyin' fast, and the money is slow
We used to hang in front of the store
Flag down cars to be a movie star, go get a glass jar
Once you cook it and cut it homie, go stand out in public
See the work sell's itself, if ya got enough of it
Plenty thugs get shot, but see its all in the game
Even I took a couple of 'em, but still I remain
I ain't dippin' from that same lead project figga
I done went with no lights, and no water nigga
And I'm still hood, that mean I still cook
Get on the block and go get mine, like you should

You know tha kid stay with his Nike's new, tha throwback is light blue
Came out around the time, my grandmother graduated high school
Most these rap niggas softer than Ja Rule
And they've been in and out as many walkmans as I do
Take time, to figure out who's walkin' beside you
Cause this sonic can feel like a fork when inside you
You mad, cause ya bitch like us
And all of my records get thumbs up, like I'm ridin' by hitchikers
Stumblin' out the g4, cause that's how tha stars land
Shit I prolly been through more trees than tarzan
On tha road, tha hoes take a look at tha cars and
It's back tha hotel, titties and bras man
Tha new ""strap don""
You might call me ignorant, but if you cow you belong in tha phat farm
When tha lights get bigger I act calm

Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch em in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
As long as she ain't stoppin', homie I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat man its on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle its on
And we gon' sip til every bubble in the bottle is gone

And a eightball of white, I got mine
Well, not quite, I got signed
And fifty put me right in the light, it took time
Meanwhile I'm livin the life
Where a nigga just might see prison tonight
My rent due, baby need food and shoes
I'm flat broke, still I refuse to lose
So I smoke, lookin' for the fools with jewels
I'm 'bout to see if it's true what a Uzi do
Nobody cares, and life ain't fair or free
The best thang you can do is say a prayer for me
And how dare, y'all try to lock me up

Cause L.T. got life, and Big Ju got fifty
Jimmy did his ten and D doin his twenty
Come get me, seems like it's no way out
So when I say ""Dirty,"" you say ""South""
Tryin' to put my hands on somethin', brush off my shoulders
Buy up some land or somethin', get what they owe us
You don't have a plan, you're nuttin' is what they told us

What's goin' on with the Unit these days? (let 'em know)

Took a couple losses, still we some outlaws
Ya bitch still lovin' my swag
We let you niggaz eat, why the fuck is you mad?
I never left the streets, I really ran to 'em
And since I know they watchin' me I let my man do 'em

In an all-black tinted-up drop top Bentley

I got my own jewelry baby, this ain't none of his (okay!)
Just holla when you need me
Show a nigga love when you see me
I can carry the weight, fifty just put it on my shoulders
G-Unit is the gang, I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
They thought it was over, he let me out the cage (hey!)
So now they got me standin on this goddamn stage, like

[Chorus]

Before I leave let me put this on your brain
If rap stop today, I still do my thang
I bought a Benz way before I bought me a chain
Took my momma out the Bricks and bought a car in her name
Paid my nigga Head bond just to get him on the streets
Hope if I get locked up niggaz do it for me
Keep the project lights on, payin' e'rybody bills
All my homies dead, I'm takin' care of e'rybody kids
And I got this, you can count on me
To come through, when the home team down by three
I'm gon' shoot, and even if a nigga did miss
I bet you next quarter I'll be back in this bitch, like

See, this pill kickin' in, and I'm standin' wit' my glock
In this bitch like Woo; I need some elbow room

Bitch, we built this city; the dope boy committed
I still got the nerds to sell it up, and come and get it
A product of the projects, my mama's only son
Made my first million dollas, and a new drama would come
Didn't run from it; I ran to it
I'm not playin' 'bout the unit, and my fans knew it
Now make the lane for me 'cause I deserved this
I wonder what my enemies get when they hear this (Let's go!)

Gotta run a gram fifty, and my A-K wit' me
If a mothafucka hit me, I'm a knock his head off!
I ain't scared of none of y'all, bitch
I'm runnin' from the law
Put ya trigga fingas up if ya wanna knock they head off!
Push a weight all through the state
It's like I speed up when they tell me hit my brakes (aye!)
If I told you what I make e'ry time I flip a key
You would probably try to take the same trip dat I did
But you can't (aye)

It say two hundred, but it go a little over
Not the Corvette, the Ferrari Testarossa
We can bet on any point on the dice
Pick 'em up, shake 'em twice, get 'em, girl
Look, I'm nice; I'm so clean with my G-Unit kicks on
I might be goin' in when pimp C get home

Just because I caught a case don't mean you can't be erased

They talk behind my back, but they won't say it to my face
Ho, say it to my face (yeah), say it to my face (yeah)

It gotta be the cars or the trips that I take

Trillest nigga in the flesh; you can't fuck wit' it
Got the German hand guns - they shoot two, two, three
Bust through ya condo and rip open ya knees (rip open ya knees)
My nigga, please, you don't want it; save your breath
By myself I'm a ride till no enemy is left
When the middle finger niggas hit your block like insurgents
There's no deterrence from us cleanin' your clock like detergents

Why, this pimp - I bet they die before they reach their first

And I'll be damned if I run you bust though
They run outta guns; man, you so dumb
You faker than a bitch snitchen' on the track
I'm about to pull a bun

All Ball do is smoke weed and get bad bitches
And if y'all mad at me for that, then y'all niggas some bitches
Undercover groupie niggas want them stop and plead
For the last time I don't smoke regular weed
It don't matter where we at, man

Well, at least when a **** had time to go
Walk to the bus stop, sellin' **** on the way

Fell in love with a shorty that was bad
I would go and skip class just so I could see that ****
But she was too fast and I was too slow
'Cause she wanted a **** who already had dough

She found her a man who was like 24
But what she didn't know, that he had plenty ****
She was too young, so now he got a new one
'Cause shorty went and bought her a new ****

See when she catch this ****, she gon' do somethin'

He lost his life because the war made him crazy

When I think how he died, I get real cold
'Cause they found him in a field with some crack stones
There was no flesh, it was just bones

I was just home with my cousin Craig
And then I got a phone call, said they found him dead
So what's next, ain't went to Bizz funeral yet
Instead of one casket, I need two of them ****

It don't quit, just when you think I'm seein' better days
My auntie just find that she got AIDS
And it's **** up 'cause her life don't end
And she locked up, so she dyin' in the pen, ****

I'm prayin ain't no kids out playin today
'cause I ain't tryna see no babies gettin hit with a stray
So if ya enemy is hidin home then turn off ya lights
Then throw this bitch in bar, we gettin out tonight
I wanna look him in his eyes before he die
Some niggas get away when the shells start to fly
We gonn' make sure anybody out there breathin gonn' be bleedin
Everybody out there leakin then we leavin
We get away, car parked in a dark alley
Just cut up through the yard, hop a fence then we at it
We off to the next block, catch me if you can
Gunpowder on my shirt and some blood on my hands
Never thought I'd see the day that I'd be killin me a man
This here for 50's enemies to make em understand that

And I don't be havin all them nightmare dreams
They say I have no conscience, my heart just cold

We hold niggas hostage, ya kid now hosed
The news to this game man we play how it goes

Every murder that go down they knockin at my door
Gotta know what you doin and how to shuffle it out
And once the homie go do it he gotta muzzle his mouth

This is the land of the free, but to me that's wrong
I'm on my way to the white house strapped wit' my heat
So don't fall asleep
Come on niggas

Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

They say that the mo' they hate ya the mo' that it motivate ya
My mind set on grind, my mental set on the paper
62 hours and countin', and I'm still awake
And they slippin' me sleepin' pills, wit' the will I break
Broke nigga always tellin' ya how to make ya cash adjust
So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media 'cause they always mad at us
I don't see 'em tryin' to mediate, when we get gats and bust
They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape
It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff
I'm takin' back my money counter 'cause it wasn't fast enough, yep
I got a couple problems (word) and none of 'em is money
Just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to maneuver with the Ruger
To live like Freddy Krueger these nightmares just ain't as bloody
In meetings they always askin' what my passion is
(And the) money talks so I always have words to answer this (yep)
I can't relax 'cause it's like I'm a fetti activist
Might see me on TV never a mat-tress

Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep (Don't go to sleep nigga)
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep (Sleep baby)
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep

Young Buck,"Yeah, I'm back

They know me 'round here, they call me Iceman
I ain't your friend boy, I'll f*** your wife man
Look at my left, now look at my right hand
Every time I move it looks like a strike of lightning

My name is Banks, but you can call me Igloo
There's white rocks on my neck and my wrist's blue
So don't trip 'cause you know I got my pistol
You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

Yeah, Louie introduced me to jewelry, now I'm lovin' it
Tell Jacob the shinin's so good, them h*** love the s***
Diamond after diamond and I climbed up out the bottom
So holla if it's a problem, I got 'em just like you got 'em

I'm stylin', they grillin' 'cause my whip can buy a skyscraper
Roll down the windows stick my hand out, ""Hi hater""
I'm on my way to L.A., I'll see you guys later
You'll be here when I get back, ain't got no time to drink that

Now all I do is sit back, hop on the plane and sip 'gnac
Hop in the Range and whip that, came in the game with this crap
You say my name you get smacked, right on your brain with the gat
Know who you playin' with Black, then holla back

They know me 'round here, they call me Iceman
I ain't your friend boy, I'll f*** your wife man

You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

My name is Buck but you can call me Icey
I keep spillin' Cristal on my white T
Don't give a f***, b**** you ain't gotta like me
I pop my trunk and have you runnin' in your Nike's

Look what I just bought, this white mink I got it in New York
And this bright link I put it on and walk right out the store
Where's my car keys? What am I gon' drive?
My Phantom got the steering wheel on the wrong side

Pocket full of cash, Ferrari with the drive-out tags
Them h*** followin' us, let me stop and get some gas
Liberace, the cops watch me
I'm ice skatin' like a n**** playin' hockey, holla back

They know me 'round here, they call me Iceman
I ain't your friend boy, I'll f*** your wife man

My name is Banks, but you can call me Igloo
There's white rocks on my neck and my wrist's blue
So don't trip 'cause you know I got my pistol
You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

Canary yellow princess cut, rocks when I smile
Fat boy kept it gritty since I was a chubby child
Look at me now, hat cocked up, wristwatch rocked up
When I put my hand up to my mouth and hit that sticky stuff

The light, hit the ice, on my eight-ways piece
In the streets, I'm a G, on the mic, I'm a beast
Keep a b**** on her knees, n**** please, I'm a pimp
Purge first, ask last, I'm a shark, you a shrimp

Check a deuce, Chevrolet, rims taller than my son
Gun, on the seat with a extra clip 'cause I ain't fin' to run
In my brand new, shell toe, three stripe, all white
In other words, come my way with that s*** you gon' lose your life

They know me 'round here, they call me Iceman
I ain't your friend boy, I'll f*** your wife man

So don't trip 'cause you know I got my pistol
You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

What the f*** are they yellin'?
Dope man, anybody killa in the hood, f*** the homeboy sellin'
I've got a problem with him, if I can't touch it
Then he can't slang it and these streets get dangerous

Corny n****z pull up in cargo vans
Palms sweaty, icky's out with they masks all mad
I gave 'em the order and that's all bad
Born into flossin' flashin' got his mark-a**, smashed

The Iceman is in the buildin' chillin', big game huntin'
And this lame's, stuntin', got an addiction
That's deeper than a prescription, he's sleepin'
I'm on a mission to beat him in my position, it's f***ed

What you mad for?
I don't know too many that go to sleep in Chanel and wake up in Fendi
You know what it was before you hopped inside my Bentley
And everything was good as long as I kept spending
But I'm gonna keep it hood, see you I can do without it
You wonder why we call you bitch, think about it
Go holler at your man, maybe he can support ya
Love don't live here , I ain't got nothin' for ya

First things first girl stick that attitude in your purse
Straighten up your face before I pull over
Ain't nothing cute about walkin' home from work
Check yourself
Now number two

So you can sit and pout until your face turn blue
I will kill a brick and drown a drop of water about you

It's like fallin' off and getting back on again
But no poppin' wheelies til we got our balance
I can't handle this

What up with all these allegations
Shorty all is well
Accusations about my situation, callin' my cell
Take a step back, relax, chill, pause exhale
You're the reason I ain't got no bars on my cell
You must think I'm in this booth spittin' these bars for my health
For every action there's a reaction , cause and effect

You're just my type, you're what I like
I bring that heat, you heard me right
Everywhere I go, go, let's go!

Something new, it's another episode
Music bumping, sweat dripping on the danceflo'
I like it when shorty get to backing it back
When she do it like that, I don't know how to act

Now work it, go ahead grind it on me, that's perfect
I'll pay to play if it's worth it
My phone when you want me you can chirp it
Now get to work it

Let me take these bricks and break 'em down
If you want I can serve 'em by the pound
Shorty know she's got what I wanna flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it

Well, if you want it let's go
I got that fire (So hot I burn it down)
Act like you already know
I got that fire ('Cause I'm the flyest chick around)
You want it, it's fire, I got it, that fire
So I might ignite ya, it's fire, it's fire

I burn it down on stage, I make it hot
'Til the Fire Marshalls come shut down the spot
I have the club jam packed every time I rock
These other niggas ain't got the style I got
I go back to the basics and break it all the way all the way down
You can hate it but face it B.I.G. and 2Pac just ain't around
Everywhere you go, there I go, I'm 50 Cent
Ghetto star by the bar I get you bent
You wanna party, let's party, you wanna freak be a freak
You wanna creep, we can creep tell me where should we meet so you can

take these bricks and break 'em down

I have the ice on, stuntin' heavy

Sold over 30 million records already
It's the third time around, you know how I get down
I'm hands down, pound for pound, the best around

Young Buck,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
It's gettin' crazy after dark

Now picture me scared of the penetentiary
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me
I'm stackin' G's buyin' all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low
Although I'm young I'm still comin up
I'm gettin' paid pullin' razors on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull the strap when there's drama
Buster you ain't heard?
I been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me

I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone
I'm gettin' used to the needles on the bathroom sink
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think
So look like I'mma be the man of the house
Gotta have somethin' to put in the air when it's out
Up early in the mornin' the first to get it
They say if you really want it then come on with it
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars
And I only spent 30 days behind bars
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid
I handled any beef that they sent my way
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change
It's thug in my veins

It ain't my fault I came up fast
And your the name niggas bring up last
And all the dames get a king up ass
10 grand on every ring I flash
Deep frog--and I'mma have to fling your ass
I'm on the block where it's scorchin' hot
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block
I get 'dro by the pickle jar
These broke niggas wanna get the star
So I don't keep the four-nickel far
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin' her brain

Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain

Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South
To reach the sky, how far would a star go
To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out
I got a custom made gun so the cops link my shot
So far.. how many mother fuckers do you think I got?

Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires

Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

Certain niggaz fall in love with a bitch
Patron in my dick, I fuck the blood out a chick
I'm in the club frontin?, I'm in the club stuntin'
Ten grand buy the bar, Ma, it ain't nothing

If homegirl wit it, I'ma get it, hit it, split it
She'll think about me every day, hour, minute
Second to nobody, baby, check it
You look as good as a check

And when you're naked, I'm ready to fuck, a little head in the truck
If her tongue getting good, I'ma let her come up
And when the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town
Stash box down with the mack in the pound

When we leave this club, I'ma take you where I live

Do me before I get up
I might eat out tonight depending on how I feel

She do whatever I say and I ain't gotta make it rain money

Go get it then she ghetto with it
Told shawty, don't do it, but she already did it

I never liked these niggaz anyway
They could drop dead, fall off a buildin? today
Hey, nobody gon' miss you anyway
No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day

I got the burner burner, I come to burn and burn ya
Revolver turn ya, call it murder murder
I ain't smilin? I ain't smirkin?, I ain't muh'fuckin? jokin?
See if you think somethin? sweet when your head open

Cross me, force me, go 'head, line me up
I found where you rest at, you grimy fuck
I be out front your raggedy ass crib on a stake out
With a pound, two clips and Chinese take-out

You make it rain, I make it lead shower
You say your prayers, you in your last hour
I have you pushin? up daisies, the coke dump crazy
You chumps amaze me, the wolves they raised me
You don't like me then spray me

This is that face down on the floor, ski mask shit
If I fall off I rebound quick
Like Greg Odin, Tony Yay' I be holdin?
German mouths on my hip ?cause my wrist be frozen

How these rappers claim blood and the books is closed?
How these rappers claim cars and they gun don't smoke?
I catch a nigga on his deathbed
And rip the IV out his arm then jump in the Optimus Prime

Dust the yellow Enzo with the Dalvins on
In my bulletproof Ac', who you stylin? on
When the sun is gone, and the wolves come out
You coward ass niggaz bring your jewelry out

You may have to bring that, ain't nobody trippin?
Shit, niggaz is hungry, I ain't nobody chicken
I think a screw is missin?, I'm pimpin?, I'm livin?
Nice with the dice, deuce-deuce six'n

Look how the game change, bad for the system
Niggaz on game shows, two dudes kissin?
Listen, we're not the same, we're not for fame
The industry's punked out, we're not to blame

These niggaz been perpetratin? so long
If they can make it rain, I can make it storm
He's makin? a scene but I can make him calm
I just got a N.B. that'll break a arm

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining 
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by a light, a star so sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from Orient land
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friends

I know it's hard in every hood I know
Struggle in every ghetto I know
But not like the one I know
I see the law in every hood I go
They throw metal in every hood I know
But not like the one I know

[Oschino]
We all started innocent
Eating Reese's Pieces
I was young, then wearing 5 star Aleses
Bullet in ya gut a have a bag catch ya feces

20 months, vision quest, sleeping in a tepee
Since my dad died, attitude worsened
That's why I stole cars before I could write cursive
Thousand miles from being rich, stuck on my grind

Try to sale nickel bags like Louie Baton
I'm young, I'm good, best shape of my life
One shot from big shit a blow you out of ya Nikes
Only a dick head wouldn't want to be rich

And do his car like school and drop out in the 6
You could look at my wrist, It wasn't shit on it
But I was determined to get a little gliss on em
The 40 ounce bottles done turned to Cris on em
And every bitch that was fronting, I'ma piss on em

[Beanie Sigel]
My hood dog
Like any average one
You know the dirty kids on the block having fun
Hand to hand is how the grams is slung

In tanned Timberlands and [unknown] until them vans a come
It's all good now
But you remember those latter days
Them tubleware, soul food platter days

That was ya mom little hustle on a Saturdays
Back then, when it really didn't matter days
You would take that beating
'Cause you wasn't trying to be

The only one who missed the house party on the weekend
Knowing that them project chicks was in there freaking
Grinding off ""As We Lay""
Walk with me why'all

Back in the Day, you and ya man slap tapping away
Pitching chains, playing craps everyday
Getting high on the block
Green bottles of private stock

2 dollar 40's
Sparks tell ya story

[Chorus]

[Sparks]
I come up fragile and timid
Pressed to the limit
12 years old, no household
From the start I was finished

Disowned by the biologicals
And adopted by rolling stones on corners, sipping Thunderbird
Banging needles and pushing stolen Regals
And with no hoe and no money, layered my hunger pains daily with rice and gravy

Stuck between a rock and a hard spot as a juvenile
Just made me want to holla ""Lord help me""
But I had will power
Stole a burner from Uncle Lester

And that .22 long blossomed to wild flower
Now when I enter rooms the conversation stop
And them cock suckers whisper
These faggots ain't got no cahunas

So if they so much as touch me
I cock back and put like bananas on them mokey motherfuckers
Show no love for these cock suckers
Weeping

Who can't deal with life situations cause that's money to me
Uhh
Murder

[Freeway]
Now who am I
Little nigga named Free from the hood
What I do
Make a living, make a killing in the hood

What I'm trying to do now
Get my children out the hood
Before the ATF start coming
Plot, plot on

Now who am I
Little nigga named Free from the block
What I do
Make a living , make a killing on the block

What I'm trying to do now
Get my children off the block
And my real niggas, if they coming, clique come on
In my hood, F-are-double uh

Cock back, double pump
You rapping, I just happen to have some space in the trunk
89' dough, space in the front
Will ya hoe fit?

Beef come, we be dumping the whole clip
Having lunch, while you be fronting, be fucking ya hoe sick
Send her home, can't hump
Send my nigga's through ya block, can't pump

Grind, watch for the cops
Shit tucked
I'll be watching them lady CO's if I slip up
Uh Uh

[Chorus: x 2]

[Chris and Sigel talking]
Yo, I'm saying Mac, I know I'm young and all
(Yeah that's what's up?)
But I been through a little struggle too
(What you been through?)
Lot of crazy shit dog, ya know?
(Shit Don't tell me, you got opportunity to tell the world)
Feel this dog
(Speak ya story, Yung Gun)

[Chris]
Yo I was brought up in the wildest streets
Where niggas pack everyday, and everybody crowd to eat
24/7, no time to sleep
A g and up, reign up, 3 times a week

Throwing numbers on the strip
The youngin' out the clique
Moves like Carl Lewis when it's coming out the clip
Uh, Still in school, all the learning I can get

Focused, trying to purchase all the burners I can get
I know plenty niggas fell, trying to chauffer through this shit
These niggas tell, then a murder gon exist
It's no joke in the hood

Especially when the boat ain't make it across
And we ain't got no coke in the hood
That's where rap come in at, more notes in a book
Dro in the woods, Mom dukes trying to lay low in the woods

Young Chris,"[Freeway] 
Do even asked me the reason...

[Freeway] 
Yeah I know,you hear freeway everywhere you go
Before rap you see freeway everywhere you at
You can bounce, he move yayo heavy with the crack
Now I'm in there like Prego with the ROC

Thick like labels with mack
Now I do doughnuts on the cops,keep cradles of stacks
And you now when you hot when niggas hate on ya' tracks
And you know when you shot when bullets come out ya' back

For words coming out your mouth watch the way you rat
'Cause I'm from the streets and you will hate the way I act
With a SK, Nine, or a Dillinger pick the heat
Mad cause' I lounge in a 8 Cylinder pick a beat

Fuck it up, holla at Julio get it checked
My squad do circles like Hula-hoops with ya' freaks
Send her home after giving us neck, you can't sleep
Wonder why ya' girlfriend not giving you sex
Same nigga you told can't stop hustlin' won't eat,uhhn!

[Chorus: x 2]
Tell me how we know,
This we lead will take us places that we don't want to go
Now I really want to change,but I'm chasing change
Trying to ease the pain, shelter for the rain
I don't want to hurt no more

[Omilio]
Yo, since a buck I been a knuckle-head
Half of the stuff you said, went in one and out the other ear
You break ya' neck for what I asked for
Pops wasn't around one of the reasons why I'm hustlin' now

One of the reasons why you strugglin' now,
Wit' three one your own, workin' the night shift and leavin' us home
It's cool mom, I just couldn't got to school mom
'Cause of rappin' cause' of that you 'bout to move mom

Boy make moves mom, soon mom, trying to get us away
From them nosey neighbors and the boys in blue mom,
But I remember them times, no food in the crib
Nobody taking timeout schoolin' the kids

In school with the kids they got they Timb's on
Buttered up, it wasn't right
I'm up in there my slim's on button up, it's alright
But they ain't never clown me, they see pain up in me
I had a little Sugar Shane up in me

[Chorus: x 2]

[Beanie Sigel]
Why that cat gotta be pushin' them Bently's
Back to back like that , cause' god meant me 
You little dirty punks ain't ready for the boy
Load four thiry chunks and eatin' seventy more

What makes you say that is it cause I'm laid back
Spinnin' through them wheels of fortune like Sajak
Pump your brakes scrap, I only spit it for ya'll
Niggas like my nigga Mark eatin' space packs

Ya'll niggas want R.I.P but I'm CEO
I remember I use to see CC
Cop, cook, and collect 
My nigga Kyle use to cook it the best

But for you crooked cops I got a 40 cal that'll cook up
Ya' chest, paralyzed my man, slimmed his legs and
Paralyzed his chance, I know Allah got plans 
But still I reminisce at night this can't be us this
Can't be right

[Chorus: x 2]

[Omilio]
It's funny me chasing change
Made my whole life change, got me a range
Slammed in the bing, freedom snatched away
Hug my momma from a K,

But mom is hurting no more

It always rains in the hood 
Heavy metals ring in the ghetto 
Everybody moves Cain in the hood (everybody move them things)
This for my niggas who stay in the ghetto (to my niggas stay in the ghetto)

It's lots of shine in the ghetto
Too many haters in the hood (too hard, niggas be hatin)
Gotta watch what you doin 
The ghetto only cop black shine in the hood (Freeway, Young Gunz)
This for my niggas who thug like shaked lights in the ghetto (Oschino)

Yo we gotta, hollow the gat, bottle the smack
When the cops pull up we gotta swallow the crack
All my niggas did time like Geronimo Prep
See the Benz like damn, what model is that
Oschino, the nigga who was locked in a cage
Niggas clockin my style like flavor flave
Fuck gettin the Source Award, or gettin Five Mics
I'm happy just gettin my daughter a pink bike
A roof over her head and some Barbie skates
It's plenty of nights man, I hardly ate
I'm from where the summers dangerous, the winters is cold
And bitches pop Van X's like birth control
I got bitches on death row, stuck with a cell number
So close to Jesus they got his cell number
The ghetto is trife, this is my life
How many rappers you know been down for murder twice?

Yo what up wit ch'all niggas
What it look like?
Throw it in the pot, see if the shit cook right
We can get it down, see if it bubble white or brown
Take it to the town and break my youngin's down
It's doin good, business is lookin fine
Get 'em for 20, but maybe 29
Youngin out on his grind, youngin poppin 'em nine's
I'm a juvenile delinquent, youngin was doin time
Cause Judge Reynold's left it up to my mom (what else?)
And I was thinkin like, damn ain't that crazy?
But mom duke's can't live without her baaaby
I'm back home, thrity eight strong, out on my own
Thinkin, get it wit chrome
Fuck makin them songs, but my mind right now
And this rap shit be my grind right now (now...now...)

You ever heard a nigga's lawyer scared to talk for him?
Creep in the dark on him, the led bark on him
I'm on his head til the Fed's spread chalk for him
That's how we do it dawg, these the last days
Yeah I had my bad days, I been through it ch'all
But I grew back (grew back)
Got my groove back (groove back)
That's how we do in trainin, cockin them two's back
Same dudes namin', givin up news
Gettin up on the stand, endin up on the news
It's fucked up what that pressure'll do
And you don't want to fuck up when they questionin you
Lecturin you, tryin to get shit up outta you
Crucial beatdowns til the bitch come up outta you

Put that dough and get your body viewed

Let me get five for twenty, or seven for thrity
That shit that you hear in the ghetto
They don't care in the hood
Cop four twenties and seven thirties
Then niggas disappear from the ghetto
Get snatched from the hood
Feds grab 'em, and some get put in the dirt
Some live in grime, good with the work
Stick up kids get hit with the nine
But the funeral parlor good with embalming fluid
Good with the hearst
Some niggas don't even grind
But still make a stack every other night, good with the dice
So it don't even matter, get hungry in the hood
Miss Low is sharp with the platters, good with the rice
And her daughter's just like her
Shootouts, they stash my guns, and I got away good with the knives
The end of the nights, stash my ones
Cause I'm good with the rocks, the smokers good with pipes

Whenever you feel that pressure
You let em know everyday of your life is, check it

For real we still killin' 'em and, each one of 'em

Proof I'm ballin', I put a eighth
Of that white down in my hood, I can finish it by the mornin'
Re-up by noon, re-kick at night
Half these dudes doing bids couldn't live my life

Cause every new gat I cop it begin wit a P
Like, P-89 you niggas' P-92 shit

Hoes get at 'em when they see a nigga ballin'
Keep the steel wit me, couple of killas from the hood
Who blew bail, but still they keep it real wit me
We ride out (and?) we find out (where?)
Your little address (and?) blow out your hideout (yeah)
Who want war? hoes they tellin' me ""E's you ain't right""
Like this year I'm goin' go South Pole
This for them haters think I'm slippin', I ain't
When I find 'em hiding I tie 'em, they be missin' like weight
But wait, lil nigga don't be missin' my point
I don't miss when I point, niggas get killed off point
And you see, I school a little you, forfeit the game
I was young, just like 'em, Jay taught me the same
But I see he hard headed, told em stay in his lane

The alias you've been living under the mack goes thrriiing
Peddi, Peddi, I heard that they watch your mother

Got a hit on your brother, like motherfucker don't - blliinng
Crack, smack a tooth out your choppers
Any wrong move, I blast the tool up on you fuckers
Wait, that's just enough for you to follow

Heavyweight rap, I spit for much for you to swallow 
Blap, Blap, number one with a bullet
Play with them guns to the fullest
Your stupid ass get, clapped, bap

About my past and my future, you disrespect it, I'll shoot you
Treat it just like that...

All of the sudden and there's six million ways to rhyme
There's still six million ways to D-I-E
I'll smack your P-why-T, with the bun and the nine, nigga
I live me rhymes, why'all ain't Free

But why'all know why'all heard of him
Niggaz can not serve him, not see him when he floatin' by, windows be dark tinted
Stop playing thinking you touch him, trouble you deep in it
Clock spitting, it's just the principle, my principality

Follow me home, better have a full tank, money for shoes
What you fools think, full bank money from shows
It's the Roc bitch, I'm on your block bitch
I'm in the cock-pit, you think it's a rose

So what if it's brown from Mac, gotta take it back, back
And gotta bobble the gat, push your shit back, back
Free, house the trap, push the release day back
Me and crack at it again, add it to wax

[Chorus]

[Young Chris]
It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name, Young Chris, or Young Gunner
Know my partner Young Neffi, we the youngest out the gang
Mami's spend a lot of meta, man I treat 'em all the same

Closest thing to my thang, is my thang, thang
Niggaz they act dumb act they think, thangs
Soon as the crackers come, they hit the bing, and sing
Niggaz on the street whisperin', Police District and

Tell them about the drops and when the Puerto Ricans did Shamear
The dough get 'em, about the flow switchin' em
Got the greatest listening, haters 4-5'n them
Blasin' not missin' 'em, LA missin' him

Muhammad thang got his momma thinking that it's cousin Chris and 'em
Though we in a better place, be here, he rather too
But our father, the number when he ready too
Do not bother the rumble, niggaz ready too, bang you in a second
Keep the banger for protection

[Chorus]

[Beanie Sigel]
It ain't a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name B. Siggy, Mac Milly, Mac Mittens
Broad Street Bully, Mac go fully, bitch
My whole squad sing chiti-bang, bang

Make the city gangbang, stay pop, chain GANG
Why'all ain't said a damn thang, with your thang thangs
Nigga, we can do the damn thang
The war ain't over 'til that fat bitch sang

Or the last bullet from my Mac blaang, mayne
My whole click goin' reign, the half a clip will melt ya
For shelter, don't get caught up in the drizzle
Hit you in the spittle, and then bring it back again

It ain't a thang to make your brains go hang, mayne
Got bitches on the thang, thang
Because they like the way the S.P. chain swings
City of Philly, you know that city brought your city the slang
My squad with me, and they ready to bang, bang

They tell me that temptation, oh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me, i tried to hide my feelings, d-o-gs
Ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to, but I don't even know what it is
You've got me singing in the morning, you bring me breakfast in my bed
And when it hurts you rub my head
Ill ask you one time only, baby, wont you be there when its hectic
When I don't have a hit record (never leave me alone)

Ive traveled so many places, I've seen so many faces
There were times I didn't think Id make it through (alone)
I went through so many phases, that got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gonna then what you gonna do
I guess Ill call my lady, and tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
Tell him his daddy's sorry, let him know all about me
There's one more thing Id really like for you to do

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
A'm mobbing through the county mainline
Back in 9500 just trying to handle mine
Spitting game at the homies about the good ol days
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga spanky too
Its true that the dirt I did from an o.g. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by
And real gs gon cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fucking niggas on the outside
But whats the chance it ain't cracking
If I was out and she was in Id probably be macking
I cant lie
So I say I would now my girl in a world of player hood
A player should show a nigga love and look our
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, OK
But if I don't I guess this is home
My girl is tripping she got a block on the phone

See if folk gonna test a nigga and bring the tools
Like the flutes and the two
See if that shit turn green or blue (green or blue)
Yo look here homie, this here pure coke with me
Get off me and go take the things
Guarantee get your fuckin' face freeze (your face freeze)
And so, then let me know, ya I know
You want to fuck wit me, you want to cop yo work for me
I know there's bucks involved, you don't touch the squad OK
You can bring just some your roadies
Leave two outside, bring two inside, just don't bring that bullshit
'cause we all gon time and get caught for this shit
I know your number, 'cause I once got caught for shit
In court for shit, like look Ian, I don't feel what I done was a crime
When I crossed your invisible line (when I crossed your invisible line)
When I crossed your border, with a thousand quarters
Ya'll niggaz do when they broke gotta test the waters (gotta test the waters)
You know you want to fuck wit me

[Chorus: Sparks]
That be	, that L, O, that W that BLOW
This coke here is purified, youngblood, want to cop yo work from me
That be	, that L, O, that W that BLOW

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
We talkin' bout that BLOW
That B.L.O.W. sniff it
Tryin' to tell you it's the shizzit
Guaranteed you get addicted
Lemme know, how you want it, pure white, or be pecific (specific)
I just came from the Pacific
My connect is jet-o-ffical
That's how we roll, keep it comin'
Long as Chris up in position, Imma keep this shit consistent
Never bitch up at the district
Let em know, Young Gunna is just a new nigga
Bout to blow straight to the tizzle
Never write straight, off the tizzle
With the flow, I get it from my big homie Sigel
But I got my own Eagles, if it's guaranteed to meet you
We can ???, but back to that B.L.O
Got some shit that I can teach you
Know if I cook up niggaz treat you weird
Got some people, might be interested to speak to
If your strips slow, you get your men, I get my people
When we get dough, give them niggaz fore warnin'
Lock down all four corners, watch that shit flow

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Twista]
I'm a nigga that'll never go a broke
Two of tens always help a motherfucker get back up
I can hook you up with whatever you want
Till' the city doubles fifty bricks and brothas get smacked up
Couple of hustle up real ass niggaz on the block, the hoes, you need some hard
Twista be servin' with the nigga Spark, and the rocks, blows, weed, cars
See us transform, double cocaine to a cherry 04 Range
Load the ki's in the sprees, and I'm gettin' P's
And I'm makin' G's, so I want to go in your bank
'cause you feelin' the feelin' of makin' a killin'
Of steady comin' up, Imma cop myself a whole BLOW feel
BLOW so trill, you can tell it was the real deal
Even if I hit a high with a pill
Tell me how you feel
Baby you was feelin' kinda froze
When you took a squirt up in the nose
Steady servin' O's, 'cause the fiends gotta get it
Even though they know it make they body decompose
Reafer in my clothes, and you know we cookin' up or shakin' up
So somebody close the door, watchin' for the law and gotta stay up on my toes
Makin' stacks, motherfucker, tell me what you know about that

[Chorus]
[Verse 4: Oschino]
See the dope move, see the coke move
See that nigga push ki's like a pro tool
Fuck a 9 to 5, I got 95 drones all in the back of the ride
And they pure like a virgin, I'm servin'
And I ain't talkin' bout Serena or Venus
I'm talkin' bout that shit
that have you doin' 50 years in a box beatin' your penis
See the car vette, see the house vette, see the young boy diggin' ya style
And you say you love that shit
They think we Shallow Hal no it's just Oschino baby (yea baby)
I'm dippin' the man, I'm dippin' the can
I'm the reason you can dip that straw in the grams
And get high, but you wouldn't understand (It's all about that BLOW)
I'm your BLOW supplier, the hoes admire
My whole attire, my rims and tires, niggaz wearin' wires
(Actin' like they want to do a deal with O)
Trains, planes, automobiles
Won't get that work across the state
Run till' they always getting' rid of the weight
Sweatin' under pressure while you talkin' to jakes
Sweatin' in the kitchen, while cookin' the cakes
Sweatin' in the mix, puttin' doe in a safe
You can sweat me right in front of my face
And there's nuttin' you can do about it

Criminal background, State Prop's back now
Lookin' for a squad like ours, picture that clown
Difference in them verses what we talk we live it too
They just beats and hooks far from lyrical
Just a lil' piece of mind I thought I'd share with you
They don't really care for you
Be a lil' careful, you
Might think you sharin' ya shit
And the weirdest shit
Then next time you hear his shit
You hearin' you
That just let's me know I'm gift with the lyrics too
While I don't take it personal
Reverse em' when they share with you
Keep her near you, unless you sharin'
'cause I party mines
Sippin' on my name while you lames drinks Bacardi lime
I'm takin' brains for the game when it's party time
Thinkin' you here to hang with the gang?
Well I'm sorry ma
Go ahead ma, keep ya ol' man Chris
Not Ronnie, ain't no old man shit
Plus you know this

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Criminals grindin', you hear us rhymin'
But at the same time nines is in alignment
State Prop, a problem try to hide ya diamonds
As if Peedi and them Youngins won't find em
As if B. Sig and Freeweez ain't behind em
Omilio Sparks and Oschin, perfect timin'
We criminal background, we back now
So lemme see ya motherfuckin' diamonds, diamonds..

[Verse 2: Peedi Crakk]
Now...
Know Crakk pick up on em bitches like Chevys
Got my Avalanche tinted, know who in it P and Lezzy (P and Lezzy)
Blowin',???? then he passed it to Haniffy
Tell me Crakk is off his grindin'
I'm in the heaviest weight class ho
C.R.E.A.M's say blast
Got a camera in my bathroom lookin' at ya ass
Know my whirl-a-frame playin' too bout to break fast
Get a half, while my nigga Tommy Buttas do the math (do the math)
It's like a capsule, you can see it from the past
From the way they call me Crakk, from upstate I'm countin' cash
From Montgomery's ass
I might blast you, look at my lap, I'm in the cash rule
The girls feel so good, but the brain is not ready, I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman, 'cause their mind is so steady, now here we go

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Young Chris]
I undastand that the ROC a crowded family
But I gotta lotta family
And I'm one of the hottest
I know the fans runnin' to cop us
Will need that jam that have Def Jam want em to drop us
Can't none of them stop us, one in the top plus
Ya don't really live it ya'll runnin' the blockbust
They get it from the flicks (watchin' too many movies)
Now watch them cameras
If they don't get it from a snitch, they get it from the flicks
I limit on these chicks, and kinda when I get head
Ever since they told me you could get it from the lips
I never hadda pops, I can get it from some shit
Used to get it on the strip, or they get it from the clips

Known to dish tha raw, dish tha law if they come up,
And cheddar 'till tha sun up
If there's a ransom and tha law get involved, then we never get it summed up,
Never put ya gun up, if ya come round me,
I go to war wit' niggas 'round tha corner from 'round me,
You can front 'round me, but I read through that,
Wit' tha mili' and I ain't talkin' 'bout no Segal mac,
Niggas see shoot back, we can see to that,
Hit yo front letters see through back, bring yo peoples back,

I find ways to say-it, so you motherfuckers hear-it,
And when you hear it you feel it, you know its real (so)
This is how I live it, how its pictured for real, (nigga)
I'm shittin' for real
Diamonds against wood, underground king for real,
Big crib when I lay, yeah I'm livin' for real,
Trust me tha guns come off tha shelf whenever shit'll get real,
Automatics and tha extended clips, that's what I'm hittin' wit',
Dummies in tha black rhinoes,

Mask up kidnap shit, that's how my niggas get,

Still accomplished, want to fill they cups?
Tha rap version of Mandela call my bluff,
Well still tha street dwellers feel my pain (My pain)
I spit a verse and split a clip in tha rain,
A fool-proof when tha full force open you (What)

Twista will rock you, you don't want tha thug apostle to pop you,
Hostile when I drop you, turnin' everything colossal to fossiles,
I speak street gospel, all they life I spit words and paint portraits,
For real niggas that hold down they fortress and serve off of porches,
Hit 'em in tha body wit' tha powerful forces, that'll end all your data,
Make you clean up your house, bag up an ounce, hit tha dance floor and bounce,

Watch me spit if for tha killers and hustler's, flippin' all tha pounds and bricks,

You can't feed a nigga Peanut Chews
Now put ya feet up in a nigga' shoes
A lack of green'll give a nigga blues
A sip of purple make a nigga rue
Make a drunk person speak a sober tune (I can't go on this way)
Fuck dat, I can't do it man
We make these tips off this gift that we cursed wit
But then my mind drift, am I defeatin' the purpose?
'Cause you feel like shit when you miss your son's first shit
But who gon' pay the bills? Supply the meals? No surplus
My baby mama give me drama on the daily
Like she making it barely and my kids is eating rarely (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out goin' through it I can't do it
If you put puppies in the oven, do that make 'em biscuits?
Put hungry dogs in the kitchen, will they eat the kittens?
Do you hear me, are you listening? It's a big difference
Do you catch the lines or the hooks or are you still fishin'?
These a couple questions that I need to be answered
Like is these Backwoods and weed givin' me cancer (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out goin' through it I can't do it
My momma say I got a nerve stress
Got her waking up in cold sweats
I'm hard-headed and iron
What make it worse my lil brother behind me
Blood pressure running like Harriet
She can't handle it
I got her screaming Lord Jesus like Mahalia
Son I'm tellin' ya please don't let me bury ya (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed man, I'm goin' through it
I was taught trust in the Lord but still tie up your camel
Use your tongue as your sword and your books as your ammo
But when them bullets start flying and you got pussies around you
And who you rely on, got them niggas surround you? Shit
And make me feel like young Tinner, from the start I was finished
How a nigga start wit a finish and begin wit a endin' (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out, I can't take it no more
I'm moving ass backwards with no forward progress
Feel asthmatic like treadmill keep jogging
Stagnant, running in place is tragic
My heart in the faith I don't practice
I still pray Allah, forgive me for my actions
'Cause I spit gangsta, think Muslim, and act Kaffir (I can't go on this way)
I gotta still feel feed my youngin's, so keep huggin

I can't wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Stuck in one time, Free patrol the block
Get avoided by the government avoid the spot
Can't wait 'til rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Stuck in the box (I can't go on this way)

Straight from the ghetto
The ghetto I'm from the youngest be the ghettoest ones

Tryna make it but they gon make it hard as much as they could

Them crackers ain't nothing without paper
They look at us it's nothing and uh (I can't go on this way)
Came too far and I ain't going backwardds for nothing
I ain't being distracted by nothing
Midget-size to Dikembe, I ain't backed up from nothing
Ma I'm still stressing
It ain't the kid it's the bills stressing, she hold it down on her own
She hold me down at the crib, hold me down while I'm gone
She held me down as a kid, hold me down while I'm grown (I can't go on this way)
I choose not, refuse not, down on my own
Now off the streets, runnin' wit the hottest label in the industry
The hottest label got a nigga lot of enemies
So now when I go in baseline
A nice-size ratchet to throw in wasteline
I gotta make mine
My bills ain't getting paid in, kids ain't situated (I can't go on this way)
Y'all better make a decision before us
'Cause the way that we living ain't all good
Ran away wit them hating ass niggas don't like us
Despite them, we gon' do it regardless
But all this commotion they causing, I ain't with it
(We ain't with it)
They can get it all it take is a call 'em

You know you make me cry
How can you love me?
I can't understand why

That's what they yellin' when they grab me
Eyes are swellin', cryin', tryin' to stab me
Once they realize they can't have me
When I leave 'em try to let 'em down easy like
I snatch your heart so easy like Valentine
Can't get caught up in that loop again
Never letting Cupid in
Boo you buggin' ain't no time to be lovin'
Man the grip on my pistol only thing I be huggin'
It's mack daddy not your daddy mack
Bitch you got it criss-crossed (scrap)
I ain't havin' that
I can't have your back
Look how you act when I had your back
Picture me havin' that back to back
I pimp proper like shrimp-lobster
Check out my pimp-posture
Even my limp proper, mama
I can't help what's runnin' down your face
I moved your ass into that furnished place
Like you earned that space

[Beanie Sigel]
God damn baby you had me
All the twirlies in the caddy used to take it back gladly
We was tighter than Tommy Buns and Keesha
You cleaned my guns, count my ones, bagged the reefer
Shit I thought you was the one, you was my bitch
The one that never snitched
Taught you how to bust a fifth, shit
I taught you how to push a whip
Taught you how to suck a dick
Taught you how to fluff a brick
But you got more drama than a be, mama
Got me goin through the motions like C. Thomas
With the bullshit, he say she say
The bitch is mad cause my jams kick like Eastbay
Mad cause they mans got they kicks on replay
How you drop from celebrity status
Pushin' Bent to niggas in celebrity wagons
In them sucker type Jags
Now you fuckin' type mad

[Young Chris]
Oh mommy its so sad
We had it together
You had it whenever
That's yo bad
You fucked up
It wasn't meant to be
You lucked up
Told me at the end don't trust her
See that's when all the bullshit started
That's what three me in reverse, counter-clockwise
In my mind I swore that we would work
But I guess that I was wrong
Ran into a dead end
Unfaithful bitch
You fucked the nigga I was blazin' with
Fugazied shit
It wasn't him it was the paper shit
Nowadays its all about the latest shit
That or they favorite...car
Or get paper from ball
Unless your label all that
And you labeled as stars
Makin' the millions
Got them bitches willin' to do
Whatever it takes
Takin' it off or willin' to screw
Whoever I bring
Guess it's a celebrity thing
But I was never ashamed
I was blessed with the game

Yesterday It Seemed to just wander on till it found me,

Then why don't you just prove it.
How? You don't know how to prove it?,
Well, what you just do is

Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop (Oh)
Stop, hatin' on a nigga
That is a weak emotion
The lady of a nigga
And you could get tipped
Like ya waitin' on a nigga, and
Put a body bag and an apron on tha nigga

I give my all behind the mic,
But you could never see, if you sit behind the light
You don't have to pick me, to win the title fight
But I'm gone wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is no light
I'm tryna be polite, but you niggas in my hair like the nigga on lice

These other rappers bark,
Some of em' even bite
But I'm much more bright
I give the game sight

Sorry there's a tub in the boot, now where the drugs at?
Like the string of the shoe
No niggas want that
I'm twisted like the string on a boot, where New Orleans at?
I build hip hop solely like a bus pass
So in your possession, I must ask

Hey, haven't I been good to you? (Think it over)
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem,
I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the meat under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I graduated from hungry,
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm gone need g's if I'm bakin' the zeedy
You niggas want beef?
I want a steak and uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where we be
Hard body nigga, takin' it easy
All about my paper, bout my paper like Eazy
Why do rappers, lot of rappers, lot of fans, lot of rappers, lot of rappers

I'm just a product of the block

The ghetto cold, the block hot
Niggas talking, nosy neighbors and everything
But a coffin, the hood filled with dope fiends and street walkers
Babies crying, hop signs, dogs barking
Crime scene, yellow tape, the street chalking
Bloody sheet cover the face of the departed
The blood drop and then she hardens
Cops celebrate the ? gun, this often
Young bitch 14 6 months pregnant
Sell her body on the corner, smoke weed on a regular
Get a pimp off her money, dope man he was? 
Last week raped twice forced abortions
It's the life that I'm living ghetto that I'm lost in
And I'mma be here till they put me in the coffin
Feeling like pac live and die in Phillie
And I'm riding till these niggas come and kill me

Where I'm from it's dangerous
It's dangerous, every day, every day
Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block
Where I'm from it's dangerous
It's dangerous, every day, every day
Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block

My crystal popping on politicians and scooping watching
Pop a ? on who you blaming on cops lock them
A jail cell can't rehabilitate a nigga
They raise your bell and give a crack dealer life sentence
Turn around and give a pedal to the floor till you fall
That's why a prison door, over a revolving door
3 hots and a ? it's all we got, ? for Big and Pac

Who ever knew when that child was born
He'd be Barack
44th president to be black, you gotta deal with that
Confess that I heard were crack, we gotta deal with that
Wonder why we put in the bags and throw still with that
See a phantom like beans I kill for that
Hood nigga going rich, now I got a mill for that
Law suit she's bringing, swear I've been through
With paying nigga in full, it's getting shot through his fuel
Known thug, since my brother got killed in cold blood
So would I avenge his death, so would I sell drugs
Promised to be a real nigga to the death of me
Bury my casket to the block with the rest of me
And let my headstone really was a father
Any nigga that thought he went hard, I went harder
So state out my bidness and off my mind
I take a shot to the downfall, I'm on my grind

Where I'm from it's dangerous
It's dangerous, every day, every day
Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block
Where I'm from it's dangerous
It's dangerous, every day, every day
Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block",Dangerous,2012

Young De,"I used to carry a Glock on the waist line, man I don't waste time!
I'm strong on the bass line, you'll never taste mine!
See me on the screen, fuckers beggin' for face time
Get your own tape, but don't bother to chase mine!
I got a block! Man we havin' a great time
You couldn't fill the shoes, anytime that I lace mine,
Light up the stage for the homies we make shine
Sick the dogs on you, get more by the K-9!
Homies on the yard never walk in the main line
The manes find that they can never be in the game, I'm
Lettin' off rounds, hittin' blunts at the same time
Pick a crew homie, you a neon to save time!
Bitches like you always spittin' the same rhymes!
We put you all to shame, you never went through the same grind!
Put you in the bind the minute you came by
So stay in your lane and get wet by the rain!

You wanna step up, get your ass touched!
You wanna rap son, get your ass buff!
Try to test us, you's gon' get smashed up!
You wanna run with' the dogs? Get your cash up!

Get it? You gotta get your straps up!
Get it? You gotta get your sta-tion!
Get it? You gotta get amp-ed up!
You wanna run with the dogs? Get your cash up!

I'm right here on the block! When it's time to ride out,
You know what I'm all about runnin' Harley bikes on site, when it goes down!
Me and my homies always holdin' the fort down
Come up in our town and your pissin' a 4th pound!
Got 4 ounces and 3 bottle's of Jack
2 fifth's in the back and everyone I'm with's strapped!
What ever happens, I'm chin checkin' and wreckin' fools
Try disrespecting, my Smith and Wesson is endin' you!
And I ain't changed since back in the day (back in the day!)
Get your shit split quick if you get in my face! (get in my face!)
You wanna run with' the dog, better stay in your place! (stay in your playce!)
Cause your little ass name don't hold no weight! (hold no weight!)
And your little ass safe couldn't hold my cake! (hold my cake!)
Get your asks denied down the road I take! (road I take!)
And let me tell you one more thing befo' I skate! (befo' I skate!)
If you a fake or a snake, I'm a send you to your grave!

Act up, act up act
Act up, act up! Act
Act up, act up! Act
Act up and you bound to get hurt!

I'm a First Staff O-G from outta the gutter
With a fucked up demeanor for you punk mothafuckas!
Get played like some dicks who try to start ruckas
I'm a real gun busta, so don't ever try to rush us!
Can't nobody touch us! That don't leave on crutches
Or worse! Get a ride in a hurse with their bodies covered!
It's gon' be a cold summer! Soon as the Hill drops
All bullshit will stop!

A couple scums in the street, so we don't care what you bustas think
Might sink in sometime, but I won't blink!
We go against everything! Smoke all the green!
Got the low wrong, swing it ain't nothing to me!
We put it down anywhere, like it's something to see
So all you bitches goin rogue with your haters degree!
And when you wanna get loud son I'm ready to work!
Punks act up and you bound to get hurt!",It Ain't Nothin,2010
Young Devi D,"Started with the blow and went to flows
Listen to me tell my gutter story and it goes

When I was nineteen
I went to go live with my auntie and noticed she had nice things
The furniture and
All of her clothes quite clean
To never be working a 9 to 5, she ran a ice cream, team
She put me on
And my with it Simon?
Stay remarkably grown
That's why my pockets be long
Ducked some feds, dumped packs then got custom threads
From serving boofas in KC we say let's buss some heads, nigga
In French village, I went till they got the rent building
Got so heavy I no longer benched skrilla was a cinched deal I had to Vince neil it
Yelling in microphone and write them songs they like it's on
I let go they life worth of pipe is blown to flowing ignite my home I used to
Buss serves
Now I, buss words

Pull up, I'm bussin' serves

Prolly find me somewhere rhyming man this flow's absurd
Or maybe find me on my grinding where the pot is stirred
Either way I'm 'bout my pay I'm tryna stack up my dollars
Ripping the chowder, stomping the powder, dumping it louder, soldier for louder
Necked it to a vato
Jefe, head honcho
El Chapo with the hot flows
Still logged in with the block though
Hit a thang and make the knot grow
Push a nigga push it all bro
Pussy pills to that Pablo
In dark or night nigga I glow
Old nigga with the bag bro
Silly nigga with the mag though
Be careful what he bust his ass for
I'm airing out one of you assholes
Real shit, but the paper quit when the violence hit, nigga beep it bool
Shit bricks and quick licks turned meal ticks, nigga beep it bool

Had to show it to my homies, this right here my life mane
Hit a lick with 30, lost 20 at the dice game
Fuck it man it's nothing, I swear to god it's nothing

Humidity is rising, barometer's getting low
According to all sources, the street's the place to go
Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men.

It's raining men! Hallelujah! It's raining men! amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

God bless mother nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amennnn!

I feel stormy weather
Moving in about to begin
Hear the thunder
Don't you lose your head
Rip off the roof and stay in bed

God bless mother nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's raining men! Yeah!

I'm tired of hustlin
y'all motherfuckers think this is all a game
This shit ain't easy, this is all I know
What am I supposed to do now? huh?

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin you?
Do you know, you Can't Hustle Forever?

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin you?
Do you know, you Can't Hustle Forever?

It was you and me against the world
We switched the game up
Hustlin' forever together before we came up
It changed our paths we went our separate ways
No more ridin' on them niggaz for me, how I miss those days
Swore up and down you was a super thug, so it's told
But had compassion for your foes wit'cha heart of gold
While I was rappin' and singing you started slangin' and bangin'
But with money comes greed saw your heart it was changin'
Niggaz out on the street, your peeps gettin covered in sheets
You relied on heat to keep you from suffering defeat
And now you're different like these savages, you're soul golfed out
I know you're hurtin' everytime I see your soul from you
You at your crossroads, whatcho gonna do?
Where you going, boo?
Street is watchin' just to take your soul from you
Who will feed your seed if you're locked down, or better yet dead?
Did you live your life to the fullest when you take your last breath?
Do you know?

Do you know where you're goin' to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin' you?
Do you know, you Can't Hustle Forever?

Come follow me into my life, my life, my life
I'm a young hustla
This is to get paid as I stay clean away from bustas
Strugglin' is in my blood
Mentality thug, reality I'm fucked up
I gotta go get it my goddamn self, cause ain't nobody about to give me shit
Gotta go out and get the rent pay
So I'ma be out here on this block with these rocks and this glock
Until I profit could you stop it?
Mama used to say ""but until I see it better, it got to be this way""
And it don't look like I be going nowhere, nowhere
Looks like I'm stuck in this here ghetto
Even though I done got this dream of being famous
This is really short, and if I don't make it by the end of the year
Shit's feelin' to be changin' I'ma be dangerous, bangin' nigga's brain
Nigga, I'ma start sharin' my pain and bang
Hey, this shit we do for the dollar, dollar bill y'all
So, before I get killed y'all
I gotta make better ain't tryin hustle forever, ever

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin you?
Do you know, you Can't Hustle Forever?

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin you?
Do you know, you Can't Hustle Forever?

God, please I know you see me livin' better that this
But, truthfully it's hard for Dre to comprehend cause it's cheddar to get
If I don't hustle I can't eat
So in these streets it's you and me
Takin' these fair penitentiary chances
Plus some real finances that'll (?) me and my fam to better circumstances
Rider quote ""man even though I know I know how this game go""
Got the green light for cash and I can't let time pass
Gotta grabs mines reality's a mutha
Tryin' to hold on to all my survivin' thugs brothas
See, this life'll make you sharp and hard two clenched fists for the struggle
Ride for my thug nation that love to hustle hard
With slugs from berettas, doing dirty business
Some niggaz still can't get together collecting figgas
Make it impossible to hustle forever
But life's a struggle we gonna survive until something come along better

I got racks like Venus, wanna stack ?
Red like panini, eating steaks and zucchini
Wit' ya broad in Tahiti, big ass green bikini

Take this dope, hit a one on one
Ain't nothing else to do, she wanna cum for fun
I'm by myself, I brung no one

And sometimes seems that all I have is worry

I don't mean it

People, don't you know I'm only human?
Don't you know I have thoughts like any one?

My girlfriend
My girlfriend
Ay ay, ay check this out

I said I weren't gon' never hurt you
You said you ain't gon' never hurt me
But we lied

Little milf, how could I do this to myself?
I lied to her and plus I lied to myself
Nothing's left, the relationship done lost its breath
It stopped breathing, it died last season

I think about you leaving 'cause you a sexy little creature
You thought I was lying when I said I ain't do Alicia
And I don't wanna hear what Mika said and f*** Keisha
I betcha they'll f*** me, all you gotta do is leave us

Make you out a believer we some grown ass people
Dem trees get on my nerves, that's why I be smokin' *****
First we start arguing then I open up my ether
When I open up my ether, know it gets deeper

At first you start throwin' then you start bowin'
Runnin' round hollerin' tryin' guess 'bout who I'm goin' wit
You know who I'm goin' wit, I be there when you doin' it
I done hit the dang ol' lady till one in the morning

Man, it's been a long spin loving this woman
At first we was in love in the beginning, it was strong then
Now you talkin' 'bout you don't want me, well go on then
If we don't get along why we talkin' on the phone then?

First I walked out, now you want me to come home then
You said we would stay together, baby why am I alone then?

I said I weren't gon' never hurt you
You said you ain't gon' never hurt me
But we lied

Baby girl killing me, I'm reacting like Willie be
Beatin' on my chest, y'all boys ain't feeling me
Cards you dealing me, I'm like, ?Baby, what it is you givin' me??
We both got injuries, now we play religiously

Same girls hatin' on us, numbers they be slippin' me
You rippin' me, you temptin' me, you thought that you was clippin' me?
I knew you got those stacks when you took 'em, I knowed instantly
I left it out for you to go shoppin' to get some denimy

You actin' like a enemy, baby why is you hittin' me?
Girls tellin' lies to you, why aren't you defendin' me?
Now I'm finna cheat, now I'm finna creep
Now I'm finna have different women in my V

Why? She lied on me, why? Fly homie
Ain't working it out, I'm finna go and ride homie
Now I'm sleeping here, creeping here, 'bout to spend a week here
Guess who I'm messing around with, that girl Keisha, yeah

Man, it's been a long spin loving this woman
At first we was in love in the beginning, it was strong then
Now you talkin' 'bout you don't want me, well go on then
If we don't get along why we talkin' on the phone then?

First I walked out, now you want me to come home then
You said we would stay together, baby why am I alone then?

I said I weren't gon' never hurt you
You said you ain't gon' never hurt me
But we lied

Messin' round wit Keisha ain't no passion though our mansion gold
Rock, Rap, Classical, Benz color pistachio
They love me, I'm on MTV, game international
Me and Nick on 26 great grand national

I love her, I ain't sayin' that, I don't know who to share it with
I'm talkin' 'bout my girl, this who I be breakin' bread with
Dread filled, sellin' dro, she never let the Feds know
This house I'm in used to be full of love, but where it go?

The pain, I wanna let it go, I love you 'cause I said so
I cheated and regret it though, I let my cousin Tres know
Told me get a thousand roses and plus seven more
We would never hurt one other, that's what we said though

We lied, go on say it, fo, we miss each other extra though
But guess what I can't get out my head, guess what we said, fo?

I said I weren't gon' never hurt you
You said you ain't gon' never hurt me
But we lied

Man, it's been a long spin lovin' this woman
At first we was in love in the beginnin', it was strong then
Now you talkin' 'bout you don't want me, well go on then
If we don't get along why we talkin' on the phone then?

First I walked out, now you want me to come home then
You said we would stay together, baby why am I alone then?

Mink coat

Can't you see someone on me you don't like
And then lick it out
We don't need to look at a town
We rip em off
My wrist forty
Forget how much tip costs
Buy a hundred k I don't wanna play

Selling dope, it be junkies where my mama's day
Bad hoes get treated like runaways
Bitch you need to go home cool out and smoke a blunt today
Go and say how my cutlass look like egg yolk

Worth more than the visa she used to hide the money in the ceiling 
Having stacks on deck now that's a mighty good 
Feelin' fuck the days I'm gettin' paid by da hour 
Been in the wood to long for da shit to go sour 
When da feign come i'm a give em what da want 
The definition of customize now put that in yo trunk 
If I ain't got g's i'm a get it from the streets leavin'

84's click, clack it up and down towners
From west side to the east we keep the G and that's a promise
But yo plaque on summers Americas most wanted
We criminal backgrounds and ready to straiteflauted

Only take is a salt dropper or a instigator
Messy mothafuckas got the make it fo and a instant hater
I'ma lay it down like a baby ready to nap
'cause I'ma trill nigga ready to clap, now wats up

I slap a nigga scope him with a back hand left
And continue till nobody from yo whack clan left
Bet you might cheat left and you might cheat the dealer
But you neva cheat the king of the underground on the rella

But yo ass gonna learn and yo ass gonna see

Hey, tell 'em for a minute Bun, chill to yo nigga don
They say they got some blowin' I'm the one them niggaz get it from
They talkin' shit is best interest is to get a gun
Grab the mac 9 and spit half a clip and them niggaz run

Sissy niggaz, sweeter then a cinnabun
I want 'em knocked off, we the ones you gotta get it done
A lot of rappers say they G's I don't feel 'em no, naw
Yea, sissy so keys I'm still a don

OG's usual low key movin' in
03 don't look up at my window, you don't know me
Gangsta, gangsta the same time
Picture the pump and paint that I ain't the kind

You wanna see me that's why I say no thanks to none
AKs, are's man I can't decide
I got the mind of the hustler halacious grind
Man, I hold my city down like I anchor eyim

Face it

See me at the mall bustin' it down wit lil' shawty
I took her out to Cabo and shot that Balenciago
I showed her how them four tangles looks up in the Gallardo
Why tho
My girl she be makin' me feel right
I mess around wit shawty she be makin' me feel like
I can have somethin' so we bond and let it go
But after while you gon' have to go on and let it go

I understand why you wanna try
Make him stay home late at night
But if wanna go he'll be gone no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin' about mine and where he might be
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How ya love someone who didn't love me

But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at it's where he
Where he wanna be

If he ain't gonna love you

And all the other situations weighin' heavy on the brain

Play with me it's guaranteed, oh, I'm a lay ya down
Gotta watch my back across my tracks god know I know these clowns

God know I know
I feel like can't nobody f**k with me
God got my back so
Lil boosie keep his mind at ease
And god know I know
That somebody gon hate on me
But god know I'm thug so
You know lil' boosie go and get skeet

Now god know my situation, he know what I be facin'
He know I'm so impatient when it come to money makin'
From school, to the blocks, from the tool, to the rocks
For the lil' nigga with that glock ridin' around in somethin' hot
Now it's bout time we hit our knees and tell god truth
Can't stop the way we livin' just help us make it through
When I die take me through, up to heaven up with you
Gotta holla at my daddy and my nigga griles to
And god know
And god know I'm thug life, u fuckin' right
So if nigga play with me of the op I gotta get him right
And god got my back so, when I act wow
I'm comin' home safely through the back do
The murder rate is sky high, nigga holla ride or die
These youngin' sling that iron it ain't no mo takin' pride
So put yo fist up in yo pockets and them bullets in the chamber
Cause niggas slingin' iron like the lone ranger
Mayne it's murder murder kill kill on the corner where the marijuana followed by the bill
Some niggas cut by delja, some niggas cut by chill, 
some niggas eat them delpids and some niggas eat them pills
Gotta get it how I live in the south side
I'm thuggin' with my cow hide
I'm fresh when I come outside
You talk shit got hog tied
God know I know these niggas
Don't make me show these niggas
Pray for these niggas keep me away from these niggas
And I

God know all the killas
He done walked with all them niggas
He done talked with all them niggas
Before they went sparked them trigger
He ain't tear ya up in church, but god pretty eyes done covered up some dirt
Plus he kept a thug alert
For these bitch ass niggas, these haters these rapists
These niggas in the swamp swear to god they alligators
Me an my niggas paper chasers (shit) we ain't stuntin'
We do what we gotta do, to get that money
And god know my past
I'm itchin' to kill, gimme a reason I will
I'll end up grippin' a steal
And god know my temper
My temper like a bubble
You bust it you in trouble
Only god know, it's hard yo, I'll lay up in ya yard wow
I'll camouflage myself with my camouflage cargo
The street ain't promised to us niggas in that dirty south
That's why I'm ridin' with that nine I'm tryin' make it out
And it's hard to live, I'm a community where ain't no f**kin unity
They always say I'm dead they try to ruin me
So boosie be on other shit
Like jew-el-r-is and poppin' chris
And mac on u a model bitch
Had a hoe that swallow dick
Since 12 I saw alot of shit god know I know
Witness a man get straight sprayed right in front of the store
So I get a blunt and I roll it, hit the block actin' a donkey
Killin' my own people, servin' my own uncles

Bronson kept me wide open
And that's a fact
But I kno they gon hate tho
Cause I got blocks and raps and blocks of work so u can call me lego

Hey boy you know it when you see it
Them G's on deck
Them bitches at attention when the kings on set
Nigga come in with that flex and jump up out and get checked
It ain't no disrespectin' when the king on set
40 cal in a tech fuck around and get wet
You better hit the deck when the king on set
Hey hey we got them G's on deck
Hey and hit the deck when the king on set

Slap a slug on me mac 11 in the bubble coat
I'm chillin' with the homie what the fuck you startin' trouble fo'
Hey first you tried to tell em homie hatas ay what you lookin' fo'
Cause once we start to let em go yo ass they gon' be lookin' fo'
Don't know what he took us fo'
Never been a pussy so I don't know what they yellin' 
Screamin' fussin' cause he pushin' fo'
I ain't fen to talk let em walk like it's all good
Catch him slippin in the parkin lot and then it's all good
Got a couple blocks and a mask in the glove box
He come out the club and his ass get seen
Now I'm linked out the window with the beam on set
Made up my mind I'm a kill him when I see him no sweat
Make a bet I ain't gon put his monkey ass on a shelf
And I don't need nobody help cause I can do this shit myself
In a triple black Chevy ride low key step
I hope this nigga ready cause he gon see death

[Chorus]

Now these niggas better move when the G's comin' through
Never be afraid to shoot when you see them near you
All fellas in my crew ain't no tellin' in my crew
Choppa city grand hustle is what they yellin' in my crew
I'm a veteran in the crew livin' legend in the crew
I keep that desert eagle lethal weapon plus two
We goin' beef what it do
And you know that I'm a ride
We can do it right here or we can take it outside
Every day is homicide couple of bodies every night
We got half the population murder rate still rise
Ay bullets still fly write his name on the wall
I ain't even gotta do it I got goons on call
I'm a beast I'm a dog you a bitch you a fraud
I'm a ride I'm a G you a snitch you a fraud
If you want it you can get it hit him all up in his neck
And his head and his chest make sure that nigga wet deck

[Chorus]

Call me triple O-G pussy nigga gon' see
You come with that disrespect and you know what it gon' be
Call me triple O-G pussy nigga gon' see
You come in with that hatin you know what it gon' be

Before you try to make a move
Everybody bringin' a pistol
What you tryin' to prove
Do what you doin'
'cause you the one that's slipin' like a foo
And I guarantee that ? for doom
Until the Hollywood terror
You need the weapon 
That was packed up in the skeleton 
For way too many years
Whenever they comin' to kill all my niggas
And feel that all I want to do is make a few things clear
Well fuck' em, fuck 'em (fuck, fuck)
I hate it when I'm hated
Because I gotta be separated for the nation

And givin' it up for the town
To all the liquor drinkin' niggas in the hood
Tryin' to put the Valley on the map
And people tell me what I'm doin' is good
And keep it real like I should
Homies want to come and give me that
Heard of a couple of sacks
Back to back
To make a nigga wonder why
Then I take it to another level
Just tell me whatever you do
Stay on the mic
And better keep comin' tight
But I love to represent niggas
I know they hate that I'm hated
So now they want to try and put me to the test
But I shoot ?em to the left
Because I got positive people tellin' me
Droopy you are dealin' with the best
Now nigga what the fuck is next
Niggas got love for this shit
Like when and whenever dawg
A competition for Nike
Is supposed to be out to get riches
I'm the individual with the biggest balls
Run up with the hog, yippy y'all
Like my nigga from the mob
Told me, ""Little brother you gotta do the job""
Is gonna take someone like you
To give a sample like an example
With the Valley
Then they'll treat you like a God
The niggas that's bigga than life
The can't even up with the price
Put this shit I deliver bringin' to the table

Sometimes I feel a little mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When things go wrong, I seem a little sad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do
I don't mean it

People, don't you know I'm only human?
Don't you know I have thoughts like any one?
But sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little thing, some foolish thing

When the feds came, I didn't open up my mouth,
What you scared for?, niggaz know you've been a hoe,
It was like homie, shit was all good just a week ago,
Get the goons ready start up your vehicle,
And shoot at any fuckin' car you ain't seen before,
Pick up the shells, and we use an automatic,
They gave 50 years to my nigga lil' travis,
See I'm movin trap, and let um trip over the wires,
And then he'll be layin', right by the preacher and the choir,
Catch um before I do, T.I. go and handle your biz,
When you see me holler at me homie you know what it is ...

Got the kind so it's time to relax and unwind
I need to get my yak on
Once I get a rock on I'm gonna throw a sack on 
So it really doesn't matter if she's thinner, if she's fatter
Than a bus, all I'm gonna do is bust nuts up in her guts
Thrust, thrust just a little more till I hit the vibration
Down on my fours, finish up my nut
I make you come through, gee
Look at my pager, it'll say 553-0461
The Vogues got the hoes just waitin in line

Now it's the V-a-double l-e-j-o
We hope you know that with a hoe
Cause yo, the players don't roll like they don't do it
But no one's gonna know that every player's been through it
So buy you some and everything'll be cool
And just to be safe, yo man, you better wear two
Cause yeah, they thick and they all look good
But they hot as a fire and they burnin like wood
In the V-Town...

You see the times is tough and the streets is rough
But hey, nobody said that you was put here to play
So just be a mack like me (Jay Tee)
Get signed to Rated Z and get paid correctly
I make my money, then bounce
Jump in the train with a real cold 40 ounce
Before I sleep with sluts, playin nothin but old cuts
I'm feelin on big butts
I love life, no wife, I'm just straight up mackin
The big dollars I'm stackin
The plug is on every time that I pick up the mic
I do what I feel and I say what I like
I'm on top cause you know I've always been down

Your smell on me
I reached around the bed and grabbed a cigarette out of your bag
Sound of you breathing
Feel of your skin
Brought back some memories
I never thought this all could happen to me
Ten hours are missing from memory,
I vaguely can recall pain and pleasure mixing in one bowl
My mind is spinning
I know the bliss
Ten million miles away my flesh and bones are dreaming in a haze

Got the whole block jumping on fire

Addicted to mula, no favors
This feel like a hell of a day bro
I'm falling in love with that coco
Think she run in my veins and my whole soul
Got the whole block in a choke hold
Middle finger to the popo

Split in two a fault line cut right through me,
Between my heart and my feet,

I'm overboard,
And I can't swim,

Why I let you in,
You and me,
And the siren songs you sing,

I'm drifting lost within myself,

Begs me to stop,
Rest my limbs and go to sleep,
And as the waves crash down,
My ears ring with the sound,
The promise of the deep,

OR don't say anything,

Is a place to close my eyes,

Young Guns,"Out of time, out of place
Hate the people we've become
In the cold, we embraced
Tell me, where did we go wrong?
Should have known from the start
You'd leave me in the dark
Then I found a spark
So tonight I’ll start a fire

You're nothing like I ever knew
Somehow you can't see I’m bulletproof
So I took the long road
Went the distance to the bitter end
Can't you see I’m bulletproof?

I was blind to my fate
Walked the line and now I run
'Cause I see my mistake
Why did I let down my guard?
Should have known from the start
Like a shot right through my heart
I ignite the spark
Just to find out who you are
(Oh)

You're nothing like I ever knew
Somehow you can't see I’m bulletproof
So I took the long road
Went the distance to the bitter end
Can't you see I’m bulletproof?

Take it back
Take it back
You're goddamn right, I'm bitter
Now I’m under attack
You said my light got dimmer
I can't believe I ever loved you
You're goddamn right, I'm bitter
Sometimes we have to face things on our own

You're nothing like I ever knew
Somehow you can't see I’m bulletproof
So I took the long road
Went the distance to the bitter end
Can't you see I’m bulletproof?

So take your best shot
Is that the best you've got?
Is that the best you've got?

Criminal background, State Prop's back now
Lookin' for a squad like ours, picture that clown
Difference in them verses what we talk we live it too
They just beats and hooks far from lyrical
Just a lil' piece of mind I thought I'd share with you
They don't really care for you
Be a lil' careful, you
Might think you sharin' ya shit
And the weirdest shit
Then next time you hear his shit
You hearin' you
That just let's me know I'm gift with the lyrics too
While I don't take it personal
Reverse em' when they share with you
Keep her near you, unless you sharin'
'cause I party mines
Sippin' on my name while you lames drinks Bacardi lime
I'm takin' brains for the game when it's party time
Thinkin' you here to hang with the gang?
Well I'm sorry ma
Go ahead ma, keep ya ol' man Chris
Not Ronnie, ain't no old man shit

Got a camera in my bathroom lookin' at ya ass
Know my whirl-a-frame playin' too bout to break fast
Get a half, while my nigga Tommy Buttas do the math (do the math)
It's like a capsule, you can see it from the past
From the way they call me Crakk, from upstate I'm countin' cash
From Montgomery's ass
I might blast you, look at my lap, I'm in the cash rule
The girls feel so good, but the brain is not ready, I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman, 'cause their mind is so steady, now here we go

I undastand that the ROC a crowded family
But I gotta lotta family
And I'm one of the hottest
I know the fans runnin' to cop us
Will need that jam that have Def Jam want em to drop us
Can't none of them stop us, one in the top plus
Ya don't really live it ya'll runnin' the blockbust
They get it from the flicks (watchin' too many movies)
Now watch them cameras
If they don't get it from a snitch, they get it from the flicks
I limit on these chicks, and kinda when I get head
Ever since they told me you could get it from the lips
I never hadda pops, I can get it from some shit
Used to get it on the strip, or they get it from the clips

Now I'm wishing I could throw me back

Lose some then I lose again, when am I gonna win some?
I said a lot of things out of anger, but I meant some
I brought a lot of things to the table, besides income
I just want things to go back how they use to be
I was use to you, and I thought you were use to me
Time was against me
You never miss something 'till it's gone
That's my word ma, you convinced me
It might not happen, but I'm still hopin'
And my heart is broken, but the door is still open
Pillow still soakin', your boy still loakin'
Dutch still lit, and a bottle still open
And if I don't get another chance
It might be hard to get focused

Lights is gettin' dimmer
Nights gettin' colder
Lost three of my soldiers
Life feel like it's over
Unloadin' there's somethin' in my way
They'll never take me alive
I got somethin' on the way
I'ma survive I'ma try to do straight
Try to make it alive, be around for that due date
But it's hard, niggaz hatin' em hard
That loss hurt to the heart
But still they say it's they fault, we blame y'all
Nigga how, nigga please
It's still on baby
Tell them niggaz had they still off safety
What about them other fake dudes that he grew up wit
Elementary middle school up wit
Man them niggaz was there ain't move yet
I'm startin' to think they had somethin' to do wit it
I used to think them niggaz was scared
It's lookin' a little shaky now
Niggaz happy his little brother's laughin', his mother hate me now

This is the game we chose to play
Not everything in life is gold but it will be okay

And it will never change

Everyday we reminisce about that three day trip
Same night that we left, got a call you hit
Thought you was still wit us, aimed at me that he flipped
Got a call from my peaches found out where you was hit
Three hit himself who missed him and you just a couple inches
You don't know how much you miss him, bullshittin' in the kitchen
Ninety percent fist fights leadin' to them slammers
But lil' Drake ain't understand until one of them niggaz vanish
This rap shit is crazy but believe me I'ma try
Whether happened or not homie I got lil' five
And with the real ones I'ma slice my pies
As you would of wanted, man I'm so sick to my stomach
That you ain't around enjoyin' the fruits of our labors
Shit's about to get major, and these niggaz really hate us
Around for nothin' givin' me teeth and palms
Man I don't pay 'em no mind, just try to focus and rhyme ya know

I'm peaches that's where you can reach us
Cook out every other til' they took a nigga brother
Love ya like a brother so I try to take ya brother
And he be on some other shit, I be tryin' to tell 'em man
I seen how you feel
He had intentions on killin' my big brother
Just to let me see how he feel
Tellin' me his life over fuckin' cops
They know they after, run before they catch him he got people to kill
That boy crazy, he got people for real
He gone wind up layin' somewhere peaceful for real
Like he the only one goin' through the pain
Like his mom and our peaches ain't goin' through the same
Cool one minute, then he goin' through a change
I don't need that around, keep the heaters around
Just like the rest of the niggaz that I leave in the town
So I separate myself, I look better wit myself

We here to make sure these niggaz take heat and remember
That we 'bout it, 'bout it business, like P in the limit
Got some 'bout it, 'bout it bitches that fein for the nigga
Used to flee me for the niggaz now see all up in it
Hit it when I want to no matter how you treat 'em
How much you flee 'em you can get it when you want to

You don't have to eat 'em, just dick 'em down right
Never speak on another playa she don't like
Get a flagour for that, fuck you hatin' for
Dude just playin' his part, she datin' boy
Down at the club she just had to go
Young Gunnas from State P had a show

You show see them people shakin' and shakin'
And movin' and groovin' but Gunna was coolin'
Long as I had my tullin', the girlies was choosin
Everybody else actin' foolish
Over there actin' stupid
Come over here and we shootin'

If you at the bar buying drinks holla
Oh oh

Don't tell 'em nothing

They look here with them fake stares
We gone get the cuttin'
You know they frontin girlies up in the place
Plus they probably mad bitches up in out face
4-5th on the hip and them Buddhas a 8
These niggaz wanna trip

Then we give these niggaz a taste
Don't shoot at cars
And won't shoot from far
We chase 'em and lase 'em
For all the shit they talking plus hatin', fuck waitin'
We send a motherfuckers to Satan
Been takin' niggaz girlies for ages
She throwin' it from the back

I'm grindin' all on her hips
She talkin' that freak shit
How 'bout she a freak bitch, maybe a chewie quick
Never got to sleep 'cause you know them, chicks
Soon's you go to sleep they all up in your grip
Catch 'em in the act and they still deny it
Might 'cause a riot
I been cut the bitch off, she still on my dick

If you at the bar buying drinks holla

All the action through the traffic on our way to perform
If you knew like I knew, you would try to keep 'em home
Soon as we give 'em the song
You hit it before the mornin'
We don't love 'em, we just smut 'em
We hit it and then they gone

Plus she was all up in my business
Askin' 'bout my cases
Knew what I was charged with
And wanna know what I'm facin'
Heard I keep it on me daily wherever I go

Till these polies appahend me, till these pricks still to me I'm doing me

I'm running crazy through the city with the two and letting my thing
Quake on these noonies for even think that they can do me dirty
I'm nine cluching on the west side of Philly exchanging my war
Story with all of my little homies playing the MOB
Who just refuse to get a job so they back

And forth in and out of these correctional facilities
I'm getting phone calls from him every week, laughing
Talking 'bout how the whole block feeling me
And how when he coming home he ride for me
See that used to be me so I feel him I got love

[Intro] It's about time niggaz Oolah

[Verse 1]
Motherfuckers I'm from a town where it ain't nothing nice
Where niggaz they hear that price
And be at you the same night
Tryna kill you got a knife
Fuck a fight snatch your life
I got thirty in my wind pipe
And motherfuck I can fight
They say we different but I say we just alike
Each other crutches and these niggaz be our luggage
Heavy as shit unwilling to spit
No I like them baby rub them on a crib
And extend him on a glib
Probably knowing it's a fifth
Cause I bought a lot of hollow tips
This if you make a spliff
And we ain't on the same tip
Shit I got to bang at you niggaz
For the love of the figures
Hell yeah we kill each other
And kidnap them baby mothers
And do dirt to ones that love us
Yeah ones like no other
Sort of like your brother
And I got my niggaz covered
Long as I'm alive they alive
Promise I'm gon' ride
Never play both sides

[Chorus 2x]
Buck you keep back now
I bet you get clapped clown
And you gon' come back 'round
Once you hear how that Mac sound
I'm not bitching you back down
You know how to act now on your life
Niggaz I put the price
That's right

[Verse 2]
That's where we lived at
War bring it where your kids at
We throw enemies where ever you get at
Nigga you get back
Or get your motherfucking head cracked
Pat! Pat! That's where we lived at
At least a hundred thousand just to get your kids back
Unsolved about that kidnap all about that riff raff
When you wasn't with that
40 Cal's we so loud play the crowd you niggaz get back
In a cloud where you lay cause all that chit chat
I got a fifth man take it you a shit bag
Frontin on them ends
Niggaz put you in the pens
Staples all crazy you fuckers shouldn't play me
Multiple stab wounds
Caught him slippin shit and had goons
Up in the bath room now the Lord will see him soon
We get it all late at midnight or early afternoon
Whenever, wherever where that motherfucking chedder
Yup!

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3]
Nope definitely niggaz won't get that recipe
The flow stupid there much more then music
What you tryna get at homie I been through it
So don't be talking foolish
Cause your life you will lose it
Soon as I pull it start to thinking movement
And bullets start coming out the top
And motherfuckers start yelling down the block
Screaming out somebody got shot
And he left the shit a mess
Ambulance gets what's left
I'm a beast with the Tec
I won't let you get a breath
If you reach then you wet
From your feet to your neck
If you come around the set
You won't make it out to tell it
Pledge burning from the pullet
In your clothes you can smell it
No witnesses to tell it
You fucking with a two time felon
And feeling to put two to your melon
And open you up
Yeah you pussies starving and butt
Don't want none of Buck put your renters up
I don't give a fuck

Lost a lot of soldiers ya know
Rest In Peace
Mom duke struggling
Baby on the way

[Young Chris]
I know I promised you the house and the wheel
Just need a little time for the house on the hills
Got all the bills to keep this crib too
So when we in the city that's the spot we can chill
Be on your own, been working all your life
Went to school every other day working all your nights
I know your tired of the bullshit ma
Forget about it now your boy Chris rhyme, we good
No more corner store grub, eat good
Damn right we gon' take avantage as we should
As they say we shall over come
In the hood most of young die over guns (Its real)
I lost three in like three months straight
We see the pain to see youngs face, it ain't a game
And they think its all peaches and cream
They thinkin mines and I'm broke when they see me on screen
See what I mean, I let ya niggaz read in between
Just give me....tiiiime

All I need is tiiiime, tiiiime

To put you right where you need to be
Lens up in the game, now the shit ain't what it used to be
But Ima grind now until we all good
'Till we layin in the woods and got property up in the hood
You runnin real estate, ain't got to worry bout being late takin orders
Ya boy will help support ya
Funny how the young'n had did it
a lot thought he was gon' stop but the boy stuck with it
You even questioned it, whole hood stressin it
I come too far to let it go down the drain
But half of you motherfuckers don't understand my pain
I got to deal with these lames to get this little bit of change
Little bit of fame and the girls think I changed
Same shit, different toilet when you messing with the game
I rather do this though, and fucking my wrist glow
Same niggaz who doubted now they sayin we should blow
Homey ain't raise no coward I was takin the shit slow

[Young Chris]
Look man, the cops is gettin vicious the streets gettin colder
My nephew gettin tall my niece gettin older
You know their pop, that's my brother fam
Lil sis back home gettin grown on the other hand
Givin me feedback
Now I gotta put a end to that before she get wild and start havin see scrat
Mom duke stressin still workin every night
My niggaz right and I'm impliyin in every kite
Just the other night lost a close homey man
He got caught sleepin with his toast on him, damn
Shame he can't see his son grow
Younger brother got game on his way to the pros
And I was just runnin with him
He got two cousins just came home, couldnt even get a summer with him
And everybody knew his life goes, true hustler but that's the way life goes
Love to the jails everybody stayin broke doin...tiiiime

I would turn green, from me...being in trenches
Him, livin adventurous...not worryin about expenditures
Think back, I never left the premesses
24/7 on corner, now let's remember this

After school, you wrote your rhymes while I sat in your crib
One of the first niggaz you let in your crib
Moms treated me like a son since day one
Thinkin 'bout how she talking bout she can't wait til that day come

The thing about that, I weren't even thinkin bout rap
Til I met you and thank you for that
And now you got us lookin like Jaz & Jay
T-Mac and Carter Neef, gotta work harder Neef

Shit...we runnin with S. Carter Neef
Dame & Biggs, get on your game my nig
The whole clique feel the same my nig
So don't think 'cause I'm ahead of you I changed my nig

Now we got rich athletes that practice evr'day
Look at Hov, seem him in action everyday
He still at it, sold 5 million, still practicin
You still with me? Units is movin...they still yappin homie

And I came into this game on your back and your game ain't intact
And I'm tryin to do my thang
All I want to know is if you tryin to do the same
I feel like I could do without you, at the same time I can't

'Cause at the same time it'll hurt
Ain't no shame in our game but our moms'll be hurt
Dreams of being stars, a lotta niggaz ??
If you can't do it for us, do it for Ms. Kim

Plus we promised both our mommas that we would
You know if we break that promise, it'll break they little hearts
Let's get this album out, and try to make it to the charts
Time for us to see the light, we done made it through the dark homie

Young Gunna I got ya..
But you hatas gonna make me snap, cock back and red dot ya
Face it, ya basic...you can't tie my laces
Now I got the game mapped, plus I want my spot back

We together forever, these niggaz can't stop that
Do it for who? I do it for you!
Let's be for real homeboy, they not our crew
And since we talkin facts, it's really just us two (Whoo)

And I know you feel the same when you're signed
But you couldn't even ride 'cause I wasn't on my job
Don't never ever think I left your side
Never T-mac and Carter see, Man you a part of me

Brother from another, even though my momma loved you like her own
Let's do this rap shit and just move on
I just thought I was passin a baton, lettin you kill them songs
Now I feel I'm all wrong

God forbid this rap shit'll don't even work out
Still know the Coke route, still get our moms out
And that's a promise we could never break

All I know she don't care who here
That's what I love about her
Make the thugs bring the love up out em
She know you comin', she gon stop and get the nut up out em
They learn enough about 'em
They get enough up out 'em
Just like a nigga that soon she fuck give a fuck about em
That's my type, baby
No disrespect to tha bourgeois and too polite ladies
I'll do tha wife, maybe
Maybe later when a player in his thirties
Man I can't afford these young'ns tryna play a nigga dirty
Have me up all night talkin' bout I can't sleep
Too hurt to eat, baby girl neva see, that be he
Not me I'm way a better cheat
You know me better, be

Fresh in the mornin' put it on me , cook a lil grits
She like to touch my lips
Yea I like to touch her hips

I wanna call her and ball her I'm on my grind though

I'm in the crib yea soon as tha block done
I lay pipe all night so let tha bed bugs bite
She grippin' the sheets tight
I came when she came twice
Oh you got the right one
We sex till the sun come
Good thing I brought a box of them Magnums
Or nine months later she pop out wit a bad one
And everything change that a chicken be naggin'

All cause him and them had a couple words

Bunch of pistol grips and I fullied the automaty
Yeah and I can care less if they bag me
Gotta hit 'em where it hurt, while she comin' out of church

Ransom a hundred grand, it can get me what she worth
For I put her to the earth and otherwise she murked
Just another T-shirt, nigga lost in the sauce

They know we tear the place up, face fruity and the Jacob
Play tough big ass toolie cover the waist up
Call my ace up nigga pay him on his way up
I told him bring the eight's up and someone bring the K's up

And chances you took and all the love that you gave
Mama made a Mac, laced me with boss game
Birth father wasn't sh..., don't even remember his face
But [Name] is a soldier, a African queen
Taught me 'bout self-respect, self-reliance, self-esteem
Told me to be a man, you stand on your own feet
Only the strong survive, streets prey on the weak
But I thought I could beat it, swore I had masterplan
Had it all mapped out till the rollers cuffed my hand
Damn, musta hurt you more than it hurt me
And me bein a knucklehead didn't make it easy
So mama, I'ma make you proud as possible

And mother dearest, when you hear this I just want you to know
That this mama boy love ya fa sho

And the lights are on and they want a show
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check 2, 1, 2
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees
What have you brung you?

Did you improve on the design?
Did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list
Who brung you?

You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you come to
And then it hit me, standing outside of heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me

I'm too uncouth, unschooled to the rules and two gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who song blue
Go back whatever you did you undo
Heavy is heaven, the devil on my two tons too

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement
Passed the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid

And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest a blaze
Now that's important to say, 'cause even with all of that
Most of us don't want it to fade

We want it to braid, meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to stay like the governor called
And they told him to wait, unstrap him from the chair
Put him back in his cage

The audience ain't fazed
They ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid
'Cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

So chauffeur, chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone

So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture

One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and Mikes don't feed back
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that

And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me

Barely make it home with the morning sun
Baby mother thinking that you on some other shit
Oh, what a job this is

Drankin' yet I'm thinking of another rhyme
Smokin', hoping that some bad news will come some other time
'Cause I'm trying to do what I've loved, I love what I do
This music is something more different than the weed and the brew

That's why we mashin', we ain't asking for nothing, we working for it
Push it, peddled it to the people, they can't ignore it, this is for
All the independents, a few major labels
The big studios who still give niggas favors

On the mixin' and mastering, puzzlin' and
Plastering the tracks together on tapes, C-D's, wax or whatever
This is for all the engineers who smoke weed
Can't forget about the production cost and all the hidden fees

For another rhyme written, we spend time spittin' in the booth

With the music I'd be making big impression I'd be leaving
And a lot of folks, they stop and stare thinking I'ma trickin' off
I roll another bleezy, puff it, pass it and shake it off

Move on to the next phase and it's amazing
The next generation of rappers, big Snoop Dogg raising
Hmm, that's 15 years in the game
Still got the fortune and fame, yeah, I'm doing my thang

Check this Devin, somebody said that real Gs to go heaven
So I'ma keep spittin' the truth on these fools like a reverend
Stay open like 7/11 that's 24/7, when you need some hot shit
Stop by and get you a beverage, I'm servin'

Plug it in, let it play and let me blow your mind

And take a couple kernels off it, that would be alright with you

Hell no, yeah, exactamundo
But we just keep recording and it ain't to get no condo
And candy, Bentley, Fanny with no panties in Miami
And that cute lil' chick named Tammy that you took to the Grammys

See we do it for that boy that graduated
That looked you in your eyes real tough and said 'preciate it
And that he wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for your CD number 9
And he's standing with his baby momma Kiki and she cryin'

Talkin' 'bout that they used to get high to me in high school
And they used to make love to me in college
Then they told me 'bout their first date listenin' to my tunes
And how he liked her finger nail polish

I'm out my mind, tryin' to fix it ‘fore I'm out of time
Don't worry 'bout me, God got me, bruh, I'm doin' fine
Another year in prison, promise this is it for me
Tryna make it through the storm, should be makin' history
No feelin' sorry for me, keep ya pity and ya sympathy
Good or bad, take it like a man, whatever meant for me
How I did it make ‘em hate my spirit, they wish they could kill it

Guess what my momma told me, she hate my partners
Guess why she hate 'em though,
'Cause all of 'em robbin'
Fuck the police, 'cause all of 'em problems
White girls fun, 'cause all of 'em swallow
Why I ain't fuck her at the house, 'cause the bitch holla
And where the pill man at, he need a blue dolphin
Old broke ass nigga, stop cock blockin'
Security, I need help 'cause the bitch stalkin'
A half fuckin' mill, that's what the whip cost me
One-hundred dollars, that's what the pussy cost me
And when the nigga start hatin', that's when the nigga lost me
Fantastico, that's what the hoes call me

[Chorus]

Drop the top, no bra, got tha titties out
Mention my name and bring the whole city out
Doin' what I do best, d-boy stuntin'
New car, old money, d-boy stuntin'
Step in cleaner then a new glock-40
My nickname in the A, strapped up shorty
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothpick
Line wrapped around the corner, boy too big
G-O, black shades and my black chains
But if you wouldn't understand, it's a black thing
You know we drink that Rozay 'til we black out
Wake up, drink some more, pass back out

Think I ain't about that action, wanna bet my nigga?
All day thumbing through the check my nigga
Boy you broke, you can't even be a threat my nigga
When you're talking to me say it with your chest little nigga
I pull up on your set and make a mess little nigga
Okay, I got a kilo of gold 36 O's
Wrapped around the neck of a dope boy
Gold yacht, Master Presi' diamond in those
And just paid cash for a Rolls Royce
A true trap nigga, I done sold everything
Trouble Man, Hustle Gang, all gold everything
I said Trouble Man, Hustle Gang, all gold everything

Bought a gold bottle now we on the Dom
Big faced Rollie take up half my arm
Porsche 911 with the Gabby top
All gold scale, that's my magic box
Got the soft, my nigga
Give me thirty minutes, I'll be right witcha
Got the hard, my nigga

Some people wear fox fur, on the Source cover I wore a fox
This for all the DJ's that got this on replay
See I sell a brick on eBay, then I celebrate
Several bitches in every state
I'm in Miami with Wayne trying to skate, my family straight
Ay your ho 'bout to hyperventilate, I owe her one, we did a 68

That's souf side up in here, I spell south with a F
F stand for fuck y'all if you ain't fucking with my set
Fuck with me and I'm busting, fuck with me and I'm busting
Every time you see me think about what it would be if I ain't do nothing
Damn right, I'm stunting, damn right, I'm styling
Just got a girl chauffeur and we on a motorcycle and she driving
This Versace, that Versace, this Versace, too
I got killers watching, niggas watching, bitches watching me too
See I'm on lean, on loud, and I got my own lane

It's no love for the other side, fuck all the tricks
Pop the glove on the other side, buck through the bricks
Birds love how a brother ride, truckin it sick
I'm heard of on the southern side, i pluck through it quick
I been one of them boys since way back when
This is way before a nigga brought grey plaques in
So if i spray mac-10s, Bet you niggas lay back then
Like you sittin in a Maybach Benz
Yea I made crack grins but ain't a damn thing funny
I keep a pocket fulla do the damn thang money
I keep it comin with bottles of champagne dunny
So keep it bouncin till you pull a hamstring honey
These pimps just better have a gothic for me
I got them hoes starin like they got a problem with me
I got them boys slingin rocks in the lobby for me
I'm rich bitch, ballin just a hobby for me

[Chorus]
I got a pocket full of money and my wrist all froze
So fuck what you heard we don't love them hoes, heeyyy

Pilsbury nigga, got a lotta dough
Call me bossan george, got a lotta hoes
They place orders, so I bake cakes

You see the diamonds in my damn chain
It ain't hard to tell, I do the damn thang

You skatin on them 22 datins like them boys

They see a nigga stones look sick
And I gotta stack of singles in my hand that's phone booth thick
'Cause I'm so hood rich

And even if she gotta pimp then a hoe should switch
And get ridda that shit spitta, get wit her, shit gitter

My style fit wit her
I tell her you don went left now you need to go right like a switch hitta

If I don't get a grammy I'm headed at the rat niggas first
And I'm back full of perk strap on the curb

And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off

Gotta do what's best for me

Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say 'I told you so'

Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'm a hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind

You couldn't walk a mile off in my air forces

Everybody already know jeezy real street nigga
Every time you see me all around street niggaz
I hope you got yours I keep mine
In the club blowing dro throwing gang signs
And you already know, dog
745 back to back me and O dog
These other niggaz is jokers
What they rein up with I spent it up all the strokers

In one night eight bitches sipped bottles of Cris
Forty grand sit back so you can glance my wrist
Keep bread so we carry dem toaster
But keep back though my earrings ferocious
It's not just my imagination
I'm the one in the topic of your conversation
Jack boyz say they gon rob
But on the real fuck niggaz, y'all don't want these problems

The Mack 11 make me walk wit a crazy dap
Y'all say we country niggaz yee-haw
The money comin back and forth like a seesaw
And y'all ain't never seen what we saw
Stacks of twenty dollar bills, bricks or white rolls
What they got Lil Pha, they don't care 'bout shit
Ludacris, how they ride out twenty wit dem bricks

Shit, I spit it for y'all
On the real my niggaz shit I spit it for y'all
Who gives a fuck about friends?
If you mix the baking soda wit it you can get a Benz
While y'all robbing and boosting
I'm standing over the stove like the chef in Houston
And it's not about the flip mane
Want the real bread it's all about your whip game

I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line, the diamond of time (uhh)
My niggaz love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start buggin cause I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like, ""Nah hov, talk that shit""
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy jay-z
See I'ma '80s baby, master 
School of hard knocks, everyday is college
You ain't did nothin I ain't did, nigga pay homage
Or pay the doctor, I sprayed lami's
Still, the time'll reveal, you know I'm bein honest

[Verse 3 - Trick Daddy]
Some of the dudes we thought was real O.G.'s was O.B's
Cause they talked pleas and included G's like you and me
The first step was going to set a trap
So in a short period, they convinced the grand jury to allow a phone tap
And if they listenin'
Not once did they hear us mentioning
Murder and a cocaine distributing
Through all that was dividends comin' in
I'm strict legit, and better yet we too smart for ya bullshit
Callin all cars (callin all cars)
Hit your brother along
And tell 'em hurry up and come them niggaz got gunz
Man down, shots fired, only fuck niggaz and cops died
First stage of a riot
And them fucks couldn't sneak by
Oh you want to witness some shit
Fine bitch, be quiet
Because they only got what you tell 'em
And only witness that they had, the bitch was layin' there dead
Shot in the street all red, with two shots to his head
Cause he was workin for the feds
And the last informant, informed us
They had it out for us
For a bird that he got popped for
So ride or die for him (ride or die for him)
Better yet, you better kill 'em
Cause I think he's gonna be the bitch to tell 'em
And he probably done all ready told 'em
But then again with out a witness them bitches ain't got shit

The streets love jeezy and I love 'em back
If I still had the work I getcha sack
It's all gravy still reaching wit my words
And make 'em feel good on the first and the third
Take you back when I was sixteen wits a bankroll
Posted on a corner like a light pole
They used to call us track stars
Before they even stopped we ran to dem cars
And everybody on the block got the same agenda
Hustle from the beginning of January til the end of December
Wasn't smokin purple then it was more like bobby brown
On that hen dog got a nigga drinking straight brown (7/11 nigga you know)
You know 10 to 4 shake 'em up talk shit get my drink and let 'em go
Even when I'm on the road the gangstas stay in touch
Why you think they love me so much (ha ha!)

I'm talking bout summertime cookouts and wintertime flights
It ain't nothing we hearing shots all night
Ford Taurus pulls up everybody run
White boys jump out running wit they guns (5-0, 5-0)
Ford Taurus leave everybody came back
Hope dem boys didn't find my sack
Real recognize real I suppose
I guess that's why the gangstas be at all my shows
Got the deal nothing changed but my clothes
Still catch me in the jects fuckin' wit' dem hoes (projects!)
Like coo-coo cal
Lord I wish mad Lou could see me now
Wish gold mouth was there wish mailman was free
A lot of niggas crossing over dog no not me
Plus I been in the commercials when I watch TV
And everybody know I rep these streets faithfully

I'm a motherfucking problem, who wanna solve me, dog?
Got six cell phones, who gon' call me dog?
This ain't a movie, we are not actors
Still use a duck ass nigga for target practice

Infrared beam on the Mausberg pump
Hit his ass with it twice, make him A-Town Stomp
In gats we trust
Niggaz play a lot of games dog, but not with us

Call me, 'Jack In The Box', hop out with two clips
Cook ya faster than a T-bone at Ruth Chris
You still hating, looking stupid

Young Gucci Man, don't kiss me baby you can kiss my chain 
Ya gotta be a dime piece, 
Just to look at the rocks in my time piece

Got a gold grill but it's not from Eddie

You can still see my chain even when the lights out 
'cause that's how monsters do it 
Spit a lil game give 'em that flosser music

These lames runnin' 'round thinkin' they so fly 
Got a lil' buzz but Boo been too high 
I'm pullin' hoes in the club and I don't even try 
I guess when she glance at my wrist, she want to get my dick 
I tell her holla at Jeezy if ya want to pop Cris 
Get at Gucci Man 'cause he on some lil' shit 
And you know I'm in the cut, grippin' my 4/5

Two choked out chains,

Everybody know the game,

Fully loaded and cocked wit that choppa and I'm ready for battle,

I'm a dirty south legend, and an allstar outta the T,
From the land of the Longhorns,

Throw that dirt weed loco,

Not to mention the gallons of ?????????? that we sip,
The game is fanominal,
Work is acceptional,
Spending hours over the stove,

Facilities even with a kitchen full of coke,
I'm still at ease,
'cause my team is full of nothing but guerillas and ???????????,

Young Jeezy,"Diamonds in my damn chain! 
It ain't hard to tell!

[Chorus:]
(Diamonds in my damn chain)
(Diamonds in my damn chain)
I'm like, oh daddy, I see you do the damn thing
Got my vote, I'm feelin' ya campaign
I like you, but I really like your damn chain
(Diamonds in my damn chain)
(Diamonds in my damn chain)
It kinda explains the way she be actin'
She liked my necklace so she started relaxin'
Now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction

[Fabolous]
Yo, you think they like me now, wait until the light hit me
I bet the house somebody's girl spend the night with me
They gotta love it, if not, then I guess they haters
This kinda necklace turn on the investigators
They ain't got one problem with this
Square face watch look like sponge bob on the wrist
One white, one gold, one nice, untold
You could look, but don't touch, guns might unload, now
I respect them thugs who get they jackin' on
But we squeeze to every slug that we be packin', son
Ya boy got the drug money we be stackin' on
Lotta carrots, not the one's Bugs Bunny snackin' on
Got 'em gettin' close, and lookin' like a scooped-up
The titanic chain from the bottom of the ocean
I play them diamonds well when I got that jewelery on
They should call me Carat Jeter, maybe Canary Bonds

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
Oh, she actin' real reckless right now
Let me at this bitch, man, let's go
Damn, what happened? He blinded everybody
It must be Jeezy, outshinin' everybody
Yeah, I'm fretted for the show
You could call me the light man
(Diamonds in my damn chain)
You could call me the bright man
Yeah, I don't do bright links, I do AP's
Yeah, I spit cheese on all these VV's
Blow an old G, yeah, I got it from home
Twenty carat pinky ring, shit, I got it robbin'
(Break yourself, nigga) We have to step it up a notch
Iced-out ski-mask, placed in the projects to hide my weed stash
Dominican shit, shit, I got it from fans
Yo, the stone is in my chain, so I call it the cab

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Yo, maybe it's them VV's 'cause they sets susters
Sit on the next bus like the show on MTV
The wings on the chain make a nigga fly
Like the wings on a plane when you sittin' in between 'em
They hittin' when you clean 'em, glitterin' when you seen 'em
Beemin' through the tints when I'm sittin' in the ""Phenom""
Oops, I mean Phantom; my words got tangled, man
But this tiger stripe watch make this bitch a Bengals fan
We all know Jacob; check the shit he did
He spent more time making the band than Diddy did
You feel my campaign, then drop your old spouse
I'm out in DC at the white and gold house
Wanna convince me, love? Secret service me with some of that Lewinsky love
She saw the chain, gave me brain, no strain ever since
Now that's what I call a real chain of events, nigga

I gotta couple of v's wit' the kits, mpv's on my wrist
A lot of glamor and glit's, but shorty I don't need that
My beginnin' was a humble one, a hustler I'ma son of one
Taught me how to number run, I went from that to number one
Had a hundred ones, I bought a slab flipped another one
Sold my little three-eighty east, and said I need another gun
The littlest in the trap, and got it poppin' like some bubble gum
Junkies hatin' on my stacks, sayin' I'm nothing but a young
Buck, niggaz say, ""what?"" then he see me raise up
Just wanna see the little boy wit' nuts exchange old niggas whole face soon
'cause I spray the nigga's whole face up, wet the nigga from the waist up
They try you once and you pull a fall, and then tell 'em shaw' don't play wit 'em
I'm fourteen in the dope game and don't care of catchin' no case bro
Consider me, that's intentionally, another nigga that it's too late for
Hey wait bro, bet any nigga came from that?
Who lose it all the day, I bet he say he changed from that

Hey you can keep the game and the fame, the haters and the lames
Just gimme some cocaine and somewhere I can slang
And I'm straight, hey shorty I'm straight

OK now, now when I spit it, I spit it how I live it

I'ma gangsta in the game, go ask lil' wayne
Ask judge Johnson, how many times he saw my face
For, ""pistol here, pistol there,"" ""violation here, violation here""
Betta ask rank, I ran the jail when I was there
I held it down, where-ever I go
When I'm in the a wit' the king, or in detroit in the snow
I'ma pro, whether it's movin' snow or movin' 'dro
That's between me and you, I can get it for the low

Shit cloudy and chipped up, know what I'm talking 'bout?
And them niggaz talking 'bout they ""trill niggas""
Don't even know what the motherfuckin' word mean!
Know what I'm talking 'bout? this comin' from the o.g. style trill
Know what I'm talking 'bout? not these ol' fake ass niggas
Tryin' to come on the scene later on and tryin' to take glory for some shit

Look at daddy in face now tell me
how good does it taste
Willie Fal-con, I'm the Dow Jones
Down South where them D-Boys ground zones
We never steal cars, what I'm puttin' miles on
Thirty feet, it cost a couple hundred thousand
My shit bigger than your's, at the biddin' wars
I'm the one they biddin' for, dog I'm
just a bigger draw
I'm in the distribution, I'm like Def Jam
Release fish scales, scales on my desk man

Got introduced to the game, to the game then fuckin' blew up.""

Whether gettin' money legally or illegally
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man! 
Yeah! Grew up a screw up, baby 
Got introduced to the game
I ain't took a breath yet 
Let's go! 

[Ludacris] 
Ever since I was an embryo, waitin' to shape up and ship out 
Somethin' in my brain said, ""Wake up and kick out!"" 
Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out 
'Cause when I came, I was draped up and dripped out 
Snip the umbilical, spit the government chip out 
Peace out, A-Town gone and then I dipped out 
And, oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out 
I slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out 
Somebody get him, the lil' nigga's out of control 
Put a lil' bit of rum in my bottle; I'll dream about diamonds and gold 
Gold, gold, to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent 
The essence of adolescence got my body feelin' fresh'n 
Fresh'n, fresh'n, and it was a blessin' to rhyme and start reppin'
I was the best in my section with flows harder than erections 
Still the best, but now I'm grown with more range than a tec's 
And I'm a heavyweight; you niggaz is lighter than my complexion 

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy] 
Hey
Y'all already know what it is 
I'm a tell you, nigga 
C.T., know what it is, 'bout 17-5 
Homey fronted me a sip, shit, I made it a bird 
That's seventeen and a half, all I need is the word 
Say, the ice is cool but them pots is hot 
You better cook slow but that money come fast 
I got what you need; I hope you brought all the cash 
You know the kid pimpin' all over the world 
A hundred carats got me all over your girl 
Yeah, five freaks and my Gucci duffle bag 
A corporate thug; I run with a Playaz Circle 
I got a Field Mob that'll disturb your peace  
Blowin' Sean Jay, all we do is smoke 
Finish countin' my bread, and I was gettin' some head 
Whassup? 

[Chorus]

[Ludacris] 
I'm a be all the way real with this, look 
When I came into the game, they ain't do nothin' but doubt me 
Now the whole game's changed and it ain't nothin' without me 
Pickin' up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown 
Only reason you on that song is 'cause I turned that down 
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys 
And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's 
From alright to handsome, from one room to mansions 
From hangin' on the block to throwin' parties in the Hamptons 
From broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a 
Plane and a boat and six other whips, no Marta 
From dice on the curb to stackin' up chips, but harder 
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my dick! 
Guard your women, dog 
I went from ashy to classy 
Went from a kiss on the cheek to doin' the nasty 
Reach your hand up in the air, and you can play with the stars 
It's not the hand that you're dealt, but how you're playin' your cards, boy!

Why would I do her like that?

Young Jeezy,"Wassup?
Hahaaa
Yeah! Yes! It's real talk, can I talk to y'all for a minute?
I was in the streets the other day, I had a homie come through and he ask me
Say ""Yo! Everybody listen to you, everybody all ears, what you gonna do to give back?""
I told him ""Look homie, I'm ten steps ahead of you, if not thirty""
Real talk, listen up, I got one song, let's make it right, let's go

I'm high on life and a fifth of Remy
From the city where them young niggas die skinny
Keep work on deck if you need any
Just holler at them boys cause they keep plenty, follow me!
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders
And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders
And it's so heavy, but I'm so ready
Feels like I was born for this
If not, at least I'll die for it
They said I couldn't do it but I'll still try for it
The big question is what can I do for the youth?
Everybody lyin to 'em so I told 'em the truth

""I'm a hustler!"" So, one man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
Real or fake y'all, we gon' see tonight
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I got hustle!"" One man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I'm a hustler!""

Real niggas don't die, they go to the Feds
Fresh out, right back chasin bread
My life's so hard, so concrete
I was raised by 'em homie, that's why I think so street
Take me for instance
My life is not about you, think me for instance
I did the impossible, I made it out
Got dealt a bad hand but I played it out
I'm a left lane nigga, my life's so fast
Now I'm thinking holmes, got my right blinker on
Spread my word, got my Kirk Franklin on
Stuntin in traffic like ""This my car""
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far
Life's a bitch so I'm tryna wife her
Just ball around, you know, buy her some things
Lovin every minute of it, still breakin chains

""I'm a hustler!"" So, one man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
Real or fake y'all, we gon' see tonight
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I got hustle!"" One man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I'm a hustler!""

Y'all my brush, let me paint a perfect picture
Gotta pay attention cause it's three dimensional
Same picture, see it one of three ways
Let it marinate, it might take a few days
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence
So I shouldn't say nothin? Get a moment of silence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense
Words to live by, took it out of context
They say your past is your present and your present is your cash
So I look forward to the future
Get a lil' paper your baby momma won't have
Partly cloudy so I need a forecast
Where's the weatherman at when you need him?
A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him
And a broke nigga believe anything you fuckin tell him

""I'm a hustler!"" So, one man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
Real or fake y'all, we gon' see tonight
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I got hustle!"" One man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night
And I think I know the way, follow me

The old lady across the street still bitchin'
It's 3 in the mornin take your old ass to sleep
The third time she's called the police this week
Lookin' at my Franck Muller, it's about that time
Your folks just left so I'm on my grind
Said you wanna two-fifty cause you need that nine
I want that bread but I don't need that dime

Put the fish scale on the scale
If Roy went postal, all he do is check mail (ha ha)

But I still bury a nigga
Put The Mask on, Jim Carey a nigga (Blaou)
Swede ends in the Chevy, got me feelin' awkward
Careful with the sweets, don't burn my seats
You could live your whole life and not come close
Guess that's why these rap niggas take notes
Recite my adlibs, borrow my quotes
Make me I hop a nigga, serve them with the toast

I like you, but I really like your damn chain

She liked my necklace so she started relaxin'
Now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction

[Fabolous]
Yo, you think they like me now, wait until the light hit me
I bet the house somebody's girl spend the night with me
They gotta love it, if not, then I guess they haters
This kinda necklace turn on the investigators
They ain't got one problem with this
Square face watch look like sponge bob on the wrist
One white, one gold, one nice, untold
You could look, but don't touch, guns might unload, now
I respect them thugs who get they jackin' on
But we squeeze to every slug that we be packin', son
Ya boy got the drug money we be stackin' on
Lotta carrots, not the one's Bugs Bunny snackin' on
Got 'em gettin' close, and lookin' like a scooped-up
The titanic chain from the bottom of the ocean
I play them diamonds well when I got that jewelery on
They should call me Carat Jeter, maybe Canary Bonds

Yeah, I spit cheese on all these VV's
Blow an old G, yeah, I got it from home
Twenty carat pinky ring, shit, I got it robbin'
(Break yourself, nigga) We have to step it up a notch
Iced-out ski-mask, placed in the projects to hide my weed stash
Dominican shit, shit, I got it from fans
Yo, the stone is in my chain, so I call it the cab

Yo, maybe it's them VV's 'cause they sets susters
Sit on the next bus like the show on MTV
The wings on the chain make a nigga fly
Like the wings on a plane when you sittin' in between 'em
They hittin' when you clean 'em, glitterin' when you seen 'em
Beemin' through the tints when I'm sittin' in the ""Phenom""
Oops, I mean Phantom; my words got tangled, man
But this tiger stripe watch make this bitch a Bengals fan
We all know Jacob; check the shit he did
He spent more time making the band than Diddy did
You feel my campaign, then drop your old spouse
I'm out in DC at the white and gold house
Wanna convince me, love? Secret service me with some of that Lewinsky love
She saw the chain, gave me brain, no strain ever since
Now that's what I call a real chain of events, nigga

Yea son. Let me see this
Oh they didn't have questions like this when I grew up son
But I guess whatever 

It takes to make you be a man son. I'm all for it
Son, the first question is, if you rap about another 

Rapper on a record, what are you? 

You a sucka! 

Aha, you got that right son. Next question
If you hate another for being successful, what are you? 

You mean like, you rollin' in Benzes, they be like P.H.ing you 
The pigs be pulling you over cause you 

Be black and you be sittin' on triple gold
Like the niggas in the ghetto be hatin' on you cause you made it out? 

Yea son, what is that, what you call that? 
Dad, that only be two words. PLAYA HATA 

Huh, you got that right son. Look like you gonna past this test
But I got one more question for you
Son, if any man depends on another man and can't think on his own
Can't survive on his own, can't take good care of his 

Family, you know what I mean son
I mean, you were put in this world by yourself
You're supposed to depend on you 

And nobody else. I mean son
When a man can't function on his own and put his problems on another man
son, what type of man is that? What do you call that type of person? 

Dad, can I curse? 
Son, if you have to express yourself. Tell me, what type of man is that? 
That a punk ass bitch 

Hehehe, damn little P, you bout it, bout it, just like your daddy
Oh wait, one more question before I leave though 

What you want to be when you grow up? 
I want to be a G like you. A No Limit Soldier for life

Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the caddy
Now those were the days, where crime really pay
Nine milly spray, got the fuck out the way

The bricks went fast, robberies went bad, niggas got blast

No food on the table, so we far from steak
But I'm so close to jail, it feels like I'm so close to hell

Mom's smoking ***, same s*** I'm selling
So who's wrong, her or me
She addicted to the high, I'm addicted to the cash
I almost put my hands on her when I caught her in my stash

How could I do her like that, Lord knows I'm wrong
Why would I do her like that, Lord know she's strong
I know it's been hard but we made it baby
Ten years clean, so she's still my lady, I must be dreamin'

Posted on tha block wit a pocket full of glass
Full speed, still runnin' from my past

I'm a predator, I pray 3 times a day
Mat Lue once said one day you'll have kids
And how you gon' explain all that *** you did

I'm a soul survivor far from a crook

Big ups, to all my haters!

Guard your woman dog or I'll take her
You'll hear her scream from College Park to Decatur
I was a snotty nose with no paper
Now my crib sittin' on 22 acres (woo)
Get it right fool I gets money(yep)
If you think Ludas not filthy you's a dummy (yep)
I was allergic to the roof on the cutty
So I took the top off like a playboy bunny (what up pops)
Catch me pimpin' in a robe and some slippers (oh)
Ridin' down 85 while I'm stuttin' on my Zixer (ern)
Mouth full of swishers or ridin' with ya sister (woo)
Or Six David Beckhams or a trunk full of kickers (ha ha ha)
Take a picture of the mister it'll last long
And these haters get stretched out like a bad thong

Went from two ounces to a Maserati
First rap check bought choppers for everybody
Before they know what's under my shirt the glock 40
Get 25 a show next month I want 40
Born a real nigga but I'm a die a goon
Just bought a new choppa gon use it real soon
Got the streets on lock homie I can't lose
Put me anywhere I'm the realest nigga in the room(believe me)
Take a look at me I'm what you call street approved
Got a lot haters but even more tools
I play dumb homie but never been a fool
Cut my dog off I heard he snitchin' too(ha)

And if it ain't money then I don't look right
Ha ha, and that don't sound right
I swear you can get a full clip not a sound bite
Su-Wu gang and if you ain't with it then you in the food chain
I'm in that wide body I'm a need two lanes
Blue Seats white paint wetter than new rain
Like a white person with blue veins
I keep a black glock red dot blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game
Cause all my kicks fly like lu kang(ha ha)
Old player new game
I'm focused I'm thinking like I got two brains
I'm in my prime I feel like a new Wayne
I Caress two women but ain't no two Wayne's
I don't know what you do but I do things
It's Mr. every time you see me got a new chain

Not knowing the only thing that we can promise is to die
A promise is a lot can?t nobody guarantee it
And death around the corner can?t nobody damn see it
I can?t agree that God good at all time
But we all know shit ain't all good at all time
So I tote my strap in the hood and all time
But respect ain't just something that?s understood in our time
Especially by our kind man I hate it for the future
Police don?t wanna lock ya up no more they wanna shoot ya
And that's half as bad as these hatas?ll do ya
As soon as ya get ya loot up they wanna shoot up
Lord forbid to kill me I bet ya nobody knew what
Suckas get shot and police come straight to us
And that jus how they do us ever since niggas blew up
I know ya goin through it know I?m goin through it too bruh

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight

You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip

Look around ma you sent me to the store to get some bread
And I?m passin? atleast 8 J?s or mo?
Rent been late for 8 days or mo?
But slangin? blow a better habit than 8 days of snow

Ya out speedin' wit the white and ya see the blue lights

Hard to realize it Baby girl but god with ya

My momma girl son 14 just got killed
Had to catch myself
Bout to tell her I know how ya feel
I?d a been a damn liar
See her tryin not to cry
She know he in a better place
But she just wanna know why
Know somebody touch mine
And a nigga gon? die
It?s goin down
How dare I tell her to calm down
I tried to convince her that he in God?s arms now
She said I don?t believe that there's a God right now
I know its hard right now and ya heart light now
But God give new begginins you can start right now
Know ya scarred right now 'cause you apart right now
But Shit you in better shape than we are right now

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight

And baby you could go where ever you like (if you like)
I said you could go where ever you like (if you like)

Anytime you want to pick up the telephone
You know it ain't nothin' to drop a couple stacks on you
Wanted you could get it my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentley's I swear

Cause everybody know it ain't trickin' if ya got it
Ya need to never ever gotta go in your wallet
Long as I got rubber band banks in my pocket
Five six, rides with rims and a body kit
Ya ain't gotta downgrade you can get what I get

And goin' every store for any bag she want
And know she ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anything ya heart desire I that

You want it I got it, go get it I buy it
Tell 'em other broke niggas be quiet
