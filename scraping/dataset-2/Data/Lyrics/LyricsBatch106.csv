El P, was geht ab?
Drei Jahre Haft, ich geh' nie wieder in Knast

Bumbs' weiter Barbies in der Nacht
Mit den Jungs, verpacken Charlie in der Stadt
Denn wenn es dunkel wird, werden Junkies wieder wach
Gleiche Sorgen, denn ich verteilte Schore
Fühlte mich eingefroren, doch machte reichlich Dosen
Meine Ohren hören grad ein paar Strophen von zwei Ikonen
Dicka, mit Bleipistole, bis ich die Scheine hole
Was für ein, ich will zwei Millionen
Dass sich die Scheiße lohnt, denn wir sind beide broke
Dicka, wir steigen hoch mit unsern Rhymes und Flows
Und wir ballern dir 'ne Kugel á la Michael Owen
Deutschrap, diese Nutte ist 'ne feige Ho
Wir kommen rein in diese Szene, Rap ist eine Show

Shoulders I lean on start to be a crutch
Babe I think I needed you a little much
But I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get just a little bit stronger every day
I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get just a little bit stronger every day

You showed me the ropes but there were these strings
Tied around my hopes unraveling
So I took the loose ends and I made a vest
To cover up this precious thing inside my chest
And I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I'm getting just a little bit stronger every day
I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I'm getting just a little bit stronger every day
And the hole I never thought would fill
Started to spill

I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get just a little bit stronger every day
I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get stronger the further you are away

I learned to tell the difference between a miracle and a magic trick",Stronger,2002
Darden Smith,"So we walked out and through the night
We laid down under the stars
And the sweat on our skin
Gave us away
And you came in like the wind that blows through this open door
And in that storm I was swept away
And the day you left you gave a little charm to me
And I wear it round my neck
Oh, every time the little charm might brush
Against my body
You come in like the wind that blows through this open door
And in that storm I am swept away

There's a river that's flowing underground
Where it starts and where it ends
It's a mystery like where'd you go
How far and why
I could throw the little charm up at the sky, curse your name a thousand times
In the end it would do no good
You can't stop the heart when it wants to turn
You can't stop the body ‘cause it still burns

Above and below you
Everywhere you go
It's all around you
Never ever doubt it

If you need, really need to see me bleed I'll open up for you

Even if that river never ever hits the sea

I knew you would

My God and your God they're one and the same
They sit around talking as friends
Laugh at the sunset they cry at the moon
Fall into each other's arms every now and then

And anybody down here who's talking for them
You're putting words in the mouth of strangers
Trafficking rumors, talking in tongues
Calling us all to danger

That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still",My Heart Stood Still,2001
Darek Oleszkiewicz,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands,2001
Darek Oleszkiewicz,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2004
Darell,"Por lo de nosotros yo siempre le pido a Dios
Pa’ que él no me mate o pa’ que no lo mate yo

Ahora ya está puesta pa’ mí (Jhayco)

Te picho a ti porque conmigo quiere estar
No le digas dónde que no va a llegar
Ella está puesta para mí
Y para hablarte claro, sí

Yo me la como como se supone
Y puede que cuando se lo hagas me mencione

Yo te quiero dar pero sin interrupciones
Y esta gente quiere darme y no tienen cojones (No no no no)

Te tengo una sorpresa y es pa’ ti
Una ropita que te la compre pa’ ti
Y una cremita que te quiero untar a ti
Pa’ sentirme ready cuando estes encima de mí

Como te imaginé
Tanto así que hasta el panty te lo adiviné
Saqué conclusiones y nunca terminé
Por eso la correa con las Retro la combiné

Me dijo tu amiga Ginette
Que no hay que coger refine con Linette
Que sabes de medi’ pote ‘e Percocet
Qué puede pasar cuando en cuatro te dé

Qué las uñas y el pelo están set

Dime pa’ qué frontear con el G y las Moët

Empercosia’o soy cariñoso a lo Ted
Pero mi bicho le da a lo Mohammed

Nunca te lo— (baby) nunca te lo pone

No te ilusiones
Contigo no quiere mezclar las emociones
Me envía fotos de noche y con corazones
Pa’ mí se hizo la uñas y también las extensiones 
(Y tú no se lo pones)

Como yo lo haría
Dijo que era tuya anoche y te mentía
Vi tu nombre pero fue las llamadas perdidas
Ella ya no va a la iglesia pero sí está bendecida (ámen)

Tengo una sorpresa y es pa’ ti
Pa’ que frontees con la combi que te di (baby)
Déjale saber ya yo estuve ahí (¡Darell! ¿Tú me estás entendiendo lo que te estamos queriendo decir?)
De ti me preguntaron y yo les dije que sí (mera dímelo Jhayco)

Yo me la como como se supone (esta es la verdadera vuelta, oíste baby)

For failing his duties to restore order in the realm.

I'm the truth when I step in the booth
AKA a hundred proof raps gasoline
Americas nightmare but a black mans dream
My eyes on the prize no sacrificin'
That's how we do it man, yeah

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me
Never, D-Brok tell 'em man

Ain't nobody like me
All day they tryin' to walk wit' it
But there's only one Pooh, one true authentic
Uh

It's been five long years since we started this
Group that was targeted, that people so annoyed with fast
And them wannabe niggaz and they gorgeous past
You ask me if I changed, fuck man, of course I have

'Cause I got more records to sell
More dollars to clock, I hate it but that's how it's gotta be
Got more stories to tell, more people to watch
And ten times more people watchin' me

So fuck the masquerade, just let me have a say
I still be spittin' regardless of the accolades
Y'all can take back the mics in The Source
Take back the props from Pete Rock Quest and them boys

Take back the night we did, ""Speed"", at four in the mornin'
Even take back the day I met ninth in the dorm
Y'all can re-write the history to settle the score
And I still be writin' wizardry like never before

'Cause I broke down this year almost lost my clarity
Felt wicked times needed God to carry me
Like, when I found success but lost my family
In the process I will not let you bastards handle me

Lookin' for some guidance, so I figured
I pray to God and He said, Tigga
Low I ain't let you run it back this far
Just so you can go and fumble under one nigga
What he sayin' dog for real?

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me, uh
Yo, you better tell 'em dog

Ain't nobody like me
All day they tryin' to walk wit' it
But there's only one Tay one true authentic
What? O-Dash, where you at nigga, man, c'mon?

Keep thinkin' shit gravy man
I heavy man, bet you all a dollar, I can change the game
I ain't gotta change the name, just change the aim
For months we gon' have to rearrange ya frame

Stay strapped on the hip, for those wanna trip
'Cause I got fresh feet on the whip
Man gimme a half I'm like Dominique doors on the flip
No respect when I'm clutchin' ya grip

Paranoia sets in, thinkin' 'bout the time you investin'
Could be gone in a second, that's life in perspective
Ya ace froze, case closed, nigga body found up in Texas
No witnesses to see who that is

That's how I handle my biz, yup for sho'
Might kidnap your broad in exchange for dough
You know how it go

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me
That's how we do it, man, y'all better get it

Ain't nobody like me
All day they tryin' to walk wit' it
But there's only one O one true authentic
Yup

Oh yeah
Ain't nobody like me
",Nobody Like Me,2005
Darien Brockington,"Uh, Deah Pops
It's your boy
I got some things I want to say to you, man
Just a couple of words
Bear with me
Gimme a minute

Time to face it
Sitting in the middle of the basement
Holding a jack
How I'm anticipating he 'gon call me back

Got so much on my mind
Ain't no holding it back
In fact, I give a fuck how he 'gon react
Through my first nineteen

Asking where he at
Never seen him in the spots where we be at
For the next couple hours I sat 'til the phone rang
No luck or no cigar

So I said to myself I'll try tomorrow
Me and my Vincent left out
Went to shoot play some ball
Came back, had message like 'this your pa'
Then I took to the phone

Conversation was raw
Shit, I had to let him know that his child was scarred
And right now we working through our mess
But I had to get some shit off my chest
So bear with me, y'all

[Chorus]
Just want to take the time to let you know
Sometimes it's hard to let my feelings show
The thoughts of guarantees are really so
This is all for you, you

[Phonte]
I was looking at your photograph amazed how I favored you
I remember being young wanting to play with you
Cause you was a wild and crazy dude
And now I understand why my momma couldn't never stay with you
From the roots to the branches to the leaves
They say apples don't fall far from the trees
I used to find it hard to believe
And I swore that I would
Always hold my family as long as I could
But damn
Our memories can be so misleading
It's misery
I hate to see history repeating
Thought you were the bad guy
But I guess that's why
Me and my girl split
And my son is leaving
I did chores, did bills, and did dirt
But I swear to God I tried to make that shit work
'Til I came off tour to an empty house
With all the dressers and the cabinets emptied out
I think I must've went insane
Thinking I was in love, but really in chains
Trapped to this girl through the two-year old who carried my name
I tried to stop tripping
But yo, I couldn't and the plot thickened
That shit affected me, largely
Because I know a lot of people want me
To fail as a father
And the thought of that haunts me
Especially when I check my rear-view mirror
And don't see him in his car seat
So the next time it's late at night
And I'm laid up with the woman I'mma make my wife
Talking 'bout how we 'gon make a life
I'm thinking about child support, alimony, visitation rights
Cause that's the only outcome if you can't make it right
Pissed off with your children feeling the same pain
So, Pop, how could I blame cause you couldn't maintain
I did the same thing
The same thing

[Chorus: x 2]",All for You,2005
Darien Brockington,"We spent the last year writing rhymes doing shows and chopping records
And traveled all around the world to spread the message
Cause ain't no rest for the weary when it comes to my team
We only sleep on December the 32nd
DJ's dissin' the album before they check it
Dealin' with their managers and program directors
And even though I try not to stress it
Sometimes it feels like a waste of time and not worth the effort

Naw but I won't let it
Put a block on my team's hustle for a second
Poobie keep it rushing, as long as Tay and I on the mic
And 9th is on the percussion, these fronting dudes can't say nothing
It was only time for we finally spoke out
Plenty cold nights ahead I suggest you get your coats out
No time to stand here lips poked out we bout to closeout that stored up doubt
And keep it moving

Seems like whatever I do
Its not enough for you
I paid the cost and gave you my all
But you still want more
I'm still standing right here
But it seems so unfair
That I sacrifice and give you my life
But you still want more

Been a long time comin'
But damn we just made it
So much to discuss so frustrated
Yes, I must say that the industry lost touch
Radio better play this, cause Tay's style is nuts
And y'alls is just dated
It's history in the making
When I write its for all of N.C., call me the state pen
And now I'm making my name for those who hate that I'm
Staking my claim just like Nationwide
Radio, them suckas never play us
Took our wax to the station and they straight played us
That's how the game got contaminated
And now they sayin' we're at fault like the San Andreas

And still trying to play us
But not spin the record or disc
I got a fire burning deep that will not be extinguished
I mean this from the depths of my soul
People no more mind talk let my heart take control

Seems like whatever I do
It's not enough for you
I paid the cost and gave you my all
But you still want more
I'm still standing right here
But it seems so unfair
That I sacrifice and give you my life
But you still want more
Listen to this, just listen to this

Uh, right now, we gettin' it right now and now we gonna give you what you want
Just listen to this, just listen to this
I'm talking you, you, you, and all of you in the back
And in the middle in the front, come on

Homie, this here is pain
I'm speaking on this pitiful thing
That's now forever stained in the banks of my memory
You probably like, 'they running this, b'
But naw, I'll doubt we'll ever be
Its funny cats don't remember me
And don't think cause we all here that its gonna be all we
Or all love, its all bugged
Trying to mask them emotions with pounds and hugs
No more I say gotta make'em pay
Cause I'm tired of getting stepsonned in the worst way just wait
These chips on my shoulder gettin' stacked
When my pockets catch up Pooh's never turning back

Yo I ain't never heard a actor blow and go global
Then come back home and still be called local
And when we onstage the people they all front
Dope beats, dope rhymes what more do y'all want (shout it out)

Seems like whatever I do
It's not enough for you
I paid the cost and gave you my all
But you still want more
I'm still standing right here
But it seems so unfair
That I sacrifice and give you my life
But you still want more",Not Enough,2005
Darien Brockington,"This some grown man shit right here 
Listen 

I'm trying to man up see what's really good with you 
Gentleman's approach, not bring it hood to you 
Same things that you hear everyday like 
""Hey ma, hey boo, baby what's your name"" 
Please pull up a seat, I'm so glad you came 
My mother call me Thomas you can do the same 
Damn its so refreshing when you calling out my name 
Been Pooh for so long it doesn't sound the same 
My occupation rap and I make a little change 
I see you not impressed with what this life brings 
Finished school, got a job, girl do your thing 
It's a lot of independent women wanna be claimed 
Marry into money or marry into fame, or at least give birth to a check 
With all due respect lets two-step in the name of like 
Who says we gotta do the waltz all day and all night, it's like 

[Chorus] 
If love is not enough 
We don't have to rush 
Come around, I'll slow it down just you 
Lady you should be 
Right here next to me 
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you 

We can go to the movies 
I'll take you to the park and promise to have you home before the lights go out 
Steady asking you questions what your life about 
Oh and me, mine's everything I scribe about 
No doubt this my life and 
Dedicated to this witting sacrificing everything for it 
Wasted time I can't afford 
So if it ain't you/then you know I'm cooped up to the record.. 

I'll scoop you up in me Porshe, sike 
You know I got a Nissan 
That I'm still paying for, still got a lease on 
But it don't matter 'cause that ain't my aim to get you 
I got fame, but you know that just ain't the issue 
Because you're looking like a woman of virtue 
So well-rounded, no wonder your're in my circle 
And normally you probably wouldn't give me the time of day 
'Cause Tay got rhymes, but no he ain't got time to waste 

[Chorus] 

Sometimes I think I'm from another world (preach) 
When I'm trynna tell a woman just exactly where I stand that (aight) 
I want a girl, when I want a girl 
And when I don't want a girl, I want a girl who understands that 
And that's some hard shit to explain 
To a woman that's in love with you, it's a pitiful thing 
Until I had to figure 
That I don't wanna play around, but I don't wanna settle down 
And that's a man's dilemma, 'cause every man remembers 
How his daddy and his uncles did it 
'Cause more than likely that's the way they're gonna do it 
I know it sound fucked up and most won't admit it 
But yo, I gotta face it 'cause I know I'm living through it 
'Cause when the party stops and niggas get old 
And the chain and the cars and the houses get sold, and that 
Other side of the bed gets cold, you don't wanna be alone 
So girl I'm trynna hold you

Oh baby (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow) 
What you need to do is 
Take it slow with me 
Slow it down a little bit (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow) 
We don't have to rush into anything serious 
(Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow) 
No we don't, take it from me (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)

It's time to make my move
You only get one shot

I push up on your body
Now I finally have us standin' face to face
Away from everybody
I gotta throw a line
To show you what I've got

I say shorty here's my cue
'Cause I just had to talk to you 
And I can tell you want it too
I said I need to get with you 

Girl, it's goin' down tonight
I'm gonna make you mine
Can't you see I want ya, I want ya girl

I've been checkin' you all night
So what's the point of lying
Now can't you see I want ya I want ya girl

Now I can be committed
I'll work that body like a nine to five
I might as well admit it
And as I grab your hips
I watch you lick your lips

You know I'm about to kiss you 
Can't wait to taste the honey from the hive
To think I almost missed you 
And now I'm standing here about to
Cash my chips

I say shorty here's my cue
'Cause I just had to talk to you 
And I can tell you want it too

I like the way you do
The tricks that you do

You're flirting with the music
Like it's your boo
Got me lost in my fantasy
Picturing you and me

It's been a while and I still wonder
If I'll take your hand, take over
Control your body just for the night

Let me bless your hips just like you want to
Every step I share is with you
Let me do it right, do it right

You give me reason to party
I'll probably spend all my money
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Got your spell on everybody
Girl, you're an artist in naughty
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

And I don't see why I should stop
'Cause all we gotta do tonight is
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance

I feel the ice is melting
Because of you
This drink could never ever
Compete with you

The way you make me feel
It's hard to be true
I'm so drunk on the energy you
Putting inside of me

If I'll take your hand, take over
Control your body just for the night

Let me do it right, do it right

You give me reason to party
I'll probably spend all my money
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Got your spell on everybody
Girl, you're an artist in naughty
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

And I don't see why I should stop
'Cause all we gotta do tonight is
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance

Ey Mr. DJ, please do me a favor
Turn it up a little bit
I wanna do this number

See, I got this little shorty
Acting like she really want it
And for sure she gonna get it
And she give me, give me, give me

You give me reason to party
I'll probably spend all my money
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Got your spell on everybody
Girl, you're an artist in naughty
The way you dance, dance, dance

The way you dance

Darin,"I was walking past this woman
Just the other day
From her neck
I felt the very same aroma
She was dipped in that cologne
That you used to spray
I just frozed and realized
That you are gone now

Can't believe
That you and I are separated
Not living together
Remember when you said that night
That you and I would be forever
Reminiscing as the tissue
Wipe the tears away
Wonder if I'm gonna wake up
From this coma

That's when it hit me
Like a flashback
On how it used to be
When you and I were still in love
It hit me like a flashback
Something that reminded me
I can't believe that you are gone 
I can't believe that you are gone

I was driving past your
Neighborhood the other day
Couldn't help from
Staring at your open window
The I heard your favorite song
That you used to play
My whole world just crashed
Like a cymbal

Can't believe
That you and I are separated
Not living together
Remember when you said that night
That you and I would be forever
What I wouldn't do to have you
Coming back my way
Now I'm standing brokenhearted
Lost and single

That's when it hit me
Like a flashback
On how it used to be
When you and I were still in love
It hit me like a flashback
Something that reminded me
I can't believe that you are gone 
I can't believe that you are gone

Just like a time machine
Taking me back to yesterday
A million thoughts
Are running through my head
I think I'll go insane miss you so much
I'm going crazy crazy crazy
Feels like I stumble in a storm
And I can't find my way back
'Cause I just realized I lost
The most precious thing that I had
I'm going crazy crazy crazy

That's when it hit me
Like a flashback
On how it used to be
When you and I were still in love
It hit me like a flashback
Something that reminded me
I can't believe that you are gone
I can't believe that you are gone",Flashback,2008

The tricks that you do

You're flirting with the music
Like it's your boo
Got me lost in my fantasy
Picturing you and me

It's been a while and I still wonder
If I'll take your hand, take over
Control your body just for the night

Let me bless your hips just like you want to
Every step I share is with you
Let me do it right, do it right

You give me reason to party
I'll probably spend all my money
The way you dance, dance, dance

'Cause all we gotta do tonight is

Because of you
This drink could never ever
Compete with you

Putting inside of me

Turn it up a little bit

From her neck
I felt the very same aroma
She was dipped in that cologne
That you used to spray
I just frozed and realized
That you are gone now

Can't believe
That you and I are separated
Not living together
Remember when you said that night
That you and I would be forever
Reminiscing as the tissue
Wipe the tears away
Wonder if I'm gonna wake up
From this coma

Neighborhood the other day

That you and I would be forever

Are running through my head

Feels like I stumble in a storm
And I can't find my way back

The most precious thing that I had

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Catholic choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world, oh

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in.

Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Catholic choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",Goodnight,2004

Tengo tanto miedo de que ya no vuelvas a mí

Nunca me olvides por favor
Recuerda todo lo que fuimos tu y yo
Nunca te alejes de mi amor
Guárdame en tu corazón

Y té extraño cuando pienso que podrías estar tan solo a un paso de aquí

With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

Searching for that missing key
Unlock a new
World harmony

Climb the highest mountain range
Then we took the longest train
Looking for our
Perfect refrain

I hear voices in the sky
(In the sky)
In the sky
(In the sky)

Hidden rhythms in the rivers run
Blinding beats in the desert sun
Hear them today

Dario G,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

Brave New World

      Artilleryman
      Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
      Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start... we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP! Our turn to do some wiping out! WHOOSH! With our heat ray! Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game, man on top again!

      Artilleryman
      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,
      And out of the confusion a chance has come at last,
      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people life alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      And it's going to have to start with me and you... YES!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people left alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      Yes and we will have to be the chosen few...

      Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies,
      And imagine the destruction of all that you despise,
      Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men
      We'll start all over again!

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

A cute little dimple when she laughs too much

She's got a quick wit and a fast tongue
But she doesn't seem to know that she's the one
They say she cheats charm when she whispers
She's devilishly pure

She doesn't know
But its time I told her so

Something inside I'm getting rushes
The adrenaline rushes
And I'm fascinated
That you really don't know how to take it
When I look at you that way you feel naked
And I'm so into you
I'm getting rushes

She's about five nine
Got a sexy stride
With long tanned legs that she shouldn't hide
With a fine air of innocence
Nonchalance in every move
She's a sweet sensation tease temptation

She looks good enough to eat
She's a fallen angel with a devilish streak
And so they say
Like with like will finally meet

You'd see if you knew her

While I'm trying to forget the feeling that I miss you
Feelin' green
When the jealousy swells and it won't go away in dreams

Feelin' yellow
I'm confused inside
A little hazy but mellow
When I feel your eyes on me

Feelin' fine, sublime
When that smile of yours creeps into my mind

Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes, I'm color blind
You make me color blind

Feelin' red
When you spend all your time with your friends and not me instead
Feelin' black
When I think about all the things that I feel I lack

Feelin' jaded
When it's not gone right
All the colors have faded
Then I feel your eyes on me

Feelin' fine, sublime
When that smile of yours creeps into my mind

Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes I'm color blind
You make me color blind

The colors fade completely
Blinded by you every time
I feel your smile defeat me

The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

My heart shall not fear
Though war may rise against me

I will survive

Feel like I've got this black cloud hangin' over me
It's like this pain is takin' control of me
Every move I make, determines my fate
Feel like I'm dying slow, and that's the shit I hate
The constant pressure, the bullshit rumors
The outcast, I'm the one they love to badge
When the records stop sellin'
And the crowds stop yellin'
All I have is me

Bet you thought I'd die without you
But see how I'm still living
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here, with another one
Even though I felt crumbled, I made it through the rumble
Torn apart, a young woman scorned
Coping with the pain, nearly drove me insane
In the hospital, crying in the pain
All types of medications, flowing through my veins

And let them live so free

Please, understand I'm a human first
And before Foxy Brown, I'm just still Inga
And my family, is my whole life
And I cherish this ring that you put on my finger
We survived through the roughest stones
Sleeping with our baby pit bull on the basement floors
And through it all, you and I felt we could be strong
All through the rough times, through the pains and storms
And, it's like when it rains, it pours
All they see is gray and blue, they don't know you like I do
Five years committed, y'all just don't understand
No career, no fame, meant more than my man
And, to my fans that slept through it all
Through the rise and the fall, I love y'all all

Story of my legacy, this can't be life
Lord, I feel like I'm fallin'
Praying for strength, I'm losing my mind
And, how can you fly when your wings are broken?
And, how can I smile when my heart is broken?
Through all the pain I've felt, that's the hand I'm dealt
My personal problem, stays in my home
Know I won't discuss them, reporters I don't trust 'em

Hiding in the strength that's in your eyes,
But now I see you
Burning all the bridges in your world,
Now I feel you 
Sinking in the quicksand of your lies 

Can't you see that you're slipping away?
Can't you hear what I'm trying to say?
(You're better than that?)

[Chorus:]
Better than that
Stronger than that
(You're worth much more)
You're better than that
And you can turn back
(What's tried is torn)
Better than that
Stronger than that
(You're worth much more)
I'm telling you its killing you 
It's drowning you, it's spilling you over
(What's tried is torn)

I thought you knew how
To chase away the demons of blind trust,
I thought you knew now
It's all about temptation 
Changed by choice,
But girl you're crazy 
You're hanging onto reasons 
Turned to rust,
You're eyes are hazy, 
You've gone and lost the velvet 
In your voice 

Can't you see that you're slipping away?
Can't you hear what I'm trying to say?
(You're better than that?)

[Chorus]

I told you once, I told you twice
I told you baby
Now there's nothing more to say 
I'm missing the girl I knew,
While kissing the broken you,
But it's not up to me...

So don't back, face up to the facts
And you can turn back 
You're better than that.

Better than that, stronger than that, 
Wiser than that, bigger than that
You're better than the devil in you
Tellin' you how, pulling you down,
Spilling you ?????- but it's up to you",Better Than That,2002

While I'm trying to forget the feeling that I miss you

When the jealousy swells and it won't go away in dreams

Feelin' yellow
I'm confused inside
A little hazy but mellow

Feelin' fine, sublime
When that smile of yours creeps into my mind

Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes, I'm color blind
You make me color blind

When you spend all your time with your friends and not me instead
Feelin' black
When I think about all the things that I feel I lack

Feelin' jaded
When it's not gone right
All the colors have faded
Then I feel your eyes on me

Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful

Girl in the moon, I see you everywhere
Help me find a way of falling, closer to you

Looking just about anywhere but in each other's eyes
I'm wondering, why?
So many chances brushed then wasted
So many matches almost won in injury time

We're kicking pieces out of each other

Where do we start?

Well, we can reach and we can climb
And we can turn this ship around in time

I'm not buying that it's over
You can tell me anything
But I'm not buying that it's broken

So many fixes come too easy
Leave us so unsatisfied
Chasing the kite, addicted to high
So many patches we have worn
So many promises stillborn
We're so blind, we kill more than time

Intoxicated, drowning each other
Instead of drowning the pain in our hearts
Where do we start?

And we can turn this ship around in time

A thousand tears and you are my shoulder
From summer's haze, on morning light
The sun is rising just like I told you

If you fall, I'll never let your spirit break
If you call, I'll always soothe the cries you make
If it's all I can do, I'll slowly kiss your dreams awake
You're not alone for heavens sake, Mercury rising

From winter skies a cold embrace
The shadows meet and they drag you under
The moonlight's mine and yours to chase
Your star is rising beyond your wonder

If you fall, I'll never let your spirit break
If you call, I'll always soothe the cries you make
If it's all I can do, I'll slowly kiss your dreams awake
You're not alone for heavens sake, Mercury's rising
You're not alone for heaven sake

Your tears run so freely, your fears run so deeply down
The pressure is breaking, quicksilver awaking now
Can you feel it rise? Can you see it rise?
Droplets of dreams that you touched, disappear
There's change in the weather and wind in your hair
And Mercury's rising, Mercury's rising
Rising, rising, Mercury's rising

It's all about control.

You're his strength,
But he's you're weakness,
He knows you care,
Knows you give,
But he couldn't care less -
He fits you to his mould,
Chipping at you soul...

It tears me up
To see the way that he treats you,
To see the way that he brings you 
down and down -
He's turning you inside out,
It breaks me up
To see the way that you take it,
To see the way that he spins you 
round and round
Turning you upside down...
Mockingbird,
Mockingbird...

Afraid to leave,
Afraid to lose, 
Afraid of living -
You turn to him,
You turn to me,
But it lies in you -
It's waiting to be found,
It's waiting to be found,
So feel your heart,
Feel your pain,
Feel your anger,
If you fight the fear,
find the words -
You'll find the answer...
Like a cat held upside down,
You'll land feet on the ground...

A cute little dimple when she laughs too much

They say she cheats charm when she whispers
She's devilishly pure

With long tanned legs that she shouldn't hide
With a fine air of innocence

I left the ground, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Should I make a move?
Did she catch me falling
What have I got to lose
Will she stop me dead?
Before I catch my breath, I can't believe she's walking up my trail,

Wanted to make you proud

If I could only let you know
I'd give up everything I own
For just one more day with you
There's nothing I wouldn't do

I could not let it pass me by
I make every sacrifice
To bring me back your love
If only we could live twice

It still echoes in my soul
Please forgive me if I didn't say
I love you every single day, ohh

To bring me back your love
If only we could live twice
If only we could live twice

Nobody told me we'd only get one chance
I didn't know that our time would turn so fast
Why we have to say goodbye, I don't understand

If I could only let you know
I'd give up everything I own
For just one more day with you
There's nothing I wouldn't do

I could not let it pass me by
I make every sacrifice
To bring me back your love
If only we could live twice

I could not let it pass me by
Nothing I give to sacrifice
To bring me back your love
If only we could live twice
If only we could live twice

She swore that I would be special

How noble in reason 
How infinite in faculties 
In form and moving 
How express and admirable 
In action how like an angel 
In apprehension how like a god 
The beauty of the world 
The paragon of animals 

I have of late 
But wherefore I know not 
Lost all my mirth 
This goodly frame 
The earth 
Seems to me a sterile promontory 
This most excellent canopy 
The air-- look you! 
This brave o'erhanging firmament 
This majestical roof 
Fretted with golden fire 
Why it appears no other thing to me 
Than a foul and pestilent congregation 
Of vapors

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I know I could always be good

Darius Fentress,"One, two, three

I started out a long, long, long time ago
But my journey held most things I did not know
But I was sure and believed the plan You gave
Was so secure inside of me

In latter days I found failure down
And complacency came to pull me down
They wrestled deep inside of me, now the passion's gone
Staring me right in the face, asking me if I am sure

Now when I need strength to endure
There's one thing that I can count on
To help me make it through
I anoint myself

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep the love, that I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day
Kneel and pray
This is how I remind myself

Now my savior's gone, it seems like I have it down
I've stood through it all, it feels still to rise and come around
Trying to guarantee this day I'm going forward
And the battle starts all over again

Now when I need to know for sure
There's one thing that I can count on
To help me make it through
I anoint myself

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep in my heart what I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day
Kneel and pray
This is how I remind myself

Sometimes in this world, challenges come
And emotions get carried away
But in faith be strong and to His word hold on
And when if doubt comes, guard up yourself
Stand there and say I remember

Sometimes gotta remind myself
What I've been called to do
Is first to be with you

Sometimes I gotta remember, oh yeah
That you called me, Lord
Yes, you did and I'm at your disposal

Sometimes gotta remind myself
What I've been called to do
Is first to be with you

Sometimes, gotta remind myself
That you called me, called me
And I'm at your disposal

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep in my heart what I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day

And my burdens are heavy

I will bless you, bless you, come

As we dream by the fire

The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows
Ain't it thrilling
Though your nose is a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

A beautiful sight were happy tonight

And wouldn't you know it, pouring rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like us I poured it down the drain

'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song

I know I've said I wouldn't miss you
But now I'm saying I'm a fool
You're on the feel good side of leaving
And I'm the backside of a mule

And I didn't know I needed you so

In this king size empty bed

Darius Rucker,"Way back when
She did a hundred and ten
In her dad's old Chevrolet
And she once climbed
Way up high
To paint her name on a water tank

She's got that little red rose
On her big toe
Tattooed in Myrtle Beach
Went to Mardis Gras
With her mother-in-law
Got a suitcase full of beads

She's walked on fire
And jumped out of planes for fun
But loving me's the craziest thing
That she's ever done

[Chorus]
She's living on faith
I'm chasing my dreams
I fly and fall
'Til I unravel at the seams
She'd never played it safe
Never walked when she could run
But loving me's the craziest thing
That's she's ever done

Left the bright lights drove down 95
To a sleepy southern town
Gave up a sweet gig to have a couple kids
Chasing her around
All her friends roll their eyes and grin
When she says that I'm the one
They say loving me is the craziest thing
That she's ever done

[Chorus]

She likes walking on a tightrope
Dancing on a ledge
But she's knows I'll catch her
If she falls off the edge

That she's ever done",The Craziest Thing,2010

Is this really goodbye?

You look down at your ring
Slowly slip it off and then
You lay it on our bed

Maybe I should pick it up
And get down on my knees
Tell you what you wanna hear
And give you what you need

Just the other week.
You shoulda seen the waitress face
When I ordered sweet tea.
She said ""we don't have that here""
And I apologized, I said ""Please forgive me,
I'm in a southern state of mind.""

And those girls out in California,
They don't understand.
They don't like it when I hold the door,
When I say yes ma'am.
They act like I've done something wrong,
And they give me the evil eye.

And the cars passin' by.

And say that boy just ain't right.

You can hear it when I talk.

And I don't get drunk and talk about you
So I guess I've learned to live without you
I just don't know how to love without you

She don't have to look just like you
No her eyes don't have to be that blue
It's hard to give someone a chance
When you can't get past that second dance

And I don't get drunk and talk about you
So I guess I've learned to live without you

And I can't believe how far I've come

How can we go on tonight and not even touch one another?
How can we say we're still in love and not be lovers?
How did we get here, where you can be right there
And I can be with you and miss you?

Darius Rucker,"Seventeen, the only way I had a car
Is after I dropped my Momma off where she needed to go

It had four bald tires
With the ceiling falling and the windows stuck
But the only thing I cared about was the radio

We turned it on, turned it up to 10
And everybody would jump on in

Ridin’ down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I’ll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio

A real, real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
We had no money and no place to go
All we needed was a radio

Grabbed my girl
We looked for somewhere to watch the stars
A perfect place to put it park and take it slow

She sang along
To even the ones that she barely knew
Still sounded good, a little louder too
But we didn’t care

I looked at her, she looked at me
I’ll never forget that melody

Ridin’ down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I’ll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio

A real, real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
We had no money and no place to go
All we needed was a radio

Hey ya’ll be quiet, that’s my favorite song
Hey man, turn it up loud
Come on, come on, come on

Darius Rucker,"November of '43
On a boat comin' 'cross the sea
He left a boy, came back a man
She started running' when she saw his face
It'd been 655 days
Since she held his hand
He got down on one knee
and pulled out that ring
That he bought in Aberdeen
And when it hit that New York sky

It shined just like a spotlight
A star up in the night sky
The kind of thing that takes your breath away
Her eyes sparkled like that diamond
With love beaming from 'em
The kind of light that's never gonna fade
It's gonna shine

For the next 55 years
Through the laughter and the tears
My grandma always fore that band
through atom bombs and a baby boom
Dr. King and a man on the moon
No it never left her hand
On the day she passed away
Mama put it on a chain
Now and then on special days
Mom would wear it around her neck

And it would shine just like a spotlight
A star up in the night sky
The kind of thing that takes your breath away
Her eyes sparkled like that diamond
With love beaming from 'em
The kind of light that's never gonna fade
It's gonna shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine

Mama said one of these days
I'd know why she gave me that ring
Sittin' here I know she was right
Oh, it's not the biggest stone you've ever seen
But girl I can promise you one thing
The rest of your life

It's gonna shine just like a spotlight
A star up in the night sky

I wanna see a kudzu vine sneaking up on a junk car
I need to sit on my old back porch 'til the world lets go of my arm

Dancing to the groove like it just ain’t nothing
They ain’t never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ain’t nothing hotter

Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
I did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown

Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying ""Son it’s on""

I'm no genius but I know what we've got
That special kind of chemistry
Go on and roll those hazel brown eyes
Let's see where we're going tonight

This could be
The start of something beautiful
This could be
The start of something magical
The kind of thing you look for all of your life
This could be
The start of something so unreal
This could be
Finally the real deal
I guess now and then
Baby, I'm right

Just admit it, I ain't always wrong
Me being right kinda turns you on

Darius Rucker,"I ain't ever been accused of recusing myself from a Friday night
Don't need no excuse to go out and cut loose beneath the neon light
Ain't got to twist my arm to get me off the farm
Just say the word, I bet I beat you to the bar

I'm up for just about anything as long as it's almost legal
I can fit in with any old crowd, long as there's a party, they're my kind of people
So if you're down with painting the town, I'll be around all night
You know I'm always good for a good time

I'm a pretty good guy in my nine to five, always walking the line
I'll lend a hand to a stranger or a friend if they need mine
You can count on me buddy, I'm free
If you've got a bead on a party in need

I'm up for just about anything as long as it's almost legal
I can fit in with any old crowd, long as there's a party, they're my kind of people

It's old but it's still fast
And the weeds out in the front yard
When they're green, they look like grass
And this house we got
Well, it sure could use a couple shingles and a can of paint
But looking on the bright side
We're dry every time it rains

Yeah, I'm kicked back on the front porch
Drinking up this sunset
We ain't got a whole lot
But we got what we need
Yeah, I'm smiling 'cause I've been blessed
Sipping on the good stuff
This ain't a glass half empty thing
It's a half full Dixie cup

Kids chasing around that old dog
Being loud and dragging out toys
But you're missing out on a sweet sound
If all you hear is noise
And their mama sitting here beside me
Laughs and says, ain't it funny
Some people I know, well, they're flat broke
'Cause all they got is money

Yeah, I'm kicked back on the front porch

We ain't got a whole lot

My hair's gettin' long but I don't care
Lawn chair sitting, ain't going nowhere
A big old smile on my face
Pointin' out pictures in a cloudy sky
Craving me a piece of that pecan pie
Might lay in the grass and kill some time
Looking like I'm in a daze
But it ain't no purple haze

I ain't stoned on what you think
Just an afternoon sun that's starting to sink
I ain't drunk on nothing you can buy
Just a kiss from a woman and a look in her eye
What I'm on you don't need much
It's a little goes a long way kinda stuff
Yeah, I'm breathing, yeah, I'm feeling alright
I'm high on life

Gettin' buzzed by this bumble bee flying around
My day in the sun is my night on the town
Just me waking up is me getting down
Spinning like a tilt-a-whirl
Sitting on top of the world

I never hit a homerun when the game was tied
I knew from an early age I wasn't going to be
A doctor or the CEO of anything

And I played, Fire On The Mountain
'Til I made my fingers bleed
I tried to stand out from the crowd
But most times I just struck out at the plate
So I sang

I wasn't cool enough to be a ladies man
It took me forever just to hold her hand
First time we kissed, she whispered, I love you
But I wasn't brave enough to say, I loved her too

So I sang, You Are So Beautiful To Me
And I played every note to Faithfully
I loved her with everything
But I couldn't think of anything to say
So I sang

No one believed in me as much as Mom
See, she worked overtime to buy my first guitar
When the angels called her home
My sister asked if I would speak
But there were no words to say how much she meant to me

So I sang, It Is Well With My Soul
And I played, I'm So Tired Of Being Alone

The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now

What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there is no fixing me
'Cause everybody has already tried

Would you stay?
Would you leave?
I could wait
It'll all come out eventually

If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?

What if I told you I don't plan on staying here
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family is gonna want you to stay
You know what I don't blame 'em

What I don't want to

Darius Rucker,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago

Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

His talent for reaching with a gaze
Into the future unknown
Conclusions drawn from inner haze

When nature released disease upon human race

Pestilence, the start of Armageddon

Where we'd stand

Brutality
And evil warmonger's insanity

Nostradamus envisioned Saviours of hate
To reign subservient mass
Attempting to alert us before it's too late
We witnessed the evil that passed
We watched all the wretched torment inflicted
And shook our heads with grief
And understood then what the seer predicted
Beyond our conscious belief
At war with a sick brain, Hitler was known
To render a massive injustice
Striking the hebrews a mighty deathblow

Guaranteeing his fate in the abyss
The wars, the concentration camps
Foretold, prophetic eye
When the doomsayer became entranced
He saw when our race will die

Sinister minds
Hate had then blind
To the slaughter of innocent people - insidious crime

Walking the earth
The devil's rebirth
The Fuhrer the second son, Napoleon being the first

Brought anguish and strife
Ruling the empires with a criminal sickening spite
Gaseous showers
With Hitler empowered
Innocent Jewish honor forever raped and deflowered

Decaying, the ruins fall swift to the ground
The carnage is morbid and great
Mephitic death stench of corpses abound
The earth meets an untimely fate
The horrific malignance, spreading its wings
Across the expanse of the sky
Contamination and all that it brings
The judges commit genocide

Retaliation, a useless ploy
We've gazed into the face of fear
We know that it stands for our own bitter end

The claws of denouement grasp at our lungs

My soul is set to live in disrespect
Karma's retribution life's reject
Is what I'm meant to be
An outcast from society??

A laughing stock as I walk the earth
Vindication laughs at my rebirth

Or will I be a victim of the thing
Commonly known as eternity??

Eternally black
In limbo I'm trapped
In silence I sound a plea
Light is no more
I feel not a thing
Undead, I need to break free

Listen
The silence deafens all the unheard screams
The darkness rips away all the unseen dreams

Numbness shrouds my soul I'm left to roam
Paralysis now my only home
Spiritual planes do not exist
Life in this realm I will resist

And break these bonds these chains that lock my soul
Watch my growing fire burst through the wall

I need to grasp the earthen world again
Onto the realm of humans I'll ascend

Hunger
Of the undead
Now if my soul is mine then why will you not let it be free??

When this will all end
To live in this shell makes me laugh at religious disease

There's no hell or heaven??

Light ends the dark of day
Mourning star at dusk
Brightens with our decay
Forward, just one step
Millions of miles away
Floating back in time
Titans without delay

Wellspring of youth

Drinking your sweet water
Falling like stones - so bitter our tears
Of the one and only truth
Well, you're my fountain
For some you're deep as graves
For others high as mountains

Neverending youth

Aching like Narcissus
Echo sings her song
Whispering words like ""Come with us""
Never to return
Hope, in all tears she's bathed
Bleeding hearts of pain
Nigh tend to be portrait

To enlighten his way from dusk 'til dawn
The Goddes of all stars
Dressed in her cold black dress
Her rays of light - alike a rose's thorn

Melting her eyes with fire and heat

Ere daylight's disguise her beauty conceals
Goddes of the dark, please shine on me
Let my eyes touch and let them see
What the night can reveal

Still I adore you a lot, from above

Whispers ""carpe noctem"" with a heavenly shine
To see her in a way she is not
...is to love

Under painful clay
Deep in the desert
Where no mortal's ever set foot
There she is lain
With a rose in her mouth and her hand
Into the voidness
Her sandy hair without colour, for good?

Since she's left me
So all alone in the darkness
Guardian made of stone,
Won't you answer
My prayers for her coming home
My dear, please speak to me
Beloved, answer me
Give me a sign to rely on
I know you still hear me
Even you cannot see me
On my knees, don't deny me

Lifeless womb

Her grave, a pyramidal tomb
Crying and praying
That her leaving the light was no end
Then it awoke
After hours and days
And then spoke the rose made of stone
""Who loves shall be never alone.""

I've been praying, Lord,

Since she's left me
So all alone in the darkness
Guardian made of stone
Gave me answers to
My prayers for her coming home

Sol et Nox in heavens hot they feast
Flesh and thunder and blood and lightning
By the eyes of the Gods the night is seized

Taming the horses, impossible to steer

Flaming -the passion- rides into his bane
For all who can see soon it will peer
Doomsday will be, showing the sun's wane
My world is on fire, the heat is my domain
Like suns, even brighter if I don't draw the rein
In fervour I shall sear to swallow all the pain
Souls unite in tears, forever there to reign

Dark Funeral,"[Sodom cover]

Honour the fallen heroes
See their last resting place
Perished in the battle of nations
Where they found eternal peace
Do you know the use of their decorations?
Awarded for patriotism
They left their life in fire
But don't know even why

Remember the fallen
Remember the fallen

To the command of despotic dictators
They marched to fight in a senseless war
Most of them were just puppets and children
The battle was lost before it began

Brotherly in heart and hand
Know that they never come back
With combined effort
And the believe in god
Their duty only as cannon fodder
Kamikaze as living bombs
Driven into the open knife
Deceitful and malicious

Remember the fallen
Remember the fallen

Their tormented souls will never rest
To pay us back for their innocent death
No quarter shed our proud blood
Retaliation on the warpath

And I'm horny, I'm horny, horny

I jump in the mosh pit, but I'm alone
Between four trees I get it on
My brain is hemorrhaging, it's them or me
It ain't easy knocking over a tree (i pass out)
I wake up the room is padded
It would appear I've had it
But hold up
Close rip, wrap them around my neck
And choke myself to death, no breath
Now I'm out, I'm strapped down
Wait, I can still move my head around
I got about four inches between the back of my head
And the metal gurney bed
Boom!
Slamming it, retractions
Boom!
I feel the back of my skull is cracking
Boom!
A broken bone is piercing my brain
And oh, I just hammered it in

Ahhhhh
Ahh I hurt myself
God I hurt myself
Stop me
Pain, pain
Stop me

I'm sitting in the dark, talking to myself
Why does everybody tell me that I need help?
I'm in love with pain
I take a needle or a knife
And drive that mother fucker through my windpipe
Just might
Take a razor blade
Dip it in some gas
See if I can take a little skin of the calf
Grotesque I'm a walking body bag
And when it all heals I'll pick the scabs

Alone in the casket, buried in the earth
Self-inflicted wounds, blood stains on my t-shirt
Kick out the door till my legs fall off
Try to use my head my skulls to soft
The pain overwhelms shooting through my kidneys
Blood rushes out when I stick a shank in me
Keep stabbing and sticking
And pulling all the blood spitting
And I cut off the oxygen
And take my own life again

[Chorus]
Why, tell me why
Do you hurt yourself, when you know I love you
Ah stop me!
Why, tell me why
Do you hurt yourself, when you know I love you
Ah stop me!

Do you wanna die? do you need my help?
Is it self mutilation that you're bringing on yourself
Went through the same situation 1 year ago
I guess that explains all the scars on my throat
Why you still breathing, are you still alive?
Escaping from the demons that you had locked inside
You death suicidal than come an play my game
One gun, one bullet if you're it no pain

A layer up skin ohhh, I pull it back
And smooth it back down with some simple smack (ouch)
Wednesday nights I got kicked off my bowling league
Just cause I show up bite a bowling ball and leave
Yea go ahead curse me you faggots
So I throw my legs onto moving cars, you got your habits
I don't consider it hurting myself, it brings me joy
Now shut the fuck up here
Batter up uhhhhahhh!!

Cut and slice away with a steak knife
Hit myself in the ankle with a pvc pipe
Exacto blade underneath the fingernail
Bleed and make another cut, fucking might as well
Tablespoon of Morton's salt pour it on the wound
If it don't burn you don't know what you doing
If you fail just return to start
Self defecation is a beautiful art

I'm all in the dark now
So dance with dead I can't do shit
I'm fallin' apart now
Been rottin' away in the grave since '96
I hope I'm not forgotten
Even though my body's gone
And when I'm on the bottom
Bury me with a Lotus cross
Don't nobody love me
Don't no one know the way that I feel
I'm feeling so ugly
And so I keep my casket sealed
My sprit lingers like a ghost
On the so called Earth
I'm underground, I'm a monster
Who lives in the dirt


[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Understand, certain motherfuckers jump to life
When certain concotions dumped down their windpipe
In the stomach, through the blood
And up to the dome piece
Pass out, wake up
Snappin' all necks within arms reach
I need another fixin', Southwest Delray
Green glowin' toxic bourbon
Lord have mer-say-a (Mercy)
Having to be an addict
In my nugget but I love it
And I can't seem to get enough of this shit
So fuck it

Corrosion keeps creepin'
Don't let it wash you away
Scratching on the surface
Hopin' that them scars will fade
It's like I'm being eaten from the inside
And don't know why
I keep fogettin' what I'm doin'
Am I still alive?
Will I breath again?
And if I do
I'll take a breath and hold it in
Grab on tight to what I have
The chase away this life of sin
All I know is what you see
And I all do is what you get
And now I'm here affecting all that's in the range of my Lotus stick

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I come in blood eternally
The disease spreads within me
My organs turn to particles
And break down rapidly
I'm ond and grey busted and I'm startin' to decay
The new models automatic
I'm obsolete and outta date
I held six shots in one round
Enough to lay somebody down
But I'm stuck in a park
Floatin' away and waitin' to be found
My piece is breakin' away like carbine barrels
And wooden handles
What once was a gat
Is now a single round of ammo

My teeth are fucking brittle
They're soft and they hurt
I ripped my fucking penis off my nut bag
When it wouldn't work
And I be on corrosion
The mould it grows and
I try to keep my brain on ice
Crystal frozen
I'm walking up the street with a baby goat on a leash
I'm about to throw it off the over pass
One for the beast
Anything to stop the rotten erosion
Of who I am
I should motherfucking eat a fucking bullet
DO IT MAN!
Fuck that damn

[Jamie Madrox]
Broken like glass I corrode with the mode
And with like tree bark slowly I implode
I'm starting to lose a hold with what I like to call my very own
Sweater of a soul
So many more holes
Have been through the sewer grates
Turning in to grains of sand
Dragon to the undertone
And grown into a normal man
Skin will turn to black again
Souls will turn to black and then
Everyones around you lookin' like what's happenin'?

Dark Lotus,"It ain't no place to be, trust me
And why is that you ask
Ain't no lights at the end
There's only darkness on my path
Tortured souls fill the realm I call home
Without the Reaper's guidance
To lead them out the dead zone
It's plain and clear
Don't spend eternity here
With others like them
Who took their own life out of fear
Why couldn't they just see that everybody's got a time?
Let the Reaper do his job, man
He's doing just fine

Death don't want me, life is all that I got
Keep me living even if I'm just a head in a box
Take me outdoors, feed me
Put tits in my face
There's enough reason for me to live in any case
Send me to prison, I'll start pimpin' faggots in there
Cripple my ass, I'm floating spinners on my power chair

Known as the Juggalos, representing family
Not afraid to die, cause death is afraid of us
We're meaner then the devil
But we're someone you can trust
We're used to being shut down
And pushed out the doorway
Death doesn't want us so we're fucking here to stay

You're way to fresh for death to want you, 
with abilities and talents no one can ever come close to, 
Suppose you don't lose, 
Stay on track, 
You don't know if you don't try, 
Always remember that, 
And remember this in my eyes we’re all the same, 
You breathe, I breathe, 
We both share the name, 
Of a Juggalo respect that and cherish your pride, 
Cause we family representin' all what’s alive,

Hold up now and think about this shit, 
Why the fuck death wanna pay you a visit, 
I been waitin' 30 years and nothin', 
So what makes you think you so special motha fucka, 
I been knockin' on his forehead, 
And peep this, 
All that bitch did was bring me a gang of kids, 
Maybe more people for later times, 
But for now I know he don't wanna fuck with me and mines, 

If I contemplated dying, 
Then really I would be lying, 
And trying to get to heaven is really another question, 
I'm guessing another lesson, 
And living ain't really needed, 
But since I been getting weeded, 
Defeated has been deleted, 
I seen it but don't believe it, 
My eyes just run and hide, 
And at the same time they collide with the other side, 
Bleeds pride and courage until the day that I die, 
Now put your lotus in the motha fuckin' sky

Death don't want you but the Lotus do 
So bring the wicked shit, we gonna bring it too 
We like ""Hey"" (Lotus up)

Look into my mind, tell me what you see, what you find
Can somebody tell me what's happening this time?
I don't know
I break it down again, losing control
With these demons inside still pulling at my soul
Still reaching for my coat, I choke and black out
Without a lung to pump anymore oxygen out
Am I doomed on the Earth with these ??? symptoms
Cause your church won't grant the dead an exorcism

[Violent J]
Let me get two turntables and a microphone
Black rain, bloody murder means spike your dome
Why, I, don't know why
Pressure released from my head when you die
(Ali Baba)
Empty pill bottles on the shelf
Got this hunger and a sexual drive to end your health
Fucking aches (ouch)
You gotta die, I'm sorry but you gotta die

[Chorus]
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump off, damn
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again

[Madrox]
Fall in through emotion and passing through memories
Descending into dark with my hands in front of me
Waving and screaming, falling like a way through Hell
What's at the bottom? I don't know
But I'll find out when I get there
Hands grabbing at me, but I'm dodging them all
Slicing each and every wrist with my hatchet as I fall
And if I reach the bottom with my life intact
I'm a climb right to the top and go right back and do it again

[Monoxide]
If you can see what I was thinking then no one would have to die
It would be as simple as looking inside of my mind
And through time all the pressure has come to a head
And I release it on the innocent and leave 'em for dead
Could be a chemical imbalance where I blame it on this challenege
And remarks, so I waited in the dark where his car was parked
A couple whacks with the axe to his back
And he was down, and then I hit the ground
Somebody catch me

[Chorus]
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump off, damn
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again

[Shaggy]
If you listen too close you might lose your mind
If you look too close your head could explode like mind bomb (boom)
Did Blaze really get shot the fuck down? (Still bleeding)
Did Twiztid really sell they soul to the underground? (What?)
After the 6th, will ICP kill theyself? (fuck off)
Is ABK a real warrior or something else?
I don't know and I don't care
Just remember me with my fucking Lotus in the air (Lotus)

[ABK]
Keep talking mother fucker, do it again, don't push me
You fuckin with a old school cat that ain't friendly
So take it to that level, go ahead keep pulling my chain
Cause when I get upset I get strange
You have no clue
Check this out, I be fiending from mood swings
Ready to throw down and knock the shit out of soft range
Hard list, ready to live out whatever
So if you're in my path, we better best be walking together

Dark Lotus,"We would like to invite you on a journey
A tale of an instrument of death
Watch us as we pass the axe.

I took the axe off the shelf in the tool shed
It's telling me I gotta fuckin' bloody the misled
My victim approached
Cut her head off at the throat
She was a hooker with AIDS
Spreading disease like it was dope
Cut the head off her pimp
Before he started to trash talk
Two bodies in my trunk and police on a manhunt
I'm on the noose again
They chasing me for blocks
Seen a homie on the street
So I passed the axe to Madrox

I took the axe
What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?
It's all bloody
And it looks like its been in and out of someone's back
Gristle on the handle, blood dripping down the neck
So I grabbed that bitch like back
Who want to get half fed up by the half with
Who got a gang of problems
And don't give half a shit, bitch
You can fall victim to the double headed fury
Don't be scared, be worried, man.

Pass me something sharp and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back (I'll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back.(I'll hack you)

I took the axe back to the shed where I stay
Cleaned off the blood and then sharpened up the blade
Waited ‘til dark and then ran through the hood
And chopped up drunk bums like they're blocks of wood
I can't see myself stopping, if I do then I'm dead
And the only way I'm dying is if I sever my own head
Grip on the tip, so my nub won't slip
And I'm about to fuckin' pass it to the hands of 2 Dope bitch

I took the axe and swung it through like butter
When I cut ya back you better run, duck, and cover.
You know your jugular well, it's gone
I blacked out last night, realized in the morning
Gotta dig another hole in the backyard
Run get me a shovel, it ain't that hard
Understand I got a hairpin trigger wrist
When I squeeze it off, haha, you get the gist.

Pass me something sharp and wicked (Pass it over here)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked (Pass it over here)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)

I took the axe
Perhaps I had a relapse
I seen a pretty pretty neck
And I couldn't relax
I cut through it
I throw knives with precision
But it's nothing like the feeling
Of committing the incision
Flip it over, a radio programmer
Pound his head into a bloody pizza
With a hammer
Threw it into the sky and let it stick in my back
And passed out at Monoxide's front porch like that.

I took the axe and lost my fucking mind
On this cop who pulled up behind me
I handcuffed him on the side of the street
And started smacking em with it like I was making a beat
Oh God!
Another cop pulled up
So I grabbed the same axe and planted it in his forehead
Two more dead, bloody and dismembered
Now it's back in the shed and that's all I remember.

Pass me something sharp and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked (I'll throw it right back to you)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)

The axe that split so many backs
Its back to the tool shed to relax
Peep that
So many failed with no tale to tell.
And it's only remembered by the stain that they left
On the axe",Pass the Ax,2004

Dark Lotus,"During each cycle of life on this very planet 
You have a beginning, and you have an ending 
As each cycle occurs 
The souls living are forced to make a decision 
They must choose to live life 
Following either the stoic path of the devoutness of worship, that many believe eventually leads to an afterlife of eternal bliss. 
Or they may choose to live life following the obuliant path, of hedonism and non belief. 
Which many believe leads only to eternal damn nation. 
In this day and age, the time of choice is strongly upon us. 
A Lotus of the night. 
A simple Dark Lotus has emerged from sacred soil. 
From this unfolds the single truth.

Can a little true heart really pay the rent?
No

It'll drive you farther down.

But, boy, we broke some hearts

Creepin' home before it got too light

And blamed it on the wine

Never found a compromise

Are slowly wearin' thin

It's late September and

I know I keep you amused,

Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band

""Did you come? Would you lie?
Why'd you leave us 'till we're only good for...

Waiting for you""
All my sins...
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming

I dream of Michelangelo when I'm lying in my bed
Little angels hang above my head and read me like an open book
Suck my blood break my nerve offer me their arms
Well, I will not be an enemy of anything
I'll only stand here

Waiting for you
All my sins...
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming

Dark One Lite,"Albert's always sincere; he's a sensitive type
His intentions are clear -- he wanna be well liked
Well, if everything is nothing, then are we anything?
Is it better to be better than to be anything?

And Albert's visions blooming uncontrolled
All his wings are slowly sinking

The world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here
All the king's men reappear
For an eggman, fallen off the wall
He'll never be together again

Einstein's down on the beach standing in the sand
'Cause everything he believes in is shattered
What you fear in the night in the day comes to call anyway
And we all get burned as one more sun comes sliding down the sky
One more shadow leans against the wall

And the world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here
And all the king's men reappear
For an eggman, fallen off the wall
He'll never be together again

Albert's waiting in the sun
On a field American
For the cause of some inflated form of hit and run and...
Yeah-e-yeah

One more sun comes sliding down the sky
One more shadow leans against the wall

And the world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here
And all the king's men reappear
For an eggman, fallen off the wall
He'll never be together again

Albert's fallen on the sun
Cracked his head wide open

The world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here

Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin'
Now the days go by so fast

And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven I wish you would

The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
All at once you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl

And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California I think you should

Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her

And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself
To hold on to these moments as they pass

And it's one more day up in the canyon
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean I guess I should

Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
She dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful
I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning 
Cut Maria! Show me some of them Spanish dances
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
I want to be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales

""She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""
Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

I will paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray 
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful
Grey is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.
Uh, I don't think so. She's looking at me.""
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely

I want to be a lion
Everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars, but we got different reasons for that Believe 
in me because I don't believe in anything
and I want to be someone to believe

Yeah we star at the beautiful women

When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me

Been hurt in some kind of love affair?
And how many times did you swear
That you'd never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights?
How many lies, how many fights?
And why would you want to
Put yourself through all of that again?
Love is pain I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way of
Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?
Why don't we turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
I'm starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero boss
The river's wide we'll swim across
We're starting up a brand new day
It could happen to you,
Just like it happened to me,
There is simply no immunity
There's no guarantee.
I say love is such a force if you should find yourself in it
You need some time for reflection
You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero Mac
I'm begging her to take me back

Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world

You're the sum of my equation

If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
And go up instead of down

I finally woke up
Everything is better
A chance for me to open up and grow

And from worrying 'bout this wasted time

Ooh, and the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me before you went out on your own
Sometimes to keep it together, we got to leave it alone

And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time

Dark Tranquillity,"""Let me die"", I cried as the curtain fell
and I stared in woe at the world before me
My weeping eyes could not bear to tell
or the shattered kingdom in ruins before me

What became of the lands that were?
A pearl in the nest of memories
Forever gone...departed by the minds of man

Scavengers, feeding on your mother's blood
Parasites of life, with my heart I condemn
your ignorant ways

Like the leaves of the high trees
I wither and fall,
Borne by autumnal winds
to my funeral hall

I'm all alone in the grip of the silent sadness

I have been told to honour life
and what therein I'll find
but if all I see is darkness,
let me die and wake up blind
As the gleaming blade before me,
singing lullabies of loss
Whispering ""Death is your redeemer
to the Paradise you've lost""

Mankind, evoker of inferno
Let me burn your honoured Crown of Creation
and dethrone you to ashes for aeons to come

Why should I stay here where I do not belong?
Of weakness burns my within...And empty shell

I've lost the way to the sanctity I need

I'll greet the dawn that brings no life,
no frail beams of sun to cleanse the black night
My mournful roam has ended

I hide in the shadows white binding my time,
sheltered from this world which disorderly rhyme
with the fury of damnation

Once I held in my hand the starlight of Eden
and the white sky lay open in a soul that was free
(But the years flew so fast as the shadows were cast
and I woke up one morning with no reason to be)

I'm all alone in the shade of the nameless
Sorrow
I'm all alone within a shadowfire of fear

Take me home to whence I came
Where I'll find light to feed my flame of life

Or my heart will die without a whisper of hope...",Alone,1993
Dark Tranquillity,"As false as our minds our eyes refuse to see
They claw for the falseness in me
From where all life springs anew
We are cleansed through the crystal fire

Fill me with sound, fill me with hatred
Let my blood bring life to the soil
The soil beneath my feet

Messenger of pain, sailing silence
Commander of my sorrow, riding rage
This is my garden, leave me be

Infinity is eternal
Never born so it may never die
The colours speak my name
Through the crowns I am baptised in the
First gnawing rays from a blackened sun
In the name of my blood I curse thee
Shelter me under the trees
Spread your twilight wings for me

My broken body is dripping with sin

Your skin so delicate in taste
Your undemanding bliss will carry me far

I bid farewell to this godforsaken land
Nevermore shall I return
I join with the riders on the horizon
For they are my blood
For they are my saviours
They bring me hatred, bring me fire
They take me down to the land I know not
They crush me, take me down
Then they build me once more again

Dark Tranquillity,"A bolt of blazing gold,
Lifted from the horizon's edge
Another radiant dawn sends new hope,
Avowed my hearty pledge

My yearning to be part
Of nature's truthful solitude
Of wisdom's inner light
That shines in mystic multitude

The guiding source within,
So few of us will ever know
And few will ever climb
The great world-tree from which we've grown

But those who seek will find
The rhythm that vibrates high and far
And rearrange the cosmic threads,
The pattern of the Weave of Stars

A bolt of blazing gold,
A sunfire in zenith hurled
Oh, wingless skydancer,
Rejoiced upon the warmth unfurled

What wonders do you hold ensnared
With your mighty heart?
What secrets may be mine
To brother-share as we depart?

Of richest emerald forged,
My soul still rises, longingly
From inferno's winding caverns,
Through dark air soaring, restlessly

If silence was enough!
No words can grasp my starkest thoughts
No language known to man
Portrays my naked sentiment

A bolt of blazing gold,
Swallowed by the waveless sea
The ocean-winds set sail,
In breeze towards their destiny

On solarbeams they rode,
White sea-gull-wings in harmony
For a moment's startling glimpse
A sienna-burnt tranquility

Oh father of the coloured sky,
Unwear thy robe of shadowhood
Let nature's soul once clash again
'Neath blooming glades of goldenwood

We're the ones who seek
To dance to fallen serenades
The magic hymns of gold;
As softly sung, the sunlight fades away

Of richest emerald forged,
My soul still rises, longingly
From inferno's winding caverns,
Through dark air soaring, restlessly

If silence was enough!
No words can grasp my starkest thoughts
No language known to man
Portrays my naked sentiment

A world of silent stone,
As frozen in the nightly sky
In heaven's dark recesses laid,
No living soul draws night

For seconds all is still,
No moonlight heaves throughout the dark
Nor do the heavens breathe,
No dryads wreathe within the dark

Within my dark domain",A Bolt of Blazing Gold,1993
Dark Tranquillity,"Force of anger, Mordant senseless wrath

Take your steady pride
In monotony and beat

Invade me

This broken spirit, blind at heart

Bite down hard on frustration
The siege that can't be broken
This hollow flame of fear

So close without connection
Locked inside the sphere
I take the blame upon me
And scream at what I see

I'm blind at heart
So blind at heart

Dark Tranquillity,"Dreamed up a new word today
In my ignorance I gave it meaning
Who was I to know

To say it is to know it
To hear it is to believe

I dreamed the world would end
I was not wrong
To doubt, to discredit
The other words I've heard before
From inside a shell pretending

It's all you've shown your faith
And what you've always known
So lay your trust in the unthinkable
It's time to justify your lesser faith

It's all your faith has shown
And all you'll ever know
Why do you matter, you're insignificant
How can you justify your lesser faith?

To know it is to fear it
To feel it is to say no

At our atmospheric skies

If I had horns
Would there be flames to shy my smile?

From the masses in the streets
Praising the last of days

Bring me the night
In the fires that never end
The dawn will never come

Charging at us from unearthly distance
I challenge the universe

As mankind weaves its silent end
Can there be no forgiveness?
I curse the heaven above me
As the light sinks through
My outstretched fingers

Fading in my open arms

Make each tear in my bare hands

Where is your heart?
Lost souls embracing the dark.

Judgment and condemnation,
Setting wars between the nations,
Death reigns in Your name,
How can I believe this is how it should be?

How can You let them control,
What they refuse to uphold,
You claim to conquer the dead,
But it’s the living that I dread.
I am a victim of Your purging,
You sent Your sheep to bury me.

Chorus

As the sickness sinks in,
Where is Your plan?",Deceiver,2016
Darkness Divided,"I lived under the tree of life,
Feeding off whatever is left,
After the kings have feast,
Ignoring my every need.
The first will be the last,
But this strain will break my back,
 The strings I pull are getting shorter,
And the flame is getting warmer.

What if You’re nothing,
And I’ve been deceived by trusting,

Chorus:
Show me to believe,
Because life will claim,
All that I’ve ever known.

Everyday I’ve raised the sword,
To separate everything you left ignored.
With the words in my hand,
And the faith in my heart,
I’ve seen the sword rip existence apart.
Judgment burns you left and right,
Don’t you dare cross to my side,
Rumors cripple the image,
You create, 

Chorus

What if You’re nothing,
And I’ve been deceived by trusting,

But what if I’m wrong?
I can’t conceive a world without You in it,
I can’t believe there was a time,
That You did not exist to me,
As my spine bends back,
And I’m about to break,
There You stand with my feet misplaced.

Chorus",Deliverance,2016
Darkness Divided,"Break down the abode,
And with the flames let my name go,
Deteriorate what I’ve lived with,
The ground is all that is left to believe in,
Tremors shake and collapse my home,
An earthquake from a burning dome,
The core of my existence,
Engulfs everything I’ve built on it,
Is this the end of it all?

Chorus:
If this is temporary,
Will You show me what lasts,
From ashes I cry out,
Is this the end of it all?

Creeping lies and ill promise,
Crumble the world upon us,
Deceiving nature drives the herd,
Misunderstanding the word,
False lies and unjust doctrine,
Prosperity forgotten.

Flames burn all that I know,
Is this the end of it all?

Chorus

Hold fast to what is left,
The only thing I hold close,
Life fades away,
Life fades to grey,

Chorus",The End of It All,2016
Darkness Divided,"Gaps filled with trusting,
A mind with no holes,
A heart engulfing,
The depths of my soul,
I searched the world that gave me no gifts,
I walked to the very end of my bliss,

And even vacancy denies my name,
My name,
And decency begins to fade away,
Away

Chorus:
Every essence of my being,
Leaves me questioning,
Who I’m meant to be,
Who I’m meant to be.

Corrupted society,
Breeding false propriety,
Popularity breeds promiscuity,
I can’t buy back ignorance that I lack.

And even vacancy denies my name,
My name,
And decency begins to fade away,
Away

Chorus

Teach me to be a man,
Who doesn’t need to understand,
Every fabric of my being,
Is this what it’s like,
To end uncertainty,
Is this how it feels?
Chorus",From Dust to Stone,2016
Darkness Divided,"I’ve been walking the line,
Following a life that binds,
You taught me freedom comes,
When you release conviction,
Commands to live a life,
Never learning what’s inside,
I’ve been saved by birthright.

Chorus:
Quit pretending,
To understand me,
Doubt has consumed me,
I can’t escape it.

I’ve been walking the line,
Following a life that binds,
You taught me freedom comes,
When you release conviction,
Commands to live a life,
Never learning what’s inside,
I’ve been saved by birthright.

Chorus

I am starting to question why,
They say believe just because they know it’s right,
Pick up your head and don’t bother asking why,
I will not be convinced this time.
Give me a chance to question what is right,
Will blind obedience accommodate,
A soul that never knew the gates?
I’ve been saved by birthright. 

Chorus",A Life That Binds,2016
Darkness Divided,"As my blood drips from my heavy heart,
I yearn for that second start.
The seasons are unchanging,
How can it be?

Chorus:
Now I cannot see,
Cannot feel anything, anymore,
Now I’ve lost it all.
Oh how can it be?
How can I see anything, anymore,
At the end of it all?

Please forgive my undiscerning,
Questioning my yearning,
I was the transgressor,
Please hold me together,

Chorus",Mirror of Death,2016
Darkness Divided,"I've seen things, 
I thought I could only dream,
I've read the book, 
But I'm surrounded by misery. 
Imperfect, yet inspired, 
Life in the cracks, 
Contradicting humanity. 

I can't comprehend, 
This twisted reality, 
There has to be,
Substance in inconsistency, 
Weaving time and reality, 
Is faith the only thing holding up my belief? 
In the darkness my eyes show me,
There is so much more that I can't see,
How defined can I be?
My fate is dependence fueled by needs,

Who will you help? 
When the whole world bleeds,
How will you help?
When your whole world bleeds.

Oh Misery, why have you left me questioning, 
My existence, 
Father will You come and show us,
How to live again?

My lack of vitality,
Affirms my humanity,
I boast not of my sufficiency, 
But to demand of Your authority, 

Is this the point for everything that I'm feeling,
Is compassion supposed to drive my yearning? 
The love You put on my heart,
Wasn't just mine from the start,
We were cut from the vine,
Pruned to be Your congregation.

How to repay,
The agony the laceration,
That cured my Misery.

Where will I go,
When there’s no hope at all,
And I am numb to breathing?

I look around at the world,
Conflicted by what I see,
Everything I lived for,
Is failing to birth growth,
Spinning to death,
I see him wait,
With his scythe at his side,
Spinning to death,
Relief will rise at it kills me,

Da se skrije od sebe jer nema sa kim

U daljini prolazi brod cruiser na kojem kao da se
Priprema bal. Na kojem kao da se priprema bal

Ajmo veceras uzet barku od tvog starog i krenuti
Na vesla kroz trag mjesecine prema velikom brodu

Ti si ponjela nakit od tvoje bake

Veze sidro za brod i umijesamo se u gomilu

Draga? Aha
Popnemo se na podij pjesma pocinje i frajer sa
Sombrerom pjeva

Yo se que la vida es sueno
El sueno es querer
El sueno es morir
Por eso quiero saber

Por que me duele tanto
Que stastan lejos
Lejos de mi alma, de mi cuerpo
De mi corazon

Si estarias a mi lado
Navegariamos tratranquilos por los suenos
Mientras la luna en nuestra laguna
No para de reir

A ja stojim i gledam te kako postojis
I ti stojis i gledas me kako postojim
I ti stojis i gledas se kako postojis
A ja stojim i gledam te kako postojis

[Verse 1]
I'm writing you this letter just to let you know
even though through out the years my feeling never showed
You were just a little girl when I fought for mi clicka
I remember times I had no peace of mind
You see I had to hussle cause I couldn't find work
I didn't know that when I left that your feeling were hurt
daddy please don't go the streets are bad
how could I explain that I had to be a man
risking all my vida every hour of the day
I always cruise around looking every single way
just to take you to the park I always said tomorrow but I said that every day
then I'll kick it in the barrio mija understand daddy only wants the best
the day you were born I knew that I was blessed
Now I'm ready to change
I know it the only way
let me wipe your tears cause your daddy's here to stay

[Chorus]
I got something that I want to say
daddy's home and I'm here to stay
No need to cry cause I'm not going away
(I love you daddy) daddy's home and I'm here to stay

[Verse 2]
It's the rage of my god please don't take me away
I want to be with my family but I killed a man yesterday
You saw 'em coming up and your face showed fear
don't take away my daddy and I couldn't wipe your tear
They shoved me in the car mija please don't cry
they were taking away your daddy and you didn't know why
let me go I'm a man and I wana be free
found me guilty so they sent me to the crazy penitentiary
Now I never see you cause you hardly ever visit
You had your quincianera and I missed it
to many long years and I couldn't see you grow
You're the only one I love but you didn't even know
I looked through my letters
to make me feel better
I could tell your little tears dried up on the letter
I miss you daddy cause now I'm grown
times are getting hard when your daddy's never home

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry little mija that I chose this route
I didn't realized what this life is all about
I waited for this moment for so long
I don't know how I lasted feeling strong
Now I'm standing by your side and I'm here to stay
I'm never gona let anyone take you away
Forget what I did
'cause I was never there
'cause you just got to know that I'll always care
I missed it all your first day at school
Every single birthday man I played a fool
How could I have been so blind
The love I was looking for was their all the time
I see your face and you cry I felt the swelling in my chest run deep inside
Querida your my angel the girl of my dream
Even though in the past I did some crazy things finally daddy's here
To wipe your tears away put your head on my shoulder cause daddy's here to stay

May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white

The orange and palm trees sway
There's never been such a day in whole L.A.
But it's December the twenty-fourth
And I am longing to be up north
So I can have my very own white Christmas

In the production of this album and in my endeavor and desire 
To bring something new and different to the music of Christmas 
And to the recording industry which is so much a part of my life

Of Christmas through the music that I love

And on behalf of all of them, The Crystals, The Ronettes

Darlene Love,"I got chills.
They're multiplyin'.
And I'm losin' control.
Cause the power
You're suplyin',
It's electrifyin'!

You better shape up,
'cause I need a man
And my heart is set on you.
You better shape up;
You better understand
To my heart I must be true.

Nothin' left, nothin' left for me to do.

You're the one that I want.
(you are the one I want), o,o, oo, honey.
The one that I want.
(you are the one I want), o,o,oo, honey.
The one that I want
You, o,o, oo
Are what I need.
Oh, yes indeed.

If you're filled
With affection
You're to shy to convey,
Meditate in my direction.
Feel your way.

I better shape up,
Cause you need a man
I need a man
Who can keep me satisfied.
I better shape up
If I'm gonna prove
Oh you better prove
That my faith is justified.

Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure down deep inside.

You're the one that I want.
You, o,o, oo, honey.
The one that I want.
You, o,o,oo, honey.

You, oo, oo
Are what I need.

Darlene Love,"Everyone that I can see is gettin' right in tow 
Changin' songs to be on the radio 
Now there are things that I believe in 
I'd never sell my soul 
It always feels so good to hear good music
I need good music--Good good music 
It always feels so good to hear good music
How can I get back to you when I'm so far from home 
In any port or foreign shore-alone 
So many ways to be betrayed believe me when I say 
I think that I would die without good music
I need good music--Good good music 
It always feels so good to hear good music 
I know that I would die without good music
I need good music--Good good music 
It always feels so good to hear good music 
I know that I would die without good music
And even though you might think it's funny 
I couldn't care if there ain't no money 
I'm a little mixed up 
But I'll be alright 
If I can hear a loud guitar all night 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I need good music--Good good music 
It always feels so good to hear good music 
It always feels so good to hear good music

And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter baby, as it grows

Wrapped in swaddling clothes, the prince of peace
The wheels start turning, torches start burning
And the whole wise men journey from the east

How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight

A shepherd on the hillside, went over my flock I bide
On a cold winter night, a band of Angels sing
In a dream I heard a voice say, ""Fear not, come rejoice
It's the end of the beginning, praise the new born King""

How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight

I saw it with my own eyes, written up in the skies
Why a simple herdsmen such as I
And then it came to pass, he was born at last
Right below the star that shines on high

Something inside
Starts to burn deep
And my heart's filled with fire  ??
Could it be that I'm very sentimental
Or is this just the way love's supposed to be?
