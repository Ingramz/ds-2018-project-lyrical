New York Unit,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,1995
New York Voices,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad

The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1989

New York Voices,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Why is this song so sad?

Loving the love I love

Stories my poor head has told me cannot stand the cold
And in between what might have been and what has come to pass
A misbegotten guess alas and bits of broken glass

And seal your fate forever
Our best years have past us by
The golden age of leather

This was the night not long to come in the year of our Lord A.D.
Where in a desert way-house, poised on the brink of eternity
Four and ninety studded horsemen closed the knot of honor
As only drunken soldiers can

And passed from man to man, a wanton child to dead to care
That each would find his pleasure as he might
For this fantastic night was billed as nothing less than the end of
An age
A last crusade, a final outrage, in this day of flaccid plumage

And there was worn no cloth but leather
Made supple by years of stinging cinders
And here were seen the scars of age
For age had been the common call for one last night together

Down colored the sky (the ritual feast)
Some had died (they were buried with their bikes)
Each grabbed a rag (from a man with a sack)
Torn strips of color (the red and the black)

We made a vow to give it all we had to give
We made a vow to die as we had lived

They flew the colors, they began to fight
They flailed at each other like bugs at a light
Bodies and bikes beyond repair
Smell of oil and gas in the air

Then the wind whipped the desert with a giant hand
And the humans and the Harleys caught the shifting sand
And the old ranger weathered the storm
And he topped the rise by the middle of morn
He saw rippled dunes, calm and surreal
And a glint of a shaft of chromium steel

Like a Burger King with a sack of Big Macs

You gotta boogie to your best ability
You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down

Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Chilly be
And I'm a surefire, full blooded bonafide house rockin' Jam-On Production MC
If you want the best, put me to the test, and I'm sure you'll soon agree
That I got no force 'cause I'm down by law when it comes to rockin' viciously, you see
'Cause when I was a little baby boy my mama gave me a brand new toy
Two turntables with a mic, and I learned to rock like Dolymite
Time went by, on this God creation, I knew someday I would rock the nation
So I made up my mind just what to do and I joined with the Jam On Production Crew
So go crazy, go crazy, don't let your body be lazy
I said don't stop the body rock till your eyesight starts to get hazy
'Till the sure-shot beat chills you to the bone 'cause Chilly B is on the microphone
'Till your mind is floatin like you're in a dream and you feel so good that you gotta scream
(Jam on it) jam on it, jam on an n on an on on an on
'Cause the beat don't stop 'till everybody's gone an that doesn't happen 'till the break of dawn
Clean out your ears and you open your eye, if you want to hear the music just come alive
If you don't know how get ready to learn
'Cause Cozmo's takin' his turn to burn

Take the see and O and the Z
Then they add M-O and the freaky D
Add a funky beat, and then what do you see
It's Cozmo D, yeah, baby, that's me
I've got the beat that's, oh, so sweet
Without me rockin' it's incomplete
So rock this, y'all, rock that, y'all
Rock on and don't you dare stop
You rock this, rock that, and that's a fact
'Cause the Jam On Crew will rock your body right back
Rock a steam locomo ride off the track
And give the whole wide world a funk attack
A to the beat y'all, get down
Let me rock it to the rhythm of the funk sound
From hill to hill, from sea to sea
A when Jam On's rockin' everybody screams
(Jam on it) jam on it, jam on and on, on and on it
And if you're feelin' like you want to dance all night
They go on ahead and flaunt it
'Cause jammin' on is what we do best
It's what separates us from the rest
And if you go deep, I'll cruise down for real
Let me tell what happened to the man of steel

(Said Superman had come to town to see who he could rock)
(He blew away every crew he faced until he reached the block)
(His speakers were three stories high with woofers made of steel)
(And when we boys sit outside, he said I boom for real)
He said, I'm faster than a speedin' bullet when I'm on the set
I don't need no fans to cool my amps, I just use my super breath
I could fly three times around the world without missin' a beat
I socialize with X-ray eyes, and ladies think it's sweet
(And then he turned his power on and the ground began to move)
(And all the buildings for miles around were swayin' to the groove)
(And just when he had fooled the crowd and swore he wouldn't fight)
We rocked this bet with a 12 inch cut called Disco Kryptonite
Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, you rock so naturally
I said now that you've learned to deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real
I'm Cozmo D from outer space, I came to rock the human race
I do it right 'cause I can't do it wrong
That's why the whole world is singin' this song

(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
As days turn to night and night turns to day
Whatever time it is I want to hear you say
(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam on-on-on, jam on it
Jam all around and upside down
And keep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound

(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
I said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control
With a sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul
(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
Get outta your seat and jam to the beat
And don't you dare stop till early mornin'

Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it

You gotta boogie to your best ability
You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down
And when you're funkin' up, be sure to pass it around
Come on, let's go to work
We got what'll make your body jerk
Make you throw your hands up in the air
Shake your booty and scream, oh, yeah

We'll funk you up until you boogie down

Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Chilly be	
And I'm a surefire, full blooded bonafide house rockin' Jam-On Production MC
If you want the best, put me to the test, and I'm sure you'll soon agree
That I got no force ?cause I'm down by law when it comes to rockin' viciously, you see
?Cause when I was a little baby boy my mama gave me a brand new toy
Two turntables with a mic, and I learned to rock like Dolymite
Time went by, on this God creation, I knew someday I would rock the nation
So I made up my mind just what to do and I joined with the Jam On Production Crew
So go crazy, go crazy, don't let your body be lazy
I said don't stop the body rock till your eyesight starts to get hazy
Clean out your ears and you open your eye, if you want to hear the music just come alive
If you don't know how get ready to learn
Cause Cozmo's takin' his turn to burn

Take the see and O and the Z
Then they add M-O and the freaky D
Add a funky beat, and then what do you see
It's Cozmo D, yeah, baby, that's me
I've got the beat that's, oh, so sweet
Without me rockin' it's incomplete
So rock this, y'all, rock that, y'all
Rock on and don't you dare stop
You rock this, rock that, and that's a fact
Cause the Jam On Crew will rock your body right back
Rock a steam locomo ride off the track
And give the whole wide world a funk attack
A to the beat y'all, get down
Let me rock it to the rhythm of the funk sound
From hill to hill, from sea to sea
A when Jam On's rockin' everybody screams (Jam on it)
Jam on it
Jam on and on, on and on it
And if you're feelin' like you want to dance all night
They go on ahead and flaunt it
?Cause jammin' on is what we do best
It's what separates us from the rest
And if you go deep, I'll cruise down for real
Let me tell what happened to the man of steel

(Said Superman had come to town to see who he could rock)
(He blew away every crew he faced until he reached the block)
(His speakers were three stories high with woofers made of steel)
(And when we boys sit outside, he said ""I boom for real"")
He said, I'm faster than a speedin' bullet when I'm on the set
I don't need no fans to cool my amps, I just use my super breath
I could fly three times around the world without missin' a beat
I socialize with X-ray eyes, and ladies think it's sweet
(And then he turned his power on and the ground began to move)
(And all the buildings for miles around were swayin' to the groove)
(And just when he had fooled the crowd and swore he wouldn't fight)
We rocked this bet with a 12 inch cut called Disco Kryptonite
Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, 'You rock so naturally'
I said now that you've learned to deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real
I'm Cozmo D from outer space, I came to rock the human race
I do it right ?cause I can't do it wrong
That's why the whole world is singin' this song

(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
As days turn to night and night turns to day
Whatever time it is i want to hear you say
(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam on-on-on, jam on it
Jam all around and upside down
And keep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound

(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
I said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control
With a sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul
(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
Get outta your seat and jam to the beat
And don't you dare stop till early mornin'

Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it

(Yeah, that's how you do it Cozmo)

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday

Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Their watch of wondering love

Lookin' forward to happier times on Blue Bayou

I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou
All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou

I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Ah, that girl of mine by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Possessed by a fury that burns from inside

Cry like a child, though these years make me older
With children my time is so wastefully spent
A burden to keep, though their inner communion
Accept like a curse, an unlucky deal

Stuff this new religious phase

Wearing your faith like a new tattoo

You out of my system

First we thought you'd be rejecting us
Now we're scared you'll start infecting us

Someday soon it'll all sink in
As all your efforts to inspire us
Spread like some computer virus

You out of my system
I cannot get you, I do not want you

Always stalled by hidden fears
Always stuck in neutral gears
Until I gave the driver's seat away
Take my life and make it real

Turn the key and take the wheel
Push the throttle through the floor

She's not sure if it's worth the suffering
And she wonders, how long?

I confess my impatience, I guess I lost track of what
I'm to persevere for of the reason you put me here for

Back then it was any day now
Never dreamed we were wrong
Now we're shaking our heads
Wondering, how long?

Next life, could you kindly refrain 
From throwing yourself at the mercy of a train?

To the cries of the storm-tossed

Every whispered secret, every muffled sigh 
Every half-truth that was added to a lie

You promised you would 
Silence that evil with good 

Shame feeds guilt, guilt needs release 
You took it to god 
You made your peace 
And swore that you would 
Overcome evil with good

If they needed blood, I'd have gladly given mine 
A child of the kingdom; still an invalid 
Forgive her, please father

May this song remind you
That they don't serve breakfast in hell.

We'd end up worshipping a Christ
Of our own design 
But Jesus doesn't fit that profile
His ways aren't mine

Chorus
",Who?,2000
Newsboys,"request the honor of your presence
the tear gas has blown away
put down your crumpets and your coffee now
so unfashionably late 
little brother, little sister
underwater we go
out of our ordinary selves
stepping out
to where the people sing

woohoooooooooo
-and the people sing
-and the times are good

you say i'm acting like a beggar
i call it killing the fool
you carry more baggage
than a momma's boy
on your first day of school

let go the light of the t.v.
drop the hands
the chains that bind me
turn it all around
stop, lift you up 'n die to self
in a time when the left and the right's the same
when it's all blurred vision in a crazy haze
send out the invitations!

you say I'm acting like a beggar
i call it killing the fool
to save your life you gotta lose it
so the people sing",Woohoo,2000
Newsboys,"Up to my ears
In bitter tears.
Can't believe I've sunk this low
As I walk the plankton
Inner sanctum.
Got outta Dodge,
Sailed on a bon-less
Bon voyage.
You said North,
I headed South.
Tossed overboard.
Good Lord, that's a really large mouth

I'm sleeping with fishes here,
In the belly of the whale.
I'm highly nutritious here,
In the belly of the whale.
Bad food, lousy atmosphere.
I don't want to bellyache.
How long is this gonna take?

Woke up this morning kinda blue,
Thinking through that age-old question:
How to exit a whale's digestion?
It might behoove me to be heaved.
Head out like a human comet.
Hmmm... i wonder what rhyme with comet.

I'm sleeping with fishes here,
In the belly of the whale.
I'm highly nutritious here,
In the belly of the whale.
I'm ready to reappear.
I don't want to bellyache.
Lord, how long's this gonna take?

End times, they come rolling around.
Enzymes, they come breaking us down to the core.
The good Lord grants we all get a second chance.

I'm one of the dishes here,
In the belly of the whale.
They say I'm delicious here,
In the belly of the whale.
Lord, please make him chuck it all.
It's a gut call
In the belly of the whale.

I'm in the belly of the whale.
In the belly of the whale.
I'm in the belly.
In the belly of the whale.
I'm in the belly of the whale.
In the belly of the whale.
I'm in the belly...

In the belly of the whale
In an underwater jail
It's a tight squeeze.
It's a-gettin' to me,
But it's roomier
Than the tail.
Hey, sailor,
Got my flow free
Like a salmon to the sea
From the L.A. Symphony.
I'm a paddle boat
Paddlin' in their wake,
A fake free-styler,
But my unemployment pays.
I'm avoiding cliches
Like ""whale of a tale"" say
Or ""you can't keep
A good man down,""
'Cause you can
And I've been there, man.
But I've been expectorated.
I'm elated!
I'm free like Willie!
Happy Day!
Oops,
That's a bit of a cliche.

Newsboys,"Dull as dirt,
You can't assert
The kinda light that might persuade
A strict dictator to retire

Fire the army,
Teach the poor origami.
The truth is in,
The proof is when you hear your heart start asking

What's my motivation?
And try as you may
There is no way
To explain the kinda change

That'd make an eskimo renounce fur
That'd make a vegetarian barbeque hamster
Unless you can trace this about-face to a certain Sign

Shine.
Make'em wonder whatcha got.
Make'em wish that they were not
On the outside looking bored.

Shine.
Let it shine before all men.
Let em see good works and then
Let em glorify the lord.

Out of the shaker and onto the plate,
It isn't karma it sure ain't fate
That would make a deadhead sell his van
That would make a schizophrenic turn in his crayons

Oprah freaks
And science geeks
A rationale that shall excuse this strange behavior
when you let it Shine

You will inspire the kind of entire turnaround
That would make a bouncer take ballet
Even bouncers who are unhappy
But out of the glare

With nowhere to turn
You ain't gonna learn it on ""What's my Line?""

Shine.
Make'em wonder whatcha got.
Make'em wish that they were not

Down here in the valley
Every shadow You see
Has its own story
Down here in the valley
Every puddle of mud
Comes from tears and blood
And it's so hard just to get warm
That the chill turns into despair

Will You lift me up with tender care?
Will You wash me clean in the palm of Your hand?
Will You hold me close so I can thrive?
When You touch me, that's when I know I'm alive

Down here in the valley
Nothing's able to grow
'Cause the light's too low
Folks spend their days
Digging 'round for diamonds and gold
'Til they just get old
And they don't know anything else
They don't know they're breathing bad air
But I'm tired of living like this
And my soul cries out, ""If You're there...

Call me up to Your side
Draw me up to Your light
Let it blind me

Refine me out of my mind

Get your pager on
'Cause you know my number
I'm a wireless wonder
Got thumbs of thunder

Soul daddies in a fire wire tumble dryer
Soul mamas broke the breaker
Soul children packin' Prozac pacifiers
Get your plug-in
We all need to plug into our Maker

Who saw the heavens testify 
Now I hang back in the shadows 
I want to come close 
I want to know 
She sees me shivering here 
She smiles and with a nod 
I walk through the mud and straw 
To the newborn Son of God

Come, let us adore Him 
He has come down to this barren land 
Where we live And all I have to give Him is adoration

He raises a wrinkled hand 
Through the dust and the flies 
Wrapped in rags like we are 
And with barely open eyes 
He takes my finger And He won't let go 
And He won't let go 
It's nothing like I knew before 
And it's all I need to know

Come, let us adore Him 
He has come down to the world we live in 
And all I have to give Him Is adoration

He is my light, my strength, my song
This Cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

'Til on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave He rose again

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand

Here in the power of Christ I'll stand",In Christ Alone,2003

here's to the lover of my soul
Here's to the lover of my soul

I dunno when to walk away or stand and fight
Just when I've got it wrong, I'm sure I heard You right
And when my arguments are watertight, You expose
Every hole with a flash and a flood and I know

I hear You call in the eye of the storm
And I know you've had my back since the day I was born
Still stoking my heart still stirring my head
You're my pillar of fire, you're the wine, you're the bread

See the Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak 
Until the king took the head of this Jesus freak

Dreamed I was standing at the Pearly Gates
We're all there and I was so scared
In the presence of One so great

I felt so worried and worthy
I felt like running away
I bowed my head and I turn to go
When I heard someone say

""Father, this one's with me
Part of the family
One of the reasons I died on Calvary
Father, welcome him in
I paid the price for him
Father, oh Father, this one's with me""

I was dreaming about Heaven
When I looked up the gates were opened wide
And in the distance, I saw Jesus
Our eyes met and I began to cry

Angels robed in their beauty
Were there to show me the way
And all of Heaven singing
When I heard His voice say

""Father, this one's with me
Part of the family
One of the reasons I died on Calvary
Father, welcome him in
I paid the price for him
Father, oh Father""

Finally, we were there face to face
And He placed on me Heaven's crown
I fell down on my knees, laid my crown at His feet
Then He said to me

""Father, this one's with me

Just shuffling of soldiers' feet as they guarded the grave
One day, two days, three days had passed
Could it be that Jesus breathed His last

Could it be that His Father had forsaken Him
Turned His back on His Son, despising our sin
All Hell seemed to whisper, ""Just forget it, He's dead""
Then the Father looked down to His Son and said

Arise, My Love
Arise, My Love
The grave no longer has a hold on You
No more death's sting
No more suffering
Arise, arise, My Love

The earth trembled, and the tomb began to shake
And like lightning from Heaven, the stone was rolled away
And as dead men, the guards, they all stood there in fright
As the power of love displayed its might

Then suddenly a melody filled the air
Riding wings of wind, it was everywhere
The words all creation had been longing to hear
The sweet sound of victory, so loud and clear

NewSong,"Heaven's gates were closed
And there seemed to be no hope
For fallen man
We were prisoners of our sin
With no way to enter in
But God had a plan
The Father knew there had to be
A perfect sacrifice
So Jesus came, a cross was raised
And when He laid down His life

Wide open, wide open
They nailed His arms wide open
After three days in a cold grave
The power of sin was broken
Now with outstretched arms
He welcomes in
Everyone who trusts in Him
His nail-scarred hands hold heaven's gates wide open

For so long my eyes were closed
I couldn't see a way of hope
For someone like me
And in my despair I cried
There's got to be more to this life
Lord help me please
And the Father said
There had to be a perfect sacrifice
That's why Jesus came, a cross was raised
And He laid down His life

For every dream this world will break

Some say You're not the One

I know first hand the miracle that You've done inside my heart
I'll gladly stand and testify just who You are

Every breath I take I want my life to bring You praise

Nothing else I need to know

You heal me in my brokenness
Tell me how could I forget
The wonders of Your love

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.

The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night,2001

Tryin' to buy that last gift or two, not really in the Christmas mood
Standing right in front of me was a little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing 'round like little boys do
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes
 
His clothes were worn and old, he was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say
 
Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, daddy says there's not much time
You see she's been sick for quite a while
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight
 
He counted pennies for what seemed like years
Then the cashier said, ""son, there's not enough here""
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me
He said mama made Christmas good at our house
Though most years she just did without
Tell me Sir, what am I going to do,
Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes
 
So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out 
And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said
Mama's gonna look so great

And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight
 
I knew I'd caught a glimpse of heaven's love
As he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent that little boy
To remind me just what Christmas is all about

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995

About a lucky man who made the grade

Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Everytime I think about your love
I need it
You got me heated
I need some squeezing
You make me shiver with a touch

I would always vision your love canal
Dreaming I could reach it, oh yeah yeah

I can finally splash, I don't have ask, no

Witcha thang in a sling from the work of a skirt 
Balls turned black to blue from a tease or two 
Well one tease is a few  save your balls from the blues 

You're givin me the blues (the blues  the blues) 
Girl I got the blues (it's all because of you) 
It's all because of you (I've got em  I've got em) 
And those freaky things you do (let me tell you a story) 

As we leave the club, you know what's up 
Thinkin I'm gettin some, damn was I so dumb 
Take her to the crib.. thinkin I'm gon' live 
But you got, all these excuses, 
How you've heard about me.. and you're not ready sexually 
After you done teasin me, you want to leave 
Say it isn't true, I'm so excited by you 
Don't know what to do, you've given me the blues 
I've got em 

One of the best hoes, and SO's, at my crib spot 
Got the vessels in my testicles stopped on gridlock 
Now why you want to touch under drawers and tease Treach 
If I bust you better duck or get your whole weave wet 
Want to shoot loose the juices, the best of hooches 
Blue balls is the sewage, from shit excuses 
Now from the first face, on the first date, WHAT? 
Five dates, then we do it, still'll be the first fuck 
You want to come and touch, run and duck, you're tricky 
Take a hickie come for Moby Dick, and slip a mickie 
You came foul and phony, you left me lonely 
So when I'm stiff and boney, I go and think about Naomi 
With my hand as my homey, uhh! 

You! You've given me the blues 
Girl I've got the blues (look what you did!) 
It's all because of you 
And those freaky things you do (ohhh yeahh) 

Hahaha, yeah 
You wore panties all fancy with that sheet shit over it 
Nuts tend to lock after an hour and you NOTICE 
Female cause charlie horse in my shorts 
Nuts beggin me to leave you in the worst part of Newark 
Then I thought of a plan and you called me a pervert 
Shit, hurtin and you beefin cause I want you to jerk it? 
I wish I knew your booty call was a coochie brawl 
I woulda had a better ball at the booty bar 
Balls swole like a bowl with my dick in the dirt 
Shoulda wait til you got up and went and jumped in your purse 
See you felt below the belt, while I kiss it you hug it 
Ain't come to suck or fuck it, shit you ain't have to TOUCH IT 
My thang was cool, takin a nap on my lap 
Then you rub it til my balls catch a cramp from the back 
Smoke the tight sack, sport the nightcap, you spoke it right back 
Balls black and blue, nuts stingin like a spiked bat 
You ain't right rat! DAMN! DAMN! 

You're givin me the blues 

Girl I've got the blues (said I've got the blues)

Get your hat, get your coat 

Your purse, and get out!

(Intro) 
This is a story 
Though the names have been changed 
The facts remain the same 
On this arista track next there gonna let you know what's going on listen 
You see you always hear about a no good man 
And there's a lot of no good woman out here 
And this story right here is gonna show just what I'm talking about 
Now T Low come on 

(T Low) 
I always said I would never trip on no female 
Found myself dropping down on your hair and your nails 
I was at the mall carrying bags for instances 
I was in love so I said oh well 
Never thought about the money that I spent on you 
So into you there was nothing that I wouldn't do 
Spend mad sheets on shopping spree's 
Pulled out my visa just to please ya 
Oh oh yeah 

(Chorus) 
Ain't nobody ever put you on a list (Nobody) 
Let you know with ice all on your wrist 
How i kiss your lips and put you in the mix 
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love you 
Ain't nobody ever gonna sacrifice for you (come on) 
Put it down, the way a player do 
(I can't believe)I can't believe the shit you put me threw 
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love 

(RL) 
can't believe when you suffer the way that I did 
Even told me you were caring bout that I'm the kid 
I Worked 3 jobs even broke the law 
Never had second thoughts you know I never went wrong(No) 
9 months later a baby comes that don't even look like me 
The blood that shows its real is the sweetest baby 
I gave you everything and you cause me so much pain 
Never have a love like mine again 
Oh Oh 

(Chorus) 
Ain't nobody ever put you on a list (Put you on, put you on) 
Let you know with ice all on your wrist 
(Ice on all your wrist Oh Oh yeah) 
How i kiss you're lips and put you in the mix 
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love you(like I do) 
Ain't nobody ever gonna sacrifice for you(Sacrifice) 
Put it down, the way a player do 
(I can't believe)I can't believe the shit you put me threw 
(just can't believe Oh yes) 
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love (Break it down, break it down)

No no 
Ain't nobody gonna do what I did for you 
I'm almost caught a bid for you 
I live for you, bust my gun that's some shit for you 
On the run and I hid for you that's how you do 
You probably really think you played me too 
When the only one you played was you 
I made you boo 
Before you came I played them games 
So what I gave you things I gave you Rings 
All the clothes the boots and shit 
When all that was boosted bitch I knew you shit 
I'm not dumb I know your type wife in the day, 
Hoe at night always Right 
He told me you was sneaking hot its all good to me you died 
See you bugged, I Ain't stressed

Smell smoke smoke, heard Barry on the stereo
Then I heard you moan, hoe
Opened up my bedroom do', oh no
Saw clothes on the floor
Looked on the bed and saw you

Riding him and he was callin' you boo
He was putting it all in you

And saw it, you're kissin'

You with two other bitches
Handling the business with the quickness
Should I dismiss it, say we're finished
Or jump in it
I couldn't believe it, your face was in her cat
Should I come and bust that ass or pull out my gatt
What would you do?

(Maybe I should join in)
Crazy things happen to all of us
The ones we love get caught up in some crazy stuff
The one you trust could be somewhere, twisted love
What would you do?

Nowadays, everybody seems to be on the hush
Your best friend could be somewhere up in her
If you busted him or if you busted her
What would you do?

Gotta see you later baby, I'm a fiend for that

Next,"Yo,
Let me start off by first apologizing,
Girl you think I take you for granted,
But I'm,
I'm here to take it back

[Chorus]
Can we
Pull back a minute and make believe
that
I don't know you and you don't know me
Darling let's pretend
This old school love is brand new
Can we
Explore the places I've already been
Just
Tell me where and I'll kiss it again
Darling let's pretend
This old school love is brand new

I know I shouldn't have to ask
But it seems that I've relaxed
And I'm getting the feelings that
It's time I take it back
Remembering late night escapes
In the car callin out my name
You being scared when your friend was late
Then being cool when it finally came
Those were the days

[Chorus]

Way back when hickies were the thing
You wore bloomers, not that sexy g-string
And gettin blue balls was a daily thing
But it was alright, with me
To when that very first time went down
How you moaned when I went down
You were the one
I had no doubt
We need to get that back right now
'Cause those were the days

[Chorus]

We're still here (yah)
'Cause we conquered every feeling (every feeling)
The fire burns inside like yester year
My baby since back in the day
We knew it would be us
Holding on to that first crush
Got to say today, is what it was
So lets keep on sending, it's only beginning

[Chorus: x 2]

Back,
Like Cadillacs and hubcaps
Back,
Like leaving letters in your nap sack
Back,
like Jellies and pro cast
Back to girl,
When we first met
Back,
To when I got the glove on
Back,
To when our love was so strong
Back,
To the days I know you miss
I'll get back , I promise this
Take it back

[Chorus]",Brand New,2002

I know what you lookin' for
I can give it to you
Go on do your thing

Go on do your thing mama
Just enjoy yourself
You ain't gotta be all by yourself
Your not lookin' for a man
You want a special friend
To lend a helpin' hand tonight
Go on do your thing

Baby your sure comin' on strong
But ain't nothin' wrong
With going after what you want
How that you've been workin' all week
Now your workin' on me, feelin' on me, buying me drinks
And your tellin' me

I'm not a ho
Cause I slept with someone
So I'm not a trick
If I want a lil' dick

I'm not tryin ta judge ya

Girl the way your lookin at me
I can tell your a freak
And baby, I like what I see

With the beat bump bump, we just lay in the cut
An' it feels good to know my family's okay

Use to call women bitches
Til I met your queen
You hold your dude down

Ney Matogrosso,"Eu me sinto tolo como um viajante
Pela tua casa
Pássaro sem asa, rei da covardia
E se guardo tanto essas emoções nessa caldeira fria
É que arde o medo onde o amor ardia
Mansidão no peito trazendo o respeito
Que eu queria tanto derrubar de vez
Pra ser seu talvez, pra ser seu talvez

Mas o viajante é talvez covarde
Ou talvez seja tarde 
Pra gritar que arde no maior ardor
A paixão contida, retraída e nua
Correndo na sala ao te ver deitada
Ao te ver calada
Ao te ver cansada
Ao te ver no are

Mal começaste a conhecer a vida

Sem saber mesmo o rumo que irás tomar

Preste atenção, querida
Embora eu saiba que estás resolvida
Em cada esquina cai um pouco a tua vida
Em pouco tempo não serás mais o que és

Ouça-me bem, amor
Preste atenção, o mundo é um moinho
Vai triturar teus sonhos, tão mesquinho
Vai reduzir as ilusões a pó

Quando notares estás à beira do abismo
Abismo que cavaste com os teus pés",O Mundo é Um Moinho,2003

Are you serious, anybody out there hearing this?
Yo I came in the game as a lyricist
And I'ma leave like that, period
You sniff lines, I write lines, you've now entered in my mind
And you better get ready cause you might find
I'm from a different place and my kind
It's a little bit different than yours is
Quit snoring hip hop isn't dead
It's just been in mourning from the moment I quit recording
Quick, record this
Listen I'm warming up and you're misinformed if

But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
I look around, one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
And one of the first things I wrote was I wish I would have called
But I should just stop now, we ain't got enough room in this song
And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
Shrug it off like it ain't nothing like it’s out of my hands
Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
And I regret watching these trust issues eat me alive
And at the rate I'm going they'll probably still be there when I die

The question is, will I ever clean the walls off in time?

Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in (slept in)
And slept in
Broken legs but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion
Inside this mansion

So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
I built the safe room and I don't let no one in there
'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear and not come back
And I admit I am emotionally scared to let anyone inside
So I just leave my doors locked
You might get other doors to open up but this door's not
'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
I'm barricaded inside so stop watching
I'm not coming to the door so stop knocking, stop knocking
I'm trapped here, God keeps saying I'm not locked in
I chose this, I am lost in my own conscience
I know that shutting the wall down ain't solving the problem
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve ´em
I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's living in here
Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in
Maybe that's the problem 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since
I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious he never did
He must have picked the room and got comfortable and settled in
Now I'm in the position it's either sit here and let him win
Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
'Cause in order to do that I'd have to open the doors
Is that me or the fear talking?
I don't know anymore

Oh yeah, it's lonely

I mean over half my life
It's awesome for me to be able to put out music that people will actually hear

something that you have a passion for

If music is a disease, I promise I'm infected
I dream on different levels of dreams, Inception
And these beats are my playground, let the words play
You ain't catch it? 
That's wordplay
Now you're stuck on the word ""play""
I'm all business, no suit on, but that's okay
I will K.O. you, if you come in my work space
And don't you ever try to tell me I lack passion
I'm a stand up guy, I promise you ain't laughing
These rappers are slowing the game down, bad traffic
And how you gonna put me in a category of wack rappin'?
Listen, I'm Hulk, I transform and I smash rappers
You sipping on syrup, that doesn't mean you a sick rapper
See what it means is you gon' probably get sick after
You don't like that I'm blunt, or is it the fact that I smoke passion?

I'm no teacher, but you'll learn to adjust
I'm my own worst critic, so critics step your hate game up
I'm a different breed of artist, I know how to survive
You come into my lane, you better know how to drive
And I suggest you buckle up if you gon' come on this ride
No Johnny Cash but some of y'all are walking the line
But you wrong though, y'all look curious
Heath Ledger type of questions like, ""why so serious?""
And you want watered down lyrics? 
Well I don't carry 'em
I dig holes for these tracks, and then I slaughter and bury 'em
The motivation I got is on a whole different level
I treat these lines like court case, I don't wanna settle
My lyrics are like bullets and they're aiming at you
And I ain't talking Switchfoot when I dare you to move

Don't step on me, or you get blown sky high

That I'm ill with the words, too sick
They say I rap hungry, well that's 'cause I'm star-vin (Vin), Diesel
That´s why they calling me riddick-ulous (ridiculous)

Trying to find who I was
Being everything I wasn't

Gotta lot of anger
You know where I'm at
Put it all of it in the pages
And wrote it into raps, said that we could be amazing, if I give us a chance
Now im lookin round like yeah, look at where we at?
Look at where we at now, we ain't made it yet but they can here us in the background comin'
Some are gonna hate it, some are gonna love it
I'ma put it in his hands and let God do the judging, yah!
Remember me and you always had you in the backpack
Took you into school writing on you like its nuthin' a lot of people in the room
See me scribble on a page but they ain't got a clue, naw they ain't got a clue
We're here to begin it hoping someday you and I can say
We made it and we did it

NF,"You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake
If you'd open your eyes then maybe you'd see what's at stake
You're sleeping, you're sleeping

You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
But you feel like even though you got everything in the world
You got nothing, so what you do then is you start going backwards
You runnin' in a direction
And you lookin' for something that isn't real
And all you know is that you just gotta have it
What you're doin' is sleepin'
And thinking that you're awake and you're not
And the problem is that you don't know what you're after
So you put everything that you have into what you do
Hoping that one day maybe you don't have to feel like you're empty
But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
Then you look back and you start to regret things
You only get one life
And every time you lookin' at yours
You feel like everything you have is a waste!
And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
Is because you were never awake

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake

You wake up in the morning
But you feel like you never got up and go to work
And you feelin' like you ain't got a purpose
And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
Like you ain't nothing but worthless
And, yo, you look around
A lot of these other people you lookin' at
To you, you describe as perfect
So you point a finger at God and tell him to do his job
And fix ya' life up cause nothin' is workin'
And you will try to hide and make it seem like it's nothin'
But really you feel like everything is crashin' around you
And you develop a problem in trustin' in other people
Which later became an issue that will mentally pound you
You only get one life
But every time you lookin' at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
Is because you were never awake
Wake up

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake

I grew up in a small place, had to drive an hour just to see a movie
I'm a simple person, city life just doesn't move me
I'd rather be home with my grandparents and playing Euchre
Didn't wanna leave but this dream's calling, I had to do it
I left my girl there, wish I would've done it different
She was right when she told me that I don't ever listen
I told her I would change a million times and never did it
Apologies don't mean a thing if you don't ever fix it
I love what I do but it's not what I expected
This industry is not your friend, well that's my perspective
Sometimes the closest people to you make you feel protected
But those are the same people that hurt you most and leave you guessing
Some people say nobody's perfect but expect perfection
How you supposed to find the answer if you don't ask the question?
Sometimes I look into the mirror and talk to my reflection
When I go home and turn the music off, what am I left with?

Breathe

We used to be close but it's time past, we became disconnected
You never felt love and I always felt disrespected
Your family thought I was a joke, I was always defensive
They just wanted what was best for you, I just couldn't accept it
And hurting you was not a part of my plan or my intentions
But I was immature, I guess I had to learn some lessons
We grew apart and our lives went in different directions
And there's a lot of responsibilities that I neglected
I had a lot that was bottled inside, couldn't express it
And this pain won't leave, I can feel the depression
It's taking over my body, feels like I'm always stressing
Doctor told me I should sleep, but I'm always restless
I lay awake at night and think, my thoughts are relentless
I need a moment to breathe, I need a moment to vent this
I seem to be the only person that I play pretend with
And when I turn the music off, what am I really left with huh?

'Til we're eighty and one day we'll get up and say we regretted our lives
That's where we going
Do not pretend like you don't even notice
Funny thing is that you already know it
I'm starting to think that you like how I feel so be lost in the moment

Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment

Yeah, they told us that time flies, didn't know what it means
Now I feel like we just running around tryna
Catch it and hoping to cut up its wings
But that ain't gon' happen
Joy, when was the last time we had it?
I don't remember 'cause all that we do
Is go backwards but that's what you get
When you live in the past
And I know we breathing but we not alive
Really, is this the way we wanna die?
'Til you got everything bottled inside
If only they knew what goes on in our minds
I know what you thinking so don't try to hide
Why do you look at me like you surprised?
If you really mean what you write in these lines
Why don't you fix it? 'Cause I'm getting tired
Yeah, I can no longer do this
Ever since you fell in love with the music
See, you find a way to express what you feel
But the moment that you get away from the mic
You don't know what you doing
Is it clear to you yet?
I don't know what's going on in your head
But eventually, you'll have to deal with the things
That you talk about yeah, but I guess until then, we're lost

Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment

Yeah, oh oh oh, yeah, oh lost
Oh, yeah, oh, no no
This may be the last sunset I'll see
I'll take it in, I'll take it in
This may be the last day that I'll breathe
I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in",Lost in the Moment,2016
NF,"When I die, put my ashes in the trash bag
I don't care where they go
Don't waste your money on my gravestone
I'm more concerned about my soul
Everybody's gon' die
Don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder do You see us down here?

Oh Lord, oh Lord, do You see us down here?
Oh Lord, oh Lord

Listen, yeah everybody wants change
Don't nobody wanna change though
Don't nobody wanna pray
Till they got something to pray for
Now everybody's gon' die
But don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder do you see us down here?

Oh Lord, oh Lord, do You see us down here?
Oh Lord, oh Lord

It's easy to blame God but harder to fix things
We look in the sky like, ""why ain't You listening?""
Watching the news in our living rooms on the big screens
And talking 'bout ""if God's really real, then where is He?""
You see the same God that you saying might not even exist
Becomes real to us, but only when we dying in bed
When ya healthy it's like, we don't really care for Him then
Leave me alone God, I'll call you when I need you again
Which is funny, everyone will sleep in the pews
Then blame God for our problems like He sleeping on you
We turn our backs on Him, what do you expect Him to do?
It's hard to answer prayers when nobody's praying to you
I look around at this world we walk on
It's a smack in the face, don't ever tell me there's no God
And if there isn't then what are we here for?
And what are y'all doing down there? I don't know Lord

Oh Lord, oh Lord, do You see us down here?

Yo, ya just get in that, you get in that head space, ya know

Somebody get the body bags, working with beats and
Put the MC’s in 'em, season 'em, put 'em on a beat with me, then I’m eating 'em
Get away from the table, you rappers ain’t hungry enough, you rappers ain't hungry like ah
They talk about me like I'm here, they talk about you like you was
That nurse came into my room, she told me I'm sick in the head
I'm in hip-hop's hospital bed with a pad and a pen and a brace on my neck
They told me that I’m never leaving, why? I am as ill as it gets
Any rapper that say that they runnin' the game
I'mma come in they session and cut off they legs, woo
Strap a grenade to my head, pull out the pin
My music is mind blowin', ain't nobody do it like I do it
You ain’t never been on my level, I gotta part 'em out the way
To keep 'em talking and acting like everybody 
Gonna get up in a sleep with your eyes open
You wanna know what I noticed?
I look around and my fanbase and they ready
That last album was heavy, that last album was gritty
How you gon' match that? Just let me
Do what I do best
You're better off playing Russian roulette
Then comin' in a booth with me cause I get
A little bit intense, I’m like, “Who’s next?”
Y'all better watch it, take a look at where the clock is
It’s my time, this ladder of music that I climbed
I took the machete, the game isn’t ready
Them rappers, they coming up on me, I cut off the ladder, and I told 'em, “bye-bye”
What? Were you lookin’ for a high-five? Nice try
Do not believe everything that you read on the Internet
I do not know who your dentist is, but he should clean out your mouth
Don’t call me a sellout, that’s something I’ve never been
I've been through hell all my life though
But I know where heaven is
Father forgive me, for I am a sinner
But you gave me music as medicine
And nobody want a problem when they get in my zone better leave me be
I'm a mean MC, better feed me rappers or feed me beats, ah, feed me both of 'em
They like ""Nate, what's it like to be famous?""
Um, I'll let you know if I make it
I wonder what life will be like if I didn't stick out my neck
200 dollars inside of my bank account, woo, I was living on that
I need some money to pay for my rent, I need some money to pay for my gas
I'm not complaining, I'm just being honest, I promise that I will not beg for respect, no
I get so frustrated, take a look at what I created
Time is wasting and I ain't waiting
I'm a doctor with no job
Me, I don't have no patients
I keep pacing back and forth, I keep racing
You ain't never been in my book and I got a problem with it, why? 
'Cause you acting like you read my pages
I wreck these stages, real talk, better give me space 'cause I am chasing
Something they told me that I won't make it, I'm not famous, I'm just Nathan
And I wonder how the world gon' take this
They might hate it, but you don't know anything about me
You know I'll leave 'em changing
'Cause you know I'm real with it, don't care if you feeling it
I'm feeling it, you don't like it then deal with it, and if God ain't real, real isn't
You still wonder why I existed, I exist in the world that's real different
And what you gon' be when you grow up Nate? I doubt they will get it
My life is a mess, better watch your step when you step in it
Some of this brain is off limits I'm off in a
World that you don't get cause you ain't ever been in it
In 10 minutes, I still couldn't explain what's inside my brain, don't mess with it
I've invested a lot of me inside these lines, I'm just protecting 'em
Everybody wanna hear the real version of life then don't get so sensitive
When I say something a little bit raw
I jot my thoughts and they call it negative
You wanna know where my heart is? I stand out cause I wear my garbage
I work my hardest and every time I look into the mirror
Don't forget about where I started

Tell me what am I doing?
Tell me what am I doing?

Quit with the trash talk before you get tossed in it
Y'all tripping, bar ripping, y'all sipping too much, right to the palms dripping
Lost in it, thoughts different, you don't want no drama? Then don't get involved in it
I'm in a whole different head space, you making money? Well that's great
I got no interest in talking to people that I know are two faced
Too fake, get outta my face, woo
What are you doing in my lane? There's already too many rappers
I'm sick of the traffic and I ain't got no brakes
I already passed you, you don't like what I'm doing, who asked you?

I'm living 'em now
Look up to heaven like mom are you proud?
I'm on a way to New Zealand, I'm up in the clouds, dang
I mean who woulda' known this, who woulda' known this?
This industry never told me I was welcome
I went to the house in the back
And I broke in then told 'em that I would be back
I flat line, all of your whack rhymes, that's mine
Might get away from it boy MM LP, I'm the bad guy, the last time
I have been taking it easy, the game's mine, fame why?
I don't care about none of that, I'm just speaking the trash lines
I grew up on Eminem, now look where the game's at
Lame raps, Hollywood fame acts, I'm sick of the same trash
I got no blunt in my mouth but give me a beat, I'mma blaze that
Give me a beat, I'mma blaze that, you and me ain't in the same class
You and me ain't on the same row, music has always been my home
I used to call up some people that won't call me back, now they blowing up my phone, woo!
Ain't it funny how that works? Mad perks, killing the record
Got blood on my black shirt, I'm jealous in love with the music, don't ever come near her

I ain't from around here, how you let me run it down here?
If that isn't bothering none of you rappers then what are y'all doing out here?
It was like music to my ears, might never make it, I don't care
Drake, I love what you doing but call up the game and tell 'em that I'm here, yeah
I like that, might snap, I laugh, y'all better surrender and get out your white flags
And cancel your flight plans, your career isn't taking off
You sound like a hype man, hit you with the mic stand
And they ask what the hype's about, come and find out, I mean, where is you clowns at?
I been training, pen game is insane, I'm done playing

I was talking to fans
And one of them pulled me aside and said
""We never met but I swear that you know who I am
I been through a lot
I don't know how to express it to people
Don't think that I can but I got that mansion CD on rotation
That's real for me Nate, you do not understand""
It's crazy for me
Kids hit me up, say they slitting they wrists on the daily
This music is more than you think
Don't book me for just entertainment, it's entertaining
Hearing these parents, they telling their kids
My music is violent, you gotta be kidding me
I guess that your definition of violence and mine
Is something that we look at differently
How do you picture me ah?
Want me to smile, you want me to laugh
You want me to walk in the stage with a smile on my face
When I'm mad and put on a mask, for real though
I mean, what you expect from me?
I'm tryna do this respectfully
They say that life is a race
I know my problems'll probably catch up eventually
I do my best to be calm
How you gon' write me and tell me you slaughter my family?
That's just a glimpse to the stuff that get sent to me
These the parts of my life that'll never see, woo
I am aware it's aggressive
I am not here for acceptance
I don't know what you expect here
But what you expect when you walk in a therapy session?

Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session

This girl at the show looked me in the face
And told me her life's full of drama
Said that her dad is abusive
Apparently he likes to beat on her mama
I got so angry inside
I wanted to tell her to give me his number
But what you gon' do with it right?
You gon' hit him up then he'll start hitting her harder
That's real
These kids, they come to my shows
With tears in they eyes
Imagine someone looking at you
And saying your music's the reason that they are alive
Sometimes, I don't know how to handle it
This type of life isn't glamorous
This ain't an act for the cameras
You see me walk on these stages but have no idea what I'm dealing with after it
I put it all in the open
This is the way that I cope with all my emotion
I'm taking pictures with thousands of people
But honestly, I feel like nobody knows me
I'm trying to deal with depression
I'm trying to deal with the pressure
How you gon' tell me my music does not have a message
When I'm looking out at this crowd full of people I know I affected?
Ah, I got some things in my life, I know I should let 'em go
Let me jot it down, let me take a mental note
I put it all in this microphone, think about that for a minute
What is the point of this song, I'm just venting but what you expect from a therapy session?

Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session

What you think about me
That doesn't worry me
I know I handle some things immaturely
I know that I need to grow in maturity
I ain't gon' walk on these stages in front of these people
And act like I live my life perfectly
That doesn't work for me
Christian is not the definition of a perfect me, woo
I ain't the type to be quiet
I ain't gon' sit here in silence
If I wouldn't say what I say to your face
Then I promise you I wouldn't say it in private
I am not lying
People go off on my page and I'm trying to quit the replying
But this is ridiculous
I'm passionate man, I really mean what I'm writing
You want me to keep it 100? Okay, I'll keep it 100
I see a whole lot of talking on socials
But honestly, I don't see nothing in public
I kinda love it, yeah
""Why don't you write us some happy raps?
That would be awesome
All your music is moody and dark, Nate""
Don't get me started
You wanna know what it's like if you met me in person?
Listen to my verses
This music is not just for people
Who sit in the pews and pray at the churches
I won't reject it
I don't expect everyone to respect it
I don't expect you to get my perspective
What you expect from a therapy session?

I mean, I think sometimes people they confuse what I'm doing
I write about life, I write about things that I'm actually dealing with
Something that I'm actually experiencing, this is real for me
Like this is something that personally helps me as well
I'm not confused about who gave me the gift
God gave me the gift and he gave me the ability to do this
And he also gave me this as an outlet
And that's what music is for me
When I feel something, whether it's anger
Um, it's a passion about something, or frustration

It's a mess right now but I haven't had time to put the rappers in the coffins

We ain't talked in like six years, why you writing me now?
I just turned 100k down just to keep the brand looking right, now (that's real)

I'm just being honest, yeah, I'll take it with you
Shows sellin' out, better get your tickets, oh Lord!
I got a love for the fans
I can't express what it feels like
Sometimes I wonder if it's even real life
Sometimes I look at the past and think about how I got here in the first place

I don't wanna be rude but I could get you on my worst days

Wouldn't say I'm out of it, but don't feel like I can't be, agh!
Who you know droppin' clean records, but they nasty?
I was made for this, I could tell when Mama had me
I hopped right off the table, told my doctor, ""I ain't average""
He asked me, ""What does that mean?"" I told him, ""Get the pen and pad, please""

I feel like you lecture me
Eventually, I bet that we

But I guess that I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now

NF,"I'm dedicated, the definition of dedication
Wrote this whole record while I was levitating
Sittin' in my room with the pen and paper, I'm innovative
They've been afraid of me since I was a second grader
I'm the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
There's levels of music—and I'm in the elevator
Going up to the top floor, look how we elevated
What, you don't know the brand by now? You better get educated
Take both of my arms, rip 'em out the sockets and separate 'em
Forgive me, yeah, I know I get animated
Don't matter, I still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
Never been more motivated
Just look at all the minds I have opened and penetrated
See, I am the voice of all these kids that think things, but never say 'em
That's why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies
And hats low like we're carrying weapons, ah!
Put the controllers away, it's game over
I promise I'm way colder
The fans keep saying that they're hungry for new music
Well that's pretty convenient 'cause I just made a plate for 'em
And now I'm hearing none of y'all are saying
I just sit at the keys feeling the music
Got me thinking I'm Beethoven
The game needs a makeover
If you've been waiting, the wait's over
You ain't notice, y'all about to witness a takeover, I'm home!
Yeah, they waiting on me to match the
Emotion that I had in the last one
What if I don't, they gon' tell me that I'm losing my passion?
If I do, am I repeating my actions?
Yeah, look, ""How Could You Leave Us"" is massive
There ain't nothing I can write that'll match that
My biggest fear writing this record wasn't putting out trash
It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
Now I want you to picture me
I'm in a hotel rapping, crying on the floor of the bathroom
Staring in the mirror, my room, hands shaking
Playing ""How Could You Leave Us"" through the speakers on my iPhone
Tryna to figure out if I'ma always feel the way that I feel
Or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
Or maybe I can't be, 'cause if the music ain't emotional enough
Are they gon' call me a has-been?
Pain's always been the root of my music
If I cut it off, how am I supposed to keep growing
If I let it go, won't my whole career be in ruins?
That's when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
I never cared to impress people that don't even know me
I just write what I feel, somehow it started a movement
Trying to enjoy a career, but I don't know how to do it
When I spend all of time my being afraid I'ma lose it!
But, then I figured out the reason they follow me
The reason why these fans surrounding me
It's not 'cause I'm a ""Rap God""
I don't need you people to bow to me
All they ever did was doubt on me, now everyone's proud of me
Acknowledge me or not, you ain't ignoring the following
I'm just teaching 'em something they couldn't learn in they colleges
This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom
And every day of they lives, feels like it's darker than Halloween!
Yeah, you ain't alone out there, look around you
We got a lot of fans in here
Couple hundred thousand, that's what we did last year
Listen to Intro 3, trying to kill my fear
They'll get that in a minute
We about to shatter the critics
I am a savage, admit it
A lot of baggage I live in

It's crazy what we'll do to climb it faster
It's like we throw away the things in life that really matter
Just so that we can make it to the top, and wonder what we're even climbing after

I wanna look at my kids in the face when I'm older 
And say I've been something admirable
Fast checks, fast women, that don't inspire me, no!
You don't wanna know what's goin' on inside my personal life? 
Then get out my diary, yeah

I wanna know what it's like to be happy
I wanna know what it's like to wake up in the morning 
And feel like it's real when I'm laughin' (yeah!)
I wanna know what it's like to sit down with my friends 
And feel like they might understand me (woo!)
I wanna know that the people around me care less about Grammys and more about family

I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know (Yeah, I wanna know)
I wanna know, I wanna know

Yeah, record labels' signin' artists 
They ain't got a clue what to do with
Why would I put my career in the hands 
Of someone that don't even know what they doin'?
Why would I sit in a room full of people 
That don't even care about me 
Or my future and tell me they ain't really feelin' the vision
Then hop on the wagon the moment it's movin', huh?
Heard you tellin' people you don't really like the content
Whatchu wanna hear me rap about?
How I'm on a roll gettin' side chicks?
You should treat your mouth like your phone in a movie theater
Put that on silence
I don't care what everybody else is doin' 
I'm just bein' me and that's not how I live
Oh my, oh my, yeah, I'm in the zone now
Zoned out, come to my show with they phones out
Whole crowd, oh wow, that's wild, tone down, no!
I have created my own style
I have created my own sound
Oh, you didn't know? Well, you know it now
Slowin' down
Livin' happy, this is what I was made for
They say you get what you paid for
Grandpa told me, ""Always look to Heaven 
Try to pay attention when you talkin' to God,"" yeah
I wish I'd paid more, I shoulda prayed more
Everybody's out here shoppin' 
Tryna find a different product in the same stores
Everybody wants they dream to fall in they lap
But don't wanna work for it
I've been doin' this since I was just a kid 
And mama bought me 8 Mile at the movie store
Hopin' someday maybe I could do what I love 
For a livin' with people I care for
People that care more about me as person 
Than money I make for 'em, yeah!

We just say 'em different
Try to fix it, crazy, isn't it?
You say, ""Mom was always proud"" and played the videos of us as kids, I get it

I make songs, I don't make friends, judge me

Feels wrong, but it feels right
My feelings seal tight real nice

Somebody told you I was back? Yes, of course
You got a problem with the fans? There's the door

Try to give me feedback, I don't really need that
I used to walk on stage in a V-neck
I used to wear a lil' tie with a black vest
I came a long way, why you lookin' upset?
I'm tryna paint a picture, get the vision, you ain't hear it yet, woo!

Look, hold up, hold up, wait a minute, please
Flow's switchin', I got ADD
Brain scatters when you play the beat
It don't matter what you say to me
I'll be doin' this at 83
I've been doin' this since ABC's
In the major leagues doin' major things, don't play with me, woo!

I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Wake up every morning thinkin' I'ma have a bad day
Drive my own car, I don't like the valet
Parked, then I go into my mind with an AK
Shoot every thought in my head then it rotates
Losin' it all, but I think that I'm okay
Who is involved? I don't know, but I'm insane
Poof! And I'm gone, wanna call me a no name, what!?
I'm prolly not what you thought
I'm prolly not what you thought
I used to judge everybody that wasn't like me 'til I learned it was wrong
Girl told me I should get it together and get out the dark
I'm tryna give her my heart
That's when I sit in my car, writin' for hours until I can barely talk

I mean, where do I start?
Feels like I'm fallin' apart
Act like my image is hard
I always put up my guard
Even when talkin' to God
Sit in my room and I plot
Everything that I'm not
Comes out in the music I jot
I give it all that I got
I give it all that I got!
I'm tryna think out the box, no!

Yeah, I got people standing outside a bus screaming my name
I don't come out and take pictures, they tell me I changed
I don’t smile in VIPs, you get mad like, ""You know what I paid?""

Yeah, what's your definition of success? (Ayy!)
I don't trust the thoughts that come inside my head (woo!)
I don't trust this thing that beats inside my chest
Who I am and who I wanna be cannot connect; why?
Don't think I deserve it? You get no respect (woo!)
I just made a couple mil', still not impressed
Let You Down goes triple platinum, yeah, okay, okay, I guess (ayy!)
Smile for a moment then these questions startin' to fill my head, not again!
I push away the people that I love the most; why? (Woo!)
I don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable; why? (Woo!)
That makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable; why? (Ayy!)
Stop askin' me questions, I just wanna feel alive
Until I die—this isn't Nate's flow (woo!)
Just let me rhyme; I'm in disguise
I'm a busy person, got no time for lies; one of a kind
They don't see it; I pull out they eyes; I'm on the rise!
I've been doin' this for most my life with no advice (woo!)
Take my chances, I just roll the dice, do what I like
As a kid, I was afraid of heights, put that aside
Now I'm here and they look so surprised, well so am I, woo!
They don't invite me to the parties but I still arrive
Kick down the door and then I go inside
Give off that ""I do not belong here"" vibe
Then take the keys right off the counter, let's go for a ride
Why do y'all look mortified? (Ayy!)
I keep to myself, they think I'm sorta shy, organized
Let You Down's the only song you've heard of? Well then you're behind (woo!)

If I should stick my knife inside of Pennywise
I, I don't care what anybody else thinks—lies (haha!)
I do not need nobody to help me—lies
I kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy; why?
I don't understand, it's got me questionin' like, ""Why?
Just tell me why""—not back to this flow
Inside I feel divided
Back when I ain't had a dime, but had the drive
Back before I ever signed, I questioned life, like, ""Who am I, man?"" Woo!
Nothin' to me's ever good enough
I could be workin' for twenty-four hours a day and think I never did enough
My life is a movie but there ain't no tellin' what you're gonna see in my cinema (no!)
I wanna be great but I get it in the way of myself 
And I think about everything that I could never be
Why do I do it though? Ayy, yeah
Why you always lookin' aggravated?
Not a choice, you know I had to make it
When they talk about the greatest, they gon' probably never put us in the conversation
Like somethin' then I gotta take it
Write somethin' then I might erase it
I love it, then I really hate it
What's the problem, Nathan? I don't know!
I know I like to preach to always be yourself (yeah)
But my emotions make me feel like I am someone else
Me and pride had made a pact that we don't need no help
Which feels like I'm at war inside myself but I forgot the shells
I hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but not a lot know me well
Hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but they don't know me well

And a woman's arms to hide him

And hides his pain by acting proud
He drinks too much and he laughs too loud
How can I deny him.

I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'

But tonight the war is over
He speaks to me in schoolboy French
Of a soldiers life inside a trench
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench
I do my best to please him

He puts two roses in a vase
Two roses sadly out of place
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face
Playfully I tease him
Hold me neath the Paris skies
Let's not talk of how or why
Tomorrow's soon enough to die
But tonight the war is over
We make love too hard too fast
He falls asleep his face a mask
He wakes with the shakes and he drinks from his flask
I put my arms around him

They die in the trenches and they die in the air
In Belguim and France the dead are everywhere
They die so so fast there's no time to prepare
A decent grave to surround them
Old world glory old world fame
The old worlds gone gone up in flames
Nothing will ever be the same
And nothing lasts forever
Oh I'd pray for him but I've forgotten how
And there's nothing nothing that can save him now
There's always another with the same funny bow
And who am I to deny them

For way too many miles now
I've been flying with broken wings

Like a long lost friend
That's never found a way back to me
And I can't deny these memories
Got me all locked up inside
And you hold the key

All that I need is this moment
To send me away with a smile on my face
I tried to leave but I turn back

If there was a way to get back

Now I'm a three hundred pound red neck rebel
I'm a God-fearing man, who's had to dance with devil
The Lord I pray my soul to take
If I should ever die before I wake
But see, right now I just wanna love and live
And show this country girl what I got to give
My whole heap and hep of country fun,
Full of four wheel drive, dirt road and shotgun
Ain't nothing better than being out in the woods
With Nic and Nappy Roots and blazin' that good good
Lord I'ma tell you we're doin' it just right
Got my Playboy bunny right by my side
This is me and my girl and ol' Sick Em Sam
In a flatbed Ford off the Copperhead Dam
Listen to Jennings sing that lonesome song
It's all just right, y'all can keep the wrong

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
Since I met you, all I wanna do is
Waste some time

With my feet up, lawn chair beat up
I'm on my third six pack, player can you keep up?
Got it right deep in the sticks, wanna see us?
Front yard golf field bought em, wanna tee up?
Cataracts here tell Jenny go re-up
Bulldog been every truck throw a G up
Hospital, school and the church one street up
Talk more proper when the city folks greet us
Tired of goin to jail so I learned how to chill
Me and the lil lady have a ball every Chri
Friends and a keg and the country boy meal
I should write a menu how a country boy live
Luck no love, or bucks no buck
Someone hand me a ball and a truck-boat-truck.
I've never been rich but I really don't want much,
Just a roof and some good liquor in my cup.

Work a little harder, do my part, start livin right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
'Cause since I met you, all I wanna do is

I got five on the wood, twenty on the keg
I been left the hood, yep I did what I said
Momma I'm good 'bout as cool as they come
We cooked a whole hog and love chicken where I'm from
I used to be the bomb, now to think I'm fresh
Still rock my same jeans and keep the liquor to myself
Got a little wealth so I gotta thank the Lord,
Couldn't do it by myself, got some help from Colt Ford
Now we in a Ford, and we travel on a gravel road
He said he knew a spot, where the music and the liquor flow
And of course I'm down like four flats
Drove a country mile, took a left to be exact
Led us smack dab in the middle of the sticks
Now I had seen a lot of things, but nothing like this
A bunch of pretty women, nothin' less than a dime
Colt Ford and Nappy Roots so you know we gonna waste some time

Nic Jones,"It's of a fair and handsome girl, she's all in her tender years
She fell in love with a sailor boy and it's true that she loved him well
For to go off to sea with him, like she did not know how
She longed to see that seaport town, called Canadee-I-O.

So she bargained with a young sailor boy, it's all for a piece of gold
Straighway then he led her all down into the hold
Saying ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue
You'll see that seaport town, called Canadee-I-O""

Now, when the other sailors heard the news, they fell into a rage
And with all the whole ship's company, they were willing to engage
Saying ""We'll tie her hands and feet me boys, overboard we'll throw her
And she'll never see that seaport town, called Canadee-I-O""

Now, when the captain he's heard the news, well he too fell into a rage
And with his whole ship's company, he was willing to engage
Saying ""She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her collar shall be blue
She'll see that seaport town, called Canadee-I-O""

Now when they came down to Canada, scarcely above half a year
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear
She's dressed in silks and satins now, and she cuts a gallant show
She's the finest of the ladies down in Canadee-I-O

Come all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be
I'd have you follow your own true love when he goes out on the sea
For if the sailors prove false to you, well the captain he might prove true
To see the honour that I have gained by the wearing of the blue",Canadee-I-O,1980
Nic Jones,"Willie sits in his stable door
And he's combing his coal-black steed
And he's doubting on fair Margaret's love
And his heart began to bleed
Give corn unto my horse, mother
And meat to my man John
And I'll away to fair Margaret's bower
Before the night comes on

Oh stay at home with me, dear Willie
Oh stay at home with me
And the very best cock in all the roost
For your own supper shall be
It's all your cocks in all your roosts
I value not a pin
But I'll away to fair Margaret's bower
Before the night sets in

If you go to fair Margaret's bower
Without the leave of me
And in the deepest part of the Clyde water
Then drowned you shall be
Oh the good steed that I ride upon
Cost me thrice thirty pounds
And I'll put trust in his swift feet
To take me safe and sound

He's ridden o'er the high, high hills
And he's down the dewy den
And the noise that was in the Clyde water
Would have feared five hundred men,
O roaring Clyde, you roar so loud
Your streams are wondrous strong
Make me a wreck as I come back
And spare me as I'm going

Oh when he's got to Margaret's bower
He's turled low on the pin
Oh wake up, me May Margaret rise up and let me in
Oh who is this at my bower door
A-calling May Margaret's name?
It's only your first love, little William
This night come to her home

Open your gates this night
Open and let me in
For me boots they are full of the Clyde water
And I'm frozen to the skin
Me barns are full of corn, Willie
The stable's full of hay
And me bower's full of gentlemen
They'll not remove till day

Then it's fare thee well to you, May Margaret
It's fare thee well and adieu
For I have won my mother's own curse
In coming this night to you
And as he's ridden o'er the high, high hill
And down yon dowy den
And the rushing in the Clyde water
Took Willie's cane from him

And he's leaned him over his saddle-bow
To catch his cane again
And the rushing in the Clyde water
Took Willie's hat from him
And he's leaned him over his saddle-bow
To catch his hat by force
But the rushing in the Clyde water
Took Willie from his horse

And the very hour that young man sank
Into the parts so deep
There up and awoke this May Margaret
Out from her drowsy sleep
Come here come here, my mother dear
And you read my dreary dream
I dreamed my lover was at our gates
And nobody let him in

Lie down, lie down, you May Margaret
Lie down and take your rest
And since your lover was at our gates
It's but two quarters passed.
Then nimbly, nimbly rose she up
Went down to the river's brim
And the louder that this lady cried
The louder grew the wind

And the very first step that she went in
She stepped up to her feet
And it's oh and alas, this lady cried
The water's wondrous deep
And the very next step that she went in
She's waded to her knee
Says she, I would wade farther in
If I my true love could see

And the very next step that she went in
She's waded to her chin
And the deepest part of Clyde water
She found sweet William in
Saying, you have had a cruel mother, Willie
And I have had another
And now we'll sleep in Clyde water
Like sister and like brother",The Drowned Lovers,1980
Nic Jones,"Shotover river, your gold it is waning 
It's weeks since the colour I've seen 
But it's no use just sitting and Lady Luck blaming 
So I'll pack up and make the break clean 

Farewell to the gold that never I found 
Goodbye to the nuggets that somewhere abound 
For it's only when dreaming that I see you gleaming 
Down in the dark, deep underground 

It's nearly two years since I left my old mother 
For adventure and gold by the pound 
With Jimmy the prospector - he was another 
For the hills of Otago was bound 

We worked the Cardrona's dry valley all over 
Old Jimmy Williams and me 
But they were panning good dirt on the winding Shotover 
So we headed down there just to see 

We sluiced and we cradled for day after day 
Making hardly enough to get by 
Til a terrible flood swept poor Jimmy away 
During six stormy days in July

Nic Jones,"Fifty-six I sailed on board
A ship called Byron One
She's carried trawler men on deck
And a harpoon whaling gun

Oh you trawler men, come on
Forget your snapper and your prawn
For it's out of Ballina we'll sail
Fishing for the humpback whale

A tractor for a whale winch
And the ship's an old Fairmile
Twin diesels turn the screws around
She'll whale in a fine old style

Oh you trawler men, come on
Forget your snapper and your prawn
For it's out of Ballina we'll sail
Fishing for the humpback whale

Keep a sharp look-out me lads
The whale he's on the run
And we'll drive him into Byron Bay
And we'll shoot him with our guns

Oh you trawler men, come on
Forget your snapper and your prawn
For it's out of Ballina we'll sail
Fishing for the humpback whale

The harpoon and the line fly through
Very deep into the whale
She split the timbers of the ship
With a flurry of her tail

Oh you trawler men, come on
Forget your snapper and your prawn
For it's out of Ballina we'll sail
Fishing for the humpback whale

The rigging struts are snapped in two
We reel beneath the blow
The gunner fires a killer shot
And that humpback sank below

Oh you trawler men, come on
Forget your snapper and your prawn
For it's out of Ballina we'll sail
Fishing for the humpback whale

Make her tail fast to the bows
We've got no time for bed
For four and twenty hours each day
We kept that factory fed

Oh you trawler men, come on
Forget your snapper and your prawn
For it's out of Ballina we'll sail
Fishing for the humpback whale

The flensing men upon the land
Some had been jackaroos
They skin the blubber from the whales
Like they're skinning kangaroos

Oh you trawler men, come on
Forget your snapper and your prawn
For it's out of Ballina we'll sail
Fishing for the humpback whale

A hundred whales and then fifty more
Through the factory we did send
And then the orders came, knock off me lads
Your season's at an end

Oh you trawler men, come on
Forget your snapper and your prawn
For it's out of Ballina we'll sail
Fishing for the humpback whale

Back into Ballina we steered
Tied up and stowed the gear
All hands headed for the pub
And we filled ourselves with beer

 I walk all alone 
 And I wonder as I wander by the river 
 Where my love has flown

 Know I love her 
 Know I care 
 But my dreams, like the songs, she sang in Spanish 
 Seem to vanish 
 In the air 
 I wonder where 
 So I wonder as I wander 
 Will love come along 
 Must I live ever after

People talk about how ""bad"" we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage

Many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us
Try to help us

How can anything survive

Il negozio di antiquariato

Non si può cercare un negozio di antiquariato 
in via del corso
Ogni acquisto ha il suo luogo giusto 
e non tutte le strade sono un percorso

Raro è trovare una cosa speciale
nelle vetrine di una strada centrale
Per ogni cosa see'è un posto
ma quello della meraviglia 
è solo un po' più nascosto
Il tesoro è alla fine dell'arcobaleno
che trovarlo vicino nel proprio letto
piace molto di meno

Non si può cercare un negozio di antiquariato 
in via del corso
Ogni acquisto ha il suo luogo giusto
e non tutte le strade sono un percorso

Come cercare l'ombra in un deserto
o stupirsi che è difficile incontrarsi in mare aperto
Prima di partire si dovrebbe essere sicuri
di che cosa si vorrà cercare dei bisogni veri
Allora io propongo per non fare confusione
a chi ha meno di cinquant'anni
di spegnere adesso la televisione

Non si può entrare in un negozio 
e poi lamentarsi che tutto abbia un prezzo
se la vita è un'asta sempre aperta
anche i pensieri saranno in offerta

Ma le più lunghe passeggiate
le più bianche nevicate e le parole che ti scrivo
non so dove l'ho comprate
di sicuro le ho cercate senza nessuna fretta
perché l'argento sai si beve
ma l'oro si aspetta",Il Negozio Di Antiquariato,2003
Niccolò Fabi,"Chiudi gli occhi 
Immagina una gioia 
Molto probabilmente 
Penseresti a una partenza 

Ah si vivesse solo di inizi 
Di eccitazioni da prima volta 
Quando tutto ti sorprende e 
Nulla ti appartiene ancora 

Penseresti all'odore di un libro nuovo 
A quello di vernice fresca 
A un regalo da scartare 
Al giorno prima della festa 

Al 21 marzo, al primo abbraccio 
A una matita intera, alla primavera 
Alla paura del debutto 
Al tremore dell'esordio 
Ma tra la partenza e il traguardo 

In mezzo c'è tutto il resto 
E tutto il resto è giorno dopo giorno 
E giorno dopo giorno è 
Silenziosamente costruire 
E costruire è sapere 
E potere rinunciare alla perfezione 

Ma il finale è di certo più teatrale 
Così di ogni storia ricordi solo 
La sua conclusione 

Così come l'ultimo bicchiere, l'ultima visione 
Un tramonto solitario, l'inchino e poi il sipario 
Ma tra l'attesa e il suo compimento 
Tra il primo tema e il testamento 

Nel mezzo c'è tutto il resto 
E tutto il resto è giorno dopo giorno 
E giorno dopo giorno è 
Silenziosamente costruire

E potere rinunciare 
Alla perfezione

Como una manzana que al morder la cabeza me confunde 
Como una veleta que se mueve y al viento no obedece

Como un agujero en el cielo por donde se van los sueños 
Como esa cesta que tanto cuesta llenar y que se vacía al momento 
Me gusta como eres
Como una herida en el corazón que no me duele 
Me gusta como eres 
Como una ventana que al cerrar deja correr el aire 
Una niña, una madre, una mujer en mi vida

Como una nube cargada de agua que moja la tierra seca 
Como la manta que me protege cuando el invierno llega 
Como esa vela que se prende y me rescata de la oscuridad 
Me gusta como eres

Di cibo sano e sane discussioni

Orfano di tempo e silenzio

Di una democrazia che non sia un paravento 
Di onore e dignità, misura e sobrietà 
E di una terra che è soltanto calpestata 
Comprata, sfruttata, usata e poi svilita 
Orfan di una casa, di un'Italia che è sparita

Greg Nice! Greg N-I-C-E
Dame un beso, ah oui oui
Rock for a fee, not for free
Maybe I'll do it for charity
Now my employer or my employee
Is making Greg N-I-C-E very M-A-D
Don't ever ever think of jerking me
I work too hard for my royalty
Put lead in your ass and drink a cup of tea
Peace to Red Alert and Kid Capri
Ooohh la la, ah oui oui, I say Muhammad Ali, you say Cassius Clay
I say butter you say Parkay
It's alright if you wanna make a sway
I'm away up town, took the deuce to the tre
I originate, they duplicate
I praise the lord and keep the faith
It's alright keep biting at the bait
'92, uh! One year later
Peace out Premier take me out with the fader

I chant eenie meenie, minie moe
I wreck the mic like a pimp pimps hoes
Here's how it goes I am a genius I mean this
I'll shake this you'll take this
I'm kinda fiendish
You wish that you could come into my neighborhood
Meaning my mental state
Still I'm 5 foot 8
Crazy as I wanna be, cause I make it orderly
You could say I'm sort of the boss so get lost
The brother who will make you change opinions
Dominions I'm in them when it's time to kick shit from
The heart, cause I get a piece of the action
Feeling satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid
Too late, when they dip in the kick they get sprayed
Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is
I get more props and stunts than Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes and can't lose when I cruise
Out on the expressway
Leaving the Bodega I say ""suave""
Premier's got more beats than barns got hay
Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money, never have to run

I left my Phillie at home, do you have another
I wanna get blunted my brother
Now may I make a mark then make a spark
Over this phat track or should I say dope beat
Subtract, delete
All of the wick wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's coming from way way back
Hey yo Premier, please pass that buddha sack
You heard we quit? No way, bullshit!
I told you before we come back with more hits
I provide bright flavor so you can sketch me
Do me a favor, dont try to catch me
Slightly ahead of the game, I'm not a lame
Ask him, he'll tell you the same he knows my name
Smooth, I drop jewels like, paraphernalia
I'm infallable, not into failure

And use my brain and a pen, like a shield and a sword
Since my mind conceive this, why not believe it
My hands receive it, and therefore I must achieve it
Then I have no other alternative
Than to show the party people just how I live
See I emerged from a level called brown
And like an atom radiates, I develop from the elements
Then I saw a vision of greatness
So I proceeded to follow a path, where only warriors go
I found the glow, I learned to know to go with the flow
I've grown, but must continue to grow
I'm like the sun, or should I say the North Star
A black pearl, or maybe I'm a quasar
I'm bright as hell, sometimes it even scares me
How in the world could one MC, be so deep?
I don't creep, like a frog I leap
And I, reap what I sew and sew what I reap
My lyrics seep into your soul and gain control
This is a fact not rigamarole
I'm icy cold but warm like a mink stole
See I've been writin' rhymes, since I was pre-natal
I have a lust and hunger for stage, my attraction is fatal
If I was to categorize me
I'd be a bigger surprise than human eyes could see

Because Nice & Smooth is like dope on a rope
Yo, Nice & Smooth is like dope on a rope
Yo, Nice & Smooth is like dope on a rope

At the hotel, we be yawnin
Take off your clothes, take off mine
Sun is shinin I'm feelin fine
Stop it booty I don't want to do the do
But I want the breakfast menu
C'mon, give me a big be	-B.L.T.
C'mon, give me a glass of vitamin see
Toast with butter, not a cover
If you burn it I'll want a-nother
Because I'm choosy and I'm small
I'm like Cinderella at the ball
I throw my hands, up in the air
I got the juice you never com-pare
Ladies shake your derriere

Who's that booty over there?
Whattup baby, what's your name?

No limitation in my life and I'm known to go far
Live in the Bronx upon a street called Marion
Girls on the block call me a black Blake Carrington
Handsome as hell, I dress real swell
By the tone of my voice maybe you can tell that I
Shampoo with Prell and live life well
When I pass you on the street it's lack of failure smell
I'm gonna let you know that I'm divine competition
When I give a show don't front just pay admission
To see, the greatest rapper that will ever perform
Cause this is, a rap attack not a quiet storm
Went downtown to meet my girl
Light brown dimples and natural curls
Got to her school, what did I see?
Some onionhead brother tryin to talk to my G
I said, ""I beg your pardon, no need for alarm
But I am the man with finesse and charm""
A man of good nature no quiver or qualm
Didn't want to have to do the boy no bodily harm
Told him Silvie is the girl that I came to pick up
And if he kept talkin to her he'd be pressin his luck
He said, ""I'm sorry Smooth Bee, I didn't recognize
Didn't recollect nor did I realize
That she was your girl, but it's no surprise
Cause when it comes to cutiepies you win first prize""
So I thanked for the compliment then stepped off
Grabbed my girl, and jumped in my ride and broke North
Took her uptown so we could make love
Cause while she's in school I'm all she thinks of
Smooth Bee, the only MC
That's guaranteed to be free cause I possess the key, c'mon

That you can deceive me
See many visions of love and splendor
I'm the real thing, not like a pretender
I rock rhymes over beats on the real tip
Stay real strong and hang on like a vise grip
Use my mind to control all my body parts

Cause I'm a dominant black pied piper
Spreadin peace and love throughout my travels
And take time to read and unravel
Day to day problems, and then solve
Them, I can see clearly now as I revolve
Around suckers
Who perpetrate heroes

Bust the sketch that I'm about to tell
I saw a dookie rope downtown on sale
Was it Wall Street or was it Canal?
Anyway I'm steppin out in style
Yo fellas there's a treasure trunk (where?) Up in the attic

G-O-L-D gold I'm twenty-two years old
And uhh, I never fold, I'm livin my role
as a diplomat, and my pockets are fat
My rings are eighteen karat skeezer, and it's like that
Went to the jeweler, had a fifty G budget
Bought a turkish rope, a medallion made of nuggets
You can look, you can touch it, but don't smudge it
Milky, milky, I'm so silky
I met this cutie and her name was Judy
Judy was top choice, had golden brown eyes
Def lips, and fly thighs
Jet black hair, her complexion clear
And her derriere, had savoire-faire
Big gold teeth in her mouth
Mmmmmmmm - Judy was from down South
She had a warm heart, that could get real cold
Judy was all about, G-O-L-D gold

Now, Teddy Ted, and I must prevail
I buy my gold by the pennyweight scale

I met this girl at the French Riviera
She said, ""Smooth B, won't you come nearer
And let me kiss your lips and give you a - treat?""
I said, ""Baby, listen, I'm not dissing
But I'm not one who goes round kissing
Each and every woman I meet on the - street
I like a girl with some class
(Got a big, big, big)
Nice and smooth, not a girl that's too fast
Please, take my beeper number, and chill
I'm not ill, I like things at a cool-out pace
It's me and you, not a relay race
You see, I'm not greedy, slow down, speedy
Save those hand-downs for the needy
I respect you and won't neglect you
And try my damn best to protect you
Cause you're fly, girl, so don't play yourself

Greg Nice, I met this dame
I like her style, she feels the same
Is she gaming, merely claiming
To be my girl, to change my world?
I don't like to be uptight
I don't wanna fuss, I don't wanna fight
She's obsessive, too possessive
I wish I knew this girl's objective
I met baby girl when I was on tour
Gave me more than what I bargained for
Makes me breakfast while in bed
She loves to keep her man well fed
Diplomatic, socialistic
Baby girl had strawberry lipstick
It tastes sweet, just like honey
Said to myself, ""Yo, this dip's a dummy""
Tried to gas me for my money
Teddy Tedd, she looks like a Playboy Bunny!

Hey yo, kickin wicked rhymes like a fortune teller
Had a dog by the name of Old Yeller
Old, Yeller, had a fiendish plot
Schemed and dreamed, for me to make a knot
Ever since then booties clock me like Big Ben
As I go on and kick more
Got more songs than a record store
Some is sniffin and some is buffin
Some is riffin some ain't sayin nothin
But my pockets I am stuffin
Huffin puffin blow the house down
Nice and Smooth is in your town
I own a sailboat, and this I quote
Collect federal notes, from songs I wrote
Not the Shah of Iran and I'm not the Pope
But my name is on the Walk of Fame like Bob Hope
Baby doll, bust the sketch, don't forget
That I'm a trooper and you're troopette
I'm Mr. Smurf and you're Smurfette
I, take you, to the hotel
You, take me, to the motel
Like a rocketship I will excel
When you do a crime you go to jail
Pay the bail then hop the bail
Bounty hunter is on yo' tail
Mission to bring you back to jail
Pump a little weight so I'm not frail

And I possess finesse and we share this

'Cause I'm buildin, a new rap level
Through bass and treble, I will abolish the devil
I must prevail

I stay def beyond 2000
And my spirit will keep arousin

And I never had jheri curls

And givin no slack, I'm tellin you flat, that
I am an orator, dope rhyme conniseur
Never leavin you bored on the dancefloor
You want more, Smooth be's got enough for 4 scores
Chewin MC's like Reese's Pieces
And treatin other MC's like feces
They walk around with no direction
They get mad over our complexion

My name is Greg Nice

Humor!  I'll make you laugh
Go take a bath you don't know the half
Yeah my structure, is like a skyscraper
Greg, Nice not a comic book caper
Like Bruce Wayne or even Dick Grayson
I'm not Freddie and I'm not Jason
I hate base and, chasin clouds of illusion
Mass confusion, which drug are you usin?

Freelance style, mother's last child
I'm buckwild don't make me pull your file
Used to wear a frown now you wear a smile
Teddy Ted is the jewel of the Nile
The original ooh child, versatile
Eagles want to fly, rappers made to ramble
My name is Greg Nice I used to scramble
Met this dip who changed my world around
At night she wore diamonds and pearls, and I say
what a way to agree, she walked up to me and said umm
""Oh no, it can't be!
 The incredible sounds of Greg N-I-see-E""
I said yes, Nice Greg, Greg N-I-see-E
Come to my cabin baby doll and see
Thirty minutes we can go around the galaxy
She, bought it for sure when I walked through the door
Turned around I saw her bloomers on the floor
I said umm, golly gee I know this can't be
Then I thought BA-BOW did it all for me
So we got busy and her name was Missy
I gave her permission to be my main squeeze
Never felt lips like these, I'm telling you!
She blessed me well, made me perspire
Missy, my number one heart's desire

[Smooth Bee]
Rhymes, rhymes, rhymes
I just write rhymes, as I incline I design
Denyin me is like frontin on Jesus
And it's a sin to begin, knowing you'll never win
You want to be my friend?  Blend
I can't extend, neither pretend
to be better than the next man, that only comes in when
others try to apprehend fake styles and then smile
while I create rhymes by the miles
No hot towels, nor weak bowels
What's with the why's anw who's, you're not an owl
I'm watching you, mm-hmm, ready to close in
And like a thief in the night, nobody knows
when I'll strike and flex and vex, against your literature
I don't bite but I write while you snore
I have to rupture your senses while you pay consequences
Smooth Bee not he now battle commences
I'm VICKING YOU!  Of all your knowledge and all of your lessons
Of all your strifes through life and all your BLESSINGS
Terminating you!  Subtracting cells from your brain

Together we're coolin', the mic we're rulin'
Suckers we're schoolin', you better stop booin'
Skill trade (we know what we doin')

My name is Greg Nice I like to swing
Went to Canal Street I bought the dookie rings
After that, I bought a fur
Then I went to see the lady for a manicure
Cut my nails down low and my rings was glowin'
Around my neck the dookie ropes was showin'
Went outside, to the BM ride
With the VVS rims on all fo' sides
I was, butter soft had on fresh gear
Kickin' it live to the girl in the air
Baby doll, when can we hang?
You got my number, give me a rang
Called me up yo, late one night
Let's get busy 'cause the time was right
You know what she wanted, she wanted to do (What? What?)
Yo she wanted to date (what?) she wanted to ooh!
Took her to the movies, I took her to dinner
Told her I'm a vet, I ain't no beginner
Grabbed her hand and said, ""Let's catch a cab
Baby don't worry I'll pay the tab""
Dug in my pockets, for the gusto
Big bills, had nothin' low


The S to the M double-O T-H'er
B-E-E no time to waste
Ah right about now I'm gonna reminisce
Of how a fly MC became a rap-ologist
Around the time when Chubby Checker, invented ""The Twist""
I used to play spin the bottle, run catch and kiss
Smooth Bee's my name, that's what I said
I got a blue Mercedes, a big brass bed
I live on a hill overlookin' a view
And I came here tonight just to rock for you
So let's a rock y'all, and get down
Let's take a trip on a funky merry-go-round
You see, round and around and around we go
And when the funky beat stops everybody will know
'Cause there's a time and a place where we'll all have fun
And Smooth Bee will be your number one
Master of Ceremonies and you must admit
That I was, born and raised to make top hits
So vicious, malicious, and very discrete
I have mystical powers I perform any fete
I'm gonna be ranked at the top of my field
I'm gonna see my name in the Rappers Guild
With all the other rappers, who want to be known
I'll be boastin' with a gold-tone microphone
'Cause I'm death-defyin, never caught lyin'
Not a female's love I'm ever caught buyin'
Get so much sex that I might explode
And on a sperm count scale I'm an overload

[Chorus]

Yo, I'm a trooper, and I do loopers
I do stunts and I smoke blunts
Forty ounce of private stizzinock
Standin' on the corner, holdin' my jizzinock
Watching all the girls, pass!
Boy she got a big! (Ooh ooh)
Hey, baby, whatcha eatin?
Looks to me, like you be beefin'
Sneakin' by I saw you peepin'
Did you think Greg Nice was sleepin'?
I'm not rich like Donald Trump
And I don't have no big fat lump
Slouch, only on the couch
And if you fight me girl I will say ouch
(Ah yeah!)

[Chorus]

Smooth Bee guaranteed to make a mic sing
I'm Smooth Bee I'm guaranteed, to give you what you need
Not a sip not a swallow but the whole damn bottle
Got a lot of juice but my girl cut me loose
For a sucker with cazals and plate named Bruce
Little did she know that I'm choice and not moist
Undisputed rapper with a golden voice
An entrepreneur, undercover love
Man of the world with my life to explore
Minks socks leather suits shirts made of velour
Smooth articulate entertainer MC
I'm rappin' to a funky beat, my dialogue's unique
Every time she sees me she offers me a skeeze
She says, ""Please Smooth Bee, please, please!
Let me ride in your blue Mercedes""
I taunt and tease as she drops to her knees
And I let her wipe my nose every time that I sneeze
 we know what we doin'!

A skill trade
We know what we doin'
A skill trade

Some-thing, I can't, ex-plain (*repeat 7X*)

[Smooth Bee]
I think I love her
but the Lord only knows if she's the one for me
My true Queen
I can't ask for more physical attraction
Baby girl is real hype
She says she wants to bear my child
Is it because I make hit records
or cause I'm a good lover?
I don't know, I guess I'm a little petrol
Together we do things that I've never done with anyone else
like eat ice cream together, sharing Chinese food
and of course entering each other, endlessly
You see, when I make love to my woman
I like to tear down walls and build new ones
I take her through multiple ecstasy
and this girlie insists that she's my match
My new love level
But I just can't front anymore
I can't feel it
So therefore I must carry on
Just take me to Love Court
cause Smooth Bee's not settling down
Call me a tramp, jiggalo, ho, et cetera
but my jimmy's not for sale
More than one woman's my motto
I'll never be caught stranded with a flat tire and no spare, word
Yeah right
In four more months, you'll be having our child
That's if you intend to have our child
And since we both made this commitment
which brings forth fruit through light
be like a strong tree, with strong roots
And like a strong limb, I'll never fall off
unless the sustainer of all living things, allows it
And I want you to remember baby, that I do love you
I really do

[girls singing]
Some-thing, I can't, ex-plain (*repeat 5X*)

[Greg Nice]
I'm sorry baby, I'm so so sorry
I didn't mean to bruise your delicate flower-like emotions
Listen - I was on some hardcore illusion of what love really is
You know I used to put up a phony forcefield shield
and the whole nine yards
Keep my true feelings, locked deep inside a box
But when your love was so strong, so potent
it was too much for my heart at last
Guess I was somewhat immature, but I've grown up now
Baby you gotta take me back, I'm on the verge of self destruction
I never had a love like yours before
Remember our walks through the park, our cozy dinners for two?
Our exhange of love juices?  MMM-mmm!
Baby, don't throw 'em all away
The only reason I broke like I did, is because
I love - I mean, I couldn't react any other way
Just think - another man, sleepin in my bed
with the one I love?  Please, tch
I'm just too nice for that
Please baby, take some time, think about us, you and I, me and you
I'm sure you'll realize that I'm the one for you
I guess I'll say peace now, and remember baby
please remember, I'll always, and always, always, love you
See you!

[D.J. Teddy Ted]
Baby, you don't love me anymore
I'm not sure you really did before
You see I couldn't see through your phony charms
Nothin really mattered when I took you in my arms
You see I found you so fascinatin
Oh baby so fascinatin
You see I thought you were the one for me
Found out you were nothin but a fantasy
You know, you left me standing lonely
Girl, you left me standing to cry
But yet you weren't woman enough to say goodbye
But there is, there is one thing I must thank you for
You taught me a lesson in life I'll never make the same mistake anymore",Something I Can't Explain,1989

Cause I guess that two loves just won't do, girl
You say you want a love that's new, girl
Between me and him you've got to choose, girl

Verse One: Greg Nice

And when we first met I thought that girl was you
You really captured me, right there from the start
But how was I to know that today you'd break my heart?

Verse Two: Smooth Bee

I bought you Fendi, Louis', diamond rings
Mink jackets all the fly material things

So peep it

[ VERSE 1: Greg Nice ]
I got a shitload of story tales in my sack
Please come in, hang your coat on the rag
While you at it, make my coffee black
So I can get the monkey from off my back
15 cents minus 5 is a dime
Sexy young ladies, let's intertwine
Greg N-i-c-e ran it down the line-line

[ VERSE 2: Preacher Earl ]
I'm the P-r-e-a-c-h-e-r, uh
Preacher Earl and I'm considered a superstar
Pick up the microphone and I proceed to rock 'n roll
By the time I sweat I'm out of control
I'm like a locomotive goin express
My lyrics written in spraypaint on the wall (ssss...) def
I'm from Uptown, I'm a gangster from the projects
Either or, take it all, get much respect
Destined for fame when I'm goin for mine
This, this is how I run it down the line

[ VERSE 3: Melo T ]
Hey yo, beats, styles, mics I be flashin
If you step up step in a orderly fashion
See, I collect the dough for the show and then I'm dashin
House parties I'm crashin, pool parties I'm splashin
Eatin candy yams, drinkin Baby Sham, breakin down ( ? )
Got the masterplan, glance at the Melo stance
Arms are crisscrossed, posture rasta
When I wanna go to the mall, I need a helicopter
Rrrrring - I think that's my time
Yo, (this is how we run it down the line)

[ VERSE 4: Bass Blaster ]
The biggeda-Bass Blaster with a tongue-twistin rhyme
(This is how we run it down the line)
Yo, literally, literary literature
Six slippery Seals slippin silently ashore
Sally sold seashells down by the seashore
Sold two shells but couldn't see to sell no more
Beautiful babblin brooks bubba between blossom and banks
Brothers above the Brooks take a punch off the plank
A big black bug bit a big black bear, bit him on the rear
The bear was big but the bug didn't care, he had no fear
 
How much would could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Yo, I don't know, all I know is I say it good
Asu, you got the funky, funky rhymes
Yo my brother, run it down the line

[ VERSE 5: Asu ]
Yo, rhymes is rippin and the mic is passed to me
It was too young so they got me for statuatory
Don't take me for granted, punk, yeah, and think I'm worthless
Fuck movin mountains I move planets and you'll be earthless
You don't wanna battle Asu, all I leave is fossils
Lethal Weapons Die Harder cause the Mission's Impossible
And my rhymes is riper, I'm ready to come crisper
Old jacks know that so they go back and whisper
Takin surveys, gettin nervous, I'm just too worthy
They can't stand me and say, 'He can't be from Jersey'

[ VERSE 6: Guru ]
Mad, mad response I'm catchin just as soon as I step into the place
That's why a smile's on my face
I got styles that you trace with haste but I'm too deep
Lots of the ladies I meet, I must be sweet
So I say hold up and wait up and then listen here
My rhymes come crisp and clear, but beware
My format is all that, my concept's refined
The Gang to the S-t-a-double r shines
Chumps be losin it, abusin it, not gainin
So there my gain is they vanish while I'm remainin
And twice as Nice with a Smooth groove I end my rhyme
And yo (this is how we run it down the line)

[ VERSE 7: Smooth B ]
Yeah, lyrical, financial and spiritual
A dream of touchin my style would take a miracle
You didn't know how deadly was my flow as I grow
And bumrush and crush any foe
But I prefer to have a good time when I rhyme
But lately I have had to refine and be sublime
Cause sometimes some people don't understand
That I'm a man with ambitious plans and I stand to live grand
And they fight with all their money invested to hold me back
But now I'm featuring the mack pack
Smooth B, you know I'm feelin fine
(This is how we run it down the line)

See that redbone? I already stabbed it
Hold that blunt too long, I'm gonna grab it

Go within, feel your heartbeat, then
Let your soul and mind blend, grin
Now you're at peace with yourself
And that's more than material wealth
Cause everytime I put my mind on God
Things really don't seem so hard
And I can be the man I really want to be
(Smooth) and that's more than an MC
Everytime I rock a mic
It's like ology-psych
And I just want to press on like Lee
And make a movie like Spike
But I proceed to give you what you need
Indeed, my rhymes take heed
Mystical, magical, metaphysical topics
And no one can stop this

This is the way we harmonize

We'll say that we're sorry for keeping you waiting so long

[ VERSE 1: Greg Nice ]
Now countries at war, little kids cry rape
Some are lyin, dyin, cryin, pullin on my cape
Massive meltdown, bring the red tape
Back up victims who caught the vapes
New lp, time to make papes
Get the album, the single, cd and tapes
Stylin, profilin, smilin, buck wildin
As the dough keeps on pilin
Somebody's knockin at my do'
(Who is it?) Somebody's ringin my bell
(Should I let em in?) Oh, what the hell
Flippin my wig like I never did before
Got my rhymes than the mighty Thor
Peace, arrivederci, I'm out the door

Yeah, yeah
Make it rain, mutha

[ VERSE 2: Smooth be	 ]
I'm Smooth be	, I'm at the top of the pile
Rap and sing, cause I'm versatile
Give me an inch, damn right, I'll take a mile
Cause I keep funky fresh routines on file
There's a lot of MC's out there that show and don't prove
Runnin round town, talkin bout they're smooth
They're smooth operators, Smooth imitators
But only one Smooth be	, the smooth originator
Smooth connaisseur, there's no one truer
Select a rhyme, and you'll find that few are
Able to match my professional blend
With Greg Nice by my side I continue to ascend
Movin on up through the lyrical light
I'm like the Alpha Omega, my rhymes will excite
Bust what I'm sayin, cause I'll always exist
And the girl that I select will be an emperess

[ VERSE 3: Greg Nice ]
Now I scooped this high heel, sweet as a shroodle
Found out she liked to eat noodles
For her birthday I bought her a french poodle
Now - get down, get down
It's a Friday night, let's paint the town
Tim Snake on the funky drum sound
Can I tic-toc, ah-ha, toc-tic?
No other than my man Slick Nick is on the mix
25 lashes, 35 licks
As I pose in a mackadocious stand
Maybe one day I might have a band
It ain't gonna rain no more no more
It ain't gonna rain no more
Comin this summer, catch us out on tour
I want to see you (girl next door)
I got more rhymes in store
Watch my hand as I slam the door

[ VERSE 4: Smooth be	 ]
Smooth be	, I'm like a lotus flower, with great power
And all invadin perpetrators I must devour
Excelling to a level in time, not like a vagabond
Not like a rattling snake, I'm not from Babylon
Much like a prince on a throne, within a state of my own
I'm not a kid, I'm grown
Righteously leading a path, my wisdom's shown
Phone calls I'll accept, Smooth, I keep a positive rep
Call me the Tap Dance Man, I never stutter or step
And wrong doing's my mission, it's just influencing you
To benefit, cause I'm legit - and I can't quit
Conversed with prophets on how we must receive our blessings
Studying hard every night, I have reviewed my lessons
And now I'm ready and strong, I'm movin right, not wrong
I'm battling back and forth, like a game of ping-pong
Prevailing victoriously, I must continue to strive
Focussing on destinies to keep my spirit alive",How to Flow,1991
Nice & Smooth,"[Greg Nice]
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
I'm sweeter and thicker than a chico stick
Here's an ice cream cone honey take a lick
I go to Bay Plaza and catch a flick
Wore my Timberland boots so I can stomp ticks
Scandalous get a wiff of this mist
Just like the Yar Boys now I'm blissed
I feel good per say good state of mind
Drive a red Sterling and the seats recline
I love it when a lady treats me kind
Go to Tavern on the Green have a glass of wine
He say, she say I heard it through the grapevine
No static, got an automatic
Too much of anything makes you an addict
Teasin, skeezin, all so pleasin
Don't ask why I got my own reasons
Smooth be	 Greg Nice Slick Nick click
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick...

[Chorus]

[Smooth B]
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 125 and Saint Nick
Waiting on a cab, standing in the rain
Under my heart three clouds of pain
She got the best of me
What was her destiny?
Maybe I should lick her with my nine millime...ter
My mind is in a blur
Cause you could never pay me to think this would occur
Me and this girl Jane Doe was living together
We were inseparable, no one could sever
At least that's what I thought
But later I fought with her substance
And almost ended up in Supreme Court
When I was on the road doing shows getting biz
She was in my penz getting stiffy with her friends
And even when she crashed my whip I didn't flip
My man Slick Nick said Smooth you're starting to slip
Time went on I started noticing weight loss
Then I had to ask her was she riding the white horse
At first she said no, then she said yo Smooth I'm sorry
But I keep having visions of snow, I need blow
And I said whoa, little hottie
I'm not DeLorean, Gambino or Gotti
I don't deal coke, and furthermore you're making me broke
I'll put you in a rehab and I won't tell your folks
And what do you know
In 18 months she came home and I let her back in
And now she's sniffing again...

Tried to bite the style but you can't come near it, fear it
Run for the hills get off the dillz split the mills

Sellin out shows like John Mellencamp
Hype so hype call me Joe Amp
Skins be playin me close like a stamp
Its dark in here, turn on the lamp
End of the month, say what? you got the cramps
Now who is the man with the bag of tricks?
Hey it's not a problem that I can't fix
(And we been doing this since '86)
Now I don't want trouble
I'm humble like Barney Rubble
If you give me trouble, I'll give it back to you double
It ain't nothin but a little razor stubble
And don't make me burst that bubble
I like diamond links and minks and furs
With some cowboy boots without the spurs

        Check out the way we be rippin it
        Sky's the limit, this is how we flippin it

Smooth B:

I'm happy to be alive, never took a dive
Used to hang out with this king who had 43 wives
Didn't know who he loved the most
So they all played him closer than butter on toast
For rhyme or reason, never treason
The kid was always in season
Took me to the players ball and all
Told me always keep my game tight and stand tall
Now I always have love for my people
Especially when they stayin on point like a steeple
But now more than ever we got to stick together
There's been enough bad weather
Take a look around you
I know it seems sometimes like negativity surrounds you
But don't let it stop you from gettim loot
If homegirl's frontin, than play her like a flute
Yo man start fakin than he can get the boot
Cause being on the block broke man ain't cute
Patience persistence
And all praises due for this physical existence
I always say first things first
The last thing on my mind is things can be worse",The Sky's the Limit,1994

The old from the new
The new to the old

Ain't nothin wrong with my pockets stayin fat
No static at all, if so get the gack
You can't beat that with a baseball bat
All I want to do is shine
Make some loot, and sip some wine
Buy me a mansion then recline
Have all the honey dips wine and grine

[Smooth B]
Yo, first no one knew that my skill were tight
That I could rock a mic all long and stay right
Man listen, when it come to rhymes I smell them
I got lyrics locked in my cerebellum
In other words brainstem
Like my man Rakim said, I'm better than the rest of them
I'm a tid bit smoother
I bust a rap like a Luger
I'm dreamy like Krueger
Smooth be	, real in the flesh
Greg Nice my counterpart keepin the vibe fresh
And we can go on
From night to morn
Rippin the mic and leave the stage torn
Never in a scuffle
Cause i can chill in the Bronx
And still do the Hollywood Shuffle
Take it back to the essence
To the jams in the park, ahh everesence
Felt like yesterday
When I was a shorty be	-boy around the way
Cango, nylon, Nike suits and Pumas
I had girls from here to Montezuma
Now things are pretty much the same
But I don't have to rhyme for free and that's the price of fame
I had to learn a lot to protect myself
From those that want what I got
Now, I can be the same like a ?pamphlet?
And before they bight, I throw a damn fit
I gotta keep makin papers
I got no time for no corn ball capers
So here's a word from the wise
If you tryin ask me, your in for a big surprise

How we, we have came to be 
You have came to me 
Although we can't agree 
And I know it often angers me

Hey girl you know you're so damn fine.

And no you shouldn't change for me 
You should change for you, wherever change may be

But the prettiest flower seems to have the most thorns 
We as stubborn as a bull with both horns 
All you got to say is I do, and maybe we can go on 
And no this ain't no song 
If loving you is right, then there ain't no wrong 
Therefore we can't grow long 
Like a man with no arms I just can't hold on 
Knowing that you ain't mine officially 
I've got nothing but love like evidently-d 
So girl I really want to know

Felt there was no moon (no moon)

Nicho Hinojosa,"Yo te di, de mi vida completa 
Mi tiempo mejor
Un lugar en mi alma mi fe y mi valor 
Sin poner para amarte una condición 

Sin mirar, te entregue de mis flores 
Siempre la mejor 
Y lo que no tenia lo invente por amor 
Para que no te fueras yhoy dices adios

Se desgarra mi alma y se rompe mi voz
Se me va por los suelos la vieja ilusion 
De llegr al sendero final tu y yo

Que me valla en silencio con esta canción

Nichola McAuliffe,"I hate men!
I can't abide them, even now and then!
Than ever marry one of them I'd rest a maiden rather,
For husbands are a boring lot and only give you bother!
Of course I'm awfully glad that mother deigned to marry father!
But I hate men!

Of all the types I've ever met within our democracy,
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy!
He may have hair upon his chest, but sister, so has Lassie!
Oh I hate men!

I hate men!
They should be kept like piggys in a pen!
Don't wear a travelling salesman, though a tempting tom he may be,
For on your wedding night he may be off to far Araby!
While he's away in Mandalay, 'tis thee who'll have the baby!
Oh I hate men!

I hate men!
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen!
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism,
He'll always stay at home at night and make no criticism;
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism!
Oh I hate men!

From all I've read alone in bed from A to Zed about them,
Since love is blind, then from the mind all womankind should rout them!
But ladies, you must answer to, ""What would we do without them?"",
Still I hate men!",I Hate Men,1987

But just a crazy group, that never seeks to sosoup,
Around a pack of little on a leash.

And I want to drown in your sea

You've got to give
What you took from me
Now you've got to give
What you took from me
Now you ought to know
What you do to me


Now you've oughta show
What you hideaway from me
What you hide away from you
What you hideaway and keep

When you walk
When you talk
When you reach from me
When you wake
Through my day
Set these feelings free

You've got a look in your eye
You've got a love you can't hide
And I want you to give it to me
And I want to drown in your sea
What you took away from me
What you took away from you
What you hideaway and keep
What you hideaway from you
What you hideaway from me
What you hideaway and keep from me

From you, From me, To you….",Hideaway,1999
Nicholas Dodd,"I'm gonna resurrect it
I'm gonna give it to yer
I'm gonna celebrate it
I'm gonna elevate yer

I need some confirmation
Of a new sensation
And it's a revelation
And what I've got to say is

Take me high high high high higher
Take me high high high high higher

Let the rhythm fall out
Let the feeling flow in
You are never without
When you let it begin

Got a big new spaceship
I'm Gonna beam me up in
I'm gonna detonate it
To a new dimension

I'm gonna levitate you
I'm gonna redirect it
I got a good vibration
I'm gonna give it to you

Take me high high high high higher
Take me high high high high higher

Take me higher

If you ever reach me
Beyond the circumstances
I'm like a burning comet
Breaking out of trances
It's an endless journey
Through a sleepless night
With love that's burning
Clean out of sight

Take me high high high high higher
Take me high high high high higher

Take me High",Higher,1999
Nicholas Dodd,"Take a good look
In your own time
See the world laugh
Through a child's eyes
Sunshine
Shine until you're mine
It's just a magic hour
Just a magic hour
Such a magic hour
Now I know we can drift away now
If only we find a way how
Now I know we can drift away now, how
If only to find a way out,how
Take a good look
In your own time
See the world turn
Through your own eyes
Sunshine
Shine until you're mine
It's just a magic hour
Such a magic hour
Such a magic hour
Now I know we can drift away now
If only we find a way how
Now I know we can drift away now
If only we find a way out
Now I know we can drift away now, how
If only we find a way how
I know we can drift away now, how
We've only to find a way out
Well I know we can drift away now
If only we find our way how
Now I know we can drift away now 
If only we find a way out
Out, out, out, out",Magic Hour,1999
Nicholas Dodd,"The warmth of the sun, it feels healing
Warming the cold in my mind
An ocean of Space sends me reeling
Easing my passage through time
Leaving it all behind

When she is gone she is gone
And when she just falls she just falls
Far too long

She just falls way beyond
She just falls where she belongs

Cool of the shade feels relieving
Cracks that appear in my hide
The key to the day is withstanding
The Kingdoms that fall and rise
Leaving them all behind

When she is gone she is gone
And when she falls she just falls
Far too long

She just
falls way beyond
She just
falls where she belongs

Cool of the shade
Cool of the shade in my mind
Warmth of the sun
Warmth of the sun in my eyes
Falls way beyond - she just falls she belongs

Falls she is gone",She Falls,1999
Nicholas Dodd,"Va, pensiero, sull'ali dorate
Cross the mountains and fly over the oceans
Reach the land, find the place where all children go
Every night after listening to this lullaby,
There you'll find their heroes alive, protecting their innocence.
Bless them all, their simple soul so pure and so wonderful.

Va, pensiero, sull'ali dorate
Let this beautiful dream carry on for all night long

Arpa d'or dei fatidici vati
Perché muta dal salice pendi?
Le memorie nel petto raccendi
Ci favella del tempo del tempo che fu!

Va, pensiero, sull'ali dorate
Va, ti posa sui clivi, sui colli
Ove olezzano tepide e molli
L'aure dolci del suolo natal!

Every night after listening to this lullaby!","Va, Pensiero",2001
Nicholas Dodd,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wings","Volare, for voice & orchestra (aka, ""Nel blu dipinto di blu"")",2001
