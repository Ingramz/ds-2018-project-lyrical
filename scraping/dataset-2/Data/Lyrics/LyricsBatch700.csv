Mavis Staples,"Seems like yesterday 
You were in my arms 
And in a special way 
You touched my heart with all your charms. 
Now you're gone 
And I find myself 
Baby, I'm all alone 
And there's no love left. 

 Hey! Hey! 

Don't know why I failed. 
For you I've always cared 
And I did all I know 
To win your love and make it so 
You'd always stay 
But you turned away. 
Honey, what could I say? 
How could you 
How could you do me this way? 

Cuz I'm chained 
To your love and affection. 
Chained cuz your love 
Is my only direction 

Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh. 
I've got to make it right 
Somehow it all went wrong 
Somewhere down the line 
The love I lost 
The love I gotta find 
Whoah! and it won't be long 
I've gotta make it right baby 
And carry you tenderly back home. 

I'm chained 
To your love and affection. 
Baby, chained to your love. 
When I hear your name 
How I tremble, how I tremeble, yeah. 
Honey, you know, honey, you know, yeah. 

Now I admit that I 
Haven't been the perfect guy 
For a girl as sweet as you 
But my heart and soul cries out to you. 

One more chance that's all I need 
 I'm gonna make it right, baby, 
Now you just stay won't you stay with me? 

Cuz I'm chained 
To your love and afection.

Mavis Staples,"Monday's so good
Tuesday's so cruel
One day you're so happy now

Mavis Staples,"I've been to the mountain top 
I've been to the valley low 
The one thing that never stopped 
Was the love that my family showed 
When my mama she passed away 
My papa he gave us hope 
He said there won't ever come a day 
When your family won't help you cope 

As sure as Moses' staff parted the water 
As sure as Cain had to pay four his crime 
As sure as no one wants to be brokenhearted 
That's how sure I am that blood is thicker than time 

Well 
We went to church on Sunday mornin' (Oh yeah) 
All dressed up lookin' mighty fine 
The spirit came without a warning 
Intoxicated us all like wine 
Don't it make you stop and wonder 
Why we kill our own kind every day? 
Why can't we get along with each other 
When we damn well know it's the only way? 

As sure as Moses' staff parted the water 
As sure as Cain had to pay four his crime 
As sure as no one wants to be brokenhearted 
That's how sure I am that blood is thicker than time

Rub my face in the mud and then you lie behind my back

You never asked me what I need

Just how bad you treated me 
Maybe the love we had, it just weren't meant to be

It's goin' be hard for me to let go, but I Can't turn back 

Well, hey! 
Oh Lord 

Haven't I tried to treat you right? 
So why do you go out every night 
Chasin' the same old thing when I got just what you need?

Wrote a song for truth.

Work what you're waiting for
Work put your back in it
Work justa a little bit more
Work sure you're wanting it now
Work till your body's hurting
Work working hard and long
Work when you finish that
Work I want you God damn tongue

Go down, go down, go down
Come up, come up, come up
Go down, go down, go down
Come up, come up, come up 

Ladies, you know that if you don't have a yard man
You can't be a hard man
You know what I'm talking about
Guys you know what I'm talking about too, not so?

And if a man want to test you, tell him come, come
And if a man want to test you, tell him come, come
So if a boy want to test you, tell him come, come
And if a man want to test you, tell him come, come

Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Max,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hier kommen drei MC's, bekannt für Rap-Parts, die Stil haben
Samy Deluxe, Luxus Chris und Maximilian!

Viele Rapper kommen nicht voran in ihren Texten
Es ist, wie wenn ein DJ immer nur mit einer Zeile backspinnt
Wir sind wie Show & AG angekommen auf dem nächsten Level
Also nick' zum Beat und lass dich von den Texten fesseln
Wir studieren den Musikmarkt, planen unsere Invasionen
Denn dort ging Hip Hop verloren, und es gibt Props als Finderlohn
Viele behandeln Rap heutzutage wie 'n Leihwagen
Achten nicht auf echte MC's, wie uns, die das Leid tragen
Wollen nach kurzen Fahrten lieber in anderen Sparten einparken
Und schnell noch Miss Poprock auf 'ne Spritztour einladen
Und wo sie heiraten läuft auf allen Musikkanälen die Hochzeit
Und danach stehen noch mehr dieser Lackaffen im Spotlight
Die nix andres verkörpern können als Glamour und Luxus
Hiphop ist schutzlos, du siehst, dass er zerstört wird, aber guckst bloß
Und so sieht's aus! Die Täter konnten fliehen, blieben anonym
Fingen an sich rapmässig anzuziehen, und hüpften wie mit Trampolin
Meinen, dass sie Leute animieren, aber verlieren nur Kalorien
Sagen nichts wie Pantomimen; Musik ist nicht da, um sie anzuziehen
Hör lieber hin, erkenn wer die Erfinder, und wer die Diebe sind
Wir sind die Effektiveren: Samy, Max und die Stieber Twins

Yeah! Die euch den echten Rap wiederbringen, genauso so real sind
Wie ihre Lieder klingen! Maximilian

Ich lag im Fieber mit Malaria, vollgepumt mit Lariam
Visionen wie Mohammed, als er am Berge Hira war
Raps kamen inflationär wie der serbische Dinar
Check Samy Deluxe, Chris, Mar und Maximilian
Das Leben ist mehr, als Mics, Beats und Samsemilla
Dolce Vita, Deutschmarks und Senoritas
Auch wir lieben das, nur nichts währt ewig
Das Geschäft ist schnelllebig, doch Geld macht behäbig
Was über den Äther geht ist bestenfalls medioker
Ich geb keinen Eurocent auf Eurotrashbands im Medienpoker
Die die Charts mit ihrem Scheiß erobern
Zeit das wir Styles anfordern
Wollt ihr Cyphers oder Seifenopern?
Hypokrisis im Hip Hop Bizz bringen die Scene in Misskredit
Wisst ihr was 'n Bitchmove is?
Sich mit fremden Federn schmücken, was?
Ins Licht der Szene rücken, was? Sich für die Medien bücken, was?
Beißen wollen wie Tse-Tse Mücken
Der Shit macht mich krank wie Malaria
Ihr habt mehr als nur Musik auf dem Gewissen wie Frank Farian
Wir scheinen, aber blenden nicht, reflektieren und spenden Licht
Aber brennen mit Esperanto international verständlich!
Also holt euch den Scheiß, weil auch Freundeskreis um die Fäulnis weiß

Konstruier mein Rapkonzept am Reissbrett wie Architekt
Vergiss dein Papi, der sein Ferrari in der Garage pflegt
Ich geh' zu Steve, der für Kies auf der Strasse breakt
Hip Hop lebt, wenn sich auch dein Arsch mitbewegt
Stieber Twins und Mad Max, präziser wie Skinny Caps
Mit Metro schneller, als Stars in Yellow Cabs
Vergiss mal Midi, Synthi, Presets, ich komm wie Grandmaster Caz mit Klartext auf Crossbacks
Scheiss auf Gesellschaft, in der nur der lacht
Der die Brüder Grimm tausendfach auf Tasche hat
Ach, deine Prachtyacht am Mittelmeer, millionenschwer
Umzäunt von Stacheldraht, weil Armut lange Finger macht
Ey, Yuppi mit Golfhobby, dir fehlt Profil, Mann, genau wie Dunlop
Die ohne Pit Stops durchs Ziel fahren
Chris und Maximilian beobachten wie Sielmann
Tiger, wie Shirkan, die wegen Zebras am Nil waren
Überleg! Deine DNA ist seit diesem Jahr veränderbar
Wie Bomber der USA das Klima in Hiroshima
Doch eins ist klar egal, ob dein Scheiß oben oder unten war
Evergreens sind immer da, der Rest Drosophila
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

You're not looking for me
You're just lookin' for another type of man

Oh baby I just wonder

Okay, I could be your Elvis, you could be Priscilla Presley
Caught you looking at me like you might want to undress me

But damn, that was vicious, ooh I admit it
I just want you to fly with me, fly with me
No other language, I can't explain it
I just want you to fly with me, fly with me

Had a crazy ass a long time ago

Love what you do
And the love will come back to you tenfold

Max,"Right here, right now, I put the offer out
I don't wanna chase you down
I know you see it, you run with me
And I can cut you free out of the treachery and walls you keep in
So trade your typical for something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

Don't you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do, or you can do like me
Stay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key
Yo, damn, suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side

Okay, my friend, you wanna cut me in
Well I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no, I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do
You're onto something, really, it's something
But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you

Don't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play
'Cause I got what I need and I don't wanna take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do, I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn, can't you see I'm doing fine?
I don't need to see the other side

Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays
If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns
But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream
And it'll wake you up and cure your aching
Take your walls and start 'em breaking
Now that's a deal that seems worth taking
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

Well it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?
Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen
I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine
Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime?
Fifteen
I'd do eight
Twelve
Maybe nine
Ten

Don't you wanna get away to a whole new part you're gonna play
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
So we can do like I do, so if you do like me
Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key
Oh, damn, suddenly we're free to fly
We're going to the other side

So if you do like I do (to the other side)
So if you do like me (we're going to the other side)

Fuck it, it's my life nigga

This is a dream of a hustler
I had the butter and the fiends was in love with us
We copped the gutta, not a team that could fuck with us
And word to mother keep the thing in every truck with us

Now I was fronting like Rich was and some of my bitches
Was going so hard, got some of us sick thugs
And minor setbacks got some of us tripped up
But the guns we done gripped up so we coming to get ya

And fuck the local authorities
And hope the big boys don't pick up my case
'Cause for these big toys and these chips, we get chased
Playing ball just like the Orioles to get to 1st base

But the goons on 2nd, bust on 3rd
You know they move with the weapons, get bucks off birds
It's like I'm playing Chicken with my life
Tryna get this paper moving pitches for a price

I come to ride out with them niggas, baby, we getting figures
It's byrd gang, we doing it big
But we towered up, get the Remy I'll need a cup
You slippin' good, can I get a squeeze?

I don't think you want it with them niggas
'Cause them hammers they won't hesitate to squeeze
We on the road, travel 'cross the globe
All my homies ain't diggin' cheese

Look the nightmares of a trap star
With white tees, Nike air's and my fast car
D.A tryna wrap me in the charge
But I just bought some V's and a pack in my garage

Now me rapping what's the odds?
We the last crew standing diplomats now in charge
Yeah, 300 for the light show
Another hundred on the hand to watch the ice glow

Another 10 grand to watch the dice roll
Trying to let you motherfuckers see this how my life go
The bright lights and this big city
I'ma live the nightlife until the pigs get me

Range Roving, Big Truck Series
The chain frozen, big chunk jewelry
White girls say he's all semi cool
But you don't want to cost him 'cause he got a short fuse

I come to ride out with them niggas, baby, we getting figures
It's byrd gang, we doing it big
But we towered up, get the Remy I'll need a cup
You slippin' good, can I get a squeeze?

I don't think you want it with them niggas
'Cause them hammers they won't hesitate to squeeze
We on the road, travel 'cross the globe
All my homies and they get cheese

We live life on reality and we flip white for a salary
You might catch us at the light in the lavish V
But watch them 'Blue And Whites', try and grab a G

Making some chips so the hate's getting thick
Watch the world through my tint, smoking haze in the whip
Contemplate, maybe take a little trip
Ocean Drive heavy glean in my neck chillin'

Call up cabs, rushing drinks out of 'Wet Willies'
""Eu Seuy O Balling"", but y'all foolish
Getting locked up for crimes and ya lawyer's ain't Jewish
That's why I keep the Turnie's on the tainer

'Cause every time I turn I'm getting chained up
They say what they want to search, tryna tame us
I think they mad we from the turf and we dangerous
And my whole crew icey we playing hockey like the rangers

It's byrd gang, we doing it big
But we towered up, get the Remy I'll need a cup
You slippin' good, can I get a squeeze?

Ho stand me? For all my ballers, my day crawlers... It's bigger than Nino Brown

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

It must of been a obsession, Had to make it large (Dreams)
Started my progression, I'd stay stayed with the huds (Down South)
Now it's private jets, smokin' haze what the stars (G4)
Quarter mill write the check is how we for the car (What's The Price?)
Switchin' lanes up 7th, Are we racin' the cars (Harlem)
But the boys still stressin', I'm facin' the charge (Yay-Ya Be Trippin')
Still prayin' to God, Cause lifes not promised, not even manana (Fuck tomorrow)
Remember movin' bricks, paranoid bout ehanas
Or even at the club, an them boys and then behind us
I'm chasin' death, gettin' closer to 30 (Gettin Older)
Sunny outside, but the work is dirty
Days out, Harlem nights, over in Jersey
In my rare view goin' home cause the vultures is thirsty (I See Em)
Pull that doubt you won't catch me in traffic
Dark tints on the V, when I lack it's the ratchet, bastidd

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

Now I'm the leader of the pack, Can't help to think back
How I was eager to sell crack, I thought it was the shit (Damn)
When they talk about my influence, I thought of uncle Ricky (Uncle Ricky Wha's Good)
He used to call up on his flip, he start snortin' on his shit
The same life had me gas'd, when I bought my first vic
I was heavy on the gas, when I bought my first whip
I thought I was the shit, you couldn't tell me nothing
I was 16, I told the teacha ""You can feel me fuck em"" (Feel Me Nigga)
Just any suits, pullin' up to club in Beamer coups
Gettin' cash (Gettin' Cash)
We livin' fast (Fast)
Different women every night, couple of bitches clashed (Fuck You Bitches)
I just laughed (Ha ha ha ha ha ha, Now Listen)
I almost got wiped out on the wave, Thought 11 was tsunami
For the prices of the yay (Fuck The City Up)
The hustlas, they know the saga of the story (I Know The Story)
We live sucka free and show problems to authority

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

One... Two, Feds comin' for you
Three... Four, Betta' watch the law
Five... Six, If you start pumpin' bricks
Seven... Eight, hope it ain't heavy weight

Ferrari dreams, feds spooked me in my nightmare
I tried to scream like Freddy Kruegers' in my nightmare (Livin' For The Fame)
So a nigga scared to go to sleep
Until the day break, I'm tearin' up the street
Porsche'n with the clutch, ballin' like the play off's
Top goin' 40 on the floor, with the safe off
12 car convoyed a road full of race cars
Till' the pilot give me 5 minutes before he take off (Roll Up)

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

That's my conclusion... See it's the fast life we livin'...
So I'm ah tell you, if you in the left lane
Keep going cause they right on your heels nigga (Squalieee)
And if they catch you, that's your ass...
And if you blink nigga, your life could be over (We Got No Time For Sleep)
I keep sayin' the rap game is like the crack game
Cause we could all end up dead or in jail
They got us under surveillance...
And to all my niggas behind the g-wall (My Soldiers)
Inhale, exhale... Shake your nuts if you have to (East Side)
And all the political soldiers that ain't never comin' home (RIP Too)
To all my homies, East Side...
While you in your cell, raise hell to this (Roll Call)
I do this for ya'll (Dipset)... I feel ya' pain (I'm On The Same Route)
I know what it's like hittin' the streets at ah early age to deal cocaine (It's Ah Cold World)
Survival, It's all about the struggle (We Gotta' Eat)...
So I dedicate this to you (My Soldiers)
Keep your head up and your eyes open...
Stay focused, It's us against them
I'd never let them take me alive, take me alive..

Take a journey wit ya' boy, let's ride..

Max B,"Bird gang Club Banger
Tryin' to holla at you shorty
One focus, one focus only
Tryin' to hit that thang, let's go

We make hits in the studio nightly
We out trying to get this money
We take trips in the winter in jet planes
To climates where it's sunny

We got mami on the dance floor
Grindin' to the beat, tipsy off the bubbly
But at the end of the day, we feelin' to play
I'm tryin' to pin the tail on the donkey

It goes yes, yes yo, fresh to death balla
You can play hard, under pressure I'm stoned
We playin' tight D, I'm in the paint like a G
Some say they gangstas but they ain't like me

Came from an environment, came I was firin'
Then hit the dealers see the range I was buyin'
Don't test drive like a whole whip like you should
Shoving up pies, a whole whip that you should

Then take the proceeds, waist about four G's
Bottles in the club tryin' to get the home and skeez
I'm tryin' to get the dame to breeze
But she putting up a fight like Layla Ali

I told the lady I'll be doin' the turnpike 80 in the fly V
Middle name 40 on the wrist
Last name you can't afford me bitch
Get a camcorder bitch

We make hits in the studio nightly
We out trying to get this money
We take trips in the winter in jet planes
To climates where it's sunny

We got mami on the dance floor
Grindin' to the beat, tipsy off the bubbly
But at the end of the day, we feelin' to play
I'm tryin' to pin the tail on the donkey

Cases of purée, rosé
Look like Picasso painted on the bottles
We throwin' money, we lookin' like lotto's
I could cover chicks with cheese like nachos

Fly out the cove, land in the heat where
New York to Miami bitch
Bitch, I'm in the life of a hood star, rock star without the guitar
Got em' all rubbin' they bitch bra

Got em' all shakin' their tush like
I'ma givin' 'em a taste of the good life
But I give 'em a taste of the good liquor, a taste of the good bud
Next thing you know she'll be tastin' my good

I get money be quiet, you talkin' to the jolly green giant
I see it, I like it, I buy it
Baby I'm flyer then a pilot
Flyin' at his highest, climb it

We make hits in the studio nightly
We out trying to get this money
We take trips in the winter in jet planes
To climates where it's sunny

We got mami on the dance floor
Grindin' to the beat, tipsy off the bubbly
But at the end of the day, we feelin' to play
I'm tryin' to pin the tail on the donkey

Where are my homies? Up to no good
Where are my homies? Yup I'm so hood
What up pimpin', pimpin', I'm exempt already
See my hoes are like my plates, temporary

Act nil you beat it, move on strategic
The marbles man, yup the floors are heated
Cam half pound a quart a kid better ask 'round
I'm sorta needed mack rounds you're deceited

In the 90's, Z3, BB's
Now in the crib the TVs watch TVs
Killen Killen, mo killen and then a kitty purrs
Fuck furs, his and hers, Bentley spurs

Gun talk, real talk, speak mack to mack
We like the Pistons, Bulls, you know back to back
Mazirattis back to back, come ride wit me
On 11 hundred, not the pipe, two five fifties

We make hits in the studio nightly
We out trying to get this money
We take trips in the winter in jet planes

Made it rain on them bitches a bucket full of ones

We got them gold diggers, cold bitches
That wanna party off patron liquor, car hoppers the hard stoppers
Catch 'em at the party call 'em bar hoppers
We live up in the sky you call 'em star watchers

They chase dope boys trap stars with fast cars
And executives rap stars with black cars
So we could swipe it charge it to the game

She likes the finer things and fuck with niggaz whose money is right
Ain't nothin' like the love of my life

She love the dick suck it till it cum
She say I'm the best fuck of her life
She give a nigga the energy he need
Whenever he feels nothin' is right

Now we in M.I. party till the noon
Hammers in the ride Ferrari's go zoom
All types of incidentals charges on my room
From last night buggin', we mobbin' with the goons

We hit the town hard, fuckin' with the ladies
Bottles of viva clique, puffin' on the hazy
It's all deja vu seen it all before
Got her in my drop heater on the floor

So I sped off from the spot, gettin' heady rock
Got her in the telly she wouldn't let a nigga pop
And when I woke all I seen was a note
Nigga follow the trail and meet me in A T L

Now we pull up in the a shoppin' in Lenox mall
Gotta get fly squad ready to ball
We thinkin' 112 or maybe even visions
Drinks at the bar like baby what you sippin'

Then she told me magic city fat asses and they pretty
They got me blowin' thousands throwin' stacks by the fifty
Got some bitches out of strokers gotta get focus
I'm tryin' to play my cards like a game of strip poker

Flight up in the mornin' gotta get up on her
When I leave you can tell ya friends about my performance
And all the time M.O.B. on my mind
The weekend was nice baby but I'm back to N.Y.

First - you stole Roc-A-Fella from Dame
Second - you stole Kanye from Dame
Third - you stole Roc-A-Wear from Dame
Forth - I seen the nigga throw that diamond up before them shots was fired
Fifth - hold on, turn the beat off
I had to turn the beat off for this
You talkin bout you a 80's baby
You 37 years old, you was born in 1968 and I open the daily news
How's the king of new york rocking sandals with jeans?
Open toe sandals with choncletas with jeans on
How's the king of New York rocking sandals with jeans and he 42 years old?
Back to business

[Verse 1: Cam'Ron]
You ain't the only one with big wallets
Got it, my shits brollic, dot it
But your publishing should go to Mrs. Wallace
Honest. Stealing +BIG+ shit, he made 2 albums, you wildin
And he can't dress dog who styled 'em
It was Roc-a-Wear, when Dame had it
Now you got it, call it +Cock-a-wear+,(you got it on) huh not in here (nope)
Dead it pronto, you won't see a car. No
Dame and Biggs bitch for years, now you Juan hoe
(Go to Lennox & Broadway you dumb ass nigga)
He own the 40/40 got you in Atlantic City
Bitched your budget outta baseline, goddamn it's pretty
You love a Harlem nigga we get it cookin' it's true
But now I look we got more dudes in Brooklyn then you
Appar-ently right? Down in Jeezy video
I shoulda kissed you on the cheek, you a pretty ho (ask Weezy, Weezy was there)
At Jaz video you starred in it, Peter Pan (Hawaiian Sophie)
I was hopping off the greyhound, Peter Pan
(Call him Hawaiian Sophie from now on)
How could he be the man? (huh)
Only reason fam I don't suck dick or kiss ass and I'm consided, damn
But we hawk yo, right where you walk ho (right where you walk)
You can fool the rest of the world long as New York know
We put you underground clown ain't gone check to sell-us (cellars)
I know he 40 years old, I don't respect my elders
I respect the hustlers, plus the grinders and the sellers
Yous a customer buster, here go jet propellers

[Chorus 2X: Max B]
You gotta hate us the way we getting this paper
All my niggaz is coming strait from minimum wages
Niggaz dick ridin the dips steady tryin to play us (Quit trying to spray us)
But for robbery we gotta new flavor (DipSet)

Who can fuck with me? No mammal, but we tote handles
Atcha open toe sandals, and you look like Joe Camel (go smoke some cigarettes)
Off of Rocafella right? no contact
But Busta fly joints, they put us out the contract
I left the label right, lot of cats wonder how
Everytime I diss that label I get fined a hundred thou'
Jus for tellin y'all I get fined a hundred thou' (This is crazy)
Huh them cats are ill, 5 times a half a mil
Wanna play like a bumper sticker smack a grill
Paul Wall cap a grill but them cats are daffy dills (put flowers on them niggaz)
East coast west coast slang yo cap ya peel
Down in Houston ask be I'ma mack forreal
Heck you tell me, respect, better dwell me
Beyonce fiance, check my 2nd LP (check my second album)
I might bring it back, that's your girl, that's your world
Had the thing, fucking singing bout slinging crack (word)
Mr. Rocafella stop, stop, stop it fellas (stop)
Still got our acapellas, but I will Akinel her
""Put it in ya mouth-Put it in ya mouth""
It ain't my fault I'm raw
I'm sorry be but I want a war
And he stabbed ""Un"" (Lance Rivera) over Charli Baltimore (fucking faggot)
Sucker for love, nuh-nuh sucker for love
Killa bitch go to trial handy stuff in the glove
I'ma hop in the bed, dog gon jus pop off her head (you know what is is)
Tell ""Oh Jay-Z chill, Cochran is dead""

'Cause when these bullets hit yo' ass I'm like it's only a gat

I need a funeral to feel good, I'm hopin it's yours
Think he religious? Heard he got shot in the cross
Holiday Styles, bitch I broke most of the laws
Fuck with the Porsche or flip to the boots, stick to the truth

Do anything it takes just to get me this loot
And missin' a tooth, but both of 'em chipped, toaster is gripped
You heard about the trouble, I start most of the shit
When I squeeze ain't no controllin' the wrist

And niggas leave the room when they hear the P flowin to Swizz
I'm an ignorant and negative nigga
I sell crack, bust guns, pop shit, and say I'm better than niggas
You think not, I'll look at your man and level a nigga

If you think a rapper's better why don't you give me his name
So I can run up on him, tear him up and give you his frame
When it comes to the streets, I'm the nigga to call
Five eight and three quarters, but I'm bigger than why'all

If I left the gun home, I'ma give you the sword
I'm the devil in the flesh, I can't give you the Lord
It don't make no sense for you to pray for your life
I got my niggas in the crib, you oughta pray for your wife

You know the P carry the gun, live in the Maz'
Tell niggas show me the money and gimme the stash
I like Malibu and pineapple, fifties of hash

Hundreds of 'dro, wear my clothes a week in a row
Sleep on the floor, catch me right next to the dog
I'm Holiday Styles, and that's what the weaponry for
And I probably won't blow for the fact that I'm hard

But I'm good with ten million in the back of the car
Either that or get life and lift the rack in the yard
Gettin' jewels from the old timers, stashin the cards
But jail ain't part of the plans

I keep weight on the scale 'cause I feel I get further with grams
In my last few bars, I run through niggas like my last few cars
And crash 'em up, the boy mighta went platinum but don't gas him up
I get his length and his width and get his casket cut

I don't deal with the snakes and fakes
But I deal with the comas and wakes, I don't make mistakes

Blow up your face, blow up the coke, and blow up the smoke

Nice to finally meetcha,
Heard so much about you,
And I hope it's all true.

Yes, such arrogance!

I'm the Spider,
Crawl inside her!

I'm gonna show you this once,
And then you're gonna do it!

But they still treat you like you're a kid.
It must hurt so bad,
With a knife in you're back

Oh, oh, oh,

They don't understand,
This is their last chance,
No more idle hands,
You'll destroy the lamps.
Then they'll know,
Whose in control

Brings those lamps back to me,
Don't leave them in once piece,
Make sure there's a crowd, 
Then tear them to the ground!

Brings those lamps back to me,
Don't leave them in once piece,
It's your chance for revenge!
This'll show them!

Now it's your turn, 
Come on!

They underestimate you and your gift!

Tear those lamps to the ground!
Let them cry their eyes out!
Tear those lamps to the ground!
Let them hear the sound!

The seed had been sown. 
Now the evil would grow his keen 
Young veins were ripe for this aim.
So Ahrima set forth to 
Use the lamps as a torch,
And with everyone around, 
He tore them to the ground!
And suddenly, without warning, 
Their creation was burning!
Their design, ignited!
All that hard work, slighted!
So Toba the Tura was sent to
Hold Ahrima responsible for his mess,
To ban him to this fiery abyss!

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Max Boyce,"During the North African campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had
Been on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The
Next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant
Commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer
The text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took
Them out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread
Them out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, ""Soldier, put away those
Cards."" After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and
Brought before the Provost Marshall

The Marshall said, ""Sergeant, why have you brought this man
Here?"" ""For playing cards in church, Sir."" ""And what have you to say for
Yourself, son?"" ""Much, Sir,"" replied the soldier. The Marshall said, ""I
Hope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever
Punished."" The soldier said, ""Sir, I have been on the march for about six
Days. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy
You, Sir, with the purity of my intentions."" And with that, the boy
Started his story:

""You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there
Is but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into
Two parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think
Of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I
Think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew

Mark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five
Wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were
Wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the
Six, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and
Earth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God
Rested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the
Eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was
Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I
Think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn't
Even thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God
Handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it
Reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I
See the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of
Heaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number
Of spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the
Number of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of
Months in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter
So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a
Prayer Book.""

Max Bygraves,"During the North African campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had
Been on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The
Next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant
Commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer
The text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took
Them out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread
Them out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, ""Soldier, put away those
Cards."" After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and
Brought before the Provost Marshall

The Marshall said, ""Sergeant, why have you brought this man
Here?"" ""For playing cards in church, Sir."" ""And what have you to say for
Yourself, son?"" ""Much, Sir,"" replied the soldier. The Marshall said, ""I
Hope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever
Punished."" The soldier said, ""Sir, I have been on the march for about six
Days. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy
You, Sir, with the purity of my intentions."" And with that, the boy
Started his story:

""You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there
Is but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into
Two parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think
Of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I
Think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew

Mark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five
Wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were
Wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the
Six, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and
Earth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God
Rested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the
Eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was
Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I
Think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn't
Even thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God
Handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it
Reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I
See the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of
Heaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number
Of spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the
Number of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of
Months in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter
So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a
Prayer Book.""

As ransom in return for my soul's silhouette.
How deep does shit get? 
Is it worth the Bentley's 
And jets in this jungle of sheer cons 
And devils with breasts. 
I mean does everything happen for a reason, 
The change of seasons, 
Even the slugs screamin' to stop you from breathin'. 
It seems we're all a target in this mosh pit. 
The world be spinnin' lopsided, that's
Why I have my logic. 

We are what we are, musical contrast
Sound clash, bomb blast 
We are what we are, musical contrast
Sound clash, bomb blast 
So don't tell me how to act, how to be, how to live 
We are what we are, forever live or die 
Don't tell me how to act, how to be, how to live 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

My conspiracy theory threatens national security, speaking clearly, 
You assholes don't hear me. 
Walked the psychopath of Timothy Leary 
When cell therapy wasn't curing me, 
God put fear in me, scaring me. 
R-I-P Kamau Jahi, quiet warrior with dignity, 
Still with me spiritually, forever in memory. 
Cut throat, who ill as me?
Soulfly. Flight attendants ain't got shit on me. 
You reap what you sow, 
So I try my hardest to harvest good crops regardless 
If most artists are garbage
With godless content. 
To be honest, the chronic plus my fondness of alcoholic products 
Held my spirit in bondage like convicts. 

Gettin' blunted wasn't pungent,
Overabundance of dumb shit had me living low-budget. Conflict. 
Indo had my mental growth stunted, cut friends out my circumference I used to run with. 
Rose above it. Fuck thuggin' and clubbin', 
I got one in the oven, 
Plus my girl's talkin' husband, she buggin'. 
My method of flowin' expression through poem, 
Salt of the Earth like the ocean, God's chosen spokesman. 
Creation to cremation, to be blatant, fuck Satan, 
Paper chasin' motherfuckers facing damnation. 
Girls actin' fly with no interest in aviation, fuck station, radio
Waves is just radiation. 

We are what we are, musical contrast, sound clash, bomb blast 
We are what we are, musical contrast, sound clash, bomb blast 
You don't feel when I bleed, when I scream, when I feel 
We are what we are, forever live or die 
You don't know how I feel, what is real, what's the deal 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

Cutthroat Logic, 
The newest extension of the Soulfly Tribe 
From now until the day that I die. 
Can't you tell by the pain in my eyes 
That with this music I will bring my dream to life. 
Stressed the F out, losin' my mind, 
I wanna blow up right now 
But I know it takes time. 
Like slanging saxs to takin' elbows across the state lines,
From 22's to tec 9's swag to kind. 
Underground to worldwide, I will never die, 
Forever my words in my rhymes they gonna keep me alive. 
So onward I strive each 
And every day of my life as I fight to keep K-RAB's dream alive. 
Forever my better half from fightin' to makin' cash. 
Some things in life are fucked up,
Wish I could take 'em back. 
But I live life with no regrets 
So I just look back on life and laugh.

We are what we are, musical contrast, sound clash, bomb blast 
In memory of D-LOW I carry this pain 
We are what we are, I know you understand 
In memory of D-LOW I carved your name 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

Got Catholics in confession 
And 5-percenters studying lessons 
While the youth smoke Buddha for blessing.
I hear you fuckers on vinyl praising false idols, 
Claiming Gods and dogs and other fraud titles, to rival. 
My recital's laced with the Bible, life is just a time trial, 
I'm trying to make the finals. 
March madness in the land of savages, 
I'm stranded, a magnet for static so I combat it diplomatic, nomadic, 
What I'm tatted, my cross my only baggage, 
Roots go back to Africa, I'm not Asiatic. 
Brothas mastered mathematics and still they can't add it. 
My quest isn't cabbage although it's nice to have it, 
Rock the planet, like volcanic magma fragments, 
As my lava cools a lot of fools take me for granite. 
I just wanna meet the trinity and live for infinity, 
Laugh at the enemy, when I get there who cares who remember me, on Earth. 

Since birth my dome had afro turf, ask the nurse, 
I heard a verse that said, ""who's last is first"", 
So I keep my flesh humble 'cause I'm still-skinned like Rumple, 
Average a triple double and keep my game subtle, 
Jam harder, than Vince on all ballers from bench to starter 
Since I slaughter holler, murda, on Shawn Carter,
No honor with robbers, 
So I pray to my godfather 
And my conscience isn't bothered by how I get my dollars.

Max Cavalera,"Intentions are clear, sleeper cells will revive
Threaten to destroy this land which we thrive
Call for a bloodbath played out on home soil
Aim to detach us from this mortal coil
Religious conversion is their demand
Declare submission or die by their hands

I am infidel, forever shall be
I will not be swayed by outdated beliefs
A doctrine that's outlined by decades of dread
Of suicide bombers and human warheads
Public beheadings, a call for payback
A blood-chilling omen, impending attack

Bring the war to our shore
Revered homeland
A wrathful legion
Under command
No room for cowards
Fight where you stand!

Hellfire rains down on our adversaries
Direct response to their ancient decree
We know the rhetoric, we've heard the alarms
We need no government to lead us to arms
The ranks are broken, like insects they swarm
Their assets weaken and losses are great
Commandos march under a banner of hate

Bring the war to our shore
Revered homeland

Esploso troppo presto fra le mani 
E cara Valentina che fatica innaturale perdonare a me stesso 
Di essere io di essere fatto così male 

Cara Valentina il tempo non fa il suo dovere 
E a volte peggiora le cose 

E tu sarai il pretesto

Su come trarre giovamento dal non piacere agli altri

Max Gazzé,"Riflesso sul lago di Kaman 
Mosso da un gelo pittoresco e inesatto 
Piega gli elementi in un comune respiro 
E sposta le nuvole da pezzi di sereno 

A grappoli uniti all'Europa centrale 
Dove Geografia rimprovera meridiani 
Calca sull'equatore quale leader incontrastato 
Punge con il picco le aree più basse 

Ho udito sirene cantare troppo piano 
Il grido di Ulisse gonfiare le vele 

Perfino nello sconcerto delle Marianne 
S'annida riluttante l'origine del mondo 
Quando linfe ingrossate vivacchiano a fondo 
Lasciando il piglio alle correnti 

Mentre ai bordi una furba umidità 
Cresce fra creature allegre vanitose 
Fuori sulle sabbie l'Atlantico è pensoso 
Su come cucire le terre che separa 

Spero che non voglia o che voglia per sempre 
Il contrario dei sogni l'origine del mondo 

Cristalli di cielo frantumano 
L'ordine apparente di gesso scaturito 
Da quello che sotto chiamano quasi sempre 
Colui che governa e controlla le cose 

Come un'immensa unica 
Verità plasmata in forma perfetta 
Che a vederla appare in balia 
Di qualsiasi evento esagonale

Soltanto per poi perderlo
Soltanto per trovare qualcuno per cercare
Perdere quel tempo, perdersi cercando insieme, insieme

Che troppe cose siano nate con la data di scadenza

Come non ne ho mai abbastanza
Di tornare a domandarti
Se vuoi perdere del tempo qui con me
Non c’è, non c’è, non c’è

E se le mie scuse
Ormai non sanno più come forzare serrature
Di sguardi e mani chiuse
Mi manca il tuo sorriso
Rimango qui disteso ad invidiare gli alberi
Che crescono senza far rumore
Verso il cielo, con pazienza, senza fretta
E senza mai vantarsi della loro altezza
Potessi temperarmi adesso il cuore
Sanguinerei di certo,
Ma non avrai più dubbi
Che tutto questo rosso sia per te.

Se io fossi al tuo posto
Farei meglio a preservare
Questo nostro rimasuglio

È giusto che ora ti levi di dosso
Tutta la vita mia

Con la biancheria 
Teresa ho già deciso
Ti mollo con preavviso
Che lo sbaglio tuo
Di amarmi col guinzaglio
È stato idillio di un illuso 
Teresa se I tuoi sentieri
Son passi sul ghiaccio
Più falsi che leggeri
Come l’abbraccio
A mano tesa che ora mi dai 
Teresa tu non prendertela a male
Niente capirai di personale 
Teresa senza offesa ce l’hai un cuore? 
E allora va da sé diglielo tu di rinunciare
Se non altro ormai perchè non ti amo più 

E poi sono tre mesi che convivo con I miei
E quasi quasi adesso io ci resto 
Tu non ti abbandonare
Non ti lasciare andare
Devi solo realizzare
Che l’amore intenso brucia presto 
E poi non c’è nessuno che cucina come I miei
Tutto il divano e dopo cena sky

Che comunque tu la metti Teresa

Che affetti non sono stai mai
Ma cosa vuoi
Ai tempi sai mi innamorai 
Teresa intanto smettila di urlare
Che brutta sei quando ti fai volgare
Ma sento che l’hai detta con il cuore

E in fondo riuscirei soltanto
A dirti che non vali tanto
Ma tu sai capire quando mento

Max Gazzé,"""Ciao, se hai cliccato questo file
Di sicuro hai vuoti di memoria""
Lo scrissi perché non potevo accedere alla posta e pensai:
""Non ricordo le password, figuriamoci la storia""
Fra qualche anno dimenticherò chi sono
Cosa penso, che cosa mi piace, cosa detesto
Infatti eccoti qui come il tizio di Memento
Ok, ascolta sto pezzo e le rime dentro

Non aver paura di invecchiare
L'età che si dimostra attrae, vedi Persepoli
Non avere paura di stonare
Non le popstar, le campane suonano per secoli
In un mondo in cui tutti competono
Tu non cavalcare, monta la sella di Pegaso
E ricorda di omaggiare il silenzio
Fingendo di lasciare un fiore sulla tomba di Marcel Marceau

Perdi colpi, va così
Ma già migliora la tua memoria con un click
Perdi colpi, va così
Ma già migliora la tua memoria con un click

Non venerare la modernità, è di plastica
Negli anni '30 la modernità era la svastica
Qui c'è tensione, non si respira, s'ansima
È una crociera estiva ma nella stiva di un Admiral
Viaggia in macchina, monociclo ed aliante
Non nella tua stanza con il dito sull'atlante
Anime penano perché non vanno mai da nessuna parte
E poi quando potrebbero, nessuna parte

A sera spegni il telefonino
È un apparecchio, infatti ti sta togliendo il sorriso
Rispetta la massa, ma quella del tuo corpo
Non quella che dà la colpa ai politici ed è uno schifo
Accettare il dolore per apprezzare la vita
Come ingoiare un tizzone per apprezzare la pizza
Ridicolo, pensare a chi sta peggio non ti fa stare meglio
A meno che tu non sia cinico

Perdi colpi, va così
Ma già migliora la tua memoria con un click
Perdi colpi, va così
Ma già migliora la tua memoria con un click

Ricorda: il tuo sesto senso è quello di colpa
E tutti ne approfittano almeno una volta
Perciò va bene l'apertura verso gli altri
Ma all'entrata mettici almeno una porta
Difenditi e difendi la cultura, non scendendo in piazza
Ma scendendo in piazza per andare al cinema o a teatro
Che quando hanno chiuso l'Odeon tutti protestavano
Già, e in un anno nessuno che c'era andato
Non è vero che è inutile il tuo diploma
È inutile discutere di glutei nel perizoma
Non tutti ti amano, diffidano dell'icona
Diventa santo e sarai di mira come Nicola
Ascolta ciò che ti piace non ciò che piace, che piaccia
Dimentica il Karma, chiunque l'ha fatta franca
Se ti fanno sindaco ringrazia, inaugura piazza, kiss
Per vedere chi spiazza

Perdi colpi, va così
Ma già migliora la tua memoria con un click
Perdi colpi, va così

Niente di strano se all'ora del tè
Non penso già affatto al piatto col petto di tacchino in consommé
Rimesso da ieri nel frigo all'era del pranzo

Di enfatici versi allo sportello bianco

Quelli mi dicono nero leggero sul giallo che in frigo
C'è intatto il piatto col petto di tacchino in consommé

Max Gazzé,"Tu che ora non temi 
Ignorane nel canto quel coro ammaliante 
Che irrompe alla mente e per quanto mulini 
Le braccia oramai non potrai  far più niente 

Ma se ti rilassi e abbandoni il tuo viso 
A un lunghissimo sonno 
O mio Pizzomunno tu guarda quell’onda beffarda 
Che affonda il tuo amore indifeso 
Io ti resterò per la vita fedele 
E se fossero pochi, anche altri cent’anni 
Così addolcirai gli inganni delle tue sirene

Cristalda era bella e lui da lontano 
Poteva vederla ancora così 
Con la mano protesa 
E forse una lacrima scesa nel vento 

Fu solo un momento 
Poi lui sparì al largo 
E lei in casa cantando, neppure il sospetto 
Che intanto da sotto la loro vendetta ed il loro lamento 

Perché poveretta già avevano in cuore 
I muscoli tesi del bel pescatore 
E all’ennesimo suo rifiuto 
Un giorno fu punito 

Ma io ti aspetterò
Io ti aspetterò 
Fosse anche per cent’anni aspetterò 
Fosse anche per cent’anni 

E allora dal mare salirono insieme alle spiagge di Vieste 
Malvage sirene, qualcuno le ha viste 
Portare nel fondo Cristalda in catene 
E quando le urla raggiunsero il cielo 
Lui impazzì davvero provando a salvarla 
Perché più non c’era e quell’ira accecante lo fermò per sempre 

E così la gente lo ammira da allora 
Gigante di bianco calcare che aspetta tuttora il suo amore rapito 
E mai più tornato

Fosse anche per cent’anni aspetterò 
Fosse anche per cent’anni

Risalga dall’onda a vivere ancora

Die guten Tage strahlen und sie kommen dann
Wenn wir uns wieder Zeit nehmen und uns Raum geben
Die Suche nach dem Sinn, macht uns beinahe blind
Weil wir die Dinge, denen wir nachrennen, nicht erzwingen können
Wieder Zeit nehmen und uns Raum geben
Wieder Zeit nehmen und uns Raum geben

Hab dich gerade dann gefunden, als ich nicht mehr suchen war
Hast mir Leichtigkeit gegeben und ich hebe langsam ab

Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled 

They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on a treadmill
And they made you change your name 

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
The candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid 

Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude 

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in

Max Harris,"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance",A  Fine Romance,1999
Max Harris,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",I Get A Kick Out Of You,1999
Max Harris,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1999
Max Harris,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Max Herre,"Das ist hier für all die durch was gegangen sind
Yeah, ah, hör zu

Wer hat noch mal gesagt
Man schätzt nicht wert, was man hat
Und bis man merkt was man hatte ist die weg, die man mag
Ach ja,
Ich glaub mit Worten war ich immer ganz gut
Doch auch für mich gilt was ich sag ist nicht gleich das, was ich tu
Hört zu
Immer meint man dass das Gras woanders grüner sei
Und warum kann man denn im Nachhinein erst klüger sein
Wünscht, für Beziehungen gäb’s einen Führerschein
Punkte in Bad Liebenau, wer ’n Unfall mit der Liebe baut
Ich hab nie geglaubt, dass wir’s einfach hätten
Das Leben kommt nicht mit ‚nem Beipackzettel
Manche Wogen lassen sich nicht einfach glätten
Es heißt, Wärme entsteht an Reibungsflächen
Und es ist nie vorbei bis es vorbei ist
Du hast mein Versprechen

Zu viele Tränen geweint
Gedacht es wär vorbei
Doch es ist nicht vorbei, bis es vorbei ist
(Glaub mir, es ist nicht vorbei, denn alles gibt sich mit der Zeit)
So vieles tut mir leid
So vieles, was uns bleibt
Denn es ist nie vorbei, bis es vorbei ist
(Glaub mir, es ist nicht vorbei)

Ach wie schön ist Panama
Oft merkt man erst wenn man wo anders war
Was man aneinander hat
Und ich war in Sansibar in Tokio, ich war in New York
Ich war an so viele Orten und immer wollt ich nur fort
Und immer hab ich gesucht und nie wusst' ich wonach
Und immer musste ich weiter, denn wer still steht denkt nach
Das ist Fluch und Segen unserer Generation doch
Wir suchen nach Liebe und rennen davon, wenn sie dann kommt
Was ist Freiheit, wenn Du alleine feierst und
Welchen Wert hat Liebe, die nicht währt wie Familie
Man kann nicht immer fliegen, wir sind nicht schwindelfrei
Doch bevor’s noch mal in Brunnen fällt
Bringen wir dem Kind schwimmen bei

Zu viele Tränen geweint
Gedacht es wär vorbei
Doch es ist nicht vorbei, bis es vorbei ist
(Glaub mir, es ist nicht vorbei, denn alles gibt sich mit der Zeit)
So vieles tut mir leid
So vieles, was uns bleibt
Denn es ist nie vorbei, bis es vorbei ist
(Glaub mir, es ist nicht vorbei)

Down, go, yeah

Und wir haben Gutes, wir haben Schlechtes gesehen
Von einem ins nächste Extrem das Beste vom Leben
und Nächte voll Tränen
Glück und Pechsträhnen, zwei verletzte Seelen
Doch das konnt‘ uns eins nicht wegnehmen, man wächst an Problemen, yo
Wir stehen immer noch, und stärker denn je
Die Täler durchschritten, die Berge versetzt
Was lehrt einen das Leben?
Vielleicht kann man nicht immer gewinnen
Doch wie man verliert kann jeder selber bestimmen

Max Herre,"Erinner’ mich an meine ersten Jahre mit der Gruppe
Es ging uns nur um Spaß an der Mucke
D. hat organisiert und produziert
Wir haben für Jams den Keller bei seinen Eltern okkupiert
Mit dem 8-Spur-Gerät, Mann leg jetzt One Take
Am Mikro, schreib’ lieber gleich so, dass auch was geht
Wenn du’s abliest vom Blatt, en masse Reefer gepafft
Die ganze Zeit gechillt und Lieder gemacht
Vier Mann Crew, drei die gerappt haben
Doch einer nur, bei dem sie gleich so geflasht waren
Und ich bekam Möglichkeiten
Meinen Kragen zu weiten, meinen Namen zu verbreiten
Du konntest dich freuen oder mich dafür beneiden
Doch jeder hat selbst seinen Pfad zu beschreiten
Damals dachten wir, wir schaffen’s zu viert
Hab’ die Texte noch auf englisch fabriziert, aber

Es kommt alles anders, wird nie mehr was es war
Und wie sich alles wandelt, wird hinterher erst klar

Ich hätt' es gleich wissen sollen: Es hat nicht gepasst
Sie wollte mehr und ich nur eine Nacht, schon gab’s Krach
Wollt' kein Arschloch sein, wir verstanden uns gut sonst
Also Zweifel runterschlucken, schauen was auf uns zukommt
Wir steigerten uns rein, sie sah Heiraten und Heim
Zweisamkeit, trotzdem gab es Eifersüchteleien
Sie fühlte sich besorgt und ich fühlte mich gestalked
Wir waren eigentlich klüger, doch wütend genügte nicht das Wort
Sie hat mir ein paar gewischt, ich hab’ ihr ein paar gewischt
Ich schlug eine Frau auf der Straße bei Tageslicht
War das ich? An dem Tag ist irgendwas gestorben innen
Mama schau nur das Monster, das ich geworden bin
Will so nicht sein, Hilflosigkeit
Will nur weg, doch sie will, dass ich bleib und ich will nicht
Ich will sie nicht mal ansehen
Doch ich hab’ mir Schuld aufgeladen, also muss ich meinen Mann stehen
Alles wurde schlimmer und als ich endlich die Vernunft hatte
Mich loszumachen, dacht’ ich nur solo für immer
Nie wieder Beziehung, in die ich was investiere
Jetzt hab’ ich ’ne Frau und eine Familie

Es kommt alles anders, wird nie mehr was es war
Und wie sich alles wandelt, wird hinterher erst klar

Ich bin einen weiten Weg gekommen seit ich ging
Schau’ zurück und die Dinge bekommen einen Sinn
Die Zukunft ist nicht nur, was ich für mich gestalte
Trotzdem muss ich tun, was ich für richtig halte
Und ich hab’ viele Fehler gemacht in dieser Sache
Hätte nie gedacht, dass ich es mal bis hierhin schaffe
Ein Wunder wie die Seele sich heilt
Wir haben bis unser Weg sich teilt ein Stück des Weges geteilt zusammen
Vielleicht begegnet man sich auf ’ner Kreuzung
Was früher wichtig war, hat heute kaum Bedeutung
Altes stirbt, doch kann zu Erneuerung führen
Wie wenn wir Schmerz erleiden, um dann wieder Freude zu spüren
Auch wenn das Leben rast und sich die Veränderung Zeit lässt
Lerne ich dazu, immer wenn ich denke ich weiß jetzt
Neues erreicht, altes begann das
Nichts bleibt gleich, alles wird anders

Es kommt alles anders, wird nie mehr was es war
Und wie sich alles wandelt, wird hinterher erst klar

Es kommt alles anders, wird nie mehr was es war
Und wie sich alles wandelt, wird hinterher erst klar",Alles Anders,
Max Herre,"Jugend rebelliert eher passiv
Desinteressiert, wer gewinnt und wer verliert?
Permanente Tränen auf Gesichtern, nicht tätowiert
Schwarzweiße Welt bunt dekoriert, Bildschirme flimmern
Reizüberflutung bis wir nichts mehr erinnern
Uhren ticken, Huren ficken, es wird schlimmer
Medizin macht krank, jeder wär' gern schlank
Leichen im Keller, Waffen im Schrank
Das Leben stirbt, wo der Tod lebt
In Großstädten, wo es zu Ende ist, bevor es losgeht
Wo Menschen Drogen nehmen, zum Verdrängen vom Problemen
Um sich beim Absturz einzubilden, dass es nach oben geht
Alles schon erlebt, alles schon gesehen, nichts neues mehr
Die Flammen sind erloschen, kein Bedarf für Feuerwehr
Wir suchen alle nach was Größerem
Soviel' Rätsel, keinerlei Lösungen

Alles hell, alles laut
Die Stadt is' schnell, die Stadt is' rau

Ich muss zurück zu mir

Keine Revoluzzer, keiner da, der Mut hat
Kein neuer Martin Luther King, nich' mal 'n neuer 2Pac
Menschen identitätslos
Vor dem TV, gucken unreelle Realitätsshows
Eindimensionale Welt, alles Fassade
Kein Punkrock mehr, alles Ballade
Klingt schön, aber schade
Mainstream, Subkulturen
Formatgerechter Einheitsbrei
Ich hab' keine Zeit für den gleichen Scheiß
Gib mir was neues, zeig mir jemand', der sich etwas traut
Sag es extra laut, was auch immer ich denk', ich sprech' es aus
Was auch immer mir passiert, ich mach das Beste draus
Alle angepasst, alles zensiert
Alles, was funktioniert, wird kopiert
Jeder, der was neues kreiert, wird ignoriert
Bis es auch funktioniert, und dann wird's kopiert
Doch ihr seid nicht verwirrt

Alles hell, alles laut
Die Stadt is' schnell, die Stadt is' rau
Menschen rennen an dir vorbei
Niemand sieht dich, niemand bleibt

Wieder malen bisschen zu denken, fällt dir das so schwer?
Brauchst du eine ganze Story wie, wann, was und wer
Sodass du folgen kannst? Wie, hä? Achso, er
Is' klar, warum du nicht wusstest, was ich sage
Dies ist 'ne akustische Collage
Mit 'n paar komplizierten Worten, aber
So benutz' ich diese Sprache
Und geb' euch Denkansätze, denn ich denk' an Sätze
Nehm' euch mit auf meine Reise, geb' euch Fensterplätze

Dabei träumt er, er rappt für die Leute
Auf den Brettern, die die Welt bedeuten
Saß Tag für Tag, schrieb Reim für Reim
Er feilte Wort für Wort und Line für Line
Dann irgendwann traf er ein Kid genannt Martin
Freitagnacht auf 'ner Hiphop-Party
Sein DJ Frico, fragt: ""Willst du ans Mikro?
Und sagt: ""Man hört nur Gutes von dir"" und ich: ""Ditto""
Er droppt den Beat und ich kick den Rhyme
Auf'm dip-dip-ba, so-so-so leicht
Der Kick auf die eins und die Snare auf die zwei
Und ich rapp in das Mikrofon und sag wie ich heiß
Der M zu dem H, das X zu dem H
Die Kids schreien: ""Hurra!"" und die Chicks werfen Bras
Zurück in den Tag, oh Mann, was'n Spaß
Der Rest ist Geschichte, das war's

Draußen ist Aufruhr, Orient bis Okzident
Nimmt sich Land um Land, Kontinent um Kontinent
Während Al Jazerra, N-TV und Fox es bringen.
Lass ich Gil Scott-Heron aus meinem Boxen klingen
Vom Tahrir zum Plaza del Sol
Auf dem Syntagma skandieren die Massen Parolen
Und es werden immer mehr und sie haben keine Wahl
Schreien Was ist Freiheit,
Die politisch ist und nicht sozial
Und wo die Zukunft,
Die verschütt' geht unter Schuldenbergen
Die sie nie Schultern werden
Und nur an die Jungen vererben.
Irgendwann lässt sich das Dunkel
Nicht mehr bunt einfärben
Irgendwann lässt sich,
Wer unten ist, nicht länger unterwerfen
Und in fernen Straßen blüht der Jasmin
Ich mach das Fenster zu im kühlen Berlin
Denn der Frühling kommt hier immer erst spät an
Vielleicht, wenn sich im Süden mal
Die Winde gedreht haben

Den Tod im Angesicht fliehen sie nach Italien
Unser Klima wandelt sich, wie Frühling in Arabien
Erdbeben, Taifune, nukleare Supergas
Anschläge, Börsencrashs, jeden Tag vor unseren Augen
Die Medien lenken, was wir Menschen denken
Was wir Beachtung schenken
Und auf was wir uns beschränken
Sie wollen nicht unterhalten, sie wollen uns unten halten
Divide et impera, Herrschen ist die Kunst zu spalten
Doch in fernen Straßen blüht der Jasmin
Ich mach die Fenster zu im kühlen Berlin
Denn der Frühling kommt hier immer erst später
Vielleicht, wenn sich im Süden mal

As I’m looking out my window
Carrying melodies of spring
While a new sun is shining
Everyone’s in spin
Everybody mingle
Freedom starts within
It’s time my people sing

Und ich sitz' am Küchentisch im kalten Berlin
Mit 'nem Block und ‚'nem Stift
Und kann dem Alltag entfliehen
Und niemand klopft an die Tür,
Hier kommt noch niemand vollziehen
Bilder ziehen vorbei, wie Gil Scott Heron’s Melodien

Elli war 13
Achtundreißig, Berlin Weißensee
Der Vater darf nicht arbeiten, als Kinderarzt
Er weiß nicht mehr wie's weitergeht
Die Mutter träumt von Herzls Altneuland
Palästina, sein Herz hängt an Deutschland
Dem Deutschland Rilkes, Manns und Schuberts
Nicht dem Deutschland, das diese Angst hier zulässt
Er wird sie fortschicken
Es lässt sich nicht mehr ändern
Achtundreißig
Die letzten Tage im September
Berlin, Anhalterbahnhof
Sie winkt dem Vater durch die Scheibe und sie fahren los
Er ruft ihr nach, man soll keine Tränen weinen
Wenn man ins Land seiner Väter reist
Sie versteht nicht gleich was das heißt
Lies sie den Vater nicht zurück, eben an jenem Gleis?
Und die Welt verschwimmt vor ihren Lidern
Versinkt im ""für immer"" und ""nie wieder""
Und sie fahren in die Nacht
Sie findet Schlaf, weil sie fühlt, dass er über ihr wacht
Und in ihrem Traum hat er Flügel
Sie träumt er fliegt in den Süden
Fliegt ihr nach in den Frieden
Nach Tel-Aviv, Hügel des Frühlings

Ich bin der Stern, der auf deinem Boden schlief
Ich bin der Stern, der gefallen vor dem Himmel liegt
Ich bin der Stern, an dem du nachts die Sonne siehst
Ich bin dein Stern, Berlin, Berlin

Acht Tage und acht Nächte auf'm Boot
Wenn der Novembersturm tobt
Hier über'm Meer und daheim in Berlin
Wegen 1000 Pfund Sterling kann der Vater nicht mehr fliehen
Und sie ausgestoßen in diese kalte Welt
Betet zu 'nem Gott den sie in Frage stellt
Während sie die Tage zählt
Die sie den Vater nicht in'n Armen hält
Und sie hegt die Dinge die ihr von zuhause bleiben:
Der Rilke-band, ein paar Kleider, ihre Geige
Auf ihrer Reise, Flucht ohne Zuflucht
Nur diese Furcht vor der Zukunft
Und er wills nicht glauben bis sie nachts vorm Haus sind
Doch sie schlagen und sie plündern, sie verhaften Tausend
Achtunddreißig, Sachsenhausen
Ein Brief aus Tel-Aviv, er ist nur froh dass sie raus sind
Die kleine Elli Weinrebe
Und dieses Heimweh, ob's irgendwann vorbeigeht?
Für das verlorene Land, dort im gelobten Land
Und sie träumt sich weit weg
Und in ihrem Traum hat sie Flügel
Sie träumt sie fliegt aus dem Süden
Fliegt zurück in den Frieden
Nach Berlin, von den Hügeln des Frühlings

Ich bin der Stern, der auf deinem Boden schlief
Ich bin der Stern, der gefallen vor dem Himmel liegt
Ich bin der Stern, in dem du nachts die Sonne siehst

Ich bin verloren, im Rauch über der Landschaft

Wo geht's hin, Kind der Sonne oder Sorgenkind

Hallo Welt! Unser Weg ist nicht vorbestimmt
Und auch wenn das jetzt nicht katholisch klingt
Glaub ich nicht weniger an das ewige Leben

Oder die in dieser Welt schon nach dem Ewigen streben
Und deshalb mach ich Musik auf das ich Seelen bewege

Da wo gestern noch morgen heute war
Also mit heute der neue Morgen kam

Will mein neues Leben atmen

Fragt man ihn, wie er sich fühle, sagt er nur „des Lebes müde,
Es reicht gerad' mal für Essen und die Wohnungsmiete
Dann das Bankkonto blank schon zur Monatsmitte
(Er) Will nicht um Almosen bitten, will das die da oben wissen
Dass die da unten für so‘n bisschen Maloche müssen
Als ob irgendwer vernünftig davon leben könnte“
Nur noch zwei Jahre, dann wärend's 50 und geht in Rente
Und wie soll er seinen Enkeln denn die Welt erklären
Hier ist alles so verquer, er versteht‘s ja selbst nicht mehr
Viele hätte nichts wenn wenige Geld vermehren
Und wenn wir so pleite wären, wo kämen dann die Milliarden her
Und er sagt Verzeihung, das sei seine Meinung
Es fehle nicht an Reichtum, hier geht es um Verteilung

Lernt das man im Job nicht besteht wenn man nicht schroff ist
Und sie macht es, will dahin wo die Macht ist
Will schnell hoch hinaus, fährt ihren Ellenbogen raus
Sie steigt immer weiter, hoch die Karriereleiter
Immer mehr arbeiten, mehr Menschen antreiben

Bangen um den Bankenbankschrott und den Standort

You are so beautiful (so wundervoll)

You are so beautiful (und sing es für dich selbst)
You are so beautiful (hey du, Hallo Welt!)

Wenn dir das Leben seine Fratze zeigt
Und du denkst du stehst da ganz allein, kann das sein?
Dann siehst du Götter gegen dich verschwör'n
Die Welt, du kannst nicht mehr hör'n
Wenn niemand auf dich baut, weil niemand an dich glaubt
Wenn du mal wieder glaubst, dass dich niemand anders braucht
Vom Pech verfolgt, es scheint als sei's dein bester Freund
Sind deine Tage eher wie Nächte und du hast schlecht geträumt
Dein Boot gekentert, sitzt an einem kaputten Lenkrad
Dann weißt du, dass es Zeit wird, dass sich an dem Punkt was ändert
Lässt dich jemand hocken, komm ich geh Brillien trocknen
Mach's wie Pierre, mach neu! Dir steht das Leben offen
Denn auch wenn Winde toben, Kinn nach oben, Blick nach vorn
Es ist nichts verlor'n, also schmeiß die Flinte nicht ins Korn
Sieh in Spiegel und die Chapman setzt'n Lächeln auf

You are so beautiful (so wundervoll)
You are so beautiful (wunderschön und das ist unser Leben)
You are so beautiful (komm, sing es für dich selbst)
You are so beautiful (sing's für dich und sing's für die Welt)

Wenn dir die Welt die kalte Schulter zeigt
Und sie dir einreden, dass du selber Schuld dran seist
Sag's zu dir selbst, dann sag's zu deinen Nächsten
Schrei's in die Welt auch wenn die Dinge manchmal ungerecht sind
Trotz all der Sorgen und Nöte glaub an die Morgenröte
Zwei Herzen, eine Brust Johann-Wolfgang Goethe
Das ist unser Leben und es ist wunderschön
Unsere Zeit, unsere Zukunft und die lassen wir uns nicht nehmen
Ich kann nicht anders als von Hoffnung schreiben
Und ist egal, was all die Zyniker uns prophezeihen
Denn das ist was ich fühle, das ist keine Platitüde
Vielleicht geht's mehr um Haltung, weniger um Attitüde
Für all die hoffnungslosen Optimisten
Für alle die, die noch hoffnungsfroh sind, so wie ich's bin
Am Ende bleibt immer Minimum noch'n bisschen

Der Sehnsucht nach sich selbst,
Vida, ein Leben und mein Kind,
Und nur weil Du bist, hat das Leben seinen Sinn

Das Leben fragt nicht, ist diese Welt 
Auch gut genug und kam ich zur rechten Zeit
Weil's immer nur die Zukunft sucht,
Und so zieht es aus, so stolz und so selbstbewusst, 
Stellt sich jedem neuen Tag entgegen mit geschwellter Brust,
Es fragt auch dann nicht, das Leben verlangt
Nach der Liebe derer dem sie's verdankt,
Und wer wären wir dem Leben das zu verwehren
Und die Welt, die ihre ist, mit unserer Last zu beschweren

Es heißt die Kraft eines Baumes liegt in den Wurzeln, 
Und Leben nicht zu lieben hieß' die Triebe zu stutzen,
Nun sagt man auch die Liebe ist wie der Vogel, 
Versuch' sie einzusperren und sie kommt nie mehr geflogen,
Doch gibst Du ihr Freiheit kommt sie immer zurück
Und auf den Flügeln der Zeit schwingt sie ins Licht,
Denn wie der Mond das Licht der Sonne nur spiegelt, 
So spiegelt auch das Leben nur das Licht in unsrem Leben

With these wings you can fly,
I know you gonna need it to get by,
Everything will be alright,
Let these dreams be your guide

Vida, ein Leben und mein Kind
Und nur weil Du bist, hat das Leben seinen Sinn

Wir haben nur das eine, leb's in vollen Zügen,
Träum' die größten Träume, nur die soll'n Dir genügen,
Nur der Himmel ist das Limit, flieg' und greif' nach den Sternen,
Kannst alles werden, hast noch alle Zeit es zu lernen,
Seht, jetzt kannst Du schon reden, ne' kleine Charaktere,
Bald bist du alt genug und begreifst was ich erkläre,
Es ist Dein Weg, doch ich bleib' Dein Gefährte,
Hab Mut in Deiner Seele, leb' die Freiheit der Erde,

Vida, das Leben kennt nur das Heute,
Das Gestern wird vergessen und das Morgen sind Träume,
Und doch ist jedes Leben ein Versprechen der Zukunft 
Und nur durch unsere Liebe zu ihm spricht sie zu uns

With these wings you can fly,
I know you gonna need it to get by,
Everything will be alright,
Let these dreams be your guide

Sometimes you may wonder why,
I can't always be by your side,
But when the road gets ruff, times get taff,
Got my love all your life

Max Herre,"Dinge kommen, Dinge gehen
Sinn und Unsinn des Lebens
Kopf in den Wolken, Kopf im Sand
Hoch geflogen und so oft verbrannt
Alles dreht sich und es dreht sich täglich
Die Kraft in dir trägt und verrät dich
Mann im Spiegel, Hass oder Liebe
Er treibt dich vor sich her und er macht dich müde
Und du willst jemand anders sein, wer kann das sein, mir fällt keiner ein
Und du willst nicht machen, was du machst
Und trotzdem sitzt du wieder hier, schreibst die ganze Nacht
Falscher Stolz, Eitelkeit
Dein Leben, doch für das Leben keine Zeit
Mit dieser Leere Bücher vollgeschrieben
Dein Albtraum auf Wolke 7

Und ich schließe die Augen
Vor all diesen Fragen
Weil es schwer ist die Zweifel
Auf den Schultern zu tragen
Also schließe ich die Augen
Um an etwas zu glauben
Ist es wert dich zu lieben
Und das Leben zu lieben
Hier auf Wolke 7

Dinge kommen, Dinge gehen
Angst vorm Fallen, lieber für nichts mehr stehen
In den Bilderfluten nichts mehr sehen
Und dann mit wehenden Fahnen untergehen
Nachts in Katakomben abfliegen
In Katakonter wieder abschießen.
Und im Gedränge untertauchen
An nichts außer an Wunder glauben
Und du willst woanders sein,
Wo kann das sein, es fällt dir gerade nicht ein
Dicker Schädel und ne dünne Haut
Jeden kennen, aber niemandem trauen
Alles is gesagt und es will keiner hören
Es wär so einfach, wenn's nicht so einfach wär
Und all die Widersprüche totgeschwiegen
Mein Albtraum auf Wolke 7

Max Herre,"Hier kommen drei MC's, bekannt für Rap-Parts, die Stil haben
Samy Deluxe, Luxus Chris und Maximilian!

Viele Rapper kommen nicht voran in ihren Texten
Es ist, wie wenn ein DJ immer nur mit einer Zeile backspinnt
Mit einer Zeile backspinnt, mit einer Zeile backspinnt
Wir bleiben live in Action
Wir sind wie Show & AG angekommen auf dem nächsten Level
Also nick' zum Beat und lass dich von den Texten fesseln
Wir studieren den Musikmarkt, planen unsere Invasionen
Denn dort ging Hip Hop verloren, und es gibt Props als Finderlohn
Viele behandeln Rap heutzutage wie 'n Leihwagen
Achten nicht auf echte MC's, wie uns, die das Leid tragen
Wollen nach kurzen Fahrten lieber in anderen Sparten einparken
Und schnell noch Miss Afrotrap auf 'ne Spritztour einladen
Und wo sie heiraten läuft hier überall die Hochzeit
Und danach stehen noch mehr dieser Lackaffen im Spotlight
Die nix andres verkörpern können als Glamour und Luxus
Hip Hop ist schutzlos, du siehst, dass er zerstört wird, aber guckst bloß
So sieht's aus! Täter konnten fliehen, blieben anonym
Fingen an sich rapmässig anzuziehen, hüpften wie mit Trampolin
Meinen, dass sie Leute animieren, aber verlieren nur Kalorien
Sagen nichts wie Pantomimen, Musik ist nicht da, um sie anzuziehen
Hör lieber hin, erkenn wer die Erfinder, und wer die Diebe sind
Wir sind die Effektiveren: Samy, Max und die Stieber Twins

Yeah! Die euch den echten Rap wiederbringen (wo seid ihr?)
Genauso so real sind wie ihre Lieder klingen
Maximilian (Hamburg), Maximilian, Maximilian

Ich lag im Fieber mit Malaria, vollgepumt mit Lariam
Visionen wie Mohammed, als er am Berge Hira war
Raps kamen inflationär wie der serbische Dinar
Check Samy Deluxe, Chris, Mar und Maximilian
Das Leben ist mehr, als Mics, Beats und Samsemilla
Dolce Vita, Deutschmarks und Senoritas
Auch wir lieben das, nur nichts währt ewig
Das Geschäft ist schnelllebig, doch Geld macht behäbig
Was über den Äther geht ist bestenfalls medioker
Ich geb keinen Eurocent auf Eurotrashbands im Medienpoker
Die Charts mit ihrem Scheiß erobern
Zeit, dass wir Styles anfordern
Wollt ihr Cyphers oder Seifenopern?
Hypokrisis im Hip Hop Bizz bringen die Scene in Misskredit
Wisst ihr was 'n Bitchmove is?
Sich mit fremden Federn schmücken, was?
Ins Licht der Szene rücken, was? Sich für die Medien bücken, was?
Beißen wollen wie Tse-Tse Mücken
Der Shit macht mich krank wie Malaria
Ihr habt mehr als nur Musik auf dem Gewissen wie Frank Farian
Wir scheinen, aber blenden nicht, reflektieren und spenden Licht
Aber brennen mit Esperanto international verständlich!
Also holt euch den Scheiß, weil auch Freundeskreis um die Fäulnis weiß

„Seid ihr bereit für die Stieber Twins?“

Konstruier mein Rapkonzept am Reissbrett wie Architekt
Vergiss dein Papi, der sein Ferrari in der Garage pflegt
Ich geh' zu Steve, der für Kies auf der Straße breakt
Hip Hop lebt, wenn sich auch dein Arsch mitbewegt
Stieber Twins und Mad Max, präziser wie Skinny Caps
Mit Metro schneller, als Stars in Yellow Cabs
Vergiss mal Midi, Synthi, Presets
Ich komm wie Grandmaster Caz mit Klartext auf Crossbacks
Scheiß auf Gesellschaft, in der nur der lacht
Der die Brüder Grimm tausendfach auf Tasche hat
Ach, deine Prachtyacht am Mittelmeer, millionenschwer
Umzäunt von Stacheldraht, weil Armut lange Finger macht
Ey, Yuppi mit Golfhobby, dir fehlt Profil, Mann, genau wie Dunlop
Die ohne Pit Stops durchs Ziel fahren
Chris und Maximilian beobachten wie Sielmann
Tiger, wie Shirkan, die wegen Zebras am Nil waren
Überleg! Deine DNA ist seit diesem Jahr veränderbar
Wie Bomber der USA das Klima in Hiroshima
Doch eins ist klar, egal, ob dein Scheiß oben oder unten war
Evergreens sind immer da, der Rest Drosophila
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Ich sag, drei MC's, die schon seit Jahren lodern (lodern)
Die ihre Hörer Live on Stage erobern
Es wird Zeit, dass wir Styles anfordern
(Was?) wollt ihr Cyphers oder Seifenopern?

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Since I've seen my baby girl
You know I've been waiting on you
And you know I got something to show you
It's the way you smell, that drives me wild
And the way you feel, ooh
I just got to, got to have you, have you
You know I got to have you near me

Always stressing me out, but still bring the best in me out
I'm knowing little mama down when a little drama spin
I'm a big timer trying to flip thangs in the city
Streets got you racking ? foot playas on your pretty feets
Pretty face laced up, tight from the waist up
Thick from the waist down, that's why I chased her
Everyday I wake up, nothing could stop me
I'm cocky, kissing me smelling like it's a mi atay
I'm a thug on the block with my whodis
Spending two g's when we shop at the Foley's
When the beef pop, she be looking at Max funny
But she won't trip, cause she love spending Max money
If I shot a ten, she'll bring a twenty back for me
If she really love me hit the cut push it back for me
Ride or die, and here you go hide the gat for me
And I can't wait to be alone so you could act for me, what act funny

Wan' take a walk though the hood with me?
Come on

Come take a walk on the wild side, the nigga, foul side
They done shot up the corner, now none the children can go outside
That's how they actin'
Now holla when you bout some jackin'
Boys spillin' them guts and they tryin' to wipe it up with napkins
Back in the game it wasn't quite this tragic
Capture the magic, smokin' on somethin' up in traffic
I'm a step away from bein' psychopathic, tryin' to fall back
Beepin' the weedman, but he ain't never call back
I'm a lifetimer liftin' weights away from being cock strong
But don't let that get ya wrong, I know how to cock comb
I can make beef with ya, or make bread with ya
Duck a fed with ya
Say it with ya
Bust a head with ya
On the same block pops got the blues on
I'm a lil' homie done went to jail, but my shoes on
But I been hustlin' since I had Underoos on
Reppin' for my hood
I'm a fool 'till the tombstone, tombstone

Say lil' man, let me tell ya what it feel like
What bein' real like
What grippin' wood wheel like
And packin' steel like
Then what duckin' the cops like
What bleedin' blocks like
What ridin' on chops like
And bein' out the box like
At the stoplight, not a worry in the world
Though we all grown up, we still boys and girls
I still hold my own
I'm well known, on a blow up phone
Makin' a deal with the Pope, tryin' to sew up Rome
I had to grow up wrong, but it's safe to say
I stayed focused and I came up in a major way
Pay attention to what you do and all the thangs you say
I ain't trippin', I'm just makin' sure everythangs okay
Countin' days
Think I'm a dog in a two-man cage
I'm on a whole nother page
Gettin' smarter with age
If you want to retaliate, let me be part of the rage
We went from watchin' cartoons to countin' war wounds
In my hood

[Chorus p1 2x]

[Chorus p2 1x]

[Verse Three]
Nowadays
Everybody want to be hard and say they real with that
But catch a case and they don't know how to deal with that
Whatever happened to takin' your lick and takin' your trip
Scorin' all your work soft, then makin' it flip
Now niggaz tellin' on they homeboys, thinkin' they sick
You say you real nigga, be it, stop fakin' this shit
I got G, for niggaz growin' up on me
Smokin' too much weed then throwin' up in the street
A million and one ways to use thug in a sentence
Talkin' on the blow up phone with five thousand minutes
And it's, nothin' sick about hustlin' hard
And a nigga can't even pay you what you're chargin'
And who would I be, to rap about money, jewelry, and cars
And it be grown women ill and children out here starvin'
Still lookin' up to God and I'm hopin' he pardon
My ways, because I gotta get it on like Marvin

Max Minelli,"Yo, I wanna dedicate this song to everyone out there
Who's goin' through the same thing, just keepin it real, listen

Well, she was five foot, three, unique with them brown eyes
So beautiful that I had to make her my wife
I put my trust in her, I had a kid with her
I thought that I would be happy till the end with her

So you live an' learn, that's what you had told me
And now I'm feeling so miserable and lonely
I should've listened to your words
I should've listened to your words

From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation, I be goin' through
From a friend to a friend, you would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all, I thought that she loved me
She wasn't good at all, I really, really thought she cared
She wasn't good at all, how could I have been such a fool
To never listen to your words, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I should've never, never, never stayed with her, yeah

I told you from the beginning about this girl
That she only come and play some games
And I know she didn't feel the same

Because I seen it in her eyes man
That she's only out for your money
Now usually I won't say a word
But I know about these type of girls

These type of girls they come and go
Remember when we told 'em about it
When I told you that she wasn't down
That she wasn't about it

From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation you was goin' through
From a friend to a friend, I would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know you knew but I never listened to you, no
She wasn't good at all, you know she wasn't down with you
She wasn't good at all, I should've listened to your words

Yo, we must of had a different vision of love, tender kisses and hugs
Makin' me weak in my knees, that's how vicious it was
I'm from the gutter girl, you know it's vicious for thugs
Where unfamiliar faces look suspicious to us

I used to miss you so much, I put the pimp aside
Broke all my criminal ties, gave you the simple life
Call me the family man, gettin' my salary tight
But soon as you drop your guard, that's when reality bites

And leave a open wound, greed got your cover blown
But I be over you, I'm solitary born
I should of listened an' my boy and I would'd known
You do your thang, I ain't concerned, baby, girl I'm gone

She wasn't good at all, I knew she wasn't good enough
She wasn't good at all, I knew but I didn't care, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know I did this to myself
I know I did this to myself

She wasn't good at all, I tried to warn you 'bout this kinda of girl
She wasn't good at all, I just was so blind by her love
Or at least I thought it was love, yeah

Ooh, on and on
She wasn't good at all
She wasn't good at all, yeah, yeah
I said I'm glad she's out of my life

I'm from the city of the wickedest, cut throat connivers

We roam the streets at dark, all we got to survive
Is our hands and our heart, our balls and our word
Just for sitting in my hood, I be screaming until I'm horse
You ever touch one of mine, I'm coming for you and yours
If you ain't got to jack in the murder, you ain't shit

Hope it ain't none of mine, and if it's mine
I be coming to get you die trying, survival of the fittest
We the sickest no disrespect, but these boys got heart
It could be the dope, but these boys play the part

Max Mondo,"The hammering from the pit and the pounding of guns grew louder. My fear rose at the sound of someone creeping into the house. Then I saw it was a young artilleryman, weary, streaked with blood and dirt.

      Artilleryman: Anyone here?
      Journalist: Come in. Here, drink this.
      Artilleryman: Thank you.
      Journalist: What's happened?
      Artilleryman: They wiped us out. Hundreds dead, maybe thousands.
      Journalist: The heat ray?
      Artilleryman: The Martians. They were inside the hoods of machines they'd made, massive metal things on legs. Giant machines that walked. They attacked us. They wiped us out.
      Journalist: Machines?
      Artilleryman: Fighting machines, picking up men and bashing them against trees. Just hunks of metal, but they knew exactly what they were doing.
      Journalist: Hmm. There was another cylinder came last night.
      Artilleryman: Yes. Yes, it looked bound for London.

London! Carrie! I hadn't dreamed there could be danger to Carrie and her father, so many miles away.

      Journalist: I must go to London at once.
      Artilleryman: And me, got to report to headquarters, if there's anything left of it.

At Byfleet, we came upon an inn, but it was deserted.

      Artilleryman: Is everybody dead?
      Journalist: Not everybody, look... 

Six cannons with gunners standing by.

      Artilleryman: Bows and arrows against the lightning.
      Journalist: Hmm.
      Artilleryman: They haven't seen the heat ray yet. 

We hurried along the road to Weybridge. Suddenly, there was a heavy explosion and gusts of smoke erupted into the air.

      Artilleryman: Look! There they are! What did I tell you!

Quickly, one after the other, four of the fighting machines appeared. Monstrous tripods, higher than the tallest steeple, striding over the pine trees and smashing them, walking tripods of glittering metal. Each carried a huge funnel and I realized with horror that I'd seen this awful thing before.
A fifth machine appeared on the far bank. It raised itself to full height, flourished the funnel high in the air, and the ghostly terrible heat ray struck the town.
As it struck, all five fighting machines exulted, emitting deafening howls which roared like thunder:

      Martians: Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla!

The six guns we had seen now fired simultaneously, decapitating a fighting machine. The Martian inside the hood was slain, splashed to the four winds, and the body, nothing now but an intricate device of metal, went whirling to destruction. As the other monsters advanced, people ran away blindly, the artilleryman among them, but I jumped into the water and hid until forced up to breathe. Now the guns spoke again, but this time the heat ray sent them to oblivion.
With a white flash the heat ray swept across the river. Scalded, half blinded and agonized, I staggered through leaping, hissing water towards the shore. I fell in full sight of the Martians, expecting nothing but death. The foot of a fighting machine came down close to my head, then lifted again as the four Martians carried away the debris of their fallen comrade, and I realized that by a miracle, I had escaped.

      Martians: Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla!",The Artilleryman and the Fighting Machine,2006
Max Mondo,"It seems totally incredible to me now that everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other. From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. It all seemed so safe and tranquil.
Next morning a crowd gathered on the common, hypnotized by the unscrewing of the cylinder. Two feet of shining screw projected when suddenly, the lid fell off. Two luminous, disk-like eyes appeared above the rim. A huge rounded bulk, larger than a bear, rose up slowly, glistening like wet leather. Its lipless mouth quivered and slathered, and snakelike tentacles writhed as the clumsy body heaved and pulsated.
A few young men crept closer to the pit. A tall funnel rose and an invisible ray of heat leapt from man to man, and there was a bright glare as each was instantly turned to fire. Every tree and bush became a mass of flames at the touch of this savage, unearthly heat.
People clawed their way off the common, and I ran too. I felt I was being toyed with, that when I was on the very verge of safety this mysterious death would leap after me and strike me down. At last I reached Maybury Hill, and in the dim coolness of my home I wrote an account for my newspaper before I sank into a restless, haunted sleep.
I awoke to alien sounds of hammering from the pit and hurried to the railway station to buy the paper. Around me, the daily routine of life, working eating, sleeping, was continuing serenely as it had for countless years. On Horsell Common, the Martians continued hammering and stirring, sleepless, indefatigable, at work on the machines they were making. Now and again a light like the beam of a warship's searchlight would sweep the common, and the heat ray was ready to follow.
In the afternoon, a company of soldiers came through and deployed along the common to form a cordon.
That evening, there was a violent crash and I realized with horror that my home was within reach of the heat ray.
At dawn, a falling star with a trail of green mist landed with a flash like summer lightning. This was the second cylinder.",Horsell Common and the Heat Ray,2006
Max Mondo,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

As time passed in our dark and dusty prison
The Parson wrestled endlessly with his doubts
His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him",The Spirit of Man,2006

Che si alzava ogni mattina senza lamentarsi mai
Persone semplici che lavoravano duro solamente per
Un futuro per I figli e un pò di serenità per se
E figlio mio questa storia è la storia di quello che è successo poi
Della corsa all'oro
Che però l'oro nessuno ha visto mai
Da quando sono arrivati in città avventurieri e businessmen
Che si son presi tutto quanto anche le briciole

Questa città una volta era un posto bellissimo
Pieno di ragazze profumate che ballavano
Fino all'alba e regalavano gioia di vivere
E voglia di sorridere
Però sai che I cowboy non mollano
Se gli spari poi si rialzano
Il destino può rallentarli però
I cowboy non mollano

Figlio mio questa storia è la storia di questi tempi bui
Di balordi che vengono giù in città a cercare guai
E whiskey e donne facili e risse nei salono e slot machine
Fino all'ultimo centesimo a bruciarsi il venerdì

E figlio mio questa storia è una storia di uomini del west
Di ciarlatani e imbonitori in giro a vendere
Pozioni miracolose che curano ogni disturbo e malattia
Dalla caduta dei capelli al crollo dell'economia
Questa città sarà ancora un posto bellissimo
Pieno di ragazze profumate che ballano
Fino all'alba regalando gioia di vivere
Le guarderai sorridere
Perché sai che I cowboy non mollano
Se gli spari poi si rialzano
Il destino può rallentarli però

Figlio mio questa storia è la storia
delle storie a cui non crederai
Quando te le racconteranno come han fatto con noi
Farai un cenno con la testa come per dirgli che ci stai
Ma poi monterai in sella come fa un vero cowboy

Max Pokrovsky,"Must have left my house at eight, because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came

Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain

Da ist das Café Noir.
Man sagt, dass das vor Jahren mal
Ein alter Bahnhof war.
Am Eingang sitzt Napoléon
Und lallt: „Die Welt ist mein!“
Er schnorrt ’ne Zigarette, es darf auch Kleingeld sein.
Sonst schimpft er wie ein Rohrspatz und lispelt sonderbar
’S ist geschlossene Gesellschaft heute Nacht im Café Noir.

Philosophen und Poeten,
Die niemand sonst versteht,
Und all die, die nie wissen,
Wie es morgen weitergeht,
Sie rauchen, reden, trinken
Hier an der langen Bar,
Sind Heilige Halunken hier im alten Café Noir.
Der eine vierteilt Bierdeckel nur mit ’nem Fingertwist.
Sein Bild war in der Zeitung, dort galt er als vermisst.

Und hier an meiner Schulter
Lehnt ein ewiger Student,
Der sagt, er hätt’ heut’ absichtlich
Sein Staatsexamen verpennt.
Er musste sich entscheiden,
Will lieber Spieler sein,
Er setzt auf eine Karte,
Gewinnt, und lädt uns ein.
Er trinkt auf Paragraphen, und auf die, die sie verdrehen
Und auf ’ne goldene Zukunft, ihr werdet es schon sehen!

Und da hinten dieser Vogel,
Der tanzt für Schnaps und Geld,
Sieht aus wie Charlie Manson,
Der pfeift auf diese Welt.
Und da kommt Pater Jakob,
Er teilt mit ihm sein Bier
Und ruft „Im Himmel gibt es keins,
Da bleib ich lieber hier.“
Ah, das sind Gespenster, längst Teil vom Inventar,
Sie rasseln mit den Ketten wie der Geist des Café Noirs.

Und Romeo sitzt einsam
Vor seinem sechsten Bier.
Er weiß, die schöne Julia
Hat Spätschicht bis halb vier.
Er glaubt, er wäre Shakespeare
Und er schreibt ihr ein Sonett,
Sie nimmt es an wie Rosen,
Und sagt: „Du bist wirklich nett.“
Doch hat sie’s nie gelesen, denn sie liebt nur Captain Flint
Oder auch kräftige Matrosen, die hier gestrandet sind.

Selbst Bob, der alte Riese
Sitzt hier rücklings an der Bar
Und spielt so unermüdlich
Die Mundharmonika.
Und allen, die ihm sagen,
Wie angetan sie sind,
Entgegnet er gelangweilt,
Geh raus, erzähl’s dem Wind!
Als wir noch in den Sternen lagen, war er schon längst da
Und bastelte die Jukebox hier im alten Café Noir.

Jetzt steh ich hier und singe
Und finde keine Ruh’,
Ich seh’ Gesichter, die verschwimmen,
Dann bist da plötzlich Du!

Na komm schon, setz’ dich zu uns,
Und tu Dir bloß nicht leid.
Wir sind nicht wirklich böse,
Wir töten nur die Zeit.
Wir stellen auch keine Fragen, wir sind nur einfach da
Und für einander Zuflucht hier im alten Café Noir.",Café Noir,2013

Am Ende, wenn sich alles erhellt,
Wer war ich dann in dieser Welt?

Sie nahmen dich fort,
Fort hinunter zum Fluss.
Du riefst, nichts endet!
Dann fiel schon der Schuss.
Ich seh' noch dein Lächeln,
Ruhig sagtest du, alles wird gut!

Es ist nur mein Blut.

Max Q,"We were talking
While driving at night
Talking about freedom
Freedom in golden cages
Illusions, some call them dreams
Someone said, ""Do the words make a difference?""
She said, ""Never underestimate your soul."" 
We took to the highway in a car full of dreams

[Chorus]
You bought your freedom
In golden cages 
Some people call dreams
You bought your freedom
In golden cages
Some people call dreams

If you strip everything away
What are you left with?
You're left with nothing
If you took away your big black cat
Would there be anything at all?
Your hats and furs and diamond rings
Don't mean a thing
And those chains you got around your neck
They're just pulling you down

Walk naked to me
Walk naked to me
Walk naked to me

[Chorus: x2]",Soul Engine,1989
Max Q,"Hold tight
Nothing missing
Look around
Pupils glisten
Can you listen?
Or is it that
You've learned too much
What's your limit?

[Chorus]
You know you've heard
Teeth are clenched
A pack of lies-yeah
Chords in the neck are tense
So hold tight
Sometimes it seems to make no sense
And don't you cry
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Hold tight
Yeah, I can see ya
You got it all under your skin
Turn around where you stand
Everybody takes aim at adversity

[Chorus]

Hold tight
I got ya message
I got it all
And there's no limit
The travel between our dreams
Has not come to an end
So let's keep up
Our unholy alliance

[Chorus]",Tight,1989
Max Q,"You are born into this world
Looking down the barrel of a gun
And those who hold the gun
Want you to work fast and die young
And if you don't work
If you don't obey
They'll make you live in fear till your dying day
Those who govern hold the gun to your head
With religions, corporations, proud of blood
They've shed

Whether it's God or the bomb
It's just the same
It's only fear under another name
And the corporate snakes coming in to feed
On that pathetic fact known as human greed
Skin and bone being raked over those hot coals
This dump never seems to give time for human soul
And all those things that we have learnt
No time for questions, you'll just get burnt
You'll just get burnt

And those words crush you flat
Like your skull's under a brick
And the fear's so damned strong
That it makes you sick
And you can see right through those eyes
That make you fear, that make you lie
And you're taught to hold high
Yet you wonder why
Dumb values forced upon you by the
Living lie",Way of the World,1989

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Her dates heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag 
So she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope, dope

Sunshine and joy always nigh;

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2000

Max Roach,"Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
",Sleep,2000
Max Roach,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2000

Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry
The choo choo train that takes me
Away from you no words can tell how sad it makes me
Kiss me, Tootsie, and then
Do it over again, watch for the mail, I'll never fail
If you don't get a letter then you'll know I'm in jail

Max Roach,"You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill
You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
Every time I look at you I can't keep still
Hm
Nothing seems to matter
Hm

Max Roach,"You deserve a boy who's willin', namely me. 
One who'd love to raise my chillun, namely me. 
Comin' home when the work is over at the close of day. 
I'd be with you all the way, to love, honor, and obey. 

'Cause you deserve two arms to hold you, namely mine. 
There to comfort and enfold you, Rain or shine. 
I deserve someone sweet and tender, bashful and shy and true. 
And I know just the one who'll do, namely you.

Well be close together, wait and see
Oh by the way,
This time the dreams on me

You take my hand
And you look at me adoringly
But as things stand
This time the dreams on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dreams on me

Max Roach,"Love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind

Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind

You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me, and with your kiss the world begins
You're Spring to me, all things to me
You're life itself

Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind, the wind
Wild is my love for you",Wild is the Wind [Alternate Take],2000
Max Roach,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

Ill tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?

Max Roach,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone

Max Roach,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2002
Max Roach,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous; he answers twice
It's really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, you can't confess
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

She sits alone 'most every night
He doesn't phone her; he doesn't write
He says he's busy, but she says, ""Is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her""

He says, ""Now, Judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge right into jail""
You'd better keep her; I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee

You'd better keep her
I know it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee",Makin' Whoopee,2002
Max Roach,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2002

I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me

Birds sing
Sun is shining
No more pining
Just we two
Smiling thru
Don't sigh
Don't cry
