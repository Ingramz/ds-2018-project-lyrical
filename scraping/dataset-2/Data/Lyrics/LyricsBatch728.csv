Mickey Tucker,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1994
Mickey Tucker,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1995
Mickey Waller,"(presley, blackwell)

Bless my soul, what's wrong with me ?
I'm itchin' like a man that's on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm acting as wild as a bug.
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm all shook up.
Ah, ah, ah, all shook up most of the time.

Well, my knees are shakin'
And my hands are gettin' weak.
Can't seem to stand on my own two feet.
Who do you blame when you, oh, when you found such luck ?
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm all shook up, any old way

Yea please don't ask me what's up on my mind
I'm a little mixed up but I'm feelin' fine
But that's alright
Oh, when I meet a girl that I've love best,
My heart beats so and it scares me to death
But that's alright

She touched my lips, what a thrill I got
My [heart] beats like a volcano when it's red hot
I'm proud to say that she's my, oh, what a buttercup
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm all shook up, any old time.
Ah, yeah
That's alright, listen
That's ok too

I'm in the mood for love, woman
I'm in the mood for love
My knees are shakin' and my elbows quakin'
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
All shook up, oh yeah.

Please don't ask me what's up on my mind
I'm a little mixed up but I'm feeling fine
I'm in the mood for love, woman, yeah
In the mood for love
Come on babe

Bless my soul, what's wrong with me

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed

You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,2004

C'mon tell me little baby

Tell me what I need to know

And let the words spill baby

Load em up before I go


Cause I could see you little darlin

Got a thing or two too say

And I could feel you little darlin

Stingin words from yesterday

You think you got it all wrote there

Neatly stashed and figured out

But I see you little baby

Slightly scattered all about


Baby its ok to wonder

We all do it time to time

Just be careful where it takes you baby

there's inoccent roads behind those eyes


Cause I could see you little darlin

Got a thing or two too say

And I could feel you little darlin

Stingin words from yesterday

Neatly stashed and figured out

Or hide your memory till light

Even I could see that it was my fault


I didn?t have the guts to leave you


I just thought that it would fall apart


And in time that we would be through



But not this time


No, not this time


It was apparent you were falling in love


All I could see is I wasn?t good enough



And I?ve never been good at breaking hearts


I?ve tried and I just fall apart


And I don?t know what to say or what to do


All I know is I?m trying not to hurt you



I don?t know what the hell could be wrong with me


I just always try to run away


I guess that I could try to be happy


But in time everybody?s gotta pay



But not this time


No, not this time


It was apparent you were falling in love


All I could see is I wasn?t good enough



And I?ve never been good at breaking hearts


I?ve tried and I just fall apart


And I don?t know what to say or what to do


All I know is I?m trying not to hurt you


All I know is I?m trying not to hurt you


All I know is I?m trying not to hurt you

Micky & the Motorcars,"Down the street a lamp light glows
The only heat through the slow fire and snow
I raise my voice but it rings hallow
I raise my glass every time you called
I raise my glass every time

You told me once that all it would take
To let the wind carry the weight
Is a chance to rest another heartache
I raise my glass to every mistake
I raise my glass every time

I take a boardwalk down to the bay
I listen to the waves
And its a price that I've had to pay
For every glass that I raised

I took a job at a factory plant
There are some things I can do
There are some things I can't
I haven't been the same since the accident
I raise my glass in resentment
I raise my glass every time

Ninety miles an hour in the dead of the night
You leaned over and you cut out the light
I flipped the Z10, I was high as a kite
I raise my glass to the dark sick night
I raise my glass every time

I take a boardwalk down to the bay
I listen to the waves
And its a price that I forever pay
For every glass I raised

I haunt these streets till the bar rooms close
I only live to become a ghost
You were the one I always loved the most
I raise my glass to one final toast
I raise my glass one last time

Then, I take a boardwalk down to the bay
I listen to the waves
And its a price that I no longer pay
For every glass I raised
For every glass I raised
Every glass I raised
For every glass I raised",Raise My Glass,2011
Micky Blue,"I'm sinking down, twenty thousand leagues
To save me now, you need a submarine
'Cause my heart is lost at sea
To save me now, you need a submarine

I feel like there's no way to win
Running in circles and I'm searching to know where it ends
Or where it begins, over and over and over again
I keep believing your excuse
Drowning in your lies and I can't breathe a word of truth
And the proof is lack, and the room is black
One hit of you and we can go to the moon and back
I'm a lunatic, my life's in pieces and I need you to glue it back
But you're used to that
'Cause you do this to everyone you've ever been with
It's like you're my parole, the way you're finishing my sentence
And now I'm in this hole and it's endless
I'm broken and I'm hoping you can pick up all the remnants and mend it

I'm sinking down, twenty thousand leagues
To save me now, you need a submarine
'Cause my heart is lost at sea
To save me now, you need a submarine

Whoa, whoa
To save me now, to save me now

Whoa, whoa
To save me now, you need a submarine

You think you're the king of your own jungle
But you're lying to yourself
Hate on me, you're retirement to my health
See, I hate you when you're gone but I love you when you're here
You're ruining my life, but I forgot if I should care
'Cause even though you're wrong for me, I love that you belong to me
And honestly when you're gone, where you are is where I wanna be
And I should know better, enough is enough
Killing those who love me for the one that I love
But there's really no point in running away to get lost again
Lost again
And I really don't care, I could die right here where the bottom is
I'm done with this

I'm sinking down, twenty thousand leagues
To save me now, you need a submarine
'Cause my heart is lost at sea
To save me now, you need a submarine

Whoa, whoa
To save me now, to save me now

Whoa, whoa
To save me now, you need a submarine

Micky Dolenz,"We were speaking of belief
Beliefs and conditioning
All belief possibly could be said to be the result of some conditioning
Thus the study of history is simply the study of one system of beliefs
Deposing another and so on and so on and so on
A psychologically tested belief of our time is that the central nervous
System, which feeds it's impulses directly to the brain, is unable to
Discern between the real and the vividly imagined experience,
If there is a difference, and most of us believe there is
Am I being clear?
To examine these concepts requires tremendous energy and discipline
To experience the now without preconception or belief
To allow the unknown to occur and to occur requires clarity
For where there is clarity, there is no choice
And where there is choice, there is misery
But then why should anyone listen to me?
Why should I speak since I know nothing?",You and I,1976

With all your little toys

You're a beautiful boy
With all your little ploys
Your mind has changed the world
And you're now forty years old
You got all you can carry
And still feel somehow empty

Creating multiple plays
You like to fence in your world
And settle down when you're old

And never scratch your soul

Try and play the role and yo the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up (c'mon!) see'mon throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling, jump across the ceiling
Muggs lifts a funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's hoe
Feelin', funkin', amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
Than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the hill plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun!
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel, to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig, 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzanegger
Try to play me out like, as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie I'll wet ya
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Microdisney,"Dazed, 
All of my blood on the pillow, 
And she says, It's late, you must go, 
If we meet again try not to faint in my hallway, 
And don't throw my mirror around.

Seven years of bad luck coming round.

Ambulance for one, 
I've had all I can take, 
What pretty shapes these lines make.
Have you met my friend, 
He says his name is Tim, 
Take him home and kill him.
 
Dances in rain in the garden.
He's laughing with his membranes all torn.
And a great battered face leers back at me from the mirror, 
Melting in the heat and the noise.

Yes, I think I'll crack now.

Ambulance for one,

What gloomy shapes her thighs make.
Have you met my friend, 
He says his name is Tim, 
Take him home and kill him.",Ambulance for One,1988
Microdisney,"Put your dress back on,
And I will sing this song,
About an honest man.
He never had a job,
He barely had a home,
And the landlord came to call.

Just pack your things and go,
This room is now on show.
That's the reason he descended into hell,
Where the cry babies
Come out from padded cells.
And the human race
Just turned and said farewell,
On the morning he descended into hell.

When screaming in the street,
He'd use a disco beat.
All your audience will flee,
And you'll be all alone.

Another sunny day,
He sips cold soup and strays,
He was lost and he descended into hell,
By the arches where
He hears that railroad bell.
No more worries, no aggression, all is well.
He was lost and he descended into hell.

So there it is, complete.
You can say what you want
But at least I don't
Hide what I am.
And I'm going to leave you now
So you can go
Knee jerk, knee jerk, knee jerk
Knee jerk, knee jerk, knee jerk
Knee jerk.",And He Descended into Hell,1995
Microdisney,"On the clifftop,
Of the blessed,
He flaps his elbows and he
Wears a dress,

Soon he's flying,
Over town,
He sees the floods, the fires, he laughs,
Turning to the clouds,
They called him weak and they were wrong,
Cause Angel knows where he belongs.

[Chorus]
Angels, angels,
Keep the angels off my back.
Angels, angels,
Keep the angels off my back.

So sue your baker,
Sue your tailor,
And your childhood sweetheart too,
And anyone who knows.
With wings of white and skin of blue,
Tomorrow belongs to you.

Angels, angels,
Keep the angels off my back.

I've got a message for you.
I've got a message for you,
All the tortured boys and girls,
Can go where he has gone.

Microdisney,"Transit Moscow, 3:50 am,
The road and the sign and the rain,
He sees the border guards
Gaping at his tank,
And says: Open that gate
While you still can,
I am the armadillo man.

It does not matter
What country you are in,
Just stay here on base
With your own kind,
But he knew a patriot
Needs a strong free hand,
Now he's off to torch
That red-infested land,
Can't stop the armadillo man.

High-gabled houses
Loom through the rain,
He's on course for destiny,
With a whoosh and a whistle and a bang,
Bye bye armadillo man.

While other people never even tried.",Armadillo Man,1995
Microdisney,"We went to a cheap hotel,
A no soap no sleep hotel,
The difference and for public scorn.
In the dead town where we were born,
How I hoped you wouldn't change your mind.
But until it was time to find,
She was even crazier than I

[Chorus]
In the big sleeping house,
Painted white,
Facing south,
With the ghost to grin at you,
Afternoon,
Now please get out.

This the night before,
We've had a little
And we want some more,
It changed the world
And it makes us sweat,
Make no promises make no threats.

And I gave her what I give you now,
It was weak and it was built on sand.
And she, with both her hands.

[Chorus]

With the ghosts.

I heard you ran off to America,
She has position and possessions now,
And I bet you can't remember how.

In the big sleeping house,
Painted white,
Facing south,
We held my hands
Up to her face
And said damn this place

Microdisney,"I went to see
Mrs Simpson,
Up ten flights of stairs.
My aunt had died,
Leaving me millions,
Which I wanted to share.

Door was closed,
Locked and barred,
The sign read sealed forever.
Should not have come,
Summers gone,
The year hangs tarred and feathered.

Like head on legs,
Rest of a person,
Somewhere in between.
I took the lot,
Taking you over,
All crazy and mean.

What we did and said in this place,
No one will ever know so what's your discrace?
Here comes broken backs and bloody tears.
The air's thick and black and you disappeared.

I went up,
To see Mrs Simpson,
But she was not there.
She may have gone,
Back to her husband,
But I don't really care.

Broken backs,
Heart attacks,
Don't help keep me sober.
I should not have come,
Cause what I've done,
Is done and gone and over.

So hard luck,
I won't own up,
At your inquest come December.
Its world war six,
Or twenty one,
The sense has gone its over.

I'll wreck my social life,
They'll disinfect my chair 
And claim some uncivil rights.

Why?

He's putting straight the record track,
Here comes the sun,
Black is back.
Ask him why he turns his back,
On the innocents upon the rack,
Saves his sympathy for rats.

The doctor is a fool,
He's just a callous snob,
He had 15 years in a Jesuit school,
And now he's not fit for any job,
He just sneers and he drives a big car,
Is this my savior,
A tale to tell.

Go and ask your friend the hack
He's putting straight the record track,
Lets spend the night,
Here it comes, get back.

There's nothing wrong with me,
I am just wonderful,
I've got pop songs to keep me calm,
And faithful friends like you.
So if you ever need a view,
At my barbed wire rainbow,

Go and ask your friend the hack,
He's dancing to his record track,
You paranoid,
You paranoid.

For taking nothing seriously.

Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers

After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz

And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck

The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious

Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer

And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand

Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Far across the sea
Waiting for

That burns inside of me
And I feel a storm

Approaching
My Mexican home

My God! I cried, it's so hot inside
You could die in the living room
Take the fan from the window
Prop the door back with a broom
The cuckoo clock has died of shock
And the windows feel no pane
The air's as still
As the throttle on a funeral train

Siento que mi tierra crece
Y duplicarse parece
Dentro de mi en cierto amor
Tu pintoresco sabor tan boricua noche y día
Adoba con simpatía de adorable condimento

El encantado momento
De andar por la tierra mía

Serranía de verdura
Picachos de suave cresta
Incomparable floresta
Y gente de sonrisa pura
Valles de fruta madura
Pueblos, calma, algarabía
Dondequiera la alegría normal del puertorriqueño

Para sentirme su dueño
Visito la tierra mía

Es el vasto panorama
El terruño maternal
La terapia vegetal

Y mi vista se derrama en la tropical poesía

""Now, I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there

   And I'd talk to him, as long as he liked

""Dad was going to take mom and me with him later on this year, Why,
   l remember 'I'm saying: 'Someday this old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear!'
But, I know I'll never get to ride an 18-wheeler again
   But, this old base will keep me in touch with all my trucker friends!""

""Teddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone
   'Cause it's about time for mom to come home
But, you give me a shout when you're passin' through
   And I'll sure be happy to come back to you!""

Well, I came back and I said: uh! ""Before you go 10-10
   What's your home 20, little CB friend?""
Well, he gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate
   'Cause this hot load of freight was just gonna have to wait

I turned that truck around on a dime
   And headed straight for Jackson Street, 229
And as I rounded the corner, oh, I got one heck of a shock
   late wheelers were lined up for three city blocks!

Why, I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call
   And that little crippled boy was having a ball
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
   Another would carry him to his truck and take off again

Well, you better believe I took my turn at riding Teddy Bear
   And then I carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy if I never live to see happiness again
   I want you to know I saw it that day, in the face of that little man

We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
   And each driver said goodbye and then they all were gone
He shook my hand with a mile-long grin
   And said: ""So long, trucker I'll catch ya again!""

Well, I hit the Interstate with tears in my eyes
   I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
""Breaker 1-9!"" Came a voice on the air
   ""Just one word of thanks from Mama Teddy Bear!""

""We wish each and every one, a special prayer for you
   'Cause, You just made my little boy's dream come true
I'll sign off now, before, I start to cry
   May God ride with you, 10-4, and goodbye.""",137 Piano,2008
Midge Ure,"I know you're leaving but it's too long overdue
For far too long, I've had nothing new to show to you
Goodbye, dry eyes, I've watched your 'plane fade off west of the moon
And it felt so strange to walk away alone

There's no regrets
No tears goodbye
I don't want you back
We'd only cry again
Say goodbye again

The thoughts we used to share I now keep alone

Midge Ure,"From city streets you came with something true
From dirt and smoke you breathed in something new
And when you laid all before you, they took what you made
And threw it away, the gift that you gave

With hands of gold and images strong
You cast the shape of things to cling on
And when you tried to show them, they took what you made
And gave it away, the gift that you gave

And in return, I give you honest love
These things I see around me
I see with my soul, I feel in my heart
The gift that you gave and in return I give you my respect

That's all that's mine for giving, I've learned from it all
The textures and form, the gift that you gave
And when they ask what prize I treasure most
What legacy I cherish, I say from the heart
The passion and art, that's the gift that you gave",The Gift,1985

Midge Ure,"The boy is listening to those records from the past
He wants to make them last
For they make him feel alive
They are the voices of the faces on the wall

He listens to them all
Hangs on every little tale they tell
Knows them all and their life stories
Shares their pain and shares their glories

One day he even cut their names upon his skin
They mean that much to him
For them he'd take the test

His bedroom window opens to the evening air
The fox is in his lair
The volume of his system is full on
But the neighbors moan and the parents call
This angry noise is the muzak of the wastelands

Wastelands, the wastelands, wastelands

The boy is dressing in the fashion of the day
The kids all dress that way, you can tell them anywhere
The boy looks out and sees his friends are waiting there
In the cold electric glare

Of those lamps that make you think that night is day
They drag their lusts into your sight
With shouts and screams they meet the night

They block your way in twos and fours
In uniforms from city stores
They're closing in, who knows the score

He has a brand new radio, but never turns it on.

[Chorus]
New Europeans.
Young Europeans.
New Europeans.

A photograph of lovers lost, lies pressed in magazines.
Her eyes belong to a thousand girls, she's the wife who's never seen.
Their educated son has left, in search of borrowed dreams.
His television's in his bed, he's frozen to the screen.

[Chorus]

On a crowded beach washed by the sun, he puts his headphones on.
His modern world revolves around the synthesizer's song.
Full of future thoughts and thrills, his senses slip away.
He's a European legacy, a culture for today.

[Chorus]

Midge Ure,"Sleepwalk. 

Rolling and falling, I'm choking and calling,
Name after name after name.

Sleepwalk. 

Naked and bleeding, the streetlights stray by me,
Hurting my eyes with their glare.

Sleepwalk.

Helplessly breaking, exchanging my faces,
Destined, we had to collide.

Sleepwalk!

Taut on the outside, I'm crumpling and crawling,
Watching the day drag away.
Spiralling deeper, I can't feel my fingers,
Rip round my throat as I dream.

Dream!

Midge Ure,"Native these words seem to me
All speech directed to me
I've heard them once before
I know that feeling

Stranger emotions in mind
Changing the contours I find
I've seen them once before
Someone cries to me

Chorus:

O O O O
The look and the sound of the voice
O O O O 
They try, they try
O O O O
The shape and the power of the voice
O O O O
In strong low tones

Forceful and twisting again
Wasting the perfect remains
I've felt it once before
Slipping over me

Sweetly the voices decay
Draw on the lines that they say
I'd lost it once before
Now it cries to me

Midge Ure,"When pale turns to pink
With a soft unnerving ease
And all you've built around
May just tumble to the ground

We stand or fall
With your future in another's hands
We stand or fall
When your life is not your own

When white turns to red
In the not too distant days
Will force and misery
Be the life you have to lead?

We stand or fall
With your children in anothers world
We stand or fall
When your town is not your own

Chorus:

White China
White China

When crimson takes a hold
When the lights go down on all you've ever known
When all you'll ever do
Is worked out for you

We stand or fall
When the thoughts you have are not your own
We stand or fall
When the freedom slips away

Moving constantly
You are in the smallest place

Smiling, raining down like sun
Smiling and in my soul I see you as you are
Smiling on and on and on

Holding the world in hand
Spinning round at your command
You are in every DNA
Your signature displayed

Offer up a world in your hand
Crossing tide and time to bring me home

To hand over all of your things and start over new
While we were out hunting for food
Our house was being robbed
I caught an apple and she caught a fox
So I caught a rabbit but she caught an ox

So upon our return we found everything gone
Which for us was no loss
We started over with a rabbit and an ox

So they came down from the north
Carrying all they owned
With a basket full of food and clothes
They were stopped by a weekend raid
Traveling the woods one day
Tried to put up a fight but lost

So we asked for them to stay
With us on their way
To have a drink and rest
And regain their strength

To see many places and hide in ditches

And all that certain men lay upon it when anger is seen

A way of life that was common for all
And all that runs on the mountain was mine

Yo! This for all my motherfucking niggaz
On the West Coast, on the East Coast
In the mid-West, the Dirty South
Nigga, I don't care what you doing
Who you wit, or where you at, nigga
Go Crazy, nigga
Go motherfucking Crazy, nigga
Get motherfucking sick wit it!

Sometimes I might get a little Crazy
Dipped and sticking doors with one-eighty
Ever since the G's raised me
The streets couldn't fade me, go Crazy

[Christ Bearer]
Yeah, all why'all niggaz go Crazy
Leave the bitch-ass niggaz braindead in the daily
Too many ho's yelling, ""Christ Bearer, save me!""
Bitches can't swim 'cause the water too wavy
My nigga, get a little nuts
The Wu don't give two fucks, Clan like Klu Klux
Lace the Digi with the 'dro
Tai Bo, bust ya fo'-fo', let ya hair down, ho
Ya gotta get a little sick
Let niggaz try to play you like a step-child and click
Fuck the dumb shit, nigga, trip
Lose ya grip, pull a semi-automatic out the whip
Get psychotic, neurotic, they want it, they got it
Bang it to the boogie, hypnotic
Dip a stick and do a quick one-eighty
Like G's that raised me, a Long Beach baby
Taught me the difference of a bitch and a lady
The streets can't fade me when I'm liable to go Crazy

Crazy, like hitting a bank with a three-eighty
And maybe, flip and pistol-whip an old lady
That's shady, ya think that's shady?
Hell, not as shady as the bitch that had my first baby
And maybe, that's why I blow big dope on the daily
And maybe, I'll fuck ten more bitches and have ten more babies
And lately, I've been wanting to take shit back to the eighties
And maybe, I'll drive-by shooting at niggaz that hate me
See baby, you know my story and that's the way it still goes
Real crazy, I'm still rapping baby and I still hate ho's
Shoshot is sick wit it, gots nothing for ho's
but conversation and some dick wit it, can you dig it?
I'm a zipped down fool, and niggaz pause when I spit it
I might strip to my drawers, when I trip off the liquid
See maybe, I need to get fucked up 'til I hurl
'cause I'm Crazy like 2Pac screaming ""Fuck the world!""

[Chorus 2X]
[Christ Bearer]
Yeah, fuck that, go looney
Screaming ""Bitch, sue me"", off the wall like a young Paul Moonie
Break a rule, act a motherfucking fool
Roll a cutty on D's, solo at the carpool
Play Clyde Bearer's like a young Warren Beaty
Let Bonnie be ya lady so the bitch go Crazy

[Meko the Pharaoh]
While niggaz go Crazy I stay amazing
Doing what I do, straight blazing
Re-arranging, the time structure in the streets
Rotating planets like my people far out, you can't see
Believe it or not, a drop
NorthStar make ya heart stop
Too hot.. yeah, my shit stay live.. wit a vibe
that makes niggaz go Crazy when they get high (pass that)
Bitches button down ya button-fly
Niggaz bust ya fo'-five, get real live
'cause ya only live this life once
So bounce to this motherfucker like you own one (bounce)
Dip a stick and straight trip on a nigga
Take a sip and straight spit on a nigga

Imagining they were yours

In their place grew bombs like a pressure mine
Like a filter built into the rind
'Cause after all no one has ventured beyond
And what's beyond belongs to only one

He's waiting patiently inside the rind to see what he'll find

Like a stubborn little baby boy,
At times it seems as if he's got me by the hand
Pulling me along more sure than I am

So determined, so sure what he will find

And we're running like children
I'm trying to keep up, don't let go
Like children
Like children

Our footsteps begin to draw away,
Like pulling to and from ourselves as we evolve
We warp and swell and bend
I want to recoil

Like children

Where'd you go? Where are you?
Endless prints in the dust
Come back
Stay

Wait up and walk with me a ways

Midnight Star,"Excuse me, may I have this dance
I was all alone, I was feeling rather low
I needed someone to lift my spirits up, so I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance and there this sweet lovin' thing was

She was more than enough I asked her for her hand
Said, ""Would you like to dance?""
So pleased that I had asked, she quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love on a slow jam, yeah, yeah

Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
A slow jam for my baby and for me, ooh
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
(Play)
A slow jam
(A slow jam, yeah)

Seems what you say is true I feel the same way too
See, I've waited all night long just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand I knew you were the man
To turn my world around and make my dreams come true

The magic in your eyes made me realize
That everything I feel has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love on a slow jam

Play another slow jam
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
This time make it sweet
(Play)

(Play another-nother slow jam for me and my baby, yeah)

When I rise in the morning and face the sunlight
You bounce all my love and it's air tight
Sometimes I'm curious on how you feel
When you're screaming out my name

Explore every possibility, let's get down
Shorty time will reveal the only true test is pain

And discuss the many different various
Issues that affiliate the best of both of us
Word the mother and as we ride up on the Bus
Conversation is making the whole situation a plus

Just figure it out, is we dealing wit us?
Or do we capture that feeling that makes you curious
About whether or not we minimize the fuss
Just to move on, you must trust in Bussa Bus
And from the bus, my horse carriages carry us
Singin' Sarafina, a little ghetto fabulous, fabulous

Midnight Star,"Let me tell you a story ‘bout a girl and a guy
The guy was too fresh, the girl was too fly
They've been together for a very long time
When they felt the sense of change in the state of their mind

They had a true love, but they just didn't know
How to talk to one another, so the feelings could show
To each other they wouldn't devote
Had to throw in that rope, had to rock that boat

Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don’t fix it
Just relax and let it flow

You and I together, boy, we made a perfect pair
Till we got those inner feelings and played those games of truth and dare
No, I’m not one to regret but I know I did you wrong
And it’s so hard to forget how you loved me all night long

I tried to understand my feelings why I ever played on you
In these days of danger, I really should be true
It ain't worth those silly chances to be a fool whenever I date
From right now to forever let’s remember this simple phrase

Don’t rock that boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don’t fix it
Just relax and let it flow

Don’t rock the boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it don't fit, don’t force it
Just chill out and let it flow

Don’t rock the boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
D-don’t do it, don’t do it
Don’t do, d-don’t, don’t

Foolishly I play the field to satisfy myself
But the true satisfaction comes from you and no one else
Ooh, you don’t have to worry ‘cause I feel the same way too
And I’ll never touch another, baby, I’m savin' my love for you

We were lucky, we found out in time
Now that we know the truth, sugar, things will work out fine
We will stay together and we’ll never drift apart
I knew just what to do to keep you in my heart

Don’t rock that boat

Let me tell you a story ‘bout a girl and a guy
The guy was too fresh, the girl was too fly
They've been together for a very long time
When they felt the sense of change in the state of their mind

They had a true love, but they just didn't know
How to talk to one another, so the feelings could show
To each other they wouldn't devote
Had to throw in that rope, had to rock that boat

The girl wanted love that was gigantic
But love was drfitin' like The Titanic
Not just knee deep, it was total knee deep
When the fly girl had to stop for keys

Who were rockin’ those freaks ahoy
She said to herself, “What’s wrong with that boy?”
To each other we should devote
Please love each other, stop rockin’ that boat

Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don’t fix it
Just relax and let it flow

Don’t rock the boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it don’t fit, don’t force it
Just chill out and let it flow

A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night

A warm embracing dance away

Midnight String Quartet,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find

You said you would always stay

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand

Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

But we see hope in this Garden of Eden and I'll never give it up, no

Sweet Renee she was destined for me, we had a road to drive on
But I let her sway from the headlights and I had to give her up

So I gave her - Dead Flowers, and ran away, Dead Flowers, they hit me in the wrong way

Jack and Jill they went climbing that mountain, they went to hold hands
But by the time they had got it together, the view said to give it up

'cause they saw - Dead Flowers, and ran away, Dead Flowers, they hit me in the wrong way
They hit me in the wrong way...

Now all these failures mean something, my lonely heart is a mess
All these lows have hardened my soul, but is there time for me yet?
To trust my mother was taken, for a cause so bright and true
Will you give me some time to mourn, with an angel like you?
All I want in my resting place let my roots unfurl
Well all at once I knew that I had, all at once I knew that I had hope

I'll never give up, I'll never give it up

Midtown,"Step outside and listen.
As you cut through the tension,
The world is crumbling down around you-it's found you.
When you woke up yesterday,
There was nothing left for me to say to you
Because you wanted me to be true.
When all you feel is pain,
Ands somehow things have changed I'll be coming home to you.
When I forgot to call,
You knew it all,
It was coming down on you.
Will you still be waiting,
That's something I can't ask you to be.
Will you be still waiting for me?
I'm waiting for you and something is wrong,
But I just can't put my finger on it.
You never listened and you'll never listen now,
You know what I'm about,
But is that sufficient?
Do you hear the words I say?
It hurts when you talk that way.
You say you'll listen cause you'd like to live together lives,
But come on,
You could have any other boy to take my place and hold when you're feeling alone.
How can you say that I'm supposed to stay when you talk on to me that way?
Oh come on.
I can't see what's supposed to be,
But if you trust me it might turn ok.
What are you gonna say?

if i could chose to start it over
i'd exercise more discretion

But you'd push it away

Tonight it seemed suddenly perfect
Still no promises made

Were you trying to let me in

Or was I trying so hard
That all my confidence was lost tonight
Confused and regretful, I cracked
Swallowed it back
And left with no spine intact

See how this ought to be
Just a taste of life to see what's right

Hey yo, what up
This one for all my homeboys across the world, right, been through some shit.
I know you've all had a lot on your mind, man.
Had a lot of struggles you went through in your life.
Keep your head up dirty.

I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left.
I've been hit, been low, been high, I guess
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)

See the star was born.
Don't think nobody notice.
Goin' through these trials and tribulations kept me on focus.
Tried to do a 9-5, but where's the money?
Coming to work damn near bumming, 
people thinkin' it's funny (ha ha).
I'm fed up.
Plus my homies sellin' crack doin' good.
Now I'm thinking fuck doing it legal bring it back to the hood.
Man it's hell, you see, wasn't no woman there for me.
I ain't got shit but a dream, that's why they chose to ignore me.

[Chorus]
I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left.
I've been hit, been low, been high, I guess
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)
I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left.
But I ain't blowin' up I'm built to ride to death.
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)

Hey
Now I'm on the block pumping rocks toting glocks.
Grand-mama on my head, I'm ducking and dodging the cops.
All cause I'm trying to make a living (living).
Consequences of that,
End up dead or in prison, ain't shit given.
I done struggled too long not to floss and get on.
I'ma get it with the double, if not the microphone.
I'm headstrong plus I'm out for those dead presidents.
And the government ain't doing shit for my residence.

[Chorus]

It's been a long time coming (yeah we struggled)
It's been a bumpy ride (but we gonna make it)
So these wheels will keep on turning (say what)
Till the day I die (ride with me for a minute y'all).
It's been a long time coming (yeah we struggled)
It's been a bumpy ride (but we gonna make it)
So these wheels will keep on turning 
Till the day I die 

Now my homies busted and getting shot at it's getting serious.
Plus I'm praying but they breaking down in tears.
See now that I'm on, people think money make you proud.
But I've been struggling trying to come up since I was a child.
Who are you to judge me for my sins and what I did wrong.
I'm trying to live don't my mama singing a sad song.
They say look out for your family and so I try to sure.
Look Tommy I miss you but I'll see you when I get thurr.

[Chorus]

Hey, I'm dedicating this song to everybody that lost a loved one, 
To the people in 9-11, hurricane Katrina, 
All the folks that lost folks that they care about, 
And if you down yourself, you got somebody that's down, 
You tryin' to bring they spirits up, this for y'all man.
I know you can relate to my pain 
So just feel your boy ching-a-ling man I do this for all y'all.",Cadillac Door,2006

[Featuring Nate Dogg  Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
Snoop (Daz): 
Yeah  what I'ma do right here is take my time  
and dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace  
and my niggas behind the wall. 
See you when I get there  you know what I'm saying? (really doe) 
So drip with me as I go down memory lane. 
Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener  
(1 8 7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor). 
I've seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up, 
some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed. 
But it's a East Side thang, a hoo ride thang, 
('cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang). 
I bring you the motherfucking .38, 
(just get the MC and the homie Nate). 
So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide, 
as I take you on a trip nigga ride (East Side). 
Nate (Daz): 
Do you remember back on the East Side? 
Where all us niggas used to love to ride. 
We didn't care what we did, 
time was nothing to us we were just kids. 
Times are different now, but you still get stuck, 
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck. 
So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me, 
keep this in mind: I'm a motherfucking O.G. 
Snoop: 
Lets speed the clock up and pass some time, 
June 17th, 1979. 
That's my first time being arrested, 
I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit. 
I learned than from the G's, 
a G is an overseer, the overseer sees. 
More than you do 'cause he gets experienced, 
and besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent. 
So I was gone, and I'm on my way home, 
my momma's going to get me, and I flee with (???). 
She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb, 
We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones. 
She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done, 
she said: ""playing football should be your only fun son"". 
I'm like ""allright"" so we enter the house, 
come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth. 
I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch, 
I looked at my momma and said: ""damn, why you snitch?"" 
They put me on punishment but that didn't work, 
now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a T-shirt. 
And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides, 
I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time. 
Nate: 
My homie told me one day he had a jack move, 
he said: ""come on Nate Dogg, it'll be smooth"". 
I agreed and said ""come on, let's go and jack them fools"", 
next day we were draped in the county blues. 
I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years), 
saying to myself ""I'll never fuck with that nigga again"". 
'fore I'm locked down I learned to be 
what I am now and that's a motherfucking O.G. 
Original gangsta 
Daz: 
I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials, 
never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile. 
You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an O.G., 
beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some Hillfigers. 
The man behind the trigger, committing robberies, 
with the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me. 
Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me, 
because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more. 
Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door, 
to let you know we can't take no more. 
Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends, 
and let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost. 
Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair, 
and ask myself: ""who the fuck should I really fear?"". 
I ran around with the best killers, 
thug criminals and drug dealers. 
Blasting niggas if they come near us, 
(???) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could. 
Knock on wood for good luck, 
serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck. 
Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack, 
a grown child laying niggas the fuck down. 
Nate (Daz): 
Original gangsta (original gangsta), 
coming from Long Beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me). 
Coming from the East Side... 
You're fucking with The Pound, oh nigga please, 
see-O-B.'s can't see the D-O-double G's, [O.G.'s... repeat 5 times] 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. D-A-Z, 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. Warren G, 
shout outs to my nigga S-N-double O-P, 
shout outs to my niggas see, Style and me. 
Snoop (Nate): 
Yeah, straight up, based on a true story. 
you know what I'm saying? It's a G thang baby (original gangsta) 
You trick ass bitch!

Oops wrong hole what she said in the shower
Already hit the booty hole for an hour

CHORUS X 2

Ring around the rosie, pocket fulla posie

Let's go smoke an ounce up, maybe tear da house up
Gripp on her ass cause this lads got a big butt
She can make ya touch ground, she can make ya bounce round
She could pack it up make a killin in another town
Shake junt staring, I don't mean no harmin
Call me Mr. Whipple cause I want to squeeze the Charmin
Rubbbin on her back as I suck on her NIPPLE!
Mane dis gal stacked but cheeks like a HIPPO!

CHORUS X 2

You's a bad young thang baby where yo mane

Got somethin poking out of that short ass dress
You know just whacha doin gal, and you a mess
With yourself, stackin wealth got me on hard
If I getcha in the bed pussy gon' fart
You da strait freak type, and I'm lovin dat

Layin down wit a man, went behind the bar
Catchin me with dope then she take the charge

We tote choppers, with a hundred in 'em
And you see them dome shots we bout, runnin in 'em

Bitch, whats happenin'? Start shit but don't take it
Pull it out, put it on your ass
Some of y'all niggaz still got the game fucked up this year
But I ain't gonna have it
Tryna talk about another mother fucker on a record
And the bitch ain't got no cabbage
Hopin' somebody can tell me whats wrong with this picture
Don't think you can put out what ever you want
And I ain't gonna come back in the bitch and come getcha
I'mma find out where ya hang at
Where ya old lady live and what time you be there
Go scope out ya ride
Follow ya to work and bring that heat
Duck and woo from this fuckin' fool
Monkey see, monkey do
Nigga so you can't be the man right chea too
There's none after this not another livin' M.C. as hazardous
And as talented and handsome, ghetto fabulous
Keep em off my back whenever they comin' I bring that double
In a minute y'all niggaz don't show no love its gonna be trouble
These niggaz here get ya name bent
Washed up anybody y'all sent
Gotta watch these niggaz, they get outta line
Gotta put 'em in they place every time they nut up
Gotta stop 'em from spreadin' them lies
Bust 'em in they mouth and make em shut up
Get up, come here never seen me cut up, you must not be from here
Im four and none here
Don't have me to bring up the shit I've done here
Reach blazin' temperatures
So please come with ya sun gear
Whoop the sleeves off of mutherfuckers that try to run in here
Serious look on my face and a boot in my mouth and balled up fists
These niggaz don't want my trouble
But its too late for 'em, gotta accept this shit

Tryna like me

You wanna do what I do?

You wanna take my style?

You would, but you can't, so u ain't

From the moment that I slid in the door
They know I'm back 'cause you can hear it in the floor
But after I rap bitches ain't feelin' it no more
Wanna talk that shit, better know what to come with
If you jump in the water
Then ya ass better throw up before I start ballin'
And if you ever fuck with what I be recording
I'm ma flush you down the toilet
And if you ever come at me wrong with a mike
I'mma throw you in the gutter
I cant be scared these niggaz
And they disrespect me 'cause I'm from New Orleans
We don't play that shit
When these niggaz and they really want me to get started
Make it painful I don't think so
I be bustin' till I can't
Thats what I where that tank for
Hittin' with the speed of Roy Jones Jr.
And the strength of iron Mike Tyson
Triflin, exciting, well precise
And I gotta let 'em know that I still been right
You talk on me strong
Just 'cause I'm rich don't mean that it don t sound hungry
Count if you wanna
Hope you think 'cause you little I won't jump on ya
You better remember that
When you be droppin' that bullshit
You lucky I'm in a good mood right now
But I'm lettin' you know how it could get
If I was the preacher
Y'all niggaz would run when I step off the pulpit
If I was you I'd leave me alone
'Cause bitch I ain't nothin' to fool with
But if it is on ya mind
You got somethin' to prove, then go head and do it
I get so vivid, I wouldn't be able to make a better picture if I could
You understand my platinum then fuck up my raps, semi tracks
No matter whether kickin' a verse or smokin' a sack
I'll fuck over you, yea
I'm makin' a habit of hurtin' they head and busting' they ass
Fuckin' they woman and takin' they spotlight, makin' 'em mad

Got her buyin' us sticky green, lace some with promythazine

Candy sweets, a candy bitch, you lookin' at a candy boy

Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boyz, that's why we act this way

Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin' in criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality, unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats, and gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble, write rippers that'll make you think

Can you picture this?
It's bout that time we got the tunes
Hot on the block sippin' on 'yac like some damn fools
Consumin' liquor by the ounce
Ya guys is rollin' up to get their grub on,
wit the dubs on and the car that bounce
Help at the park, barbaques wit roasted pig
And can nobody eat until the meat is done and we feed the kids
Nieces, nephews, uncles and aunties
Yea, you ride wit plenty of folks but ain't got nothin' up on these
Seeds from the weed, up out the bangs of optimos
A bunch of pimps, playas, and hustlaz to fock the hoes
Pros comin' off, when the barbaques done
ain't really focus on that, but hell a playa bound to get some
Kids runnin' back-and-fourth cryin' on who pushed them now
We all fam, but I be damned if they push my seat down
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

[Chorus:1x] *background chorus vocals - Koffee Brown
How does it feel to ya
Roll up the Swisher baby if it's real to ya
Gangstas, where we from (?) to ya
Leg breakin', cake bakin', is it trill to ya
How does it feel to ya
That's how we do it
Hop in the heavy Chevy, corner bend to it
Shine up the candy and the twenty-twins to it
Get drunk, fill up your cup again to it
How does it feel to ya...feel me now

Hennessy and gin, need some orange and apple juices

Midwest is the timezone
When it gets hot,
We go block-to-block, open up shop, and get our grind on
Now I ain't lyin' homes to whoever make a playa change
To release the tension, mention basketball and play a game
Wit dames on the sideline cheerin' you on
And haters that can't play on the side while,
cryin' foul, screwin' you on
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

[Verse 3: Coo Coo Cal]
Can you picture this?
A bunch of bawlaz ride oldschools
A lot of them cut the top, hookin' up decks and sounds to roll to
It ain't the old two-hundred twenty twins
Mack-10, boss jackin' at the lakefront in the city I'm in
Bendin' corners in an orderly fashion
Twenty cars deep,
creepin' up the street, beatin' dawg so it be mashin'
Flashin' bread at them chickenhead
Yea they jumpin' in to sin dawg,
'cause-it's-about the only thing that'll get 'em fed
Hear what I just said
Pick 'em up in the presidential rento limo, TV's and (?)
Ghetto celeb is the gear we wear
Naw ya'll don't hear it there
But by the end of this year you gonna feel the player
Sippin' on Henn, and Cris is gettin' plenty drunk
Which switches from the candy-coupe dawg, an empty front
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

[Chorus:1x] *background chorus vocals - Koffee Brown
How does it feel to ya
Roll up the Swisher baby if it's real to ya
Gangstas, where we from (?) to ya
Leg breakin', cake bakin', is it trill to ya
How does it feel to ya
That's how we do it
Hop in the heavy Chevy, corner bend to it
Shine up the candy and the twenty-twins to it
Get drunk, fill up your cup again to it
How does it feel to ya...feel me now

Mieczyslaw Fogg,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

Miff Mole,"You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
 
Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da

Miff Mole,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say: 

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin

Miff Mole,"How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?
Why do you try to make me feel so blue?
I've done nothing to you.
Do me right or else just let me be.

I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned

Miff Mole,"You dress me up, I'm your puppet 
You buy me things, I love it 
You bring me food, I need it 
You give me love, I feed it 

And look at the two of us in sympathy 
With everything we see 
I never want anything, it's easy 
You buy whatever I need 

But look at my hopes, look at my dreams 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 

You phone me in the evening on hearsay 
And bought me caviar 
You took me to a restaurant off Broadway 
To tell me who you are 

We never-ever argue, we never calculate 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 

I'm your puppet 
I love it 

And look at the two of us in sympathy 
And sometimes ecstasy 
Words mean so little, and money less 
When you're lying next to me 

But look at my hopes, look at my dreams 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 

Look at my hopes, look at my dreams 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent

Look at my hopes, look at my dreams 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent

It's just unlawful
How that boy can cheat
But I must have that man

He's hot as Hades
A lady's not safe in his arms when she's kissed
But I'm afraid that when he's cooled off
And maybe I'm ruled off his list
I'll never be missed
