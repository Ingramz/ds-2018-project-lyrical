Kenny Poole,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1999
Kenny Poole,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight",Stars Fell on Alabama,1999
Kenny Poole,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
",When Lights Are Low,1999
Kenny Poole,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are 
Songs to be sung 
Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young",You Make Me Feel So Young,1999
Kenny Poole Quartet,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There Is No Greater Love,2000
Kenny Price,"I'm burnin' the letters that I've kept from time to time
And I waited to see if she would call
I know that what she's doing's gonna make me lose my mind
But she's gone ahead and done it after all 
Yes she's gone ahead and done it after all
The picture that she gave me makes the flame burn high
For I just can't stand to see them on the wall
I told them that she would never listen to his lies
But she's gone ahead and done it after all 
Yes she's gone ahead and done it after all
The tears I shed are from the smoke that fills the room
I guess it's best that I forget about that call
I said I'd never cry but if that smoke don't clear out soon
Well I've gone ahead and done it after all 
Yes I've gone ahead and done it after all
The flame has just burned out like her love for me
But is that footsteps that I hear down the hall
Now in her arms I know that's where I'll always be
For she said she couldn't do it after all 
That her love was just for me after all",After All,1967
Kenny Price,"I've been through a lotta states and a lotta towns most of them have different names
But you'll find the streets all run the same
Girls are a lot like this if you work it right and I do this well
How I do it is my secret and I refuse to tell
But I'll tell you I'm a big operator I know how to talk that talk
I can talk my way into their hearts without even tryin'
Yes I'm a big operator I know how to walk that walk
You can bet when I walk away I'll leave 'em smilin'

There are many girls in every town that I have left behind
But that don't ever trouble my mind
I won't look back now but if I ever change someday when I get old
Then I'll have these memories to keep away the cold
For they call me a big operator

I'll be smooth as glass if you want me to or rough as desert sand
It depends on what you want in a man
My aim is to please and I believe I do for a back track many times
I was always welcomed by the ones I left behind
You can see that I'm a big operator",Big Operator,1967
Kenny Price,"Go on and leave if it's over and you no longer care for me
But before you leave would you please say something nice to me
Tell me a lie if you want to say you're sorry and don't be
But darling please before you leave say something nice to me

I know you've made up your mind and there's someone waiting for you
I'll never stand in your way but there's one thing that I'd like you to do
Tell me a lie if you want to
Say something nice to me",Say Something Nice to Me,1967
Kenny Price,"I know I'm not your first love they're just a past memory
But I'm the one who's got you now and that's all that matters to me
I know other arms have held you but I'm not jealous of these
For mine are the arms that hold you now and that's all that matters to me
I came alive when you came along you brought life back to me
And don't care what's in your past you're as far as I can see
I know other lips have kissed you I know you've been thrilled and pleased
But mine are the lips that kiss you now and that's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me that's all that matters to me",That's All That Matters,1967
Kenny Price,"Wasting my time again asking you to stop seeing him
I've told you goodbye for the last time but I'm wasting my time again
This thing that you're doing's a sin how could you leave me for him
Somehow I wished we've been nothing but friends there I go wasting my time again
But time means nothing to me when I'm lonely
It takes time to heal when you've lost your one and only
Wasting my time what's new the story of my life with you
I could talk 'till I'm blue in the face but then I'll just be wasting my time again
My time again my time again",Wasting My Time,1967
Kenny Price,"You made me lie to you about my running around
You wouldn't believe me when I told you of a new love I had found
So I just pretended that there never was anyone else
You made me lie to you please lie a little yourself
Forget what I told you I was just fooling myself
And those words I spoke to you were lies I couldn't love anyone else
Why did I lie to you about my running around
Maybe you could see through me and not let this thing get you down
I wouldn't blame you but I trust you more than myself
You made me lie to you please lie a little yourself

Why did I lie to you",You Made Me Lie to You,1967
Kenny Price,"The wind and I have a lot in common it seems we're always in a race with time
We never know just where we're goin' or think about what we leave behind
Grass won't grow on a busy street you can't take bitter and make it sweet
You can't draw water from a well that's dry rainbow fall from a clear blue sky
Grass won't grow on a busy street

Love will bloom in any season but I found out some time ago
My heart just beats in one direction I won't give a true love time to grow
Grass won't grow on a busy street

I never was a little baby if you don't believe me just ask my dad haha
Anything I do I do it big boys when I'm good I'm good and when I'm bad I'm bad
Grass won't grow on a busy street",Grass Won't Grow on a Busy Street,1969
Kenny Price,"I'm a long way from home and so all alone and I'm scared like I thought I'd never be
I'm a long way from home and everything is wrong Lord please watch over me

Can't get a custom to the hunger no one seems to notice that I'm cold
This life's not making me no younger I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told
I'm a long way from home
Well last night I slept in a public mission you know you can't imagine how I felt
With things that they happened to me like they were fiction
Someone tried to steal my shoes while I slept
I'm a long way from home and so all alone
I'm a long way from home",I'm a Long Way from Home,1969
Kenny Price,"I've been down to Mississippi
Down through New Orleans, yes, I have
I've played in California
There's not much that I haven't seen, no, there's not

I'm a ramblin' man
Don't fool around with a ramblin' man

I left a girl in West Virginia
Up where the green grass grows, yes, I did
I got a girl in Cincinnati a waitin'
Where the Ohio river flows, poor girl

I'm a ramblin' man
Don't give your heart to a ramblin' man

You'd better move away
You're standing too close to the flame
Once I mess with your mind
Your little heart won't be the same

I'm a ramblin' man
Don't mess around with any old ramblin' man

Well, up in Chicago
I was known as quite a boy, yes, I was
Yeah, down in Alabama
They call me the man of joy, ha ha, bad boy

Well, I'm a ramblin' man
Don't fall in love with a ramblin' man

You'd better move away

All you got to do is sing
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah

Kenny Price,"I'm a walkin' southern bound down the highway
Cars and buses and the big trucks pass me by
I walk awhile then I thumb they must think I'm a bum
For no one will give this country boy a ride
I left to get a job in that big city cause Lucy's dad said son don't hang around
I got her letter in the mail today and he can't keep me away
And tonight this lovesick boy is southern bound
Can't afford a ticket on that big gray dog
Where I'm a goin' they don't know a freight train sound
I'm a long way from home cold and hungry and all alone
Tonight this country boy is southern bound

Now I know they'll all be glad to see me it's been so long since I left to roam
I can hear my mama cry as she kissed her boy goodbye
Tonight this country boy is a headed home
I've got just enough left to buy some coffee
I'll spend that if this road goes through the town
Take some money if I grind all I have left is my pride
If I have to walk I will I'm southern bound
Can't afford a ticket
Tonight this country boy is southern bound",Southern Bound,1969
Kenny Price,"You ought to see Mr Jones when he rattles the bones
Old Possum Brown dancin' round like a clown
Old aged Mama she's past eighty three shoutin' I'm full o'pep
Watch your step watch your step
One legged Joe danced around on his toe
He threw away his crutch and hollered hey later go
Oh honey hail hail the gang's all here for Alabama Jubilee

You ought to see Mr Jones",Alabama Jubilee,1971
Kenny Price,"Blues in my heart oh how it aches nobody knows the sorrow it takes
I should have known right from the start
That you'd leave me with these blues in my heart
Gone is the love I couldn't hold I feel like a lamb that's straight from the fold
What can I say what can I do blues in my heart has got me this way

Rain falling down down from the sky even the sun's beginning to cry
Everything's wrong since we're apart I wish I could lose these blues in my heart
I wish I could lose these blues in my heart",Blues in My Heart,1971
Kenny Price,"Midnight I've spent another lonely day thinkin' of you
Midnight tomorrow is on its way empty and blue
I'm so lonely so lonely at midnight for you
Midnight oh what a lonely time to weep I ought to know
Midnight I should have been fast asleep hours ago
Still I'm crying I'm crying cause I miss you so

Midnight I lie in bed awake and stare at nothing at all
Wondering I'm wondering why you don't care wishing you'd call
Tears keep flowing like drops from a waterfall",Midnight,1971
Kenny Price,"When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup o'er hills and meadows we'd roamed
Just a boy and his dog we were both full of fun we grew up together that way
I remember the time at the old swimming hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
Shep was right there to the rescue he came he jumped in and helped pull me out
The years rolled along and at last he grew old his eye sight was fast growing dim
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said I can't do no more for him Jim
With a hand that was trembling I picked up my gun I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it I wanted to run and I wished they'd shot me instead
I went to his side and I sat on the ground he laid his head on my knees
I stroke the best pal that a man ever found I cried so I scaresly could see
Old Shepy he knew he was going to go for he reached out and nipped at my hand
He looked up at me just as much as to say we're parting but you'll understand
Now old Shep is gone where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know old Shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep,1971
Kenny Price,"Steal away, steal away, steal away to Jesus.
Steal away, steal away home.
I ain't got long to stay here.
I was walkin' in Savannah past a church decayed and dim
And there slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn.
A sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew
Till I found myself environed in a little Negro pew.
Down front sat a young couple nearly wild.
On the altar was a coffin, in the coffin was a child.
Rose a sad old Negro preacher at a little wooden desk
With a manner grandly awkward and a countenance grotesque.
And he said ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay,
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away
And he's doin' very finely and he appreciates your love
But his sure nuff Father want him in the large house above
Now He didn't give you that baby for a hundred thousand miles.
He just think you need some sunshine and He lent him for awhile
And He let you love and keep him 'till your hearts were bigger grown
And those silver tears you're sheddin' are just interest on the loan.
So my poor dejected mourners let your hearts with Jesus rest
And don't go criticizin' the one that knows the best.
He gave us many comforts, He has the right to take away.
To the Lord be praise and glory, now and ever let us pray.
My Lord calls me, He calls me by the thunder. The trumpet sounds
Within my soul.
I ain't got long to stay here. I'm gonna steal away home.",Steal Away,1971
Kenny Price,"Gonna get out my sycamore and shine up my shoes meet my baby and tell her the news
I bet my bundle on a swayback nag and I came home winner with a plenty o'swag
One foot two foot slew foot drag swing your honey to the Sugarfoot Rag
Dig a little jig with a zig and a zag and listen to the guitar play the Sugarfoot Rag

Kenny Price,"Listen while I tell you bout a place I know down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
The moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there all right but they all go native on Saturday night

Well the music is a fiddle and a crack guitar they give the kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods're full of couples lookin' for romance
They struggle and they shuffle till the broad daylight
And they all go native on Saturday night

When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fella packs a gun
Everybody does his best to act just right
Cause it's gonna be a funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till the broad daylight
Then they all go native on Saturday night

Now you've heard my story bout a place I know
Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows

Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there all right but they all go native on Saturday night",Tennessee Saturday Night,1971
Kenny Price,"A rope close line holds these ragged Levi's to my hips
A boxcar keeps the cold away from cracked and bleeding lips
The different blast of a diesel horn drowns up the sound of pain
But nothing stops the inward hurt that's locked inside my brain
Destination anywhere this train's a goin' estimated time of arrival I don't care
Departure from the world of insecurity and a oneway ticket to get away from her

Out of failure be a man's ambition anyway
Striving for the future just existing day to day
I can't escape the truth inside this boxcar of the shell
But at least I'm not reminded of the time I spent in hell
Destination anywhere
Oh a one way ticket to get away from here",Destination Anywhere,1971
Kenny Price,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world
Will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That we're burning

Lay your head,
Upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft, against the window
And make believe you love me,
One more time,
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find,
You ever need me
Don't say a word 
About tomorrow, or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head
Upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times",For the Good Times,1971
Kenny Price,"The first time I kissed her she cried and said I bet I'll still love you after I die
When we were married she cried then too
And I could hardly hear through all her tears when she said I do
When she first held our baby she cried
And insisted he be named after me for he had my eyes

But to some people's life autumn comes early and God will let a favorite flower die
And I miss her so but Lord she's happy I know
For just before she left she said I'll miss you then she cried",She Cried,1971
Kenny Price,"It's a big job just gettin' by with nine kids and a wife
But I've been a workin' man dang near all of my life
And I'll keep on workin' long as these two hands're fit to use

Kenny Price,"Alice it's a wonder that you haven't been called under
By the swift and angry current of the times
Alice it's surprising you're so warm and sympathizing
When so many girls are faultless and unkind
You share all my problems and you try to help me solve them
When I'm down and out you always stand by me
Alice it's assuring knowing nothing world's maturing in the makeup of your personality
Which gives me cause to believe you're my Alice in Wonderland
The touch of a soothing hand the key to a perfect plan
And furthermore I believe you're a rose in the world of thorns
The calm in a raging storm my Alice in Wonderland

Alice it's a wonder that your mind has not been plunder
By the cold and bitter willing of the seed
Alice it's surprising you're not always criticizing
Like so many women that I chanced to meet
You make me feel want it and not once have I been taught it
To a point where I desired to be free
Alice it's assuring knowing our love is enduring all the apsticles and dissociaty
Which gives me cause to believe",Alice in Wonderland,1971

The two of us together loving and living she gives me something to believe in
She gives me something to believe in I devote to her all of my being

From here to there must be quite a distance but it's not as far apart as you and I
I stand on the dock in San Francisco and watch the ship as it puts out to sea
From here to there must be quite a distance
Oh but it's not as far apart as you and me
From here to there I can almost touch you
But the wall between us oh it's much too high
An animal that's wounded sometimes is dangerous
But usually it just crawl off somewhere and die
I look down at the water just below me but if I jump then no one would really care

Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky
Once upon a time that little girl was mine
If I'd been true I know she'd never be with you, so
Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Oh take good care of my baby, take good care of my baby
Just take good care of my baby

Kenny Price,"Take me take me to your darkest room close every window and bolt every door
The very first moment I heard your voice I'd be in darkness no more
Take me to your most barren desert a thousand miles from the nearest sea
The very moment I saw your smile that would be like heaven to me
There's not any mountain too rugged to climb no desert too barren to cross
And darling if you would just show a sign of love I could bear it all
Take me to Siberia and to coldest weather of the wintertime
That would be just like spring in California as long as I knew you were mine

If I swear to you on bended knees I won't hurt you again
If I become the kind of man that you want me to be
Would you take another chance on me
The good Lord knows I've done you wrong I've asked him to forgive me
And deep inside I think you would if you could do the same
If I could take back all the things that caused you misery
Would you take another chance on me
Would you take another chance on me I've paid for my mistake
Would you take another chance on me or have I changed too late
I've been a fool to hurting you but can't you see I'm sorry
If only you were mine again I'd make it up to you
But my past keeps blinding you if you could only see
Would you take another chance on me thank of that darling",Would You Take Another Chance on Me,1972

Did you ever watch a child while he was praying

Did you ever watch the sun desert the sky
Did you ever hold a woman while she's sleeping
Just don't let the good life pass you by
Man was made for loving not for buying go can't give you things we really need
Just look my friend there's happiness in living
Somewhere between broke and being free

Did you ever take the time to help your neighbor

Kenny Price,"Some people don't know exactly where to go in
And they'll take the path that's easiest for the load
The quickest way to get there with the most is
They'll take the front of a bus the back of the church
And then they'll take the middle of the road
Some people fight to get in front of one another
And they don't care if they step on someone's toes
When they arrive they have the first selection
And it's the front of the bus the back of the church
And then they'll take the middle of the road
The front of the bus is always crowded the back of the church is always filled
And if you take the middle of the road today you can always say I told you so
The easy way don't always come so easy
And don't take from the harvest if you can't sow
And if your last at everything in life there's still room
At the back of the bus the front of the church
And be the side of the road side of the road",Front of the Bus Back of the Church,1972
Kenny Price,"My pappy said, son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that hot rod Lincoln

Now you've heard the story of the hot-rod race
When the Ford and Lincoln was settin' the pace
That story's true I'm here to say
'Cause I was drivin' that Model-A

Got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model-A body makes it look like a pup
Got eight cylinders'n uses them all
Got overdrive, just won't stall

Got a four-barrel carb and dual exhaust
4-11 gears it can really get lost
Got safety tubes but I'm not scared
The brakes are good, tires fair

Was out on San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shining bright
We were drivin' up on Grapevine hill
Passin' cars like they was standin' still

Now all of a sudden in the wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said boys that's a mark for me
By then, the taillights was all you could see

Well the fellers ribbed me for bein' behind
So I thought I'd make that Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it down into overdrive

Well I wound her up to a hundred and ten
My speedometer said I'd hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor
That's all there is and there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
The telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said slow down I see spots
The lines on the road just looked like dots

Went around a corner and passed a truck
I crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clickin' the guard rail post
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

Well smoke was comin' outta the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him, thought I could pass
Don't ya know by then we'd be low on gas

Went around a corner, side-swiped the side
You could feel the tension man what a ride
I said hold on boys, I got a license to fly
And the Caddy pulled over and let me by

Now all of a sudden the rods started knockin'
And down in the dip she started a'rockin'
I looked in the mirror, red lights was blinkin'
The cops was after my hot rod Lincoln

They arrested me and put me in jail
And I called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said son you're gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that hot rod Lincoln",Hot Rod Lincoln,1972
Kenny Price,"His daddy was a simple man just a red dirt Georgia farmer
And his mama spent her young life havin' kids and bailin' hay
He had fifteen years and an ache inside to wander
So he hopped a freight in Waycross and wound up in LA
Lord the cold nights had no pity on a Waycross Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry and then the summer came
He met a girl known on the Strip as San Francisco's Mabel Joy
Destitution's child born of an LA street called Shame
Growin' up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy
Laughter found the mornings brought meaning to his life
Yes the night before she left sleep came and left that Waycross Georgia boy
With dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife
Sunday morning found him standin' neath the red light at her door
When a right cross sent him reelin' put him face down on the floor
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine
Who groaned your Georgia neck is red but Sonny you're still green
He turned twenty-one in a grey rock Federal prison
The old judge had no mercy for a Waycross Georgia boy
Starin' at those four grey walls in silence he would listen
To that midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy
Sunday morning found him lyin' neath the red light at her door
With a bullet in his side he cried have you seen Mabel Joy
Stunned and shaken someone said why son she don't live here anymore
She left this house four years today and they say she's lookin' for
Some Georgia farm boy",San Francisco Mabel Joy,1972
Kenny Price,"Show me a man who starts each new born day giving his thanks unto God
Show me a man who digs beneath the earth
Mining black gold yard by yard and that's hard
Show me a man who risks his life to say someone that he doesn't know
Show me a man that's hold yet plants a tree a tree that he'll never see grow
Show me a man who is starving yet shares his crust of bread
He is a man who face tragedy and never bow his head

Show me a man who's not afraid to speak what others think but fear to say
Show me a man who finds a cost that's just
That stands his ground come what may come what may
Show me a man who's hard and calloused hands reach down to help a fallen hurt

Kenny Price,"Livin' on whiskey dirt ain't easy Lord when you're little
You might say it's a mighty rough row to hold
Sometimes you think that you won't get no bigger (but I did)
When you planted in whiskey dirt it's hard to grow

The corn we raised on whiskey farm we stored in a jar and a gunny sack
But it kept us eaten when dad couldn't find any work
It was hard to smile when you knew that folks were laughin' out loud behind your back
It's not much plant to do in the whiskey dirt
Livin' on whiskey dirt

We had to survive so we worked all together everybody had his little thing to do
I had to wash and boil 'em Mason jars
Mama did a fillin' and dad did a diggin' we had to keep it hid when we got through
Later on papa did sell 'em in the wagon yard

An angel who could please most any man
She said to me I'm free and you're just my kind

Almost you almost slipped my mind I could taste taste her kisses in the wine
But your memory came and found me just in time
But for a moment you almost slipped my mind

Now I can see how sometimes a man can be so blind

A certain kind of lover 
Who will show me the way

Someone to enfold

You know where love is at
When it's been pointed right at you

I hope that you can see
Just what you're doin' to me

What lives and grows without rain 
What brings a smile that lasts for a little while 
Then makes me cry without shame 
How can you please me then and torture and tease me 
And do it in the name of love 

Don`t you know how to be nice 
You leave me without thinking twice 
You`re warm as an oven when you want a little loving 
Then you`ll go from fire to ice 
How can you please me then torture and tease me 
And do it in the name of love 

I`m a coming I`m a going is it raining or snowing 
I got no way if knowing you`re mine 

You made me rise and fall 
You make me stumble and crawl 
So baby get with it you might as well admit it 
Don`t love your daddy at all 
Just how can you please me then torture and tease me

It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,

I will feel a glow just thinking of you and the way you look tonight
Oh but, you're lovely with your cheeks so soft and your lips so warm
There is nothing for me but to love you, just the way you look tonight

With each word, your tenderness grows, tearing my fears apart
And that laugh, that wrinkles your nose, touches my foolish heart
Lovely, never, never change keep that breathless charm
Won't you please, arrange it 'cause I love you just the way you look tonight

And that rain stops beatin' on my window pane
When the sun comes out
There'll be bluebirds 'round my door, singin' like they
Did before

That ol' storm broke out
And girl ran off and left me in the rain
Though she's gone I doubt
If she'll stay away for good,I'd stop livin' if she
Should

Just when everything looked bright and sunny
Suddenly the cyclone came, I'll never be the same

Til the sun comes out
And the rain stops beatin' on my window pane
If my heart holds out
Let it rain and let it pour, it may not be long before
There's a knockin' at my door
Then you'll know the one I love walked in

Kenny Rankin,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

In pools of fallen rain

There's not a cloud in sight,

And draws them to eternity.

I Wonder Why it is that you are here with me,
I Wonder Why.

I Wonder Why it is the sea's so calm tonight,
The sands are ghostly white
Beneath the moon.
It seems strange to me to stand in endless space,
And know that in this place
I'm held within its timeless sway.

I Wonder Why it is that you are here with me.
I Wonder Why.

The wisdom of the world with all its mystery
Is strangely haunting me on this great shore.
I know no book can teach, but I can feel tonight,
The sky above, the sea below,
And you my love.
Tonight the world is mine, we're on the edge of time.

It's a quiet village
Every day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say

Bonjour bonjour
Bonjour bonjour bonjour

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good morning, Belle
Good morning, monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've, I can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where you off to?

To return this book to Pere Robert, it's about to lovers in fair Verona
Sound boring

Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour, good day
How is your family?
Bonjour, good day
How is your wife?
I need six eggs
That's too expensive!
There must be more than this provincial life!

Ah, If it isn't the only bookworm in town!
So, where did you run off to this week?

Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?

I'm afraid not
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big

Bon voyage

Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!

Look at her, LeFou
My future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That's makes her the best

But she's so well-read
And you're so athletically-inclined

Yes, ever since the war, I felt like I've been missing something
She's the only girl that ever given me that sense of

Mmm je ne sais quoi?

I don't know what that means

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Bonjour, pardon
Good day, mais oui!
You call this bacon, what lovely flowers
Some cheese, ten yards, one pound,  excuse me I'll get the knife
Please let me through!
This bread, those fish, it's stale, they smell!
Madame's mistaken Well, maybe so

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

She doesn't quite fit in

We were young and we knew 
In our eyes were alive 
Deep inside we knew our love was true 
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past 
We knew love would last 
Every night, something right 
Would invite us to begin the day 
Something happened along the way 
What used to be happy was sad

And yesterday was all we had

We would ever need

Kenny Roberts,"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through, God her love is true.

We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,1997
Kenny Rodgers,"Ruben James, in my song you live again
And the phrases that I rhyme
Are just the footsteps out of time
From the time when I knew you Ruben James

Ruben James all the folks around Madison County 
Cussed your name just a no 
Count share croppin' colored man 
Who would steal anything he can 
And they always laid the blame on Ruben James

Ruben James, you still walk furrowed fields on my mind
The faded skirt the weathered brow
The calloused hand up on the plow 
I loved you then and I love you now Ruben James
Flora James, Ruben James

Gray, a gossip of Madison County died with child
And although your skin was black 
It was you that would not turn your back 
On a hungry white child with no name, Ruben James

Ruben James, with your mind on my soul
And the bible in your right hand 
You said turn the other cheek 
A better world is a waiting for the meek 
In my head those words remain from Ruben James

Ruben James one dark cloudy day 
That brought you from the fields
And to your lonely pine box came
Just a preacher, me and the rain 
To sing one last refrain for Ruben James",Reuben James,1997

Our friends have all gone home
You and I are waiting
For Santa Clause to come
There's a present by the tree
Stockings on the wall
And knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all

The fire is slowly fading
Chill is in the air
All the gifts are waiting
For children everywhere
Throught the window I can see
Snow begin to fall
Knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all

Just before I go to sleep
I hear a church bell ring
Merry Christmas everyone
Is the song it sings
So I say a silent prayer
For creatures great and small
Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of all

Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of all",The Greatest Gift of All,2004
Kenny Rodgers,"VERSE 1
On a warm summers evening, on a train bound for nowhere, I met up with a gambler we were both too tired to sleep. So we took turns at staring out the window at the darkness, till boredom over took us and he began to speak, He sais ""Son I've made a life outta reading peoples faces. Knowing what the cards were byt he way they held their eyes. So if you don't mind me sayin I can see your outta aces for ataste of your whisky I'll give you some advice.""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow, then he bombed a cigarette and asked me for a light. And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expresion said If your gonna play the game boy you gotta learn to play it right.

CHORUS:
You gotta know when to hold them,
Know when to fold them,
Know when to walk away, know when to run.
You never count your money when your sitting at the table,
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealings done.

VERSE 2
Every gambler knows that the secret to survival is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
Cause every hands a winner and every hands a loser and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.
And when he finished speaking he turned back towards the window, crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep. 
And somewhere inthe darkness the gambler he broke even. And in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

CHORUS

And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light

And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through, God her love is true.

Some old times, some old friends
Suddenly it came across my mind
That I would like to see you again.

Walk and talk holding hands
We said we loved each other I recall
We made a lot of future plans.

But the years have come and gone
And a whole lot has happened since then
But tonight your memory's awful strong on my mind
And I would like to see you again.

It's funny how an old flame comes down
Come on back, make you blue
But I saw the picture of a railroad track
An old shot of me and you.

I guess I'd better straighten up my mind
Straighten it up and go to bed
I pray that I don't dream about old times
Some old times, gone and dead

But years have come and goneâ?¦.

And understands you, you're not alone
Runaway girl, I won't stop until I found you
And put my arms around you and take you home.

Kenny Rogers,"WE DON'T WE MAKE LOVE ANYMORE
WRITERS KENNY ROGERS, MARIANNE GORDON

The love that we have
Is not so bad
Unless you think about
The love that we had
I don't know, who closed the door
But we don't make love anymore

We used to love
You used to care
Now it's hard to find
The feeling we shared
You found a way
To even the score
And we don't make love anymore

So come lie down
Beside me and talk to me
Touch me with your body and your mind
Help me find the feeling
And push all this behind
We'll make sweet, sweet love one more time

But you won't try
And I'll understand
We'll just live our lives
The best we can
We turn out the lights
We still lock the door
But we don't make love anymore

Kenny Rogers,"Laura, hold these hands and count my fingers
Laura, touch these lips you once desired
Lay your head upon my chest, hear my heartbeat
Gently run your fingers through my hair
Mmm, touch these ears that listened to your wishes
Most of them fulfilled, and that's a lot
Let your soft gentle hands caress my body
And then tell me what he's got that I ain't got
Oh, yes tell me what he's got that I can't give you
Well, it must be something I was born without
You took an awful chance to be with another man
So tell me what he's got that I ain't got
 
Laura, see these walls that I built for you
Laura, see this carpet that I laid
See those fancy curtains on the windows

Then tell me what he's got that I ain't got

Pretending again
I think we both know this is the end
We can try it again
But we better face it
Losing again
I know we both thought this time we'd win
But you can't take thing and just erase it.

Could it be we talked too long
Maybe we should start off being friends
And try it again.
Could it be we both were wrong
Maybe we should sing our song again
And rewrite the end, start it again.

Start it again
Not looking for love, needing a friend
And knowing inside it's gonna be better
Laughing again
And thinking how wrong we were back then
We're happy again and this is forever.

Now we know we both were wrong
Aren't you g lad we sang our song again
To rewrite the end and start it again.
We start love, love, love
Start it again.



",Starting Again,1978
Kenny Rogers,"On a warm summer's eve
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with the gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin'
Out the window at the darkness
The boredom overtook us,
And he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind me sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his faced lost all expression
He said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right

You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done

Every gambler knows
That the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner
And every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die
in your sleep

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette
And faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler he broke even
But in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep

You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done

You've got to know when to hold 'em (when to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (when to fold 'em)

At least I had you every now and then
And in between the sorrow
At least there was tomorrow
And as long as there's tomorrow
There's no end
Oh, I wish that I could hurt that way again.

Oh, I wish that we could play that game again
Even though I'd always lose and you would win
At times you would desert me
The emptiness would hurt me
But your coming back
Was always worth the pain
Oh, I wish that I could hurt that way again.

You don't need me anymore

He drifted a while
With no purpose or direction to his life
He tried to get himself together
And pacify his mind
And forget about the things he left behind

The cryin' woman
Standing helpless in his door
With a two month old baby-why in her arms
His little black book 
Laying torn up on the floor
And God only knows he never meant to do her wrong

A careless weekend on the other side of town
Has torn the King of Oak Street's Castle down
And all week long he's tried to ca-all her
But she won't let him explain
Now Sunday morning finds him walking i-in the rain

He sits down in a phone booth and he prays
That she'll forgive him 
And she'll believe he's changed his ways
With shaking hand 
He deposits hi-is last dime
And he's still praying that she won't hang you-up this time

Then the sweetest voice he's ever heard says hello
Breakfast's a-almost ready baby-why, come on home
I've thought the whole thing over 
And I think I understand
That the King of Oak Street is just an ordinary man

His mama lived her short life having kids and baling hay
He had fifteen years, an ache inside to wander
He hopped a freight in Waycross, wound up in L.A.

Lord, the cold nights had no pity on a Waycross Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry, then the summer came
He met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Mabel Joy
Destitutions child born of an L.A. street called shame

Growing up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy
Laughter found their mornings, brought a meaning to his life
Yes, the night before she left, sleep came and left that Waycross
Country boy with dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife

Sunday morning found him standing 'neath the red light of her door
When a right cross sent him reeling, put him face down on the floor
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine
He growled that Georgia neck is red, but sonny your still green

He turned twenty-one in a gray rock federal prison
The old judge had no mercy for a Waycross Georgia boy
Starin' at those four gray, in silence he would listen
That midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy

Sunday morning found him lyin' 'neath the red light of her door
With a bullet in his side he cried have you seen Mabel Joy

Kenny Rogers,"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says ""how was your night?""
And I come to her and say, ""it was all right,"" and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday, if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows, maybe, on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God, her love is true

Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door, and saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace, and took down his daddy's picture
As the tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again

He wasn't holding nothin' back, he let 'em have it all

For a piece of your time
There's been so many days

In the dark of this room
Where the burning has grown
You believe in your love
When you're lost and alone

And life don't give no reasons
When the love goes away
No answers for someone like you

Hold me, hold me
Seems like we never get together anymore
Hold me, hold me
Starry nights don't come enough
That's what we come here for, hold me

I will lay by your side
I can warm your cold nights
You can play in my dreams
'Till I'm out of your sight in the morning, my love

Couldn't change where you go
You were always my woman
It's the one truth I know
So hold out when there's no chance
For your love anyway
No diamond could shine close to you

Kenny Rogers,"She's got dinner on the table at seven
The kids are tucked in bed by nine-fifteen
And she's headed for a hotel at eleven
To meet a man her family's never seen.

As the elevator takes her to her lover
She thinks about his wife at home asleep
And she knows it must be painful to discover
That the man you love's not always yours to keep.

Well, she's one man's bride
And she's one man's on the side
She wonders why it takes two men
To keep her satisfied.

She's a hard workin' house-wife
Right now she's occupied
She's one man's woman
And one man's on the side
Yes, she's one man's woman
And one man's on the side.

She thinks about her husband when it's over
But she justifies her love affair somehow
She knows it can't go on like this forever
But she takes it all from day to day for now.

Once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen, changin' moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music

And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face

And you decorated my life
Created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

Like a rhyme with no reason
In an unfinished song
There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me until you came along
And you brought out the colors
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be, shinin' soft in your eyes

Kenny Rogers,"In Cumberland Kentucky
On a cool autumn evening
Billy lay in love with Marianne
She was a rich judge's daughter
He was the son of a miner
But that night their love was more than they could stand
The judge said to his daughter
“That son of that coal miner
Is someone you'd do well to leave alone”
She knew her dad so well
She knew she couldn't tell
But the truth was bound to show before too long
Their love had started growing on its own

You can't outrun the long arm of the law
No, you can't outrun the long arm of the law

Billy placed his hand on Mary
And he felt the baby moving
Kissed her, and said ""I'll see you when I can""
The judge had made a promise
When he caught up with Billy
He'd send him far away from Marianne
The whole town knew he'd do it
Too many times he'd proved it
To at least a hundred men behind the wall
He'd smile behind that frown
And when he brought that gavel down
He called himself the long arm of the law
And he'd set his mind on seeing Billy fall

In a hot and humid mine shack
The midwife pulled the sheet back
And placed a cool, damp towel on Marianne
Billy's eyes were wide with wonder
From the spell he was under
When she placed the newborn baby in his hands
He didn't hear the siren
Just the baby crying
That miracle of love was all he saw
When the door came crashing down
And Billy turned around
He felt the heart and soul inside him fall
He stood face-to-face with the long arm of the law

You can't outrun the long arm of the law
No, you can't outrun the long arm of the law
You can hide out for a while
He says with a smile
But you can't outrun the long arm of the law

Seemed like everybody down in Cumberland, Kentucky
Came out that day to see poor Billy's trial
The court was called to order
There sat the judge's daughter
She looked so proud, holding Billy's child
When they brought Billy to him
The judge just looked right through him
As he held that Holy Bible in his hand
Then he smiled at his grandson
And his eyes cut back to Billy
He said ""I think this time the law will understand
Son, I sentence you to life with Marianne""

You can't outrun the long arm of the law
No, you can't outrun the long arm of the law
He said to Billy with a smile
I know you hid out for a while
But you can't outrun the long arm of the law
No, you can't outrun the long arm of the law",Long Arm of the Law,1980

And the phrases that I rhyme
Are just the footsteps out of time
From the time when I knew you, Reuben James

All the folks around Madison County cussed your name
You`re just a no-account, sharecropping colored man
Who would steal anything he can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James

The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

The gossip of Madison County died with child
And although your skin was black
You were the one that didn`t turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name, Reuben James

With your mind on my soul and a Bible in your right hand
You said ""turn the other cheek
A-there`s a better world a-waiting for the meek""

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed field of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Until your lonely pinebox came
Just a preacher and me in the rain
Just to sing one last refrain for Reuben James

The calloused hands upon the plow

Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

As we go along,

We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

As we dream by the fire

Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

And friends are calling ""You Hoo""

Kenny Rogers,"You wanna know if I care for you
You ought to know by now
How can you stand there just pretending
And you know how I feel.

Â'cause baby youÂ're my love
And I love everything you do to me
YouÂ're my love
And I love when youÂ're around
YouÂ're my love
And IÂ've never let you down.

You wanna know what I see you
I can really say it for sure
All I know is I need you
More than IÂ've ever needed
Anyone else before.

Â'cause baby youÂ're my love ....

seasons changing faster than they do
And we be gone
ItÂ's funny but we didnÂ't seem to care
The only thing we cared about
Was keeping you out, our strong
As long as youÂ're there
IÂ'll always care.

Kenny Rogers,"Desperado, why don't you come to your senses,
You've been out ridin' fences for so long now,
Oh and you're a hard one, but I know that you've got your reasons,
The things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow.

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy, she'll beat you if she's able.
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table,
But you only want the ones you can't get.

Desperado, you ain't gettin' no younger,
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home,
And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin'.
Your prison is walking through this world all alone.

Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime,
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine,
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day.
And you're losin' all your highs and lows,
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses,
Come down from your fences- open the gates.
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you.
You'd better let somebody love you,
Let somebody love you. 
You'd better let somebody love you,
Before it's too late.",Desperado,1987
Kenny Rogers,"I don't need you.

I don't peace and harmony.
I don't need you.
And you surely don't need me.

[Chorus]
But we both want it bad enough.
Yes, we both want it.  Don't we?
I don't need you baby.
And I know you don't need me.

I don't need your loving arms around me.
All I need is to be free.
That's what I keep telling myself.
And I tell you, you don't need me.

I don't need children in my old age.
No more cluttered leaves around the tree.
And I don't need you baby.

You have made me what I am and I am yours
My love, there's so many ways I want to say ""I love you""
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

You have gone and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh, we belong together
Won't you believe in my song?

Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life and made me whole
Forever, let me wake to see you each and every morning

Kenny Rogers,"Girl, we've come a long, long way
Too far for us to end this way
Sometimes the cost of love is hard
And we must pay this little give-and-take

So don't you think if you and I
Were just about and let our hearts decide
Maybe it would all work out in time
So won't you stay, please don't go away.

Love, love is what we make it
We can make it so much better if we try
Love, love is what we make it
So let?s make it real good this time.

Is it too late to change your mind?
Or has it gone to fall this time
Won't you hold me just one more time

Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more.

From the waters lifted me.

Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
Love lifted me.

Then just get out of my way
Show me the jukebox, I'll tell you a song you should play
Sooner a later a few shots of bourbon
And I'll think of somethin to say
Whoa, I can take her or leave her
But I like to take her away

Liquor and music, a good combination
If you've got love on the brain
I never knew two women who acted the same
Some want a drink first
And some want to just sit and talk

Kenny Rogers,"In a bar in Toledo across from the depot
On a barstool, she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her she said ""I'm no quitter
But I finally quit livin' on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings""
In the mirror, I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking, his big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""

After he left us, I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the barroom
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her 'cause the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""",Lucille,1987
Kenny Rogers,"Sing a song sweet music man 'cause I won't be there
To hold your hand like I used to, I'm through with you
You're a heck of a singer and powerful man but you surround yourself
With people who demand so little of you

You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singin' along right with you, you said
""I need you"", then you changed the words and added harmony
Then you sang the song you had written for me to someone new

Oh, but nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel things are right
When I know they're wrong, nobody sings a love song quite like you

Sing your song sweet music man, travel the world
With a six piece band that does for you what you tell 'em to
And you try to stay young but the songs are sung
To so many people who've all begun came back on you

Sing your song sad music man, makin' your living
Doing one night stands, they're through with you
They don't need you, you're still a heck of a singer but a broken man
But you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to

Oh, and nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along and nobody else
Can make me feel things are right when they're wrong with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you

Sing your song sweet music man, I believe in you

Kenny Rogers,"It was six in the morning
When I made the county line
There's someone I got to talk to
I can't get it off my mind

He's just a kid
And he's in a pretty rough spot
Two dimes to make a phone call
That's about all I've got

How's my boy today?
I know it's been three weeks
But you know how far I've got to go
To make those loose ends meet

How's your mama now
With her new live-in friend
Oh how I hate the wounds 
That never seem to mend

[Chorus:]
And he says I don't call him daddy
but he takes care of things
When you pick me up on Friday
Are you gonna bring me anything?
Oh don't worry dad ya know 
It don't matter what we do 
I don't call him daddy 
He could never be like you
Never be like you

God bless their little hearts
They're the ones who really pay
When mom and dad can't get along
And go their seperate ways
In a way I'm glad there's someone
There to fill the empty place
Tears of understanding
Streak down a dirty face

[Chorus]

He is quite a little man 
Growing up as fast as he can
And I don't get to see him
Half as much as I had planned 
There's so much I need to tell him
So precious little time
A little rain on the window
In a little way goodbye

 Said to me I'd love to be with you
 I'm not tempted for a moment
 I just think about my woman

 Telling me I need to hurrily home
 Well the hurrying is easy
 Because she's waiting up
 With all the love I need

 I prefer the moonlight
 The one right little lady by my side
 That's what I like
 I prefer a late drive down the turn park
 With the moonlight shining so brightly
 Got her by my side
 That's what I'd like
 I prefer the moonlight

 I prefer playing quiet song
 She's a mother love her daughter
 Moonlight dances on the water
 The moon is full and so am I
 I look at her and feel like I could cry
 But my tears contain no sorrow
 Because I know
 She'll wake up by my side tomorrow

 Where the moon is surely shining bright

I met up with the gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Till boredom overtook us, and he began to speak

He said, ""son, I've made my life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey, I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression
Said, ""if you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done

Now ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep""

So when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down

I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine

Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

To the California sun

Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene

To avoid life's mud and stone? 
Did you ever kick a good man 
When he was down, just to make yourself feel strong? 
Tell it all brother, before we fall 
Tell it all brothers and sisters 
Tell it ah-ah-aal 
Tomorrow just might be too late 
Now is the time 
To get your jumbled mind straight 
And seek a new design 
Did you ever walk for a crippled man 
Pretending you were lame? 
And what made you think one feeble hand to God 
Was gonna make him call your name?

Kenny Rogers,"When the morning sun streaks across my room
And I've waken up from another dream of you
Yes I'm on the road, once again it seems
All I've left behind, is a chain of broken dream

But you know I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you

How I wish that love, is all we need to live
What a life we'd live, 'cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong, deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign could be keeping us apart
When you know I love
Yes I love you

And if I could only find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life of mine didn't cross our minds
All the answers were found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you, I'd come running back to you

But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Just to pay the rent, I must leave you all alone
But you know I made me choice many years ago
And this traveling life is the only one I know

But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you
But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you

But you know, I love you

Kenny Rogers,"Ain't funny how time
Steals the feeling from a love affair
And there's no place to lay the blame
'cos in any case, oh, no one cares
Helplessly we just watched it fade away
Neither will admit it
Are we both aching to say.

We, you, I miss the days when we were crazy in love
When you were so sure of me, I had my little jealousy.
We, you, bring back the days when we were crazy in love
I wanna feel that way again, remember when we were crazy in love.

I know it used to be so easy
One touch and I was high
And I could get intoxicated
Just by looking in your eyes
Oh, baby ain't there anything we can do
Cos I know you're missing me
As much as I've been missing you.

We, you, 

Girl, we were more than best of friends
We were crazy in love.",Crazy in Love,1990
Kenny Rogers,"If I were a painting
Captured on canvas
Alone in the portriat I would stand
And brush strokes bold
Yet soft as a whisper
The work of a feminine hand

Caught in a still life
Surrounded by shadows
And lost in a background of blue

If I were a painting
My price would be pain
And the artist would have to be you

I imagine the colors
Would all run together
If you ever allowed me to cry
So don't paint the tears
Just let me remember me
Without you in my LIFE

It's only the frame
That holds me together
Or else I would be falling apart

If I were a painting
I wouldn't feel
And you wouldn't be breaking my heart",If I Were a Painting,1990

You warm to what feels cold in me
And healing to what hurts.

I'm driven as I am
Is there something that I have
That makes you give a damn.

Be my comfort when the world
Waves me to the ground
Take me when I've lost my way
Let me know I'm found.

Be a blanket to my soul
Wrap it all around
Be a feather babe to me
And lay my body down.

Touch me with your finger tips
Give my burdens rest
Tell me not to worry so
I know that you know best.

Outside my ride is layin' on the horn,

I've been saving for this rainy day,
What do you say we stay at home,
And make love all day long,

And let's just listen to the rain fall,
Music on the window pane, that's all;
Nothing ventured, nothing gained,
Just crawl back in bed,
Pull the covers overhead,

Let's just listen to the rain

Life moves fast,
Let's find a way to make the moments last,
Forget the future, and forget the past,

Let's just listen to the rain fall, 
Music on the window pane, that?s all,
Nothing ventured, nothing gained;
Just crawl back in bed; pull the covers overhead
Me and you,
Like John and Yoko use to do

Let it pour, we'll hold each other let the thunder roar,
Love is never felt like this before,
And I need more of you

I say you'd better come here love girl

Who care about the faith of love

What love needs is a defender
I am a soldier of love.

They say love will win in the end
Hold him close and surely he'll be
What if its heartaches break you again
Walk away, baby, walk away.

It takes more than just one to provide
Why forgive him just to keep it alive
'cause when its hurts are done, cry out this time
Just walk away, baby, walk away.

Think of me once in a while
I held this old dream, you see
And there's a path that leads to my door
And a home for a refugee.
Don't feel guilty for foolish desires
It ain't easy to drown a fierce fire
Cry will lead you to something much higher
Walk away, baby, walk away.

And darling, please, forget me not
Bring out your tears to me
'cause through the years I never spoke out
And finally I'm begging, please.

If he cries out, love me once more
Just turn around, go on and open the door
Save your dream, score the one you adore
And walk away, baby, walk away.

Walk away, baby, walk away
Just walk away, baby, walk away.



",Walk Away,1990
Kenny Rogers,"Everybody's heart is torn and tattered
Mine was not designed for giving up
'Cause all I've ever done that really matters
It's what I did for love.

So count me with the wound and the shaking
Even when I'm barely standing up
I've tried to offer more than I have taken
It's what I did for love.

What I did for love, what I did for love
And I hope that you can see
All that love they've done for me

And when they sit and list the reasons I've existed
I'm afraid it won't add up to very much
'Cause I've gathered all I had and gladly rested
That's what I did for love.

What I did for love,?

Some day I'll make silently surrender
This old heart has finally had enough
But I hope that I will always be remembered
For what I did for love.",What I Did for Love,1990

With the strength to be gentle
And the courage to be kind

Though it hasn't all been roses
Still I know you understand
One of these nights
When we're sharing a dream

I'm gonna take you by the hand
And lay you down on a bed of roses
In that peaceful shelter
Only love can provide
I'll lay you down on a bed of roses
And then I'll lay me down, right by your side

There's no diamond on your finger
Just a simple wedding band
Since your knight in shining armor
Is just an ordinary man

And pretend you're in my arms
And if I can't keep on crying out your name
My heart would think you're here beside me
And things are still the same.
My mind knows it's over
But how do I break it to my heart
If I let it down easy
It'd still be torn apart
And if I tell it the truth
Then the pain is gonna start

But how do I break it to my heart.

A picture from a cheating song
She'd been standing by the jukebox
Dropping quarters all night long.

He said, tell me: are you lonely?
Is there some place we can go?
She said: cowboy, you know I'm lonely
But there's something you should know:

If you wanna find gold
Go looking in the mountains
If you wanna find silver
Go digging in stones
If you wanna find heaven
Go reading in the Bible
If you wanna find love
Go looking at home.

She touched the gold ring on his finger
And held it to the jukebox light
And she said. Stranger, think what you're losing
If you leave here with me tonight.

So he hold her body closer

And he said: thank you, for the lesson
And if you need me I'll be at home.

Your memory won't let me go at all
I found no way out since you've been gone

I must replace, racing through the people chase

Not up in the mountains or down by the shore
Something shine in the fashion in the smile that you wore
They just don't make 'em like you anymore

In the eyes of someone new I wait for a glimpse of you
But it's never there, one among the precious few
Your kind of person is becoming so rare

They just don't make 'em like you anymore
Like those white lace dresses at the second hand store
Or sweet old songs filtering out through the floor
They just don't make 'em like you anymore

And the gossip magazines and the videos
A brand new actress on a screen
In a brand new style of clothes
But by any other name a rose is still a rose

And it grows in my memories
Wonder if you still are the same while I look for a remedy
Someone with a tender heart to clean your name

I can't help it long for how it used to be

A restless wind that yearns to wander
And I was born the next of kin

And I guess the sound of the outward bound
Made me a slave to my wandering ways

And I was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

And although you may think it's crazy
Here is where I want to be

There is one thing that I realize
That there's no doubt in my mind
We can make this love go on forever

It's gonna take more then wakin' to rise me
I wake up with this need again

When I wanna lay here with her
And love her before I leave
And listen to the rain fall on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

Oh, I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wanna wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire
With morning desire

It looks like I'm gonna be late again
And I gonna give up and get movin' and I'm tryin'
But the longer I keep stalling
The more I think about callin' in and lying

It's just one of those days
When I wanna stay here with her
And watch her while she sleeps
And listen to the rain fall on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

Oh, I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wanna wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire
With morning desire

Well, I love to hear the rain fallin' on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

Oh, I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wanna wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire
With morning desire, with morning desire

Kenny Rogers,"One time I drove to see a girl across the country
One night as I was driving through to Mexico
I had the windows wide open
It was cold and I was crying
And I later laid her on the radio
Then I stopped that side of Tahoe
Through this tiny mining town
At a diner to be filled for the ride
And in the wind I heard this crying
Like a heart broke cried a tune
I turned my collar up and went inside.
Well, I saw this smiling waitress
Joshing friendly with these truckers
That give her pats and she gives them shoves
I said: Miss watch that awful crying
Everybody laughed and said:
It's the tomb of the unknown love
And then they pointed out the window to this stone
All by myself, beneath the tree, beside the hill
And on that winter night
I read these words alone
These words that are haunting me still, it said:
He lies a young man struck down in his prime
By the awesome burning power of love
He couldn't stand this true love cheating
So he shot the girl down
They hung him from that tree up ( right ) above
I know that local folks say it's the wind
But I know it's crying from the tomb of the unknown love.
So I drove on to my destination
I did the job my heart commanded of me
And when the sheriff sirens came up
I did believe and tried to find
They counted ten, I came out at three
So now I guess tomorrow morning
Warden reads some kind of paper
How I'm gonna pay the state for what I've done
Hey, didn't they put their shackles on me
And they'll take a little walk
They won't have to drag me 'cause it's said and done
And maybe someday they can put me at this stone
All by itself, beneath the tree, beside the hill
And lovers everywhere can come and meet alone
These words that forgive them up to, and it'll say:
He lies a young man.",Tomb of the Unknown Love,1997
Kenny Rogers,"It's been a long time since I walked
Through this old town
But oh how the memories start to flow
And there's the old movie house
They finally closed it down
You could find me there every Friday night
Twenty years ago.

I worked the counter at the drugstore down the street
But nobody's left there I would know
On Saturday mornings that's where
All my friends would meet
You'd be surprised to know what a dime would buy
Twenty years ago.

[Chorus]
All my memories from those days come gather round me
What I'd give if they could take me back in time
It almost seems like yesterday
Where do the good times go?
Life was so much easier twenty years ago.

But he joined the army back in 1964

Kenny Rogers,"When a man loves a woman
He can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'll trade the world
For the good thing he's found

If she is bad he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he put her down

When a man loves a woman, spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comfort, sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way it ought to be

Well, this man loves a woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your precious love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman, down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool, he's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman, he can do no wrong
He can never hold some other girl
Yes when a man loves a woman, I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're my world

A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Kenny Rogers,"Stranger I know where you'll find her
Down the road from here about a mile and a quarter.
You'll know the place by a shackey barn
That stands in the field by a run-down farm
By a pond, filled up with stagnant water.

Then you'll see a shack nearby, you'll ask yourself
I wonder why it looks so cold, and lifeless all around.
Chimney rocks are fallin' out,it looks as though
The fire's gone out and the biggest part
Of the house is rotted down.

Though Stranger, I ain't seen her lately.
She don't come around here like she used to.
You've got her pictured in your mind,
Pretty, gentle, sweet and kind,
You've practiced every word you're gonna say.

You'll call her name, but she won't hear you,
She's in the graveyard near you.
She died ten years ago, last May.

There was a man she talked about,
A man she had to live without.
Years ago, he just turned and left one day.
He left her with an unborn child,
And a love for him that never died,
And an aching heart,
That sent her to an early grave.

Yes, Stranger I know who you are,
I recognized you from afar,
But you ain't never seen me,
Not one time.
Yes, I know that you're my dad,
From pictures that my Momma had.
And it was me and Momma that you left behind.

Stranger, you will find her there,
In a peaceful sleep on yonder hill.
Where we once walked, as I do still...
To pick her flowers from the field.

Momma don't need you anymore,
And I don't need you like before,
You can go on back to where you went before...
You're just a stranger.

Kenny Rogers,"He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
A three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he hold inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is a story of  you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
Opened the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
Cause I'm gonna make things right
I'm gonna hold you tonight
Do all those little things
For the rest of your life.",Buy Me a Rose,1999

Stands in the field with his ball and bat
Says I am the greatest player of them all
Puts his bat on his shoulder and he tosses up his ball

And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The world's so still you can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

Now the little boy doesn't say a word
Picks up his ball, he is undeterred
Says I am the greatest there has ever been
And he grits his teeth and he tries it again

And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The world's so still you can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

He makes no excuses, He shows no fears
He just closes his eyes and listens to the cheers

Little boy, in a baseball hat
Picks up his ball, stares at his bat
Says I am the greatest the game is on the line
And he gives his all one last time

And the ball goes up like the moon so bright
Swings his bat with all his might
And the world's so still as still can be
And the baseball falls, and that's strike three

Now it's supper time and his mama calls
Little boy starts home with his bat and ball

But even I didn't know I could pitch that good.",The Greatest,1999

Kenny Rogers,"No one seemed to notice the man beside the road
He was just a ragged soldier out there in the cold
But he seemed to have a purpose only known to him
As he walked along the streets that night through the town of Bethlehem.

In his head he held a memory of all the wars he'd known
In his hand he clutched a medal for the bravery he'd shown
And the weight of every battle he carried in his heart
But his eyes were clear and searching for a manger in the dark.

[Chorus]
Some are born to greatness, some are born to fall
Some are bound to be forgotten like they never lived at all
But we're all born to know Him and stand before His light
Like the soldier who found his king tonight.

He had marched for politicians, served under their command
And he fought for all the causes that he did not understand
But it was something deep inside him now that led him on his way
With a single star to guide him to were the baby lay.

[Chorus]

He stood before the Son of God, come to pay our debt
He smiled up at the soldier that the world would soon forget
So he held out his medal and said this for you I bring
There he swore allegiance to the newborn baby King.

The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going down,
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town.

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war,
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore,
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be,
Oh Ruby, I still need some company.

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed,
And the wants and needs of a woman your age really I realize,
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around,
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town.

She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door,
The way I know I heard its slams one hundred times before,
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground,

Melt my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together.

I'm so lost in your love
And oh, we belong together
Won't you believe in my song?

Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life and made me whole
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

In my eyes I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me

Kenny Rogers,"In a bar in Toledo across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her
She said I'm no quitter but I finally quit livin on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings
In the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there be-side me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking his big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille.
After he left us I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her 'cos the words that told her
Kept coming back time after time
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille.",Stardust,2002

Out the window there's a lonesome highway callin' me
It was fun Marie - I gotta run Marie
If I cannot keep your love
At least I'll have your memory

Wakin' up beside you in the Tijuana mornin'
With that ocean breeze to keep us cool

I stayed just long enough to be your fool

Till you moved with your pen changin' moods now and then
till the balance was right
Then you added some music, ev'ry note was in place.
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face
 
And you decorated my life, created a world Where dreams are a part.
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart,
You decorated my life
 
Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song,
There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me
until you came along
And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise,
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be

And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart,

Something made my car go a different way
Before I knew it
I was back in time at our old address

Sitting in the drive
And I could see you in my football jersey raking leaves
I could see me hanging lights on our first Christmas tree
I could see us nail those numbers on the door that afternoon

At 727 East Magnolia Avenue
They added on where we thought we would
You always said it would sure look good
They cut down that tree we were afraid would fall

Looks like they picked up right where we left off
I could see you out there on the deck soaking up the sun
I could see me chasing you around with a water gun
I could see us there together

Seemed the sky was always blue

Back to the arms where my heart first fell,

And that was one less problem in South Carolina tonight
Wrong or right

She just looked to me as she finished her tale
The blank expression went another pale shade of gray
There was nothing to say

In the shadows of her face I saw the scars
That you get when you live where love is hard
And she said

Don`t you sit and judge me from some high and mighty seat
Don`t you shrug it off until you've walked a mile in my bare feet
There are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play

Well, I put the cuffs on her and sat her in the car
Walked inside, he was layin' on the floor stone dead
Been shot in the head

There were whiskey bottles and dope by the chair
A starving baby with nothing to wear but tears
So the picture was clear

He had finally pushed her way across the line
And the badge I wore was losing all its shine
And she said

Don`t you sit and judge me from some high and mighty seat
Don`t you shrug it off until you've walked a mile in my bare feet
There are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play

I just stood there thinkin' how justice is blind
But after thirty five years you learn to read the signs
So I made up my mind

I took the cuffs of her and I walked her back in
Wiped the gun off and wrapped it in his right hand
Where it should've been

And the morning paper read in black and white
It`s just another senseless case of suicide

The sound of my own breaking heart, 
I can't pretend that my world isn't falling apart.

And I don't wanna go through love like this, 
'Cause I won't ever know what I might have missed.
I wanna burn with desire, 
I want to feel the fire when we kiss, 
But I don't wanna go through love like this.

I still remember the taste of your skin, 
The sound of you saying my name, 
The way that it felt as we laid in the sand, 
And passion came crashing like waves.
The wind of your laughter, the longing, 
The love lead us to lacking inside
There must be some way for lovers to turn the trash.

'Cause I don't wanna go

Like strangers living like two people 
Who'd never known what is like to be loved.

But when Adam saw Eve in the garden, 
I believe he felt the selfsame way.

I said: ""I know, it ain't much it needs a woman's touch, 
Perhaps she turned around and looked at me.""

His mother gives him life then dies, 
But no one even by them to be sad.

Kenny Rogers,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me & Bobby McGee,2003
Kenny Rogers,"You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating, going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall, tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started that crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that, I'm not the man I used to be
Oh, Ruby I still need some company

It's hard to love a man, whose legs are bent and paralyzed
That my wants and needs of a woman of your age
Ruby, I realized
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

She's leaving now 'cause I just heard the slamming of the door

Kenny Rogers,"The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
And down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home

Yes, they've all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home

The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I'd walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home

Yes, they've all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me at the gray walls that surround me
And I realized that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green green grass of home",Green Green Grass of Home,2003
Kenny Rogers,"There you go again
You take my breath away
The way you looked just then
Moves me more than words can say
Just about the time I think
I couldn't love you anymore
Well then
There you go again

You're still amazing me
I shouldn't be surprised
You'd think I'd know by now
But you get me every time
The love you give, your tender kisses
Take me places I have never been and
There you go again

There you go
How'd you know
Sometimes it's like you almost read my mind
Just when I need you most
There you go again

You know it's hard for me
To tell you how I feel
I want you in my life
And I always will
?Cause no one else can touch you 
When it comes to loving me
The way you can, and then

Ruben James all the folks around Madison County
Cussed your name just a no
Count share croppin colored man
Who would steal anything he can
And they always laid the blame on Ruben James

Ruben James, you still walk furrowed fields on my mind
The faded skirt the weathered brow
The calloused hand up on the plow
I loved you then and I love you now Ruben James
Flora James, Ruben James

Gray, a gossip of Madison County died with child
And although your skin was black
It was you that would not turn your back
On a hungry white child with no name, Ruben James

Ruben James, with your mind on my soul
And the bible in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek
A better world is a waiting for the meek
In my head those words remain from Ruben James

That brought you from the fields
And to your lonely pine box came
Just a preacher, me and the rain

The geographic center of the lower 48.

We were riding these plains before the pony express.

There`s a sycamore tree all splintered and brown.
Well, it used to touch the sky `til the twister came around.
It`s got this one green branch pointing in the air.
Yeah it`s still hanging on, just like the people around here.

You can hold back the rain, bring on the wind.
Knock us right down, we`ll get up again.
We`ve dug in deep, made our stand.
This is our homeland.

I can feel their spirit deep in my bones.
Up on the hill we carved in in stone.
Been a long line before us, and little ones to come.
Yeah, it`s a family thing that we`re carrying on.

To try and be the man she thinks I am

And trembles when I love her
Makes me feel so big and strong and mean
Whispers that she cannot wait
To be my baby's mother
She's the only glimpse of God I've ever seen
Her momma should have warned her

In search of truth and light

Over thirty-six-hundred spins around without a cosmic slip

An' we watched as time proved Nostradamus wrong
An' we watched as Mother Nature shook the planet
An' cellular replaced the telephone

We even lost Superman, hmm

Well, the last ten years, look at the hills we've climbed
The best golfer's black, the best rapper's white an' it's about damn time
But we best beware, there's a brand new fight you see
An' I hate to say, we might be our own worst enemy

We watched Oklahoma sifting through the damage
An' we watched a US President get caught
We watched shareholders watch their savings vanish
We all cried when we watched those towers fall
We lost Minnie Pearl, Ron Reagan and Sam I am
We even lost Superman

The dot-com boom, an' reality shows

When I heard the doorbell ring

Through the peephole, all that I saw there
Was a crooked cap on curly hair
An' some kid squintin' back at me

I said, ""If you're sellin' somethin'
Well, I ain't buyin' nothin'
But I appreciate you stoppin' by""
Said, ""I ain't askin' for a dime just a minute of your time
An' your name here on the dotted line
Could you sign my petition?""

Handed me a chewed up pen
An' I ask you, ""What am I signin' up for?""

Saw a couple of neighbor's names

With a list that numbered one to ten

Keep Uncle Joe an' those soldiers safe
Give those kids on TV all they want to eat
Put a stop to bullies on the bus
No crime, no waits, no hate, no drugs
Give a jacket and a job to people on the street""

I said, ""Son, sounds like a world I'd like to live in""
And I signed his petition

He thanked me for my time
I headed back inside, grabbed my beer
An' got back to the game
Thought by now that boy, he's three doors down
Here I am just sittin' round

Must've blocked the whole game out

Now that it's much too late to change
How a father could have held his son
If I could undo what's been done
But I guess everyone is living with water & bridges

Now my old man, he had it rough
'Cause like his daddy when he drank too much
He'd get mean
And take it out on me

So with angry words, I was gone
I never even tried to go back home

And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues, yeah

Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free,

And every night she kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away

He said I read it in the paper, can't believe you're 21
And I can't believe some son of mine could do the things I hear you've done
He went on like some big hero, who flew in to save the day 
And the boy said if your here, to steer me right, man, its too late 

You had to be there, and I'm talkin' from from day one
That's the only time a dad should talk through glass to his new son 
You'd have to go back, and teach me how when I was nine 
Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball even if she had the time
I should have been learning how to fish, instead of learning how to smoke
I bet if you'd of whooped my tail, I'd never thought it was a joke 
He said sometimes the will for doing wrong is way too strong for any mama's prayers 
You had to be there

The man said, boy, I'm sorry that you hate me like you do 
The boy said dry it up man, we ain't making this about you
Its about a teenage girl against the world cause she was left there high and dry 
Its about a kid who might have stood a whole lot better shot at life

Cussed your name 
You`re just a no-account, sharecropping colored man
Who`d steal anything he can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James

Faded shirt, your weathered brow
Your caloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

And although your skin was black
You were the one that didn`t turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name Reuben James

And a bottle in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek
For there`s a better world awaiting for the meek

So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Till boredom overtook us, and he began to speak

He said, ""son, I've made my life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey, I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression
Said, ""if you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done

Now ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep""

So when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even

Kenny Rogers & the First Edition,"When the morning sun streaks across my room
And I've waken up from another dream of you
Yes I'm on the road, once again it seems
All I've left behind, is a chain of broken dream

But you know I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you

How I wish that love, is all we need to live
What a life we'd live, 'cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong, deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign could be keeping us apart
When you know I love
Yes I love you

And if I could only find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life of mine didn't cross our minds
All the answers were found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you, I'd come running back to you

But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Just to pay the rent, I must leave you all alone
But you know I made me choice many years ago
And this traveling life is the only one I know

But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you
But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you

Now Molly's got her hands full, raising baby sister's child. 
Every time she holds it close a tear rolls from her eye.

In my song you live again
And the phrases that I rhyme
Are just the footsteps out of time
From the time when I knew you, Reuben James

Reuben James
All the folks around Madison County cussed your name
You`re just a no-account, sharecropping colored man
Who would steal anything he can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James

Reuben James, for you still walk the furrowed field of my mind
Faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Flora Grey
The gossip of Madison County died with child
And although your skin was black
You were the one that didn`t turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name, Reuben James

Reuben James
With your mind on my soul and a Bible in your right hand
You said ""turn the other cheek
A-there`s a better world a-waiting for the meek""
In my mind these words remain from Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed field of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow

One dark, cloudy day they brought you from the field
Until your lonely pinebox came
Just a preacher and me in the rain

The calloused hands upon the plow

With a diva riding shotgun, just to say you got one

We'd lock ourselves in the bathroom, and nobody could get in

Kenny Vance & the Planotones,"At Erasmus Hall High School, we used to harmonize
Me and Benny and Aaron and two Italian guys
We were singing oldies, but they were newies then
And today when I play my old 45's, I remember when

We'd practice in a subway, in a lobby or a hall
Crowded in a doorway, singing doo wops to the wall
And if we went to a party and they wouldn't let us sing
We'd lock ourselves in the bathroom, and nobody could get in

'Cause we were looking for an echo, an answer to our sound
A place to be in harmony
A place we almost found

And the girls would gather 'round us, and our heads would really swell
We'd sing songs by the Moonglows, the Harptones, and the Dells
And when we sang ""Sincerely,"" we really sang it high
Even though it was falsetto, we almost reached the sky

We've sung a lot of changes since 1955
And a lot of bad arrangements we've tried to harmonize
Now we've turned into oldies, but we were newies then
And today when I play my old 45's, I remember when

I don't know where this road is gonna lead to.
All I know is where we've been and what we've been through.

Kenny Vehkavaara,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2001

Got me in a trance

Is gonna look just like our past
