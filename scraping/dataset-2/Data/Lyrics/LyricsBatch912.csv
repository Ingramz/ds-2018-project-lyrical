Rebecca Trehearn,"Boy, boy, crazy boy, 
Get cool, boy! 
Got a rocket in your pocket, 
Keep coolly cool, boy! 
Don't get hot, 
'Cause man, you got 
Some high times ahead. 
Take it slow and Daddy-O, 
You can live it up and die in bed! 
Boy, boy, crazy boy! 
Stay loose, boy! 
Breeze it, buzz it, easy does it. 
Turn off the juice, boy! 
Go man, go, 
But not like a yo-yo schoolboy. 
Just play it cool, boy, 
Real cool!",Cool,2007

Rebecca Trehearn,"Could be?
Who Knows?
There's something due any day
I will know, right away
Soon as it shows
It may come connanballing down
Through the sky
Gleam in its eye, bright as rose
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
under a tree
I got a feeling there's a miracle due
Gonna come true, comin' to me
Could it be, yes it could
Something's comin', something good
If I can wait
Something's comin'
I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great
With a click, with a shock
Phone'll jingle, door will knock
Open the latch
Something's comin'
Don't know when
But it's soon
Catch the moon
One handed catch
Around the corner
Or whistlin' down the river
Come on, deliver to me
Will it be, yes it will
Maybe just by holding still
It'll be there
Come on, something
Come on in
Don't be shy
Meet a guy
Pull up a chair
The air is humming
And something great is coming
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight!",Something's Coming,2007
Rebecca Trehearn,"There's a place for us, somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air, wait for us somewhere

There's a time for us, someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare, time to learn, time to care

Someday, somewhere, we'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving, somewhere

There's a place for us, a time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're half-way there, hold my hand and I'll take you there

Somehow, someday, somewhere",Somewhere,2007

I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
And I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, cant you see, I'm in love

I'd be a silly so-and-so

Rebecca Varon,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,2002

There isn't any other stair quite like it
I'm not at the bottom, I'm not at the top
So this is the stair where I always stop

Rebecca Zapen,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Rebecca Zapen,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Rebecca Zapen,"In the evening when the cattle's [Incomprehensible]
An old familiar feeling settles over me
And it's your face I see and I believe that you are there

In the garden when I stop to touch a rose
And feel the petal soft and sweet against my nose
I smile and I suppose that somehow maybe you are there

When I'm dreaming and I find myself awake
Without a warning and I rub my eyes and fantasize
And all at once I realize it's morning

And my fantasy is fading like a distant star of dawn

Pretend the dream is true and tell myself that you are there",You Are There,2003

Rebecca Zapen,"I have often walked
Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.
All at once am i
Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

Rebekah,"She picks the glass up from the floor
And he swears he won't hit her no more
And yeah she's heard all this before
But she still needs to make believe it's love
And I mind my business across the street
Turn up my music and try to sleep
But I wish she'd reach out to me
So I could help her see

He wears her in
He wears her out
And I just wanna fill her in
That's not what love's about

So he goes and buys her pretty things
'Cause he doesn't know how else to be
And I wonder why won't she leave
I guess nobody wants to be alone
And I see her in the store one day
Her sunglasses hide the love they made
But this time I don't turn away
I ask her does she know

He wears her in
He wears her out
And I just wanna fill her in
That's not what love's about

She closes in
To keep him out
And I just wanna fill her in
That's not what love's about

Dreams to linger within you,
Close your eyes and we'll ride my carousel.
I'll sing you stories of 

Lovers whose love used 
To fill me.
And the lovers who will be. 
For, you see, love is one thing I do well.

Come let's believe love can be just as sweet as it seems.
Let's live on dreams...
In my dreams such beautiful lovers have found me.
Story book lovers surround me. 

Nothing is real, but I'm flying,
Sighing: Where, where, where is my story book
Ending?
Why does my golden pretending

Leave me with nothing to hold...but
My dreams?
Oh is it only in dreams that we find out ideal love?
Are there lovers with real love? 

If you know how to feel love, show me how.
Ah, but my prince, if you can't be as sweet as you seem, 
I'd rather dream!
Come and wake me! Come be the love I can hold now.

Storybook love leaves me cold now.
Show me the way to stop dreaming! 
There is only one perfect story book ending. 
That is the end of pretending. 
That is the moment I say: Love me now!

If you and I could only dance into the past
And find that love we knew

And love isn't everything
This moonlight on the bed will melt away someday

Who I followed like a star
And suddenly you changed

I don't ever worry 'bout my next step
Or ever even worry 'bout my next check
Like it's the best bet, trying to protect neg
Living in this hurry, only worry is my next breath
'Cause you can get left and ghost with the rest
And end up most raise a toast to the death
Like it's blessed

'Til you rest where your breddas left wishing you were next
But the best don't, fade
Flicker where the flame blows
The circle still be tighter than some canerows
I feel the pain, never worry if the pain shows
Maybe only reason I be feeling like I paint those images that fit
Quick like the minute that you flip
For your finish feel the ignorance and dip
Still you slip
For a minute blame the Guinness that you sip
Little pierce missing ignorance and bliss

You falling out your tree, tryna be the top banana
Even the apple of my eye turn green with envy
When every jungle animal is on a feeding frenzy
Fear loathing on this helter skelter
When all we really need is food, clothing and shelter
Played the hand they dealt ya down 'til the last card
You claim king but only jokers have the last laugh
So when alarm bells ring we don't do a thing
But sing, it's sink or swim and the tide is in
Every night is a title bid
You gotta float when you're the butterfly that they're tryna pimp
And pack a sting for those buzzing 'round your honeybee
But never sweating when it's coming to the currency
The money been the root of evil since Genesis
So I let the ink chase the paper when I'm penning this

Nah we ain't in a hurry
We ain't in a rush bBut we steady pacing
Chasing payments is a blatant but we're staying patient
Pumping product from this basement trying to make a statement
But ain't nothing changed when I check my statement
Remain determined 'cause the work is being put in
I'm aware of what I'm cooking and the people overlooking
Mastering this recipe before we hand it out
But still living hand-to-mouth
Thought I had it figured out ,what a setback
That time is money that I'll never get back
And yeah I get that but listen if that
No time to dwell, 'cause only time will tell if it works
Flipping verses, filling purses is a gift and a curse
And so I, live for the better and I learn from the worst
I'm burning earnings will curve
And it's discerning at first
Determine money for music is the plan I prefer
To tell my mother I'm a man of my word

The lab is my pad, we’re using every session to jam
Working on my revolutionary revenue plan
But currently without the green, like a recession in 'Dam
So we scribble on the daily making beats for 'em
Create ancient plastic discs and playlists
That your parents used to play with
Quick and very painless
Stumbled onto rap, always been sick my very name is
Now I’m quick to leave you brainless
You anus
You Ignoramus
Just let me say this
Not the greatest - but gimme space kid, I’m set to make it
So basically we’re bringing it back to basics
Rocking hi-hats and big kicks that are the latest trend
It’s a statement, but when you put this fashion aside
This rap music is a passion of mine, lifeline
'Cause I designed the Illest rhymes
Chillin', time keeps tickin'
But I'm high
Keep spittin' and flippin' rhythms to vibe, like

Oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
It's like
Oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We sayin'
Oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We got some old Jay Zs, couple ODBs
Place 'em up in perfect order 'cause my OCD won't let me

It’s like sixteen bars in sixteen minutes
I kill it
Extinguish all the fire from the liars and the gimmicks
Losing spirit
Bredders putting cheddar over lyrics
Then diminish any vision when they clear it
I hear it, it's happening
Moving like they’re mannequins
Dressed by other brothers
Hiding under covers with mothers be panicking
Rambling
Gassing like they’re Anakin
But red and blue lights are out of sight
On the mic - stop damaging
Your honour and your pride
I, goner from the side
Never dippin' from the rhythm
Flow specific when I rhyme
Sometime tell the flack and back, a slap
To any cracker jack who be slacking his mac
I’m on the track and in my prime
Ease your mind if ya hold it
Time if you chose it
Keep your spine straighter then a blind homophobic
Ease your mind - if you hold it
Time if you chose it
And keep your spine straight tonight (‘night ‘night)

Rebellion,"On the blackened eve of destruction
A king arises with the promise of light
But the Jarls who held him high
Were soon to see that they followed a lie

Wise magicians and healing women
Put to the stake by royal hands
Baptized they would not be
And so in flames their life did end

Odin thy face
It fades in the blood
The heathen oaks burned
It's the end of a god

Blood rains from the sky
Love is just a christian lullaby
I can't believe I'd rather die
Blood rains from the sky
Preaching love while tortured victims cry
I won't believe I'd rather die

Bondes who would not dip in the water
At the Althing he had put them dead
A royal smile a lie on the lips
Believe in Christ or drink burning lead

Raud a mighty Jarl on the isle
He was taken at night and tried to a stake
His house on flames
Yet he would not fold his hands
Condemned to death
He had to swallow a snake

Odin thy face
It fades in the blood
The heathen oaks burned
It's the end of a god

Blood rains from the sky
Love is just a christian lullaby
I can't believe I'd rather die
Blood rains from the sky
Preaching love while tortured victims cry
I won't believe I'd rather die

Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the gettin's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Come along, come along with me

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

You bared your sould I waltzed right in
You gave me everything
And I just made you feel so very
Naked and you don't remember
How you let yourself become so unraveled

You spilled your guts on my best shoes
I keep it in, you let it loose
It's only love that makes you feel like I'm getting
So completely
Naked and you don't remember
How you let yourself become so unraveled
Your naked pretty as a heartache
Waiting for your second skin to settle in

My hardened heart can't hide me now
It loves as much as I allow
And in the end the eyeball army will just drag me down
And I'll be

Naked

And I know there's nothing that can hide me now
I'm naked

Reckless Kelly,"Tommy was a hesher from the valley
He was as burned out as a building from the riots
He had a rockin' little girlfriend named Marla
She was a cocktail waitress at The Pit

Sometimes, on the weekends, they'd ride jet skis
And they'd take his little trailer to the river
They'd bring along a T.V. to watch Rick Dees
Well, they smoked dope and snorted crystal meth

Marla was as skinny as a fence post
And the powder in the baggie made her talk
Sometimes she did her hair like Charlie's Angels
Yeah, well, sometimes she looked as weird as Mr. Spock

Sometimes, on the weekends, they'd eat fast food
And they'd take his El Camino to the desert
They'd ride his motorcycles in the sand dunes
Well, they smoked dope and snorted crystal meth

Tommy had a passion for firearms
His confidence, they really seemed to bolster
He bought a ninety dollar pistol for his Mar-Mar
She kept it in her little girlie holster

Sometimes, on the weekends, they'd be fighting
As Tommy thought his girl was telling lies
He thought that she was thumpin' with the bass player
Smoking all his dope and all his crystal meth

Tommy started suffering from delusions
After five nights without any sleep
He rammed his fist through Marla's bedroom window
He shoved his car keys through her dirty little teeth

But Marla got her fingers on the trigger
She grabbed her little Tommy by the hair
The pistol was still smoking on the counter
The sirens were screaming through the air
Scream on and on

Tommy was a hesher from the valley
He's just a memory of his burned out little world
Marla's doing thirty years for murder
Yeah, but she knows she's still his rockin' little girl

Someday, up in Heaven, they'll ride jet skis
They'll scrawl their names upon the Golden Wall
And maybe, up in Heaven, they'll watch Rick Dees
Smoke a little dope and snort some crystal meth

Reckless Kelly,"The first pub we could stagger to was twelve steps from the plane
A Virgin flight to Shannon town the day it didn't rain
The laughin' eyes of Ireland sparklin' blue and green
With hair as black as Guinness stout and barely seventeen

We're back out on the cobble stones, whiskey drunk and high again
Liquored up and gearin' up for seven nights in Ireland

The corner booth is waitin' for the session to begin
It's quiet as a mother's prayer till we all stumble in
And it's fifty happy voices mixed with whistles made of tin
And a piper man is blowin' like the North Atlantic wind

And an Aran island beauty is sawin' on the violin
I wonder will she miss me after seven nights in Ireland

Well, it's Ladies Day in Galway and we watched the ponies run
Fifty pounds against the odds and came in six to one
McSwiggin heard the race report, he invited us on in
So we drank Catholic whiskey with all our newfound friends

They raised a glass to all of us and we all toasted them
Here's to Michael, Tom and Pat and seven nights in Ireland

Well, we kissed all the girls goodbye and gathered in our gear
And when she walked me to the gate I swear I saw a tear
But then she looked into my eyes, I knew she felt my pain
And only then I realized we were standin' in the rain

So save our places at the pub and when the eyes are dry again
We'll come back another day for seven nights in Ireland",Seven Nights in Eire,2005
Reckless Kelly,"Sadie got a six gun
She ain't afraid to use it
The banker took us straight down
To the safe and I blew it
The sheriff heard a big bang
In the broad daylight
And by the time the smoke cleared
We were nowhere in sight

Sadie got an Mustang
An old '64
Sadie got the top down
And her foot to the floor
Lights in the rearview
Got the fuzz on our tail
Better give me that scattergun, baby
I ain't goin' back to jail

Sadie got a hideout
Off of 71
We'll count up all the money
Ditch the car and the guns
Sadie says she loves me
I'll always be her man,
""And I'll see you in Rio honey
We gotta stick to the plan""

I woke up in the hayloft
To the rooster's crow
No sign of Sadie
No sign of the dough
I'm heading to the airport
I got a little brass key
I got a ticket and a passport
Locker 32-B

Open up the blue box
There ain't nothing inside
I been played like a fiddle
I've been taken for a ride
Sadie made a phone call
In the middle of the night
They've got the place surrounded
With the black and white

I got myself a hostage
In a Delta skirt
""Do as I tell you
And nobody gets hurt
Show me where your car's parked
You're gonna have to drive
Because I'll be hiding in the backseat
With a .45""

""Get me through the roadblock
Better drive real slow
Better play your cards right
And I'll let you go""
And I hear my heart a pounding
As fast as it can
I hear the copper askin'
""Have you seen this man?""

Delta kept her mouth shut
Like a good girl should
""And you're free to go now
'cause you done real good""

Now I got a suitcase
And a thumb in the air
I don't know where I'm goin'
And I don't really care

Bubba's got a big rig
And an empty seat
We're headin' to Laredo
It's alright with me

I'll check into a hotel
In old Mexico
I gotta wait until it cools down
I'm gonna lay a little low

Well I don't miss the money
I don't miss the guns
Well I sure miss Sadie

Until we come to see the error of our ways

Leaves me lost with nothing to believe

you never saw the other shore
Hey but only a fool would have believed the alligator

I've lost all my true friends I've lost a happy home
I'm heading for destruction I'm on the wrong track
Down the highway of sorrow there's no turning back

I went back to my darling I got down on my knees
I begged her with tear rimmed eyes to give my poor heart ease
But she was hurt so deeply she could not forgive
So I'll live in sorrow as I long as I live",Highway of Sorrow,1988

This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, honey, for my size

Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
Baby, how can I roll when the wheels won't go

Up on the mountain just to see my honey
And I ain't coming back, lord, I ain't coming back

Red Café,"Yo, I'm a tic-tac-toe tactical wit it tactician
Tit for tat, three bombs on me, we all ticking
Schizophrenic, up in the kitchen
With a black fifth up against my head, just, click, click, clickin' it
We check the barrel and start respinnin' it
We, I start, medics start sowing and restitching them
My constituents and scorpions poisonous stingers filled with opium

Stay grippin' 'em, I've got a venomous heart, filled with vigilance
That will shatter ten continents and ten palatinates
Envision the vengefulness, visualize the vindictiveness
I rhyme with Sid Vicious viciousness
You be kiddin', soft like kittens
My grills are pit bulls, they will kill when I say sick 'em
Restrain me, restrict me
I'm arresting resistance, can't be apprehended nigga

You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole squad siding with me

Let the catty spray and wet up the matinee
Smack niggaz with both hands like patty-cake
Violate and I will retaliate
I don't battle fake niggaz, I'm heavyweight nigga
GMG, fam, we gladly hotta
Behold the sorcerer's stone like Harry Potter
And I'm like Harry Potta, we scary riders

Can't get near the dadda
I swear to God I'll come find where you hidin'
Have my high, finding beamers and ninas
Leave the area shot up, you hearing me Patna
I'm a fucking five star general, to drive cars into you
Ic' dodge interviews, one flip of the mack, take all ten of you
This message intended to, who's ever offended Duke
Yeah, you my nigga, but you could still get it too
So don't test me, I don't wanna do this shit to you

You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole squad siding with me

Live from the NY state
And I got one question, guess what's in my waste
Y'all got me pisted off slick talk
To get that Jacob watch, I'll cut your wrist off
I'm in the limo too long to turn
And this motherfuckin' Dutch taking long to burn
I'm impatient, this is a song you learn

Make money, take money
And I'm hear to confirm my occupation
The new boss of course, the new Porsche
I pull up just to murder you niggaz and move off
You too soft, Red Cafe from New York
I tell a bitch quick, I'm hot can't cool off
I twist lesbos, and guzzling out exos
My firearms stick to my waste like Velcro
It's R.C. nothing phony about me
With E double the O.G. you know me

You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole squad siding with me

Yeah, I know, you never expect me to anchor
I bring it to them so called pranksters and them gangsters
I run DMC's from rappers that's petter piper
I am the big apple, ain't nobody ripper, man
I'm not M.J., I'm a lover and a fighter
That's why I'm in D.C. now, looking for the sniper
I came in the game with hoodies and timberlands
Hard since Cypress Hill been wanting to kill a man

I did time, a thirteen year bid
I'm gutter E, I'm hanging on the side of crib
I'm a fan, but I hate what you're doing
Whenever you performing shows it's me booing
Ya as soft as your bid-die, you punk now
And you gonna be a punk at sixty
Dog, ya need more team to get me
I'm a G, and my Unit come through like Fifty

You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole squad siding with me

You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole squad siding with me

You ever had corns on your fingers from squeezing the mack to much
Nigga be rhyming the dice game where me and lil wack grew up
Tripping stolen strip cars for a living
Stayed away from home when ever they was bitchin
We used to rush the customers for sales when they pull up in cars
Until undercovers started putting us behind bars
Menace to society is all we watch
In the back seat straped with the throw away glocks
I got some partners in the business never seeing the light
Your people would gota cocking if your cheese be right
You know I've been holding it down playa you a dog
I'm a real nigga I ain't gonna stop accepting your phone call
I'm a blow and toss a hoe for you, like I'm supposed to do

Shot a nigga for smokin rocks on my mom back porch
Damn near graduated and got on that dope
My, work is an art, I am better than smart
Homey I hustle with a strategy that's never been taught
I can make the coke flip, I can make a hoe strip, I can spray the whole clip, 
I take nothing from no bitch
I got the money in the case, 45 in the waist
Pitbulls in the yard so stay away from my gate
Could you believe a nigga feelin like he still ain't ate?

Would love to give you some credit, but even you said it

Trust me homie I'm not playin', get up!
Now get on the dance floor off the chain
I say get up!

I came to bring you that California love
And a lil' New York hatin' it's all of the above
I'm not playin' I'm sayin' I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow the instructions
I said get up!

I ball till I fall
I stunt till I drop
I'm off the show room floor
Not the used car lot
You buy a bottle
I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras

When I get in to it
I get in to it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it
I make it rain, rain
Till the sun come out
A nigga playin', playin'
We make the guns come out

Now, my question is
Who they gonna blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again
Shit, shift now the game done change
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain

I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And NWA made the West Coast bang
Nah it's just music, man it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here

Girl, you look good
I want to get to know you better
You look good in them jeans
And them red stilettos
You got a Bentley
Coupe booty baby
I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is
When I'm inside

I'ma take you for a spin
You know round and round
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return
If you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn
I got money to burn

While the Gap Band play
She dropped the bomb on me
It's up and down
And up and down
Gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
Or Fifty you should go home to see
What that bitch bout

I found out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up' get cha some
I know how to get you sprung
Tune you up' use your tongue
Under the hood it's so good
She said it's so good
Goddamn I'm so hood

Look
Like Michael J. Fox, I got +Family Ties+
Posing us can't be wise
Swept across the family dies
Something small as a look, can bring about a man's demise
And whoever he stands beside, hit him where he can't survive
Throw the drop, or slip an object, if not then missing
Nine shot, pop a clip in, pine box the opposition
Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary, determined the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath
Skin peeled off your flesh, I know you wish you wore a vest
That's a no brainer, I'm coming with both flamers
I'll spray 'em, but I'm no painter
To this here, I'm no stranger
It's obvious you no bangers
You dudes pose no danger
Your whole crew chumps, in the closet like coat hangers
Like purple broke up in the dutch
Leave you broke up on a crush
That's what happens when shooters choke up in the clutch
We gonna body you, and have to hook your wife to an I.V. too
Put both of your parents side by side in I.C.U (everybody lose)
Closed casket so they can't have a proper wake
Don't interfere with family business, that's how we operate

(feat. Nina Sky)

[Intro: Nina Sky]
Oh-ho, oh-ho, ohhh... Nina Sky-why-ighhhh...

[Red Cafe:]
DJ Envy, Red Cafe, The Co-op!

[Chorus sung in the style of Gina Thompson's ""The Things That You Do"": Nina Sky]
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Verse 1: Red Cafe (Nina Sky) {Red Cafe in parenthesis}]
Uh, you remind me of hard liquor
Feel like I overdosed on hard liquor
Now you got a G leanin (Jodeci)
You got a G Feenin woe is me
Is are Dot, the fresh and the flyest (Yeah)
The thighs in that dress could start a riot
{UH OHH!} It's the lovin like that
Like a round-trip flight, I be comin right back (Right back)
Shakedown got me thuggin like that (Like that)
All night, I'm out chasin that trap
It's like every thug's dream
To have a down chick or a thug a** queen
Face in the pillow, a** in the arch
Legs done had a divorce, they split apart (Split apart)
I do it slow, til you scream (Do it faster)
Red Cafe, I'm back the Trackmaster

[Chorus: Nina Sky (Red Cafe)]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you (Yeah, It's The Co-op, OK OK!)
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you (ok ok

[Verse 2: Red Cafe (Nina Sky) {Red Cafe in parenthesis}]
It might be wrong but it feel so right, yes yes this is life
Love is so hood you could bottle that stuff
If it wasn't Cafe I would gobble it up
Yep! No longer thinkin 'bout them R&B girls
Like, Ciara (Uh Uh) Nivea (Who that?) Teairra (Nah) Olivia (Whatever!)
All them names seem trivia
You look mean in them painted paints, do that dance, do that dance
I ain't no backyard n****
But my workout plan will make your backyard bigger
{I like} To see you in my favorite jeans
{And I like} The way you don't hold your screams
{I like} The way you make your body rock
And you ain't scared to lick the lollipop

[Chorus: Nina Sky]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
OK! OK! I know you like the finer things
Designer names like Vera Wang
Necklesses and diamond rings
Bling blaow shirts with the shiney things
You could get all that plus a rover
Put my chain on the arm give you the cold shoulder
And the hood respect it man
I bring the pain that's the Method Man
What's 'gon top that? Who 'gon knock that?
We a tag team girl they can't stop that
The world feelin your fella, on the road to the riches let's get it together

[Verse 4: Nina Sky]
I see you sippin slowly (Slowly) I can tell you want me (You want me)
Like that drink so tasty, there's no need for chasin, no no no

[Chorus: Nina Sky]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Outro: Nina Sky (Red Cafe)]

Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Just me for you and you for me, alone!

No friends or relations on weekend vacations,

Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear; 
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear.

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

A heaven that I've never known.

Red Callender,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Con quella schiena che mi chiama quell'andatura favolosa
In questo sabato affollato nel centro storico di tutto
Mi sei apparsa all'improvviso e sto inseguendo il paradiso
E corro e corro verso te e corro e corro verso te 
E corro e corro verso te e corro e corro verso te
Avrò anche visto tante volte aprirsi al cielo un calicanto
Ma non avevo ancora visto la fioritura di uno schianto
Sei come pane per l'istinto colpo di genio della sorte
Come l'annuncio del buon vento la giusta mano nelle carte
E corro e corro verso te e corro e corro verso te
E corro e corro verso te e corro e corro verso te
Fermati dai solo un momento

Male che andrà mi porterai via con te
Voltati dai che ho il cuore in gola
Ti chiederò: sei mica sola?
E corro e corro verso te e corro e corro verso te
E questa sete di conquista che in ogni uomo regna e vince
Dietro di te diventa un vizio un'idea fissa che mi spinge
Ma lui ti ha aperto la portiera e ti ha baciata e gli hai sorriso
Sento il morale sotto ai piedi
Ma non mi sono certo arreso

E corro e corro verso te e corro e corro verso te
E allora corro verso te e corro e corro verso te
Fermati dai solo un momento

C'è quello che già ho

E quanto tempo è andato via tra il rumore e la follia
E allora sto in silenzio qui che non c'è niente meglio di così

C'è il gusto della malinconia che lasci andar via ci sei
C'è quello che vorrei
C'è quello che già ho

Giorni di pioggia ricordi e promesse di questo vivere
Siamo noi a complicare la realtà e il futuro che verrà

I don't know who I am

I must've gone too far
And I'm too tired to try and find my way back home now

All my love has crumbled into dust
I don't know what will become of us

I think I cry because 
Of how easy it once was
That's how love should be
Why is it hard for me?
Why do I look at you and see a stranger there now?

In the tremor beneath my skin
In the sweat running down my back 
In the breath that I'm holding in
While I tense for the next attack

I try to ride it out, but its taking its toll
I try to hide from it, but it knows where to go
I try to fight it, but it scares me so

The fear is solid, the fear is real
Fear is the only thing I feel
Fear and frustration will be my degradation
And it's fear you see driving you away from me

There is something
That I can't put my finger on
At the edge of my consciousness

And it stays with me dusk till dawn
What it is I can only guess

How can I beat it down, when I can't fight what I can't see?
I have to kill it before it kills me
I have to find out how strong I can be

Fear is the only thing I feel
Fear and frustration will be my degradation

Red Delicious,"Under an early sun, I hear a song, a desperate sound
Out of the open sky, an angel falling to the ground
Familiar to me-I feel a sickening sense of déjà vu
It used to be the song I'd sing

Until you touched me with your hands
And you showed me your sweet face

I was a ghost before, a silent heart, unoccupied
Uncomfortable in my skin, a clumsy shell where I would hide
I barely cared to breathe; I didn't have a reason to
Now when I do, I breathe for you

Because you touched me with your hands
And you showed me your sweet face
And you changed me with your truth
And you saved me with your grace

I feel resurrected, I feel born again in perfect skin
What did I feel before you opened up and let me in?
I can't recall, anything at all

And you showed me your sweet face
And you changed me with your truth
And you saved me with your grace",Grace,2004

I want you seasick every time you look at me
I want you spellbound falling at my feet

It turns into another song
But it's sweet
I want them awestruck, dumb with disbelief
I want them swooning every time they look at me
I want them pleading begging on their knees
To kiss their children and cure their disease
But what I crave so badly now
Will soon go bitter in my mouth
But it's sweet
I want their worship and their stares
If it goes sour well who cares
It's sweet

I want you seasick everytime- you look at me
I want you spellbound falling at my feet
I want you heavy and I want you -sweet

And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old Shep, he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
""I can do no more for him, Jim""

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side and looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Shep, he has gone where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep,1964

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see

Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there all right
But they all go native on Saturday Night
Oh, well the music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples looking for romance
Somebody takes a brogan and knocks out the light

They all know the other fellow packs a gun
Everybody does his best to act just right
Cause there's gonna be funeral if you start a fight

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1964
Red Garland,"It begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'round midnight.

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Let our hearts take wings'
'round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing,
for your returning.
Till our love is safe and sound.
And old midnight comes around.

Red Garland,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

I'm up in the morning on the corner so siditty

That you'd hardly know it's me
And late in the evening when I'm mellow
There's my fellow with the world for me to see
It's a world full of cocktails at nine
And dinners and wine very late shows
And where the crowd goes

I'm a girl with a world of her owna queen on her throne
Till everything's gone and then
I wake up to find that I'm a stranger
In a world where I have never before
I look for my man who held my hand

But now I know that he'll be coming back no more
I'm telling you 'bout this bag of blues
Paid a whole lotta dues baby
Gonna change my way of livin' talkin' bags of blues
Mister don't you see I'm paying dues
Gonna change me some shoes baby

And doze on the sofa 'til eleven then get up and pour myself another drink
While back at the party I'll be hardy while I'm waitin' for some better news

Red Garland,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day, twelve O'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong, again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again and only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will while yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

And late in the evening when I'm mellow
There's my fellow with the world for me to see
It's a world full of cocktails at nine
And dinners and wine very late shows
And where the crowd goes

I'm a girl with a world of her owna queen on her throne
Till everything's gone and then
I wake up to find that I'm a stranger
In a world where I have never before
I look for my man who held my hand

But now I know that he'll be coming back no more
I'm telling you 'bout this bag of blues
Paid a whole lotta dues baby
Gonna change my way of livin' talkin' bags of blues
Mister don't you see I'm paying dues
Gonna change me some shoes baby

Walkin' in a daze to my apartment where I'll grab another wink
And doze on the sofa 'til eleven then get up and pour myself another drink
While back at the party I'll be hardy while I'm waitin' for some better news
But now in the meantime I'll just sit right here and cool it
We're gonna cool it now and listen to the rhythm

Red Grammer,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2009

Red Holloway Orchestra,"Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hill

Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
My secret love's no secret anymore

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
My secret love's no secret anymore",Secret Love,1996
