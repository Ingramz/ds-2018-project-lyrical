Kyjuan,"Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them niggas' back
I hear them boys coming dirty
Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them bitches' back
I hear them boys coming

Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them niggas' back
I hear them boys coming dirty
Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them bitches' back
I hear them boys coming

Who am I you ask me, you know it's 'bout that grammar
From any state, it don't matter, from here to Montana
From white girls named Anna to old ladies named Nanna
They holding up their banners and running with their cameras
Can I get a flick, you're damn right, miss
""Can I take a hit"", ""Here, boo, like this""
Chronic's sticky like gum, I guess that's how it comes
Don't worry 'bout my funds, I play around it in one
(Like, oh) (oh-oh oh-oh)
When you've seen that Hummer but that was last summer
This year I'm more blunter, more up close and personal
It's just gon' get worse now
From Prada to Vokal
The Tics are too versatile
Can't worry 'bout certain sounds
That come out these haters' mouths
I realize they can't help it just stay where you're bowing down
Some more you can't get these pounds
Unless you gon' smoke it now
If not, I suggest you pack your shit up and head out of town

Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them niggas' back
I hear them boys coming dirty
Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them bitches' back
I hear them boys coming

Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them niggas' back
I hear them boys coming dirty
Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them bitches' back
I hear them boys coming

They be like, ""Hold up, hold up, hold up
I know that ain't them, man""
Murp jersey on backwards with old school Tim's and
Kyjuan's got on so many colors just like a pimp
Nelly's chain's so long, got him walking with a limp
Ali is throwing money in the front row
And her body's screaming slow down but where the hell is Slo
Of course we be them up, close, live, and in person
Might look like the type that be robbing them purses (like oh)
But I ain't, I'm the young dude, I be rhyming them verses
Worked hard since ninety-three, that's how I got signed to Universal
Now the girlies take their thongs off
And it be crazy in the club when that Lunatic song go off
I be that 'pull up right beside you, beating bad' type of Tic
I'm a 'hold up traffic to touch her ass' type of Tic
Lunatic, that's what I am, that's what I said I am
I'm trying to be a millionaire, I bet I am, I bet I am

(Like oh) It's them boys' on them Porches in Air Forces reading Sources
My choice is old school's over them Rolls Royce's
Of course, this Tic shit live like EA Sports is
Dribble in the club, I lay up with two draft choices
Hit the center, touch the point guard, she hit the joint hard
Oh, wee, oh Lord, she don't want no more
Cutlass is four door, stash for the four-four
Smokes' one four-four's, what them oh's go for (like oh)
Three-fifty's or more, three-fifty stick in the floor
Brand new Azure smashes, G's and C's all in my glasses
'Tics fantastic, we get booked more than matches
Imagine me without those two headbands
Them Vokal t-shirts with some eight class pants
Feeling dapper like Dan, yes, fresh like Mannie
Cutlass candies sit down, you know you can't stand me

Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them niggas' back
I hear them boys coming dirty
Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them bitches' back
I hear them boys coming

Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them niggas' back
I hear them boys coming dirty
Like, oh
Better get them back
Watch them bitches' back
I hear them boys coming

Andy freezes, all his fees
Locks, stripy stocks, rocks in the watch
Big shorts, headband to a cross-jersey back Ross
That's that mid-west talk, I think your future boss'
Batter up no, cough,
Let you know Caprice Classic's on these hoes for our big shows
Tell her, best be on they toes Five Country Grammar boys in bandana's, platinum, no gold like oh
(Like oh)
That's what they say when I
Pull up on d's in that old Dr J
Old 88, fat laces, this world is rat races
Heading back places but it still seems racist
Got locations so I haul off the wall off if you could fall off
Got a room at the Wada with a saw that'll take the wall off
Hit the mall off with a sag, hockey jersey, Do-rag
Fitted still, switching two different shoes, starchy with tags

Ayyo, I'm laid back and humble, yeah, I'm cool wit it
Kinda hungry, give me a salad and a soup wit it
Ain't no need for extra rolls, Sue comes wit it
Baby, girl behind the counter lookin' cool wit

She got a fat ass, I know I went to school wit it
She was the type that said I wouldn't know what to do wit it
I kick that Willie Bo Bo aqua suit wit it, went trough wit it
Got her number, she ain't it so I'm through wit it

I let Pooh hit it, he let the crew hit it
Hold on lil' Derrty, for two minutes
I think I left my herb man I ain't cool wit it
Murph Derrt say he got me now I'm cool wit it

I make a lotta dough, pay a lotta pay dues wit it
Pimpin' already, now I got the juice in it

Yo mo Leezy Nell, I'm done come act a fool wit it

I woke up at 9:30, I was cool wit it
I said damn it's kinda early but I'm cool wit it
I had a message on my celly I'm like who did it?
Turns out, it was this chick I'd like to 'Ooh' wit it

Now I'm tryin' to figure out if I'ma fool wit it
She used to be the cheerleader type, school spirit
You know the pom-poms, back flips, split wit it
I know a lot of niggaz tried but they didn't get it

Or maybe they had the game they just didn't spit it
Or they won't admit it, 'cause they carry too much pride in it
I like to slide in it, flip it and dip it and take a ride in it
Hide in it, might flight glide in it

You know I did it, 'cause I'm cool wit it
A lot of niggaz talkin' shit but I'm cool wit it
Walk in a party, lotta gawkin' but I'm cool wit it
Look outside, see what I'm parkin'? you can't fool wit it

Not at all, you can't fool wit none of that young mate
Why is you trippin of the 24 Escalade
Powdered baby blue wit the Gucci Lou interior
A-ha, slide on young playa
Just be cool wit yo losses, a-ha, Pimp Juice

Yo Murph, you cool wit it?
Yeah, man I'm cool wit it
But is you cool wit it?
Yeah, Derrty I'm cool wit it
You sure you really cool wit it?
Yeah, man I'm cool wit it
Pimp Juice let me show you really I am

Look, look, I got my mama a new house and she cool wit it
I grew up and had to bounce so she cool wit it
Baby sister got a car and she cool wit it
'cause she work and go to school so I'm cool wit it

My granny don't like rap but she cool wit it
'cause as long as I got a job then she cool wit it
To my grandaddy name and he cool wit it
Told me boy don't blow yo money and be cool wit it

So in other words Derrty don't be a fool wit it
He said don't wind up in the motherfuckin' news wit it
And help the family when you can and they cool wit it
Separate the hatas from the friends and be cool wit it

I'm Murph Dert mu'fucka I'm so cool wit it
I send raps on ice 'cause I'm cool wit it
And erry scene I be in I be cool wit it
Pull up in the yellow Benz thing 'cause I'm cool wit it

Got shit 'coz I dare too much
Gimme, gimme, got shit 'coz I dare too much
Gimme, gimme, got shit 'coz I dare too much
Gimme, gimme

Uh, uh, uh, uh
I'm automatical, infatical, radical even
I wanna clear all the misconceptions and shit ya believe in
I'm leavin' nothin' to the imagination
I won't stop on my emanicipation, proclamation
Through the radio stations

Facin' me, ain't that hard but it ain't that easy
Like I don't know when to play hard and when to play easy
Believe me, George and Weezy couldn't move up this fast
I'm lappin' everybody can't tell if I'm first or last

It won't hurt ya ass, but it might hurt yo ass
To come trippin', find dirty got the perfect stash
The perfect gat, left in ya ass thought I would run
Laughin' at them niggaz who thought derrty was done

I'm a son of a G, I'm not a son of bitch
I'm makin' sure that my son and my sons gon' be rich
Daughters and my daughters in no particular order
I leave 'em layin' up out the water wit straps to protect they ball up
'Coz I call it

I need some cool-Aid, whaa?
Wit my red hot riplets
Tell 'em what ya, tell 'em what mean man
You all that and a bag of chips
And I just wanna know if me and you can dip
That's all

I need some cool-Aid, whaa?
Wit my red hot riplets
Tell 'em what ya, tell 'em what mean man
You all that and a bag of chips
And I just wanna know if me and you can dip
That's all

Baby girl, you sweeter than cool-Aid, the red flavor
""Ooh that's my favorite"", yeah I know my game is major
She gave me her card, she said I can page her
I was gon' wait a couple of days but I did her a favor

Call her now, invite myself awake the neighbors
Beatin' loud, swoopin' like a caped crusader
Without the cape, without the tights
Her baby daddy was the type to have a truck like mine
No beach rims, no door pipes

Of course that, I love her apple bottom short set
She got upset, I said she couldn't fire up a cigarette
Small brat, ain't used to cats wit short stacks
If you ask me for summin', drop her off where the porch at

I'm on a mission, turn the keys in the ignition
Beat steady, beatin' Tweeter steady whistlin'
She's seen my glisten, started to trip
Murph, she's all that and a bag of chips

I need some cool-Aid, whaa?
Wit my red hot riplets
Tell 'em what ya, tell 'em what mean man
You all that and a bag of chips
And I just wanna know if me and you can dip
That's all

I need some cool-Aid, whaa?
Wit my red hot riplets
Tell 'em what ya, tell 'em what mean man
You all that and a bag of chips
And I just wanna know if me and you can dip
That's all

Look, I want some mushu whether I'm in Cali or Cancun
No goin' out, I like to stay in my damn room, damn
She got a donkey-o, this must be a damn zoo, ooh
Look at the monkey yo, she must be a baboon!

Please don't feed me mama, I'm like an animal
Especially after 12, can you handle my stamina?
You won't believe the things I say when you walk by
My game cool but when it's on but it's hot when I talk high

Now ought I take you home but am I wrong
I'm a kid ma, you know I don't wanna be Home Alone
Plus I felt summin' therre when we was dancin' on that song
I like togetherness, can we all get along?

Can we all, get in my car and talk about it in the morn'
And make decisions when wake up and yawn
Come on, you can tell me if you like it or not
'Coz I'ma have my cool-Aid and my riplets red hot

I need some cool-Aid, whaa?
Wit my red hot riplets
Tell 'em what ya, tell 'em what mean man
You all that and a bag of chips
And I just wanna know if me and you can dip
That's all

I need some cool-Aid, whaa?
Wit my red hot riplets
Tell 'em what ya, tell 'em what mean man
You all that and a bag of chips
And I just wanna know if me and you can dip
That's all

Yo, yo, them muthafuckas just too damn hot
Nigga like the pie in the window
Cross the gun line and even get shot to find the indo
Eatin' red hot, riplets promotin' passin' out snippets
Seen you walkin' wit the triplets, I'm clubbin' lookin' terrific

I need some cool-Aid, shit I got to get it wit it
Put my spoon up in ya pitcher see if it fit up in it
And smoke for a second, and told her I'll wreck it
Told her groupie connection, got in the room and told her get naked

Told the Lunatics, told her how I reflect it
Lemme show you from the Show-Me, no talk fo sho respect it
And ya red hot butt and now ya say ya hearin' not
It's the rap Fred Flintstone, I makin' the Bed Rock

I give it to ya never failin' ya, handlin' business I'm tellin' ya
You ever need me again I'ma be through in on my celluar
And I'ma store y'all never on the red hot riplets and cool-Aid

My heart,
And it feels like magic,
It's changing my life.
Since you came to me,
Everything is so bright I see
You touched my heart,
And gave me love so real.

This time around I wanna let it show
There's something special,
In my heart you ought to know

I feel for you,
I mean I truly love you
In my heart and in my soul
You are my love
You are my all
I feel for you
I mean always love you
Because to me
You are a dream
Come true

Love grows
Everyday
And it's hard to deny it
You inspire me all the way
The joy you bring
Makes my heart keep on singing
And all I wanna do
Is to remain close to you

This time around I wanna let it show
There's something special
In my heart you ought to know

I feel for you
I mean I truly love you
In my heart and in my soul
You are my love you are my all
I feel for you
I mean I'll always love you
Because to me you are a dream
Come true

You are my angel in disguise
You are the reason I survive
With you each moment is worthwhile
You make me smile
And if without you
Surely I cry

I feel for you
I mean I truly love you
In my heart and in my soul
You are my love you are my all
I feel for you
I mean I'll always love you

Because to me you are a dream(3x)

Be straight up

Was I your rebound on a low
A crutch a step a stool for you
The one to help you get through

Would you just stick around
Would things still work out in the end

If you could have your way would it be mine, just me and you
If you had an option more would you be

How life would really be
If you would have the choice would you be here with me

(Aha) 
Yeah I gets you lifted 
You know the windows tinted in the back sweat we could kick it 
(Aha) 
And when the shit is lighted 
You know it feels terrific cos we hotter than a minute, on and on? 

[Chorus] 
Everybody move your body, now do it 
Here is something that's gonna make you move & groove 
Hey D.J. keep playing that song, all night 
On and on and on 
 
I switch flows like I switch gear 
Heard your first single, now who soundin' like a b***h here? 
You stay unnoticed like a bad landmark 
I stand out like an albino at a million man march, huh 
If you don't understand press rewind 
Malique and Joe, Asia?s best of all time 
It's been a long time since we hit you with a strong rhyme 
**** the gossips, me and Joe we get along fine 

(OK) 
Ya?ll lay men make way 
When made mens in black Vans pull up the valet 
(OK) 
With more butts than ashtrays, 
Yes I love my girls and I love em nasty 
(OK) 
You love my flashy ways 
Exactly how I?m digging how ya butt cheek sways 
(OK) 
Girl, just walk this way and bring your best friend 
We could do it three way, on and on? 

[Chorus] 
 
On and on and, 1,2?s and phat jams 
I'm guilty of puttin' 34's on black rims 
Back then, a 3 for 10s with black vans 
Now roll in black tims with mens in black vans 
(That's hot) 
Sorry it's just the lil' dragon in me 
I'm blazin' man this vocal booth should get a chimney 
(That's hot) 
Like your mothers fried rice, right from the pan 
It's time to add a lil' spice right from the man 
That's hot... 
 
(So sexy) 
Yeah I see them hotties, from the VIP balcony with a view of these hotties 
(So sexy) 
Sit wit a few of these hotties, 
I'm thinking of jetting soon and getting a room with these hotties 
(So sexy) 
Or jump back in the black van, we got room for you're friend, 
Now give me that lap dance 
(So sexy) 
Like a Paris summer night, Menage trios at the back of my car that?s tight.

Hey kids, gather around, it's Wyclef and Melky Sedeck
I got a story to tell, here we go

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof
One night, he jumped out the car
And caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose

You can be at the party gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose

Hey yo, hey yo, my pen's in my hand, OK, what should I write next?
Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect caller from Jeff
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""
""Yo, I got bad news""
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the I'll street blues
""The friends will make you, them too can break you
They plan an execution like Fu Manchu""
""Who?""
""You know the character from channel 5 kung-fu (wahoo)""
""Slow down, man, Jeff, I'm losin' you""
""Hey yo, your cousin Rohann...""
""Uh-huh""
""Who used to sell bang""
""Uh-huh""
""DT's found his hand in the back of Bennigans""
""What?""
""In a plastic bag with a note attached""
""Saying what?""
""A million and a half or he won't be back""
""So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge, 12:00 sharp""
""If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp""
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?
Don't they know like Sting, I can turn this murder into art?

And shattered broken dreams

They left a mark on me
Don't understand the master plan
That only God can see

I need to know, I won't let go
And lock it all inside
I wonder why they say goodbye
And gather up my pride

And move on with my life

Kyle,"Every night I lie awake
How thoughts come rollin' in
Love is won, love is lost
And love's that might have been

I see the ghost of long lost hope
And shattered broken dreams
I know it's time to carry on
It's harder than it seemed

I've gotta let it go
All the pain is ripe
I've gotta let it go
And move on with my life

I've gotta let it go
It's time to let it leave
I've gotta let it go
And then I can be free

The times gone by, I can't deny
They left a mark on me
Don't understand the master plan
That only God can see

I need to know, I won't let go
And lock it all inside
I wonder why they say goodbye
And gather up my pride

I've gotta let it go
All the pain is ripe
I've gotta let it go
And move on with my life

I've gotta let it go
It's time to let it leave
I've gotta let it go
And then I can be free

I know I have the will to carry on
Life's made me strong
I've learned too much to turn my head away
I'm gonna stand

Brick by brick, I'll build my life again
And I'll begin to learn from all of my mistakes
And make them fly away
I've gotta let it go

I've gotta let it go
I've gotta let it go
I've gotta let it go

I've gotta let it go
I've gotta let it go
I've gotta let it go

I've gotta let it go
All the pain is ripe
I've gotta let it go
And move on with my life

I've gotta let it go
It's time to let it leave
I've gotta let it go

Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screening out the lane
Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)

Through the cracks in the sky

In younger dreams, I thought that body might be mine

You were a cold crush, I was a heartbreak junky
Now you're a mother, and I'm a flashback son
Yeah, I'm a wasteland, you've got all your milk and honey
And back then, I swore you were the only one

So disenchant me baby, I've been dying to know
How to give up, get out, stay gone
Make me not wanna go back to the girl that I had before
She was so sweet, baby, so sweet
Maybe I can reconcile what I ripped into
That haphazard, half-hearted love I was making with you
Yeah, I made it with you

But now the bars are closed, and the city sleeps tight
As I ramble home my wretched merry way
Where down was up, and feeling bad felt so right
I thought that vertigo was here to stay

We're talking hellfire, but at the time it seemed funny
When all the demons left the woodwork to play
With an angel, and a heartbreak junky
Stuck in their rock-bottom masquerade

So disenchant me baby, I've been dying to know
How to give up, get out, stay gone
Make me not wanna go back to the girl that I had before
She was so sweet, baby, so sweet
Maybe I can reconcile what I ripped into
That haphazard, half-hearted love I was making with you
Yeah, I made it with you

So when Eden burns behind you in the rearview
And you're off to find a stranger paradise
Where you can sing your own way out
Well, you know that I'll be 'round
With a sweet talk woman fading slowly
On a lovesick mind",Heartbreak Junky,2017
Kyle Craft,"She walked in
Her hands in fur coat pockets
She brought her best bad habit
She's looking for to kill

If not herself, then
Maybe tonight's boyfriend 
Maybe some sad random
Looking for his fill

And though I know I'm just some perk
She lets me hang around and watch her work
'Cause she knows what I like to do
And she knows what I like to see
And she knows how to bring about
A shattered heart that don't belong to me

This one's a rager
And all the cute girls hate her
And all the boys run terrified
From her powder-white toes

""Who's she?"" they ask me
As she stumbles past me
It's one of twenty different names
Depending where she goes

But I still don't know which one's real
She lets me hang around and watch her deal
'Cause she knows where a man gets weak
She leans in with a low-cut dress
She knows what I like to see
Her victims walking out the bar a mess

Now it's search and destroy
For the player of the playboy
For the walking apocalypse
And the heels she staggers on

She courts the shadows
She swings about the gallows
Rope to rope, she gets her thrill
And lays awake at dawn

But who could live that way this long?
I've seen plenty good girls go wrong
But I never seen someone like you
Burning holes in a four-post bed
Passed out with your knees all bruised
Your sleeping hand holding a cigarette

And your head never hurt so bad
Thinking 'bout the fun you had
What on earth did we do last night?
Why's there blood on the shower wall?
Who's that sleeping on the hardwood floor
And what's the number written on my palm?

Yeah, my keys are somewhere in my pants
But I ain't trying to get back home
Then she wakes up, and she quietly laughs
""There's a party tonight if you wanna go""

She said there's no salvation

Now stay to watch you break down
But I'm gonna have to miss your demise

'Cause your one trick pony's won out 
I can't take you, I can't take you
When there ain't shit to do in your town
I can't take you, I can't take you anyhow

You best get back to Texas
You best get back and find yourself some chic air to breathe
You say you're going crazy sounds like you're going to the same place as me
But girl I'm up on Belmont
And you, you're in the depths of suburbian dreams.
I'd stay to help you break out but you won't be back in the escape with me

The wayward angel, your promised land, they've burnt to the ground
Stone-drunk on halloween, the shift is like some trick to me
When a call comes from your balcony but no one's around
So pick your fight, break down the door, endless nights waging war against yourself
on the bathroom floor, spilling it out

Now I'm on the bed, her hair's undone, my face is wet
Her face is worn from empty years and bitter scorn and a Victorian love
I don't wanna cause you grief and I don't wanna take the lead
Hey little girl, all I wanna see is you getting off
Clenching thirst and heavy breath, naked as the night we met
You left it up to me I guess but I'm slow on the draw

So while the poor boys sit lonesome at the last call
and the shy ones stare down at their toes
I'll make way for that woman and the mean kingdom coming
I get tired walking these streets alone
And I call her my Bridge City Rose, yeah, I'll call her my Bridge City Rose

The garden on her windowsill, her crystal moons and family stills
jawbone treasures, beatnik thrills and blood-red mulled wine
The sweetgum hanging overhead, with books I bought but never read
Can I lay low here, can I stop instead and stay for a while?
'Cause I cant remember the last time I wasn't drawn in neon lights
Say come drink up the water's fine and the whiskey's half off

But before you find yourself torn between lovers
or you're stuck wearing yesterday's clothes
Best make way for that lady and her sweet spirit breaking
Fine glass against any old stone

I spent my time made my money
Now carting this shit home

But I'll keep your secrets here
Some shack in California
I'm shutting them out but gotta warn ya
Everybody knows

Cuz you've been out all night
Always talking at the wrong time
The barroom and the busted lamplight
Keep you company
And it's there you speak her name
But give in to the lips of strangers
Poor boy you'll never tame her
She knows your talk is cheap

And by the time that you go get her
By the time you that feel better
And by the time you realize the new you is a drag
She'll be rolling in new love
And you'll be rolling in the exile rag

So Shotgun Annie come
Look down your barrel at me
Take your time feel free to have me
Dying or alive
Cuz I couldn't stand to walk
Wild streets of New York freezing
Looking for a love that pleasing
To walk into my life

And by the time that herr door's closing
And you feel like your imposing
On that brand new boyfriend she has
She'll be rolling in new love
And you'll be swinging on the exile rag

The ghosts here ain't so bad
But I swear she talks just like you
Shows her teeth and walks just like you
Through the middle of the night
Knee high boots and bells
She doesn't turn round for me
Holds me close but then ignores me
Underneath the light

And by the time that her train's parting

Kyle Craft,"Well if you find your way out wandering, walking in a dead man's shadow
If you hit that quicksand running, count me out kid, I can't follow
'Cause I put to rest your revelations, I cut the rope, the tie that bound you
Still you ate that incarnation, just like the day that I found you

Oh, you still wear that smile, your crazy whispering denial, sweet nothings
I can't be the only boy who can see, who believes
You're a fake, you're a fake magic angel
You're a fake, you're a fake magic queen
Yeah, you suck life out of all that's around you
But you won't be sucking nothing out of me

So move along I'm sick of sad songs, feels just like some ear full of dare
You seen the part where I said so long, well this is the part where I don't care
To aid you in your black hole conquest, to hear you balled each boy in each barroom
Still you flaunt yourself in that same dress and talk how your magazines taught you

But you still wear that pout, your crazy words that in your mouth, just nothing
I can't be the only boy who can see, who believes
You're a fake, you're a fake magic angel
Just a gear in this fake magic scene
Yeah, you twist and you turn with the times, babe
You're a fake in a fake magic machine

So pinch me every time I dream
This waking life gets weird enough to not wanna sleep
Seems every time I see you I've got secrets to keep

Was she your last drag?
Was she the little piece of mind you thought you once had?
Was she the cure-all, or just the disease?
Was she the ransack, or the good denim jeans?

Maybe the bad nights
Maybe the deep wound left behind a spider bite
Maybe the head hung inside a toilet seat
Maybe the vampire searching for someone to bleed

Hey, it's whatever she wants to be
Hey, that's whatever she's gonna be
Out there roaming the night
Guess I'm the only boy she won't bite

Was she the wedding dress drenched all in gasoline?
Was she the new-age Jezebel dog treat?
Was she the warhead, or the firecracker?
Was she death itself, or whatever comes after?

Maybe a suckerpunch
Maybe the common thread
Maybe the gray teeth pulling on a cigarette
Maybe the absolute
Maybe the in-between
Maybe a fortune teller with no-one there to read

And she waits, and she knows herself too well
She stares at her hands, but still can't tell
When good luck comes around
She packs up all her cards and jumps town

Was she the trophy wife?
Was she the wanderer?
Was she the only spell in life that you've been under?
Was she the broken string, or the whole symphony?
Maybe the upright, perfectly out-of-key

Maybe a tar pick filled up with ancient bone
Maybe the footsteps you hear when you're home alone
Maybe the prize bird losing its feathers
Maybe the glue that just won't hold your shit together

But I can't find one way with you
You're the full circle nightmare making all these bad dreams come true

He was a day late, he was a dumb kid
He was a little less than what you like so why the hell did you go with it at all?
His picture's perfect babe but it's hanging crooked there on your wall for show
And now you've got to live with every photo you wish you could let go, too bad
The full circle nightmare never lets you have what you had

But what's a boy to do with such a whiplash woman?
I never make it through to you in time

It was my last night, it was my last chance
It was a warehouse party where I saw her spinning around in the dance, alone
A flash of light hit me right in the eyes then she was gone so quick
And the people 'round the punch bowl made me feel so twisted and sick of you

Kyle Craft,"Well boy you've got it wrong, golden calf or not, I bet you're still talking about me ugly.
I never wanted her to give me all she's got and I never wanted her to love me.
But just like you I was drawn to her eyes, just like you she went and left me.
Ah, just like you I can't forget the night, watching that pretty thing undressing, ah.

And you said she could run around with anyone but me.
I couldn't play by your rules boy and neither could she.
So I laid her down in a gossamer gown on the same bed that you did.
And the shadows played on the wall. And she told her closet talk.
It's funny you think I care at all what you see in me
You're crazy calling that girl a whore, cried like a baby behind her door,
Your temper tantrums settle your scores, shit-talk everything that breathes.
Call me whatever you need. 

Well boy you've got it wrong, golden calf or not, I bet you're too dumb to know the difference. 
You're talking like a saint, said throw it in the fire even though you're the one who built him.
Gathered the jewelry, melted it down made for yourself to go idolize.
But that wasn't me, I already jumped town, catching up to your runaway bride.

And you said she could mop the floor with any modern man
I wish I played by your rules boy 'cause now I know she can.
She took my heart in a parking lot from the moment we first kissed. 
And now I'm stuck in some foreign land between my girl and a waste of time
Aside from loving all through the night, I'm not so different than you.
High as a kite on the church pew there, so infantile in your wild despairs. 
I get it boy, you're the perfect pair. That kind of love it takes two. 
So call me whatever you do.

But when the party's over honey and your key to the kingdom
Don't fit the new lock
And everybody's shoving camels through the eye of a needle

Just throwing bottles at the Delta Queen
She passes slow like your memory, makes the bend
And floats out of sight

Austin, Texas, mattress on the floor
We'd buy some grass from the kid next door
We bitch of love as if it was a chore
but we made it to ease both our minds
First time I lost you was a mean curveball
Thrown in Las Vegas down a hotel hall
Why we stuck it out, man, I can't recall
Seems my honesty's always on trial

And I never once called you baby, I never once called you anything
I never once called you baby 
I always thought you were more to me

And I saw him coming with his suit and tie
His hair slicked back looked a lot like mine
But that was years ago and over time
Lost my scissors, my comb, and my style
And how he watched us at the table there
As we caught up on our when and wheres
Our escapades, our life-ain't-fairs
and how you'll be leaving with him tonight

And I bet he calls you baby, I never once called you anything
Oh I bet he calls you baby, I always thought you were more to me

And what went up the river comes back down
Maybe we'll meet again next time around

Keep both your feet out of the wedding aisle

(my life) my life (my life)

In my life, a lot of haters talking shit
And I might, expose you hoes you out this bitch
And I ride, with the nine I won't fall or slip
If I die, they still will not get off my dick
But I try, to survive like Destiny's Child
And I smile, cause they been trying to test me a while
But I cry, cause not all my partnas alive
But I smile, cause I know all my partnas with God
In my life, a lot of haters baller blocking my shine
I stay calm, even though I ought to drop em a nine
In my life, I make cash using hoes
And my Sprite, is purple so I'm moving slow
On my side, my dogs moving rocks and hay
And I slide, by how I'm chopping blades
When I drive, I got a big cup of syrup
When I glide, I ride with a couple birds
In my life, I feel like I stand alone
But you still wouldn't leave, out of San Anton'
When I die, don't cry get high for me
So you can feel, like you flying in the sky with me

I been through a few up's, and a whole lot of downs
I take the good with the bad, however the ball bounce
And lately, I've been walking on dangerous ground
It feels like my own partnas, don't want me around
Cause everybody in my crew, be trying to argue me down
They telling me I changed, and I'm not the same
But for the past three years, I've been saying the same thang
I've done a lot of dirt, but I don't brag about it
And since I don't rap about it, you don't know jack about it
People see me being friendly, and they think they know me
But just cause I shake your hand, don't mean you my homie
I got a personality complex, man I'm so complex
But if you come with plex, this ain't fun plex
I'm walking straight, but my mind's in a maze
The only thing that I'm afraid of, is being afraid
I done stared death in the face, I ain't budge one inch
He here beating up myself, and I still don't flinch
Somebody pinch me, I hope I'm dreaming
I'm searching inside my heart, trying to find the meaning of my life

[Chorus: x4]

Y'all don't know shit, about my life
It ain't all about the hoes, gold and ice
I go from down to up, up to down
In a blink of an eye, smiles turn to frowns
Kings get crowned, the rich get rich
Where everybody live, screaming life is a bitch
I ball in the mix, and keep to myself
I don't just want to be, another book on the shelf
A lot of y'all fakers, faking the game
I'm one of the real niggas, that's bringing the pain
I've seen hard times, so I spit hard rhymes
I've been around, different people of all kinds
And to this day, I got a few riddle friends
Too many of y'all, that's so fake and pretend
To be what you not, that's why you get got
Don't fuck with my life, that's all that I got

My life-my life-my life-my life, is all I got
Fuck with my life-my life-my life-my life, and you will get dropped

Feelin the slow groove
My mind is startin to burn
With forbidden thoughts

Strangers all around
With the lights down low
I was thinkin' maybe we could
Well...you know

I don't wanna stop just because
People walkin' by are watchin' us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
I'm not gonna stop no no no
I want you
All I wanna say is

Any time
And any place
I don't care who's around
Mmmm

Any time
And any place
I don't care who's around

There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,

I know this world will never understand 
Or return the love that he's been born to give. 
It's in the giving he receives. 
His pardon is in the pardoning. 
And in dying he's born again to live.

Says there You are.

There You are 
In front of me.

Sparked in the heart of the Cheyenne breaks, 
Only to disappear. 
Just like this memory of what once was my home. 
And as I move beyond everything I've known, 
You pull me near.

Kyleon,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

I bless 'em with my presence, never ever my funds
I got broads that's ghetto, broads that's seditty

With big ass and titties, on the scale a dime
But if I'm out of time, I might settle for a nine
I love money, pussy and sticky green
I keep a all star team, that love to lick me clean
I know they want me for my green, I'ma let 'em stay wanting

Do anything for her, as long as she ask me chick
Like flashy shit, DG Prada and Gucci clothes
And Victoria Secret silk panties, covers and ooh she knows
She never hang with movie hoes, dig dealers and X popping
She's not a bopper, that say she hop out of Lex droppers
She my sex doctor, good love she go hard in bed
Go down below my waist with her lips, and harden my head
I call her the warden in bed, she keep me on lock
Not only her, it's my game she keep me on top

Now you know, I fuck 'em and leave 'em duck 'em and weave em
Listen to they sad stories, never fucking believe em

Kyleon,"Yeah, huh..
[Kyleon]
Sometimes I ask myself, what is life like
What would I be without this rap, without a mic life
Or will I die young, like my partna Mike like
Won't get to see my girl grow, and see what a wife's like
But my life's alright, no I ain't finished yet
I just got started, I ain't ready to end it yet
I'm 24 years old, I ain't even beginned it yet
I just started having money, I ain't got a chance to spend it yet
I want to be a millionaire, but I'm losing my life line
My ticket out this ghetto, is for me to write rhymes
I know I can get this money, if I write rhymes
Opportunity knocked for me, at the right time
Cause I was losing hope, getting sick of this bullshit
Losing my faith, not listening to preachers and bull pits
God pulled my card quick, nope no more pain mayn
Sunshine for now, no more rain mayn

[Slim Thug]
I grew up around a bunch of gang bangers, and caine slangers
Stayed in danger, cause I played with strangers
Was born and raised by gangstas, taught by the hood
Proud of my block, everyday fought for the hood
Stand up kid, ain't too many did what I did
Saw half the shit I saw, or lived like I lived
When my mama went to work, my brother went to work
In the kitchen, pyrex shifting till it hurt
I watched him grind, fascinated by the cash
Patiently waiting, for my time to mash
Never tagged along, see I had my own gang
We had our own ideas, on how to get this change
We did our own thang, small time hustling
Some young niggaz, never asking for nothing
It ain't take us long, to peep what's going on
The broke niggaz was weak, while the rich was strong we got it on

[Lil Mel]
By all means I had to get it, I'm a hustler black
This rap thing what I dreamed, don't want to fuck with crack
But damn, being broke I can't fuck with that
And being po' ain't what I hoped, so I hustled stack
Have nuts have money, that's the code in these streets
And when my money got low, I was holding the heat
I'm just a young nigga living, trying to sip and ball
And even though these streets wet, I can't slip and fall
I ran with killas pull triggas, up out they stacks fo'
And if they broke, they hitting your back do' with the Mackno
Fuck worrying bout haters, cause that'll freeze em up
That's what the heat is for, guaranteed to heat em up
These streets bad and yeah lil' daddy, from has-fect
A young nigga could lose his life, over a glass set
It'll take a cell in a jail, for us to do some mad thinking
That's how it is that's how it go, I know it's sad ain't it

[Chris Ward]
You gotta know, that you can't take your life for granted
Cause it's a loaded game, out here on this lifeless planet
Smoke till my eyes get slanted, just to focus better
Thinking over pass times, when I wrote this letter
I just hope it gets better, for the future's sake
Trying not to make the mistakes, that I use to make
Been out in the streets, since the age of 17
And witnessed all type of bullshit, most have never seen
Damn near homeless, I slept on flo's slept in cars
Been through all kind of battles, nigga just check my scars
My backgrounds my resume, and my repitwa
That's why I walk the way I talk nigga, and wreck this hard
Please God, no more rainy days just sunshine
Cause me and my homies tired, of ducking one times
If I could I promise, I will put this gun down
But how can I, when I'm a soldier on the frontline",It's So,2004
Kyleon,"Close your lips and open your ears, for a change
You just might, learn some thangs
I don't understand your plan, let me get this right
You broke, but you grinding all day and night

You on the block pushing caine, with Jordan's and a chain
I know, everybody want to have nice things
But man, you must think the dope game is a game
Fuck around and have yourself, catching a chain

Better stash you some cash, for a rainy day man
Cause only God knows, what tomorrow bring
Better listen, I'm trying to stop a lot of sorrow and pain
'Cause falling on your ass, is a horrible thing

You better listen, I talk too shit too raw explain
Better learn from the mistakes, of the Outlaw gang
I been there done that, fought that won that
Lost that and got it right back, you better listen

[Chorus: x2]
Quit being hard headed (yeah I hear you mayn)
Open your ears and just listen (yeah I hear you mayn)
Get off your ass and do something (yeah I hear you mayn)

It's more than one way out here, to get that do'
It don't take a rocket scientist, to get that bro
You can get that fast, get that slow
Hit licks with that grass, with that blow

Or with that pads, spit that flow
Or gamble with it, try to get back mo'
Uh-uh not me, I refuse to lose
You either got it or you don't, and I refuse to choose

And candy blue's I cruise, cause if I snooze I lose
And if I get out there bad, I just use my tools
My mind and muscle, that helps me grind and hustle
If it wasn't for this rap, I'd try to find a hustle

Why niggers sitting on they behind, steady trying to hustle
24/7-3/65, my time to hustle
I'd be a dealer out here, I got dimes and shuffles
Kyleon, is what really defines the hustle, just listen mayn

[Chorus: x2]

You need to quit talking so much, for a minute and hush
Stop trying to throw down boy, why you in such a rush
You play the game, as if you got a royal flush
But if you don't cool off, you just might get touched

I grind against the grain, and your brain like a crush
'Cause for me to get mine, is a plus and a must
But listen, hustling ain't for everybody
Especially if you ain't got the heart, and you's a scary body

Oh but I know, you don't hear me boy
It's goin' take something bad to happen, for you to feel me boy
But I'm so sick and tired, of teaching and preaching
You ain't even meet me half way, it's like I'm the only one that's reaching

While you keep leaching, you goin' find yourself smashed
Pumped up, wrecked and crashed
You must of forgot my nigger, your future's my past
You oughtta listen, 'fore you wind up on your ass

[Chorus: x2]

On how, I got this cash
I sold zones bled mics, moved rocks and hash
I click pro long, had to get on these blocks and mash
You want your do' long, try to hit these blocks and mash

Be careful though, you got niggers that watch your stash
And the second you slip get off his hip, goin' pop your ass
Get a connect cop a Tech, take your prize in the dash
We balling now, hit the lot put your ride on glass

You hard headed not heated, when you ride on glass
Left it at home, but you need it when you ride on glass
Knocked off your feet you looking weak, your boys slide on past
Had a high class bitch, now you collide with trash

Now you the hood rat plumber, pushing hood rat lil' mama
Laid up with the slut, and caught the high five from her
Now you lying like a plumber, sick broke and in drama

Let the sun's light warm my face
Once again the times are changing
Once again I've lost my way

While the words of acient poets
Fall like dust upon my shoes
Greed has grabbed me of my vision
Turned my heart from higher truths

So take my hand and lift me higher
Be my love and my desire
Hold me safe, in honor bound
Take my heart to higher ground

I have walked too long in darkness
I have walked too long alone
Blindy clutching fist of diamonds
That I found were only stones

I would trade the wealth of ages
For a warmer hand to hold
Though the path of life is narrow
But it leads the streets of gold

So take my hand and lift me higher
Be my love and my desire
Hold me safe, in honor bound
Take my heart to higher ground

Never sure of what we see

Since the day you walked into my life
We've smoothed out all the rough edges
Of our sweet love and devotion

The price is high given life as a scale
Wondering where I'd gone wrong
And I know it's going to work out fine
When I see that look in your eyes

I never felt so good
I never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now

Yeah, nothing can stop us now
[Incomprehensible] some people say
That a man who thinks that a woman is weak
Is so wrong

'Cause nobody can hide from you
We both know something else is true
Just the touch of your hand
And I know we're going to make it

I never felt so good
I never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now

I never felt so good
I never felt so strong

For now and for always I'll dream about this time and place

It's really nice, nice and new

On the road to God know's where
For now and forever

Hold on to the reason,

If I could see the things I've never seen,

My life's a trial
I'm not denying

For a while, getting away
Before it gets any worse today

You're in denial
And that is final
You're not admitting
You should be quitting

Queens and fairies
And muscle Marys
The rough trade boyfriend
Who in his pathetic own way
Denies he's gay
Why can't you see?
This is a fantasy world

Think I'm going mad
How do you know if you're
Going mad?

Look at me I'm lonely

Look at me I'm sad

I'm not denying
I could be trying
A little harder
To deal with some of this stuff

Know what I'm thinking?
Less drugs and drinking
No cigarettes and you'd feel
A little less rough

Is that enough?
My life is absurd, I'm living it
Upside down

Night, sleeping all day
A dad with a girl who knows
He's gay

When you can't find the music
To get down and boogie
All you can do is step back in time
Ball of confusion
When nothing is new, and
There's nothing doin', step back in time

Kylie Minogue,"Shed my skin since you came in
Where do you end and I begin?
Awoke my senses yet you stopped time
You took me to a deeper high
The essence of my hopes and fears
Creation of my muddled dreams

With a peaceful smile
You are from the temple 
Won't you stay a while

Found my voice to have my say
You take me close to far away
And now I find and now I feel
The ordinary is surreal
Peace and terror all in one
My future life has just begun

Remember how you promised me, 
That life would always be good, 
You forget the fact you lied to me, 
You locked my heart and threw the key, 

I'm so misunderstood, 
What to say when all the words have gone, 
Promises, promises, 
What to do when all our thoughts have flown

Promises, promises, 
Remember how I gave my heart, 
And all at once we fell 

Apart, Was I supposed to forgive you, 
You forgot the fact you said to me, 
That we were for eternity, 
You're so easy to see through, 
What to say when 

All the words have gone, 
Promises, promises, 
What to do when all our 
Thoughts have flown, 
Promises, promises

Remember that I'm over you, 
And know that I will make it through, 
Hope you never forget it, 
The promises you made to me, 
Were really lies and fantasy, 
Hope you come to regret it

What to say when all the tears have dried, 
Promises, promises, 
What to think when all our love has died, 
Promises, promises, 
The promises we used to keep have gone, 
And with them all the words

That kept us both from seeing what was wrong, 
The rest is silent,

You can take a seat, do what you normally do
I'm about to let you see
This is what'll happen if you ain't givin' your girl what she needs

Can't you see
I'm in trouble?
Infatuation's got a hold on me
A little jealously
I'm not myself at all

I'm surrounded by confusion
And I'm lost in this illusion

You serenade me at the ball
Hiding from it all
Behind a disguise
Who's the man who's at the masquerade?
Wish I hadn't stayed
Just to drown in lies

Like the headline of a magazine, are you what you seem
Because I'm losing my belief?
Can I make it when there's so much doubt
Someone, help me out 'cause I'm in too deep

I'm surrounded by confusion
And I'm lost in this illusion

Follow my dreams into distant lands
Blowing in the winds over shifting sands

I'm in too deep

And I'm lost in this illusion
I'm surrounded by confusion
I'm so lost in this illusion",Illusion,2010

Forse noi non siamo fatti per cambiare
Forse noi non lo saremo mai
Ma non è principio imprescindibile
Di ciò che sei per me

And when the nighttime's falling and my
Eyes are closing you appear.
And buried deep inside is all the
Love that you don't know I hold.

Lascerò che sia il tempo a decidere chi sei per me.
Lascerò all'istinto e dal buio tutto tornerà.

Limpido (limpido)
Limpido

Yes, at times,
You found it hard to understand me
Shaping how you wanted me to be.
I'm still here while fragments of the past return
And it's not what you think.

E so che sostenere il colpo non sarà mai facile
Ma so che non importa in fondo ciò che penserai di me.

Letting go, no more fighting,
Time will show you what you mean to me.
Letting go free my instincts from the darkness I will re-emerge.

Lascerò (lascerò) che sia il tempo a decidere chi sei per me.

I simply want him more because he looks the other way

Just the same as a dog is to man.

That I got from all of the prayers and what it meant,
I was gonna cancel then I realized

Now I see it clearer, my best friend is a mirror look behind me

Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle

Don't think i have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause 'tis the season

Completions and connections left
From last year, ski shopping, counter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
(Most of '81 past along those lines)
So deck those halls and trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chill this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow, get this winter over with
Flash back, to spring time, sun again (why?)
Would have been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course 'till summer time
Out to the beach to his boat could have joined him
No this time, it was me, sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendars just one page
Of course I am excited

Not to do too much about it

Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's r-s-v-p

It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go, (I'm sorry)
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way, unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

Cool
A&P has provided me with the world's smallest turkey
All ready in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn, guess what I forgot?
So on with the boots back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear?
In the line is that guy
I've been chasing all year
(I'm spending this one alone) he said
(Need a break this year's been crazy)
I said me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale to a very happy ending

I know moving on is never easy
Wish my heart could change like the seasons
Someone send a happy end
To my winter's tale

Now I'm building me a great big snowman
When I hold him we'll be two hearts frozen
All alone, I'll keep him cold
To make sure that he stays

I am doing my very best but now I face the hardest test
As I've no festive cheer

Yeah, at Christmas, I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me, evergreen
It's a time of joy, but for me it's bittersweet

At Christmas, I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be, c'est la vie
Yeah, I've spent all year wishing you were here at

Can't help but think about you when I'm all alone

I'd be in Christmas heaven
If only you were present
Maybe you're somewhere out there on your way to me

Yeah, one day I might get it right
Am I ready for tonight?
Yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
Stuck, can't get you off my mind

I don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling

A very good place to start
When you read you begin with A-be-see
When you sing you begin with do-re-mi

Do-re-mi, do-re-mi

Ray, a drop of golden sun

That will bring us back to Do (oh-oh-oh)

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
So-do!

Now children, do-re-mi-fa-so and so on
are only the tools we use to build a song
Once you have these notes in your heads
you can sing a million different tunes by mixing them up
Like this

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re

Can you do that?

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
So Do La Ti Do Re Do
So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Now, put it all together

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re, So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Good!

But it doesn´t mean anything

You can sing most anything

To say goodbye

Cuckoo!

No need for talking
Its by your side

I watch the sun fill up the room
The world it flowers begin to bloom
You're moving like the world a lover could do
I need the rest of my life to get over you

Here comes heaven now before you
I was feeling lost inside
Here comes heaven now you've touched me
I can't feel, I can't breathe, I can't love, I can't fly.

Honey pours into the jar
Shepherd moods hug every star
You hold me close and feel me like a glove
I see your name in skies above

Water melts into the sand
My bodies shaking in your hand
To hear you say that I'm your destiny girl
Spend the rest of your life
Rocking my world

Here comes heaven now before you
I was feeling lost inside
Here comes heaven now you touch me
I can't feel, I can't breathe, I can't fly.

And when you smile that way
A simple word you say
It hits me every time
I can't believe you're mine
My loneliness is just a memory
Its only in your arms I wanna be

You're moving like the world a lover could do
I take the rest of my life and spend it with you

Kym Marsh,"Setting up my battlements
Waiting for the guilt to come
Like armies have intent
Turning me to face someone
Who looks a million loving nights
And every stolen glance pulls me in deeper

lay off my back and look at stars
Think of all the love we gave
He writes it down for me
But I've already turned the page
And I feel the ground beneath me give
Close around my eyes and I am sleepy

where in my life did this begin
What happens now
If I admit

I'm tempted by your touch
I'm tempted by your moves
I don't know where to look
Don't wanna have to choose
Coz I'm tempted and I know
Where this is leading to
If I surrender now
If I give in to you
Give in to youuuu
Give in to youuuu

like water through my hands
Your propositions come
He's writing in the sand
I'm staring at the sun

and promises and memories
All dance before my eyes
But have no meaning

where in my life
Is this gona end?
Where do we go
If I admit

I'm tempted by your touch
I'm tempted by your moves
I don't know where to look
Don't wanna have to choose
Coz I'm tempted and I know
What this is leading to
If I surrender now
If I give in to you
Give in to youuuu
Give in to youuuu

I don't wana hear the question
I'm scared of my confession
Ill save it for another day
Ohhh
Can't even deal with maybe
Coz nothings gona save me
Ever hear me say
That I'm tempted

I'm tempted by your touch
I'm tempted by your moves
I don't know where to look
Don't wanna have to choose

Je chante la foudre
Pour que tu raisonnes
À l'Hymne à l'amour

Tu dessines sur les murs ce que l'on ne voit pas

J'ai vu notre futur rouler entre tes doigts
Et rougir la lune quand elle s'adresse à toi

Dans l'air du temps
Tu te balances
Comme l'eau qui danse
À contre-courant

Tout le monde y pense
Mais personne ne bouge
Quand on n'sait faire que des tops 5 de tout

Il y a des notes d'espoir, des images qui saturent

Kyo-I,"Je croyais avoir tout vu
D'un monde fragile et clair
Traversant les rues
Frôlant quelques vies

Elle vibre un peu, je tremble
Je ne l'impressionne pas, je pense
Dans son voyage, elle m'emporte
Et elle dort d'un sommeil en or

Elle mord mes lèvres et mon cou
Alors, je tombe à genoux
Sous ses cils, elle me fait rire
Moi je n'ai plus d'incisives
Elle se joue, elle se joue de nous

The future isn't what it used to be

Flow on, river of time

It's fate that guides me around the bend

Kyoko,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

And now I sit and wonder night and day

Kyper,"Tic Tac Toe is a game I used to play.
When I was little I used to say
I got the X and I got the O.
It don't matter cause it's Tic-Tac--Toe.

Now I'm a little bit older.
I like to play just a little bit bolder.
I like gettin' girls and givin' em pearls
And their legs across my shoulders.

I love to go to the disco.
See a fly girl and say hello.
They just look me in the eye and pass right by
With that booty shakin like Jello.

I like to speak cause that's bein' nice.
It makes me mad when I have to speak twice.
But that's the game that girls like to play
It's just Tic-Tac-Toe and roll the other way.

[Chorus]
X, and O. As in yes, and no.
X, and O. As in sex, maybe so.

X is for yes and O is for no.
X is for sex or maybe so.
You might get some if you play this game.
All girls love it but smooth is their game.

That's why they just walk right by.
Laughin, gigglin, shakin that pie.
Girls are what you what when you come up to them,
So don't play dumb and try to school em.

That's when you got to be real cool.
Jump in the biz and act a fool.
Pull out the portable car phone.
Next thing you know you'll be drivin' em home.

On the way there you're thinkin' bout one thing.
Girls ain't dumb they know you want the wild thing.
You through the X and go for the kiss.
They throw the O and go for the dis.

Do you want to play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you want to play Tic-Tac-Toe?

I met this girl by the name of Judy.
Kind of cute with a real nice booty.
Hard to get and likes to play tough
Cause she knows I want the funky stuff.
When I spoke, she wouldn't even speak
Til she saw me in the biz that week.
Took her to the movies and bought her a treat.
Went to my house and made the bed squeak.

Yeah that Judy puts up a fight
But I won with the X cause I rolled that night.
Just when things started to feel good
We rolled a little fast and we broke the wood.
My dad got up cause he heard some knockin'.
Thought it was a crook me and Judy was rockin'.
Came to my room opened up the door

I woke up this morning and hear the newsflash
They said it happened down at City Hall
He had his wife with I'm from the crowd made him fall
It was chaos and pandemonium blood covered up the podium
Covered his face, and wouldn't show me him
I had to see if it was true
Secret service was mad nervous, so was the boys in blue
Scatterin', like rats and ants, with the lights on
Man hunt the suspect all night long
Interrupted episodes, every channel show
Barricaded the city and blocked every road
Jakes in riot gear, blacks smilin' it is
Reporters cryin out in the street, ?""It ain't Rudy!""?
He ain't dead off, somebody blew his head off and skated out
Commissioner live on channel five when they announced his death
Wifey was stressed, she was right there
She stated: it was like a nightmare
One-time, was combing the streets, had the whole force on the beat
Flyin' in cars and on feet
The D's came through stompin'
Ghetto birds had the projects lookin' like Compton with marksmen
With dirty thirties out the window
I'm in my room smokin' boom, playin' Nintendo, high off the indo
Who shot Rudy?

From courthouse to your house
Rich house to poor house
QB to Shaolin, Brooklyn Long Island
BX to Money Makin', YO and New Ro
The news final, yo, who shot Rudy?

They speculated it was mob related
Every wise guy with mafia ties, interrogated for lies
Every king and yeta, had the linguistics
Snatchin' they gats for ballistics and expert statistics
Were drawn out, gang unit was all worn out
Investigatin' his body and everybody else
Whoever gave threats, made bets or wages
Cash donators from the campaign stages
Cab drivers and frank vendors who protested
Were roughed up like Abner, gettin broom molested
Sharp lawyer suit-breasted, double-breasted reporters
Was mobbin' daughters and other mourners
Pushin' cameras away, blockin' the sights
Had the riot squad at Washington Heights
Kennedy Airport, stoppin' flights, niggaz was tight
Cause the couldn't sell a dime all night, but that was alright
The devil died and nobody cried
They was real like some Jews celebratin' when the pharaohe got killed
Glasses of Henny were spilled and we got twisted
Smokin' blunts on the corner like we used to cause we lived it
Knowin' he was gone for good ???, it got me thinkin'
Ay-yo, where the fuck Dinkens?
And Harlem World, Shaolin to Brownsville
Did Sharpton and Farrakhan make the shit real?
Was it Khalel? you know he keep mad steel
Did the Bloods or the Crips smoke Rudy on the hill

I'm the queen of spades
A ruler of hearts, I shoot the moon
I take my trips right from the start

I'm a sucker for love
Joker running wild
My heart it can break
Ooh, it can break
Frail as a child

Whatever it is, it is
Whatever will be, it's gonna be
Whoever you are, you are
But those games that you play
Don't cha play 'em with me

You're a visionary dreamer
A fool, leaving things to chance
Love is a hazard, ooh, such a hazard
When you flirt with romance

It's like shootin' the dice
Flip a coin in the air
You running on luck
Odds are against you
You're not playing fair

Whatever it is, it is
Whatever will be, it's gonna be
Whoever you are, you are
But those games that you play
Don't cha play 'em with me

Stacking a deck, dealing the cards
Watch what you take
Standing on love

J'suis rien qu'emmerdeuse,
C’est rien, je t'aime. 

Jouer les songes 
D'une nuit d'été,
Et ses violons, 
A l'heure d'hiver,
Comme un mensonge 
Maquillé,

Ou la prière.

Se fabriquer 
Juste ce qu'il faut 
De mystère.

L,"Mon frère, mon petit,
Si le ciel est superbe,
Quand il est vert de gris
Mais que tes yeux s’y perdent,

Viens vite me retrouver
Dans ma chambre en secret,
Je saurai leur rappeler
La couleur qu’ils avaient,

S’ils souffrent d’amnésie,
J’teindrai mes murs en bleu
Pour leur faire un abris,
On s’ra que tous les deux…

Mon frère, mon frère
Mon frère, mon petit,
Si le ciel est superbe,
Quand il est vert de gris
Mais que tes yeux s’y perdent,

J’ouvrirai les cartons 
Où je range mes souv’nirs,
On r’trouvera nos sourires 
Et nos vieilles chansons.

Si tu t’en souviens pas,
Je relierai pour toi
Nos lettres et nos saisons,
Tu t’étonneras peut-être…

Mon frère, mon frère
Mon frère, mon petit,
Si le ciel est superbe,
Quand il est vert de gris
Mais que tes yeux s’y perdent,

J’me souviendrai pour toi
Des choses qu’on disait pas,
Quand on est tout petit,
Comme on était nous deux,
Les mots doux, les aveux,
Les baisers dans le cou,
J’ai des photos de nous
Et on n’a pas vieilli…

L,"J’attends que l’été soit passé,
Orage et idylle insensés,
Que les enfants se taisent enfin,
J’veux seulement qu’on soit demain.

Je veux des matins indolores,
Des nuages pâles, sans presage,
Des bleus délavés, incolores,
Je veux qu’on rentre de voyage.

Je ne veux pas de bords de mer,
Je ne veux pas de grand soleil.
La couleur du ciel m’indiffère
Sans toi, tout est toujours pareil,
Les heures d’ennui ou les nuits fauves, 
Pareilles, pareilles
Les jours de pluie, pareils
Le rouge, le mauve, pareils…

Je rêve au calme de l’hiver,
À des gris tendres et monotones,
Tu sais, l’automne me désespère
J’attends que le jour déraisonne.

Je me souviens de tout
Ces talons crève-cœur
Et l’odeur de ton cou
Les trottoirs qui luisaient

Ta peau de nacre noire
La courbe de ton cul.
Ce bruit des bracelets 
Que tu cales à tes pas
Qui écrivaient chaque fois
Mon cœur en pointillé,
Et puis tes yeux surtout
Et leur drôle de lueur
Ma p’tite, ma douceur
Je me souviens de tout


Il faisait presque nuit
Et j’ai juré au ciel
Que t’étais pour ma vie
Une patrie nouvelle
Je voulais tout apprendre
Tes rires, ton drapeau
Les marques sur ta peau
J’avais mon cœur à vendre
J’ai oublié mon nom
Pour m’rapp’ler tes chansons
J’laissais mes souv’nirs veufs
Pour toi, pour être neuf
Amnésique en exil 
Et déjà patriote

Jusqu’à c’que tu m’adoptes

J’voudrais juste te r’trouver 
J’peux pas croire qu’ils soient fous
Pour t’avoir embarquée
Sans qu’je puisse te r’parler
Faut qu’je t’dise que mon corps
Ne peut pas t’oublier
Et que je porte encore
Sur ma peau tes baisers.
Je suis tous les tapins 
Aux parfums truandés

And i soak my pillow when i weep
I drop my tears

I remember when we danced
Then world fell away but my heart held to you.
I remember when we fell in love
I close my eyes. i can still believe you're here.
I remember when you left.
I cried as i prayed i would soon forget you.
I never will. i never will.

With loneliness, i wonder 'round in shame
As memories of you run down like rain.
Asleep at night i still call out your name.
As the storm clouds beat a cold refrain
Against my window pane.

But is it even worthwhile?
I said was it all worth it, baby?

I ain't even tryin' to get over my baby
No, no, no....

L,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

*Talking till the End*",Intro,1997
L,"Just cause this is the end 
Don't mean it gotta be over 
Shoot we friends now, partna 
Ooh based on a true story

Hope you feel what I go through 
Cause I'm just like you 
Home girls and relationships

Can not forget the kids
