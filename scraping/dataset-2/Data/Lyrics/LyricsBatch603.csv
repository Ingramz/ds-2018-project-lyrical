Linda Ronstadt,"Look at this face I know the years are showing
Look at this life I still don't know where it's going

I don't know much but I know I love you
That may be all I need to know

Look at these eyes they never seen what matters
Look at these dreams so beaten and so battered

I don't know much but I know I love you
That may be all I need to know

So many questions still left unanswered
So much I've never broken through
And when I feel you near me,sometimes I see so clearly
That only truth I'll never know is me and you

Look at this man so blessed with inspiration
Look at this soul still searching for salvation

I don't know much but I know I love you
That may be all I need to know

I don't know much but I know I love you
That may be all I need to know

I don't know much but I know I love you
That may be all there is to know",Don't Know Much,1989
Linda Ronstadt,"Deep down inside
I know I still love him
But he'll never know
Cause I'll never tell
 
I'll confide that I'm thinking of him
And wishing him well
I can't walk up to him and say to him
 
Baby, what you been doing
I still love you like I did
You know, nothing's really changed here
But being the way I am
I keep it hid
 
Lately I've seen
That look in his eyes
That just breaks my heart
He needs me so
To lean on at this moment
Oh why can't I walk up to that old love of mine and say
 
Baby, what you been doing
I still love you like I did
You know, nothing's really changed here
But being the way I am
I keep it hid
 
Maybe someday I'll throw off my foolish pride
This ain't so good
Watching him die this way
Cause he's the same guy inside
Oh why can't I walk up to that old love of mine and say
 
Baby, what you been doing
I still love you like I did
You know, nothing's really changed here
But being the way I am
I keep it hid",I Keep It Hid,1989
Linda Ronstadt,"Don't need a Rolex or a limousine 
Don't need my picture in a magazine 
Don't need approval of a chosen few 
Tell you what I do need, I need you 
 
Don't need no fixtures, fittings, or phone 
I'm so unfurnished, I'm on my own 
I Don't need reminding when the rent is due 
I tell you what I do need, I need you 
 
I need you like a fly needs a plane 
I need you like a ball needs a game 
I need you like a pool needs a cue 
Need you, need you, need you, I need you 
 
I Don't need no covered kisses for company 
I Don't want no washed up dishes soft soaping me 
I Don't need no other fella, honey I refuse 
Tell you what I do need, I need you 
 
Oh, I need you like a fly needs a plane 
Oh, I need you like a ball needs a game 
I need you like a shot needs to shoot 
Need you, need you, need you, I need you 
 
Need you, need you, need you, I need you 
Need you, need you, need you, I need you 
Need you, need you, need you, I need you",I Need You,1989
Linda Ronstadt,"Shattered
Like a windowpane
Broken by a storm
Each tiny piece of me lies alone
 
And scattered
Far beyond repair
All my shiny dreams
Just lying there
 
I'm broken but I'm laughing
It's the sound of falling glass
I hope that you won't mind if I should cry in public
While I wait for this to pass
 
'Cause sweet darling I'm shattered
Into fragments cold and gray
Sweep the pieces all away
Then no one will ever know how much it mattered
Something deep inside of me 
Shattered",Shattered,1989
Linda Ronstadt,"I was walking down the street
With a lot of not much to do
Wondering only if it was gonna rain
When this guy came into view
For a moment I looked crazy
And at first I couldn't work out why
Then something made me turn back the hands of time
To a careless past goodbye

Say you will change your mind
Don't be cruel
I'll be kind
You're so right
You're so wrong
So tough
So right
So wrong
You're so good

When he walked up
Me I stood there
With this picture in my mind
It was a flash like an old photograph
I keep with me all the time
Fished for silver in my pocket
Then I ran for the telephone
I dialed the number of all the reasons
Why you should button up and come on home

Say you will change your mind
Don't be cruel
I'll be kind
You're so right
You're so wrong
You're so tough
So right
So wrong
You're so good

Say you will change your mind
Don't be cruel
I'll be kind
You're so right
We're so wrong
You're so tough
So right
So wrong
You're so good
So right
So wrong
We're so tough
And so strong ","So Right, So Wrong",1989
Linda Ronstadt,"Where have you gone, my darling one?
Are you on your own?
Are you having fun?
Is it someone to hold when you need it bad?
Is it uncontrolled like the love we had?
 
Does a day go by like a memory?
Do you ever try to remember me
In an automobile or a crowded bar?
Well, I hope you're alright where ever you are
 
And if you are still within the sound of voice over some radio
I just want you to know you were always my only choice
And where ever you go then I still love you so,
if you're still within the sound of my voice.
 
In the dead of night, do you hear me call?
Somethings quite not right, no ones there at all
Did you make a mistake? Was it in your head?
Was it really me talking to your heart instead?
 
And if you are still within the sound of my voice
watching this video, I just want you to know
That it always made me rejoice
Just to have you so near
There's a place for you here
If you're still within the sound of my voice.
 
I am calling like the echo of a passing train the cries
one last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies
I am sending out a message like a ship out on the sea in distress 
but only you can send a lifeline out to me.
 
Are you still within the sound of my voice?
Why don't you let me know I just can't let know if it's wrong 
then I have no choice but to love you until I no longer have a will
Are you still within the sound of my voice
 
I am calling like the echo of a passing train that cries
One last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies",Still Within the Sound of My Voice,1989
Linda Ronstadt,"When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
If I know that she's worrying
I know I'd feel the same misery
 
We've been through so much together
We stand as one
And that's what makes it better
 
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
 
Just what she means to me, now
Oh, you just wouldn't understand
People can say that she's no good
But she's my woman and I know I'm her man
 
And if he's got a problem
I know I've got to help him solve 'em

Linda Ronstadt,"I beg your pardon momma
What did you say?
My mind was drifted off on Martinique Bay
It's not that I'm not interested you see
Augusta Georgia is just no place to be

I think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches drinkin' rum every night
We got no money momma but we can go
We'll split the difference go to Coconut Grove

Keep on talkin' momma I can't hear
Your voice it tickles down inside of my ear
I feel a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly beer

We got no money momma but we can go
We'll split the difference go to Coconut Grove

Voila! An American Dream
Well we can travel girl without any means
When it's as easy as closin' your eyes
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign

Just keep talkin' momma I like that sound
It goes so easy with that rain fallin' down
I think a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly beer, and

Mariquita she was called
The girl that lives by the river

Because I am dying of cold

Because I took her away

Linda Ronstadt,"El que me oiga mi cantar
Dira que estoy muy contento
Yo canto por divagar
Esta pasión que yo siento
Y que no puedo olvidar

Me acuesto pensando en ti
Y en el sueno estas conmigo
Y me siento tan feliz
Al sonar que estoy contigo

Hubo noche que soné
Que tu boquita besaba
Y luego que desperté
Fui viendo que era la almohada
La que de besos colme

Ya me canse de sonar
El sueno me hace sufrir
Quisiera que al despertar
Mi sueno fuera verdad
Para dejar de sufrir

He that listens to my song
Must think that I'm very happy
I sing to sooth
This passion I feel
That I can't forget

I go to sleep thinking of you
In my dreams you are with me
And I feel so happy
When I dream I'm with you

There was a night when I dreamed
That I kissed your little mouth
But when I awoke
I realized it was just the pillow
That I had so madly kissed

I go to sleep thinking of you
I'm tired of dreaming
This dream you cause me to suffer
I wish that when I awoke
My dreams would all come true
So that I could quit suffering",El Sueño [Dreaming],1990

Bésame igual que mi boca te besó
Dame el frenesí
Que mi locura te dio

Quién si no fui yo
Pudo enseñarte el camino del amor
Muerta mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodó a tu pies

Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Y que tú vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea nomás de ti
Bésame con frenesí

Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Y la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir y amar
Que es más que amor, frenesí

Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazón
Dime qué sabes tú sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo

Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Y que tú vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea nomás de ti

En estas horas de tristeza infinita
Cuando tu ausencia pesa mÃ¡s en mi vida
CuÃ¡ntos recuerdos
Llenan mi alma dormida

Aquellos besos ue quemaban mis labios
Aquellos cosas que temblando decÃ­as
DÃ³nde han quedado
DÃ­melo vida mÃ­a

Ya estoy cansada de esparar
Why de llorar
Why ya no puedo soportar
Mi soledad

why sin embargo yo te sigo queriendo
Why por quererte ya estoy enloqueciendo
Why poco a poco
Me olvido de vivir

Ya estoy cansada de esparar
Why de llorar
Why ya no puedo soportar
Mi soledad

why sin embargo yo te sigo queriendo
Why por quererte ya estoy enloqueciendo
Why poco a poco
Me olvido de vivir


En Mi Soledad
(In My Solitude)

In these hours of endless sadness
When your absence weighs upon my life
How many memories
Fill my weary soul

Those kisses that once burned my lips
Those things you told me trembling
Where have they gone
Tell me, my love

I am tired of waiting
And crying
And I can no longer stand
My solitude

Still I keep loving you
And in loving you I am going crazy
And little by little
I am forgetting how to live

Linda Ronstadt,"Salomé no está llorando
Los martirios de tus penas
Es mentira
Nunca ha sido mujer buena

Con humano corazón
Mujer falaz
Impostora de caricias
Tu beso es virus

Que al alma envenena
Mueve tus ansias
Un corazón de hiena
Con las maldades
Que encierra la codicia

Muher falaz
Impostora de caricias

Que el alma envenena

Mueve tus ansias

Linda Ronstadt,"Nadie comprende lo que sufro yo
Tanto que ya no puedo sollozar
Solo temblando de ansiedad estoy
Todos me miran y se van

To you
My heart cries out ""Perfidia""
For I find you, the love of my life 
In somebody else's arms

Your eyes are echoing ""Perfidia""
Forgetful of the promise of love
You're sharing another's charms

With a sad lament my dreams are faded like a broken melody
While the gods of love look down and laugh 
At what romantic fools we mortals be

And now
I find my love was not for you
And so I take it back with a sigh
Perfidia's won
Goodbye

Después un suspiro why luego el chasquido
De un beso febril

Tus dientes de perla labios de rubí
Dime si me quieres como yo te adoro
Si de mí te acuerdas como yo de ti

A veces escucho un eco divino
Que envuelto en la brisa parece decir
Sí te quiero mucho, mucho, mucho, mucho
Tanto como entonces siempre hasta morir

A veces escucho un eco divino
Que envuelto en la brisa parece decir

I heard the story long ago 
She saw the Queen of Heaven once 
And kept the vision in her soul 
No one believed what she had seen 
No one believed what she heard 
But there was sorrows to be 
And mercy, mercy in this world 

So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine 
Torn by what we've done and can't undo 
I just want to hold you, won't you let me hold you 
Like Bernadette would do 

We've been around, we fall, we fly 
We mostly fall, we mostly run 
And every night, and then we try 
To mend the damage that we've done 
Tonight, tonight I can not rest 
I've got this joy inside my breast 
To think that I did not forget that child 
That song of Bernadette 

So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine 
Torn by what we've done and can't undo

Kind of hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free

It's my own fault for what happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go

But you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean I'll never kiss your sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Just find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

Well, I know they make you sad
They make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me like you should
Folks got ways to make you feel no good
I'd guess they've got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
And boy, you never lied to me
And the part of you they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me

So you just do what you gotta do

It's too soon to know
Can I believe him
When he tells me so
And is he fooling
Is this all a game
Am I the fire
Or just another flame

A one sided love
Would break my heart
He may be just
Acting and playing a part
If he don't love me
Let him tell me so
And I can't hold him
If he wants to go

And though I'll cry
When he's gone
I won't die
I'll live on
If it's so
It's too soon
Way too soon to know

And though I'll cry
When he's gone
I won't die
I'll live on

You're not like all those other girls 
Who play with man's hearts like they were toys.

That there is truth somewhere 
And you should use your head.""

There'll be no returning
I crossed all the bridges
I watched them all burning
And now I'm a stranger
To a strange land I'm driven
Where all is forgotten
And nothing's forgiven

But I cried a river
A river for him
That's deeper and wider
Than I'll ever swim
The heart it will harden
The sorrow will dim
But I cried a river
A river for him

I think of him now
On the road I am taking
And wonder how long
His heart will be breaking
But he'll never hear when
The teardrops are falling
Or the sound of my voice
Or the name I am calling

But I cried a river
A river for him
That's deeper and wider
Than I'll ever swim

So weep for the sons
And the dear darling daughters
For the passing of time
And the parting of waters
For all who have passed through
This world long before me
To a far distant shore line
Where no one waits for me

He likes to play with you that's all
He's waiting on someone else's call
He's playing it cool

Beating your heart against the wall
Waiting for Jericho to fall
You hard-headed fool
Didn't your mama teach you
Anything at all

Or change a devil to an angel overnight
He'll wreck all your best laid plans for spite
You can't treat the wrong man right
You can't treat the right man wrong

Acting mean and head-strong
He'll sit home and wait for you all night long

I heard it on the telephone
A woman was whispering in my ear
And though I was trying not to hear
The message came through
She was someone who knew you
I guess she told me everything
I wasn't listening anyway
I know she had a lot to say
But nothing was clear
I only remember her voice
Above the sound of the pinball
Saying to me

You can't treat the wrong man right
Or change a devil to an angel overnight
He'll steal all your love and and fly by night
You can't treat the wrong man right
You can't treat the right man wrong

But I know that you've got your reasons.
These things that are pleasin' you,
Can hurt you somehow.

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy,
She'll beat you if she's able.
Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
Now it seems to me, some fine things,
Have been laid upon your table.
But you only want the things that you can't get.

Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger,
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home.
And freedom, oh freedom,
Well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking,
Through this world all alone.

And don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're loosin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, and open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you,

You better let somebody love you,
You better let somebody love you,

Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left

Linda Ronstadt,"Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us, never molested, though in the wrong
When death has come and taken our loved ones, it leaves our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it; farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother; live in the sunshine, we'll understand it all by and by
Faithful till death said our loving master; a few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful gates
Farther along we'll know all about it...
Yes, we'll understand it all by and by",Farther Along,1996

Into a river of tears

Why, our lips could turn blue shootin' the breeze

A warm blush of red and a touch of her knees

And I've seen the northern lights dance in the air
But I've felt the cold follow the first kiss
And there's not enough heat in the fire burning there

We said we'd walk together baby come what may
There come the twilight should we lose our way
If as we're walking hands should slip free
I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me

We swore we'd travel darling side by side
And we'd help each other stay in stride
Each lover's steps fall so differently
So I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me

Everyone dreams of love lasting and true
But you and I know what this world can do
Let's make our steps clear that the other may see
And I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me

Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead
And there 'neath the oak's bough soon we'll be wed
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees
I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me

Darling I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me

",If I Should Fall Behind,1998
Linda Ronstadt,"When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too
And your gravity fails and negativity won't pull you through
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they'll really make a mess out of you

Well, if you see Saint Annie please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move and my fingers they are all in a knot
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And my best friend the doctor won't even say what it is I got

Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice and she leaves you howling at the moon

Well, up on housing project hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim

And if you're looking to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man they expect the same

Now all the authorities they just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first and she left looking just like a ghost

Well, I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand beside me when the game got rough
But the joke was on me there was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough

He drinks too much and he laughs too loud
How can I deny him?

I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'

Of a soldier's life inside a trench
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench
I do my best to please him

He puts two roses in a vase
Two roses sadly out of place
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face
Playfully I tease him
Hold me 'neath the Paris skies
Let's not talk of how or why
Tomorrow's soon enough to die
But tonight the war is over
We make love too hard, too fast
He falls asleep, his face a mask
He wakes with the shakes, and he drinks from his flask
I put my arms around him

They die in the trenches and they die in the air
In Belgium and France the dead are everywhere
They die so, so fast there's no time to prepare
A decent grave to surround them
Old world glory, old world fame
The old world's gone, gone up in flames
Nothing will ever be the same
And nothing lasts forever
Oh, I'd pray for him but I've forgotten how
And there's nothing, nothing that can save him now
There's always another with the same funny bow
And who am I to deny them?

Linda Ronstadt,"Tonight my bag is packed
Tomorrow I'll walk these tracks
That will lead me across the border
Tomorrow my love and I
Will sleep beneath auburn skies
Somewhere across the border
We'll leave behind my dear
The pain and sadness we found here
And we'll drink from the Bravo's muddy water
Where the sky grows gray and wide
We'll meet on the other side
There, across the border

For you I'll build a house
High upon a grassy hill
Somewhere across the border
Where pain and memory
Pain and memory have been stilled
There, across the border
And sweet blossoms fill the air
Pastures of gold and green
Roll down into cool clear waters
And in your arms beneath open skies
I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes
There, across the border

Tonight we'll sing the songs
I'll dream of you, my corazón
And tomorrow my heart will be strong
And may the saints blessing and grace
Carry me safely into your arms
There, across the border

For what are we
Without hope in our hearts
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters
And eat the fruit from the vine
I know love and fortune will be mine
Somewhere across the border",Across the Border,1999
Linda Ronstadt,"All I left behind should come as no surprise
To me since I fell through the black hole of your eye
Only little things inconsequential I could say
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway
Silver earrings in Wichita
Beaded moccasins in Tonapah

But I had you, so
I just let them go
The flannel shirt I wore to keep me from the cold
When we drove from Boston all the way to Buffalo
The leather boots I bought so many miles ago
I took them off to follow you into the Ohio
Never did my armor feel so thin

Silk was all I had between me and your skin
Like Waterloo, I lost that too
And the gold bracelet with my father's name inscribed
On the back by the one who loved him all her life
The way I too could have loved you
The Spanish shawl I put across the broken shade
Of the lamp that lit the room

That last night near Cour d'Alene
Only little things inconsequential I could say
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway
Of all I left behind",All I Left Behind,1999

A million tales
I have told
A million more
Some of them
Must have been true
But I don't know anymore

But I'll never get out of your love alive

She told him that his song was something he could never sell
And I think he knew a change was gonna come
Still he lived too fast and he died too young
Well dying young I have survived
But I'll never get out of your love alive
I got washed in the blood of Bill Monroe
When he sang about the the blues in the body and soul
He believed in a God that could raise the dead
Still it's a mighty dark night to travel he said
I've seen a mighty dark night and I made that drive
But I'll never get out of your love alive
Robert Johnson had a hellhound on his trail
Drove him to the coffin like a hammer and a nail
It takes a powerful man to carry that load

You who've been traveling so long
Yes, you who must leave everything 
That you cannot control
It begins with your family 
But soon it comes 'round to your soul
Well I've been where you're hanging 
And I think I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy 
Your loneliness says that you've sinned
Well they lay down beside me
I make my confessions to them
They touched both my eyes 
And I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf 
That the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love 
That is graceful and green as a stem
When I left they were sleeping 
And I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights 
You can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous
If I find they have sweetened your night

And besides it would still be all right

Maybe a little of that wall stands inside us all
I shove my prayers in the crack
I've got nothing to lose, no one to answer back
All these years I've brought up for review
Wasn't taught this but I learned something new
And to answer the distant call
At the Western Wall
I've got a heart full of fear
And I offer it up on this altar of tears
Red dust settles deep in my skin
I don't know where it starts and where I begin
It's a crumbling pile of broken stones
It ain't much but it might be home
If I ever loved a place at all
It's the Western Wall
I don't know if God was ever a man
But if she was I think I understand
Why he found a place to break his fall
Near the Western Wall",Western Wall,1999
Linda Ronstadt,"Away in a manger,
No crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head

The stars in the bright sky
Looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing
The poor Baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes

I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my side,
'Til morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray

In Thy tender care
And take us to heaven
To live with Thee there

And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Was it the spell of Paris
Or the April dawn

In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces

The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut tree
The wishing well

I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.
When she woke up and found 
That her dream of love had gone, madam,
She ran to the man

Who had led her so far astray
And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun and shot her lover down.
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.

When the mob came and got her
And dragged her from the jail, madam,
They strung her up
On the old willow across the way.

She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam.

Looking forward to happier times, on Blue Bayou.

Where the folks are fine, and the world is mine on Blue Bayou.

With their sails afloat,
If I could only see,
That familiar sunrise,
Through sleepy eyes,
How happy I'd be.

Want to see my baby again, 
Want to be with some of my friends,
Maybe I'll feel better again on Blue Bayou.

Work until the sun don't shine,
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou.

No secret place to crawl
And there is no rest for the ones God blessed

If words unsaid could sway
Watch you melt into the night

Linda S. Collins,"The lady comes to the gate dressed in lavender and leather
Looking North to the sea she finds the weather fine
She hears the steeple bells ringing through the orchard
All the way from town
She watches seagulls fly
Silver on the ocean stitching through the waves
The edges of the sky

Many people wander up the hills
From all around you
Making up your memories and thinking they have found you
They cover you with veils of wonder as if you were a bride
Young men holding violets are curious to know if you have cried
And tell you why
And ask you why
Any way you answer

Lace around the collars of the blouses of the ladies
Flowers from a Spanish friend of the family
The embroid'ry of your life holds you in
And keeps you out but you survive
Imprisoned in your bones
Behind the isinglass windows of your eyes

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone

Even now by the gate with you long hair blowing
And the colors of the day that lie along your arms
You must barter your life to make sure you are living
And the crowd that has come
You give them the colors
And the bells and wind and the dream

Will there never be a prince who rides along the sea and the mountains
Scattering the sand and foam into amethyst fountains
Riding up the hills from the beach in the long summer grass
Holding the sun in his hands and shattering the isinglass?

Day and night and day again and people come and go away forever
While the shining summer sea dances in the glass of your mirror
While you search the waves for love and your visions for a sign
The knot of tears around your throat is crystallizing into your design

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone
Come away alone with me.",Albatross,1991
Linda S. Collins,"Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Oh like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir

So many things I would have done, but clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels the dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real, I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughin' when you go
And if you care don't let them know, don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now 
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud, to say, ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange they shake their heads, they say
I've changed
But something's lost but something's gained in living every day

Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
Many loved before us, I know that we are not new
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you

Now it's come to distances and both of us must try
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time
Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me
It's just the way it changes like the shoreline and the sea

But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie

When I am Lord at last
And your body is the little highway shrine
That all my priests have passed
That all my priests have passed?

My priests, they will put flowers there
They will kneel before the glass
But they'll wear away your little window, love
They will trample on the grass
They will trample on the grass

And who will shoot the arrow
That men will follow through your grace
When I am Lord of memories
And all your armor has turned to lace

The simple life of heroes
The twisted life of saints
They just confuse the sunny calendar
With their red and golden paint
With their red and golden paint

And all of you have seen the dance
That God has kept from me
But he has seen me watching you
When all your minds were free
When all your minds were free

I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

She's nothing like the rest of us

I don't know what that means

Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Isn't he dreamy?

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special

When I lived without you
I'm never going to run away
I'm never going to run away

I came to you when 
No one could hear me
I'm sick and weary
Of being alone
Empty streets and
Hungry faces

You're on your own
A heart needs a home

Some people say
That I should forget you
I'm never going to be a fool 
I'm never going to be a fool
A better life, they say
If I'd never met you
I'm never going to be a fool

The great Valerio is walking
The rope seems hung from cloud to cloud
And time stands still while he is walking
His eye is steady on the target
His foot is sure upon the rope
Alone and peaceful as a mountain
And certain as the mountain slope

We falter at the sight
We stumble in the mire
Fools who think they see the light
Prepare to balance on the wire
But we learn to watch together,
And feed on what we see above
'Til our hearts turn like the seasons
And we are acrobats of love

How we wonder, how we wonder
Watching far below
We would all be that great hero

Come all you upstart jugglers
Are you really ready yet?
Who will help the tightrope walker
When he tumbles to the net
So come with me to see Valerio
As he dances through the air
I'm your friend until you use me
And then be sure I won't be there

And I'm bent and grey with years
And all my companions are taken away
And who will provide for me 
Against my dying day
I took my own provision, 
But it fooled me and wasted away

Oh where are my companions?
My mother, father, lover, friend, and enemy
Where are my companions?
They're prisoners of death now, 
And taken far from me
And where are the dreams I dreamed 
In the days of my youth
They took me to illusion when they 
Promised me the truth
And what do sleepers need to make them listen,
Why do they need more proof?
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Won't you give me an answer?
Why is your heart so hard 
Towards the one who loves you best?
When the man with the answer
Has wakened you, and warned you, 
And called you to the test
Wake up from your sleep that builds 
Like clouds upon your eyes
And win back the life you had 
That's now a dream of lies

You'll win the lover's prize

All you beautiful babies been had
Who’ll be able to love you for
What you, what you really are?

Beauty, what is your face?
What has it given the human race?
All that it has given me is a longing for
People and things I could never afford

Ah, beauty, now that the walls of Troy are tumbling down
And poor Oscar Wilde’s verdict is out
And the Hope diamond’s up for auction

And what about Michael Jackson?
And I’m smoking again
In the morning looking at

Beauty, look at me
You who did line the apple once offered Eve
I fear you line the world we see
Filled with goodness only hidden by

Beauty, you make me sad

Lindisfarne,"As she played, magicians seeing all this on the floor,
Belly dancing beauty with a power driven saw.
Had myself a nightmare,
Didn't think there could be much more.
Then in walked Lord Borgaasha with the Lady Eleanor.

She tied my eyes with a ribbon,
Of a silken gossamer thread.
I gaze with troubled vision,
On an old four poster bed.
Where Eleanor had risen to kiss the neck below my head,
And made me come along with her to the land of the dancing dead.

But its alright Lady Eleanor,
Alright Lady Eleanor.
I'm alright where I am.

She gazed with loving beauty,
Like a mother to a son.
Like living, dying, seeing, 
Being all rolled into one.
Then all at once I heard some music,
Playing in my bones.
The same old song I'd heard for years,
Reminding me of home. 

But its alright Lady Eleanor,
Alright Lady Eleanor.
I'm alright where I am.

Then creeping on towards me,
Licking lips with tongues of fire.
A host of gold and demons,
Screaming lust and ways desired. 
And when it seemed for certain, 
That the screams could get no higher.
I heard a voice above the rest,
Screaming you're a liar.

But its alright Lady Eleanor,
Alright Lady Eleanor,
I'm alright here in your arms.",Lady Eleanor,1970
Lindisfarne,"When winter's shadowy fingers
First pursue you down the street
And your boots no longer lie
About the cold around your feet

Do you spare a thought for summer
Whose passage is complete
Whose memories lie in ruins
And whose ruins lie in heat
When winter comes howling in

When the wind is singing strangely
Blowing music through your head
And your rain splattered windows
Make you decide to stay in bed

Do you spare a thought for the homeless tramp
Who wishes he was dead
Or do you pull your bedclothes higher
Dream of summertime instead?
When winter comes howling in

The creeping cold has fingers
That caress without permission
And mystic crystal snowdrops
Only aggravate the condition

Do you spare one thought for the gypsy
With no secure position
Who's turned and spurned by village and town
At the magistrate's decision
When winter comes howling in

When the turkey's in the oven
And the Christmas presents are bought
And Santa's in his module
He's an American astronaut

Do you spare one thought for Jesus
Who had nothing but his thoughts
Who got busted just for talking
And befriending the wrong sorts?
When winter comes howling in
When winter comes howling in

Your tattered tweeds and walking cane

You dance your pants and sing with the Jew
Who knows your face from a different place

You just don't care

Bow down, in out, feeling fine
Drinking bottles of American wine
You don't care
You just don't care

And toast the feet that walk the street
From north to south
Walking kitten on a leash

He's still got a beer pout

The men who made the ships,
Searching for some kind of salvation.
With heads held high, and dignified,
The towns folk and passers by,
Held them in some kind of admiration.

[Chorus]
March on, Marshall Riley's Army,
Marching for your rights,
You've surely earned them.
March on, Marshall Riley's Army,
Marching for your rights,
The lessons you taught us, 
Who has learned them.

Soldiers in the front line of the struggle,
For the right to work,
God gave me these hands just to be idle.
Why has holyness the bishop,
With his infinite christian wisdom,
Like Peter in when the cock crew had denied them.

[Chorus]

And the yes men, and the press men,
In London Town all came down,
Brought with them the curious, and derranged.
And forty years has since gone past,
But you're still down there,
If you're working class. 
Can anybody tell me what has changed?

Lindon-Sherman Flute & Guitar Duo,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life,2001
Lindsay Crosby,"On a Christmas Eve a happy snowman
Stood and dreamed beside a cottage door
How the children loved their friend the snowman
And the funny fedora he wore

When they said goodnight they told the snowman
That a gift for him was on the tree
So he called himself a lucky snowman
Just like one of the family was he

The cottage porch looked beautiful and bright
The holly wreath was turned on for the night
When all at once it caught on fire and fell
He couldn't knock, he couldn't ring the bell
He couldn't run for help, he couldn't call
But then he had to save the children after all

He knew he'd melt away, and yet the snowman
Threw himself across the burning floor
How the children missed their friend the snowman
But they'll always remember him for
A heart that was brave and the joy that he gave
And the funny fedora he wore",The Snowman,2013

Who always wanted to
Be the one to stand out from the crowd
Always believed that she
Was gonna live her dreams
That what went down was gonna come around

For all the doubters, non-believers
The cynical that once were dreamers
One of these days you'll open up your eyes
And you'll realize

That girl was a one-time teenage drama queen
A hyped-up everyday wannabe
But she'll have changed her destiny
Now she's a somebody

That girl was a wild child dreamer
But she'll find herself
'Cause she believes in nothing else
Then you'll look back and you won't believe
That girl was me

Armed with an attitude that she knows how to use
She's gonna get there any way she can
Now she knows what she wants
No one is gonna stop her
Nothing's ever gonna hold her back

For all the doubters, non-believers
The cynical that once were dreamers
One of these days you'll know that you were wrong
Who would've known?

You gotta paint it colorful
Can make it anything you want
Don't ever stick to any rules

To succeed in what you do
You just gotta have no doubt
Just believe in yourself

And you'll realize

Sounds like she's singing 
Whoo, whoo, whoo 
Just like the white winged dove 
Sings a song 
Sounds like she's singing 
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh 

And the days go by 
Like a strand in the wind 
In the web that is my own 
I begin again 
Said to my friend, baby 
Nothin' else mattered 

He was no more than a baby then 
Well he seemed broken hearted 
Something within him 
But the moment that I first laid 
Eyes on him all alone
On the edge of seventeen 

Just like the white winged dove

Sounds like she's singing 
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh 
Just like the white winged dove 
Sings a song 
Sounds like she's singing 
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh 

I went today maybe I will go again tomorrow 
And the music there it was hauntingly familiar 
And I see you doing 
What I try to do for me 
With the words from a poet 
And the voice from a choir 
And a melody nothing else mattered

Sounds like she's singing 
Oo baby, oo, said ooo

Sings a song 
Sounds like she's singing

When it rains 
But the sea changes colours 
But the sea 
Does not change 
And so with the slow graceful flow of age 
I went forth with an age old desire to please

He was doin' her wrong in a bad way 
But she was good and strong 
He was her man, but he was a jerk 

He was in a hotel with Nellie Blye 
And the gun went rooty-toot-toot 
She shot the bastard in the heart 
And ruined his nice suit 
He was her man, but he was no damn good 

So they took him up to the graveyard 
And stuck him in the dirt 
Which was oh-so very sad 
And a waste of a nice clean shirt
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong 

He had no idea what happened 
He was waving hello to God 
He died from eating squirrels
And they laid him in the sun 
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

Lindsey Buckingham,"Written by Red Hayes & Jack Rhodes. 
How many times have you heard someone say,
""If I had his money, I could do things my way.""
But little they know, it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.

Once I was living in fortune and fame,
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.

?Cause money can't buy back your youth when you're old,
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a love that's grown cold.
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When life has ended, my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt.
But one thing for certain
When it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world

I think we are the demons

And winds lift you up to God, lift you up to God

You fall to your knees, you embrace the storm
You no longer care, if it's cold, or if it's warm

You live for the danger,
Oh like your passion and your anger, you don't let go
You like to be twisted, by the force
You like to be shaken by the wind
And this game that you play with God
You've been warned to retreat

You take it to the limit
When the winds come up
Crazy men, crazy women
Cryin' out for love
You'd like to save her
But you just can't give it up

You'd rather be rapped up, in the arms of a storm

Chasin' down the demons

Cryin' out for love

Jean was a girl with style,
Boy, heads turned every time she'd smile,
Envy turned her girlfriends' eyes green
Whoa oh oh Jean.

Soon days of youth slipped past,
Jean had to grow up fast,
Working when she was just eighteen,
Whoa oh oh Jean.

And though it seems such a long time we've been apart,
Forever she lives inside my heart.

Jean, as it came to be,
Gave her life for her family,
But her life never matched her dream
Whoa oh oh Jean.

Like a child warm and mending,
It kills the demons and it makes me sane,

And when I'm weary of this world I find,
And better days I could be spending,
The sight of you can make me feel so fine,
Love forever, never ending,
With someone like you.

I've heard some people say that love is blind,
But I believe that love is blending,
'Cause when I'm with you this is what I find,
Love forever, never ending,
With someone like you.

Nobody could understand, odd things that I do,
But now I know someone can, somebody like you.

Have no faith today

Where no one remembers their name
And nothing but nothing is free

Make so sleep and dream of me

Nowhere to go but down
Faces of glass all hung in the past they
Only come here to drown
They were long gone far gone nowhere
Else to go
Long gone far gone down on Rodeo

We never took quite enough chances we
Never had quite enough time
I did about a thousand dances but
Nothing would change your mind
You were long gone far gone putting on 
Your show
Long gone far gone down Rodeo

I'm going where nobody's gone before
Ain't never coming back
Going where nobody's gone before ain't 
Never coming back

That's just the way it goes sometimes
The price is a little too much
Two little children on reveille hill we
Looked but we couldn't touch
We were long gone far gone looking in
The window
Long gone far gone down on Rodeo

Said I was a visionary, but nobody knew

Telling myself it's not too late

I'm not a young man but I'm a child in
my soul
I feel there's room for a man who
is whole
And there's a need for songs that
are sung
For chances not taken for deeds not
yet done

I'm a madman out on a bad man route
Looking for paradise

Show you show you how

When the play is unoriginal
And the cast scrapes and bows
And the only way you can seize the day
Is to blend into the crowd
She says slow down baby slow 
Down now
Come 'round and get me I'll show you
Show you show you how

You can float downstream let the past
Be the past
You can wake up from a dream and find
Your other half
Resurrection will come apparition will
Go
And the shadow singer will stand
And linger
In places no one ever goes

When the stage is dead and empty
And the band had all gone home
When the lights go out what's it
All about
Sitting there on your own

Long gone kiss it goodbye

Of where I put my fist

It doesn't mean I'm not there
It only means that when I steal from you
I don't want you to know

Although the day is done
What a miracle that a spark lifts these candles out of the dark
Every evening, one by one
Until the end of hanukkah, of hanukkah.

With the jingle bells and the toys
And the TV shows and noise
It's easy to forget
At the end of the day

Fought so all of us could be free

And restoring life to the lighthouse
A slow motion wave on the ocean
Stirs my emotion up like like a rain cloud

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

A cab driver turned to skydiver
Then to survivor,
Dying to breakdown
A blood brother, surrogate mother,
Hugging each other, crying their eyes out

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

I'm ecstatic like a drug addict
Locked in the attic
Strung out and spellbound

I fought all through the night
Oh, oh, but I made it alive
The sun's starting to rise
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times
This fight of my life is so hard,
So hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times

A bad feeling burned through the ceiling
Leaving my healing heart with a new scar
A dead fire rose and rose higher
Like a vampire, up from the graveyard

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

Just to discover life where we all are

Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?

Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

pretending that I'm someone else?

this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

S'est pris au piège, De tes grands yeux
Je te donne en gage, Cette croix d'argent
Et de t'aimer toute la vie, Je fais serment

Comment ferons-nous, nous n'avons pas d'argent
Pour nous marier dès le printemps

He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair

Se ho paura

Alle cose che vorrei,

Divinely touched by angels; There was no time for lust

Fast forward to the future
Where the youth Them are a-changing

They're hearts blazing
Can't nobody tell 'em nothing
Their love is unstoppable

Overcome any obstacle
Together they will always grow

See, I was told all in love is unfair
One fee, one fare, done there
Fishing, dishing, and wishing upon air

Is do it your own way, the long way

And get close and be with the one that you truly love the most

His desire for a child undisclosed

Deep inside a fire took hold
The moment that the plot was shown
Visions of intermingled souls
Matching afros, juleps on a creaky porch

No regulations to encroach upon their relations Cantankerous kinfolks, damn

Linear Labs,"Ayo Kane found Logan lamping at Deluca's
Sitting with a little black boy, she called him Lucas, he knew it
Found himself the daughter of a kingpin
The ex of Tony Starks, it's a win-win
His seed, the grief filled up in his eyes
He kidnapped them both, for a scheme of revenge
Pillow cases over their heads, tossed in the Benz
No friends, no foes, only evil to expose
Let's make a video
Tell Lu I got his grandson and daughter
And I ain't lookin for no ransom
I want revenge, I want blood, I want his head on a rug!
I want him to watch me strangle his daughter
Butcher his babies, attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies!
M-80s stuffed in his ass cause bodily harm
This is just the fuckin tip of the storm!
Tell him to come! Tell him we need to speak man to mush!
As soon as he step in the building
AMBUSH!

At day break, the Delucas made their way through the main gate
Quietest cougars chasing wild gang prey
They cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps
They raided the Kane gang [?]
The look on Kane's face when he realized what was taken place
He was anticipating a payday, but he was faced with a melee
He sprained to his feet but his legs wouldn't stay straight
Afraid, he reached for his piece, Bang Bang! Bang Bang!
But wait, as if on cue, the Deluca crew called out, ""Lucas!""
And began shooting unison, maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of Kane
Blew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings!
Finally it was over
The Delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters
They shifted through the dead remains
The bedrooms, and the entry way
WHERE THE HELL IS LESTER KANE?!

Now what is this that stands before me?
Underneath this wack off coughing
It's Logan and her half beat offspring
I got the nod from Kane that I'll be enforcing

Kane's gang had no imply the Delucas had 
staked out the vacated building for eight days
They knew about his way in, the way out, the makeshift escape route
The hidden staircase, the way down to the basement in the safe house
Where to find Logan and her afraid child
In a dark corner where they were being held
They were blindfolded with taped mouths
No [?] arms and legs bound

But there's a double cross of course
I'm hearing guns letting off from somewhere else
I'm ready to get involved with the revolving [?] warehouse all by myself
I dive underground finding rounds

Standing here holding a knife, now I'm 'bout to take my own life

My spirit needs to be replenished so I walk on my soul and be delinquent

Lifeless, his body left stuck in a chair
It was time to become one, but my mind wasn't there
I wasn't sure if I wanted to walk this corrupt Earth
Smell sweat instead of fear, give up my powers
Be a simple man, but along a ruthless killer

Murderer, take lives like mine's was once taken
Or leave my seat in this cold world, my heart's aching

Man up soldier, no need to back it up now
I'm in a large space, beauty queens feeding me grapes
Jewels on, thinking clusty
Me and the father ain't rusty
What's the matter talking about you're not sure anymore
Did you lie to your brother Cane or died I die in vain?
You don't wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins
You a general, love the life you find in the city
Pretty women, lots of money, doing anything you want
Think about it, me and you is one force
There's no limit the way they can take it, time is ticking, jump up in my corpse
And be true living king that you are, you need to live again
So you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars
Drink the finest wines and dawn on exotic moods
Tell the people who never helped, dropping a little jewels
So you hesitating - I didn't hesitate but you

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Why did I leave her alone tonight?

I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,

There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor

Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

The rain then sends dripping, acidic questions, forcefully
The power of suggestion, then with the eyes shut
Looking through the rust and rot and dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

And the sunset creeps behind street lamps
Chain link and concrete

Floats on down the street till the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

(It starts with one) one thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

All I know time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Or wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

In the end
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so 

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know

Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

Mixed media slang, banging in your boom box
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish

You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an Emcee
With your lack of skill and facility you're killing me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility

I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
You're not an Emcee if someone else writes your lines
And rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
'Cause rock and hip hop have collaborated for years

But now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You want to be an emcee you've got to study the skill

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up

So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally you don't have the hip hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40

And your record company is completely missing it
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate
So in a battle you can't hack it, react with whack shit
And get smacked with verbal back flips

Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It's taken decades for emcees to establish this
You're new to hip hop and welcome if your serious
But not on the mic leave that to the experienced

Using the waves of sound the true master
Paralyzes his opponents, leaving him vulnerable to attack

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?

By the world's leading sound scientists

In space used to carefully attack and neutralize

And the question must be asked

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me
I'm with you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)

Ugh!

I hit you and you hit me back
And we fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong, I pretend the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you're close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

Or keep burning and torching my soul

Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far

To lose it all

Party control showing all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle

I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder
I brought you back of the thing
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it

A pig skin I never nerved you
You felt lever never pleather, real bringing the pleasure
By any means and means of leaving you teens
Holler for teen magazines but I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl

And I was forced to run, with you mocking me
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly
Remembering all those times you fought with me
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy

And now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said and make it expel
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't matter to me
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall

To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Linkin Park,"From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

We're stuck in a place so dark, you could hardly see
A manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
Duck away into the darkness, times up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture's there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up

Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs
And nauseated by the polluted rock that's all around
Watchin' the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows and captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes me by
And a young, shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rocks with antennas on top
Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The same lose, not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change, the box stays the same
And the figure inside could bear anybody's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday I'm hopin' to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again

From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture's there 
The memory won't escape me 

I'm here at the podium talking, the ceremonial offerings
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring
What's happening
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants, causin' urban collapsing
Bullets that scar souls, with dark holds, get more than your car stole
Some hearts be blacker than charcoal
For real, this society's deprivation depends not on our differences, but the separation within
No preparation is made, limited aid, minimum wage
Livin' in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspread like permanent plague
I'm the forgotten

In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up",Frgt/10,2002

I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekanetic psychology
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces, cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinite, let icon be bygones
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the guantlett with whoever that wants this

On highways write with road rage
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around

Devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics
Forth dimension, compact convention
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention
Ment to put you away, with the pencil

Shining with the light from the sun,
The sun doesn't give light to the moon,
Assuming the moons gonna owe it one,
And makes think of how you act to me, you do favors that rapidly,
You just turn around and start asking me about things you want back from me,
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger,
Sick of you acting like I owe you this,

Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Hey yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind
But I find myself in places with names but no faces
My memory races at speeds hundred degrees
My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the flames

All I'm trying to do is just master me
All I want to do is smoke a blaster beat
But something keeps talking to me consciously
Responsibly it keeps haunting me
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another verse
There's nothing worse the trying to pull yourself back up from the dead
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head

It's like a whirlwind inside of my head

The sacrifice is never knowing

A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall

That the face inside is hearing me

Foes that wanna make sure his casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's ""Money, Cash, Hoes""
He's from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
So fuck critics, you can kiss the whole asshole
If you don't like the lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if we don't play they show
They don't play our hits, we don't give a shit, so!
All these mags try and use our ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers!
I don't know what you take us as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
From, rags to riches, we ain't dumb
We got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

Now the year is ninety-four, in my trunk is raw
In the rear view mirror is the motherfuckin' law
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or (or?)
Bounce on the Devil, put the pedal to the floor (c'mon!)
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I, pull over to the side of the road
I heard ""Son, do you know why I'm stoppin' you for?""
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Or do I look like a mind reader sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo'?
(Well you was doin' fifty-five in the fifty-four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carryin' a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are)
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my papers legit
(Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?)
Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
(Aren't you sharp as a tack!
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or somethin'?)
Ha, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
(Well we'll see how smart you are when the canines come)
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

Now once upon a time, not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no God damn sense, try an' push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'mma get to clappin' and
He and his boys gon' be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' them
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mill' for bail cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharin
But ain't nuttin' sweet bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems bein' a bitch ain't one - hit me!

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

Shut up when I'm talkin' to you!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talkin' to you!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
I'm about to break!

Fagots running to the Po-Po's, smoke em like cocoa

Left holes through some guy clothes 
Stop your bullshitting, glock with the full clip 
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit 
One shot could make a ***** do a full flip 
See the ***** laying shocked when the bullet hit 
And hey ma, how you, know niggas want to buy you 
But see me I want to ""**** for Free"" like Akinyele 
Take this ride 'til you feel it inside ya belly 
If it's tight get the K-why Jelly 
All night get you wide up inside the telly 
Side to side, til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me

I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard 
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact 
That everybody can see these scars

What I want you to want, what I want you to feel 
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you 
To just believe this is real

Face away and pretend that I'm not 
That's all I give cause you're all that I've got 

Got a condo with nuttin' but condoms in it 
The same place where the rhymes is invented 
So all I do is rap and ***, imagine how I stroke 
See how I was flowing on my last cassette? 
Rapid-fire like I'm blasting a Tec, never jam though 
Never get high, never run out of ammo 
Niggas hating n **** cause I slayed your ***** 
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick 
And now you're, acting raw but you never had war 
Don't know how to carry your hoe, want to marry your hoe 
Now she's mad at me, cause Your Majesty, just happened to be 
A pimp with a tragedy 
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked her friend 
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again 
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, ""****.. 
There's a draft, shut the door ***** and come on in!"" 

I am, a little bit insecure, a little un-confident 
But you don't understand I do what I can 
Sometimes I don't make sense 
I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt 
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out 
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do 
You face away and pretend that I'm not

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Or wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how

I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised

It got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside

Aftermath, ha ha
G-G-G-G-G-Unit ha ha

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore,
Do you want more (more)
Do you want more (more)

Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down

Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight

Now what the hell are you waitin' for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more (more)

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar",Numb/Encore [Remix],2006

I got to say something
Lightweights stepping aside,
When we come in
Feel it in your chest

They panic and start running
Words on loose leaf
Sheet complete coming
I jump on my mind
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping
Healing the blind
I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways
We march to the drumming
Jump when they tell us
They want to see jumping
Fuck that, I want to
See some fist pumping
Risk something
Take back what's yours
Say something that you know
They might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated
Like I had before
Like it's stupid standing for
What I'm standing for
Like this war is really just
A different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater the rich
And an abandon the poor
Like they understand you
In the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughing their way
To the bank and cashing their check
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect

For a leader so nervous
In an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling
For nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world
Watching at the end of the day
In the living room laughing
Like what did he say?

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen

In my living room watching
But I am not laughing
'Cause when it gets tense
I know what might happen
The world is cold
The bold men take action
Have to react
Or get blown into fractions
Ten years old is something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he thought the ""next one could be me""
Do you see?
The soldiers they're out today
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic
At times like this you pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling
For nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world
Watching at the end of the day
Both scared and angry
Like what did he say?

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen

It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights

And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

This is something for your people on the block to
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need
Like Papa, who shot ya
Seperate the weak from the obsolete
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that

We swim against the rising waves
That crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more

So rest your head
It's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
And sings again no more
'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more",Until It Breaks,2012
Linkin Park,"Separate, sifting through the wreckage
I can't concentrate, searching for a message
In the fear and pain, broken down and waiting
For the chance to feel alive

Now in my remains
Our promises that never came
Except this silent rain
To wash away the worst of me

Come apart, falling in the cracks
Of every broken heart, digging through the wreckage
Of your disregard, sinking down and waiting
For the chance, to feel alive

Now in my remains
Our promises that never came
Except this silent rain
To wash away the worst of me

Like an army, falling
One by one by one
Like an army, falling
One by one by one
Like an army, falling
One by one by one
Like an army, falling
One by one by one

Now in my remains
Our promises that never came
Except this silent rain
To wash away the worst of me

Like an army, falling
One by one by one
Like an army, falling
One by one by one",In My Remains,2012
Linkin Park,"I'ma be that nail in your coffin
Sayin' that I soften
I was duckin' down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations
I don't have the patience

Before you even say it I know
You let your pride and your ego
Talk slick to me no
That is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sound

I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

What is it you want me to tell ya?
I'm not the failure
I would rather live and let be
But you can't make the right kinda threat to
Push me to let you
No, you can't intimidate me
You disrespect me so clearly
Now you better hear me
That is not the way it goes down
You did it to yourself and it's over
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sounds

I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself

You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself

I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery",Lies Greed Misery,2012
