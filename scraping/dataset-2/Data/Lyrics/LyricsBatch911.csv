Rearview Mirror,"Show me through your own life.
Don't repeat anything.
Don't need to hear it twice.
Never needed to be told.
Never needed to be trained.
Everything that I know I've learned from your mistakes.
So thank you for all the times that you messed up,

Because now I don't have to? So free to drift along with the wind,
Because I know what to watch out for.
I'm so free to look at myself on the in, inside.
I understand what it means now.
I'm so free to drift along with the wind,

Because I know what I'm watching for? One time, take a look at yourself, discover humility...
So free to drift along with the wind,
Because I know what to watch out for.
I'm so free to look at myself on the in, inside.
I understand what it means now?Hope you realize that you're worse off than before.
No one sees your accomplishments,

Cause they forgot about them already? So free to drift along with the wind,
Because I know what to watch out for.
I'm so free to look at myself on the in, inside.
I understand what it means now.
So free to drift along with the wind,

Because I know what I'm watching for.
So free to look at myself on the in, inside.
I understand, understand what it means.",Thank You,2002

Reax,"Someone found a letter you wrote me
On the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole
In your old brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant

I was so surprised and shocked
And I wondered, too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul
Just how I've been feeling about you
But they said it really loud
They said it on the air

Don't it kinda strike you sad
When you hear our song
Things are not the same
Since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear
Is that you love me still
And that you think
You'll be comin' home real soon
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, you kinda made me feel proud
When I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know
I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud
They said it on the air

Blow the smoke slow 
And holler fuck hoes

Nines grab the green weed exactly
One shot lives and daiquiris
My gat be stashed in the dash
Mixed herbs and hash
On a cruise for cash
I might bruise some cats
Spit 2 at you dudes that act
Like you can't be touched
Front and lose your cap
I incinerate guns after bodies I caught son
Never on the run stack mail by the tons son

Chorus 2x:
Yo it's that Roc a Fella shit
Hoes clothes to whips
Act up and get hit 
Give a fuck who you with

Locking down your strips

I live my life now like none of y'all fagots
You keep fronting like that

Tinted my whip now

Money spend now

Niggaz hate bleek cause I live through this shit
You niggaz keep hating cause I could deal with this shit
I'm a street individual 
Sold it all criminal
Weed just a minimum 
I'm a M-P emblem
Rock syndicate and flips in the block
You call it I lick a shot

And I was sure by now I'd make it on my own
But seeing you today
Took my breath away
And I still long to hold you now and then

Suddenly I felt myself wondering
If you might want to try it again
And though I wanted so much to hold you
You smiled and shook my hand

So I'll exist on dreams again
On days when we were lovers and not just friends
And even if I find another love in time

And roped real good
And tried to get his ranch out in the clear

He didn't want us kids to rodeo
He wanted more out of life for us
Maybe banking, or a lawyer
Or maybe even driving some old bus

Well that's when we took up singing
And his pride grew greater day by day
And I know his eyes grew misty
The night I sang up on the Opry stage

[Chorus]
Now his ranch is so much bigger
The the days when he first started
The grass grows now where none used to be
His roping got him started
Cattle prices made it better
And he's trying to get his ranch out in the clear

Five years ago September, he bought more steers and hung up all his
Ropes
But he often tells the stories about the rodeos he won and cowboy jokes
Well it's funny that the first big roping that he won some thirty years
Ago
Was the same day that I sang on the stage of the Grand Old Opry show

[Chorus]

Now he's feeding cattle
Toting hay
And branding the Y.O.
And his hired hand's there to help him
And she also cooks their meals when they get home
They built their ranch together
And listening to the kids sing through the years

Well they worked real hard 
And roped real good and now they got their ranch 
Out in the clear
Because when a family works together
They finally get their ranch out in the clear
Out in the clear",Daddy,1979

And if you come to me all hexed up you know I'm gonna break the spell

And if it's loving you want, I can kiss you and give you the shivering

The great divide oh that river's sorrow
We can't rebuild the bridge we burned between our hearts

We sat and watched the children play
If it was the heat or the noise

A move that could have made the wind stand still
He took my hand in his and said the words
That I never will forget

He said have you ever cheated on me
Has there been someone else
Is there someone you love more than me
Someone you can't forget
If his memory is opened again

I said only in my mind

How can I tell him
The time we spent together 
Was time between friends
There's just somethings I can talk about with you
That I can't just talk with him

The way she was looking every woman could cry
Then I saw her sit down with a lawyer 
And I knew what was going on

And bring us broken lives
And heartaches that never end

I was thinking of you
Would you come and rescue me
Maybe I should call and see

For a little way back when

Watching for your headlights
Creeping down the street
Trying to steal a kiss

His parents were Joseph and Mary
And Joseph's big ole heart was torn
Cause he couldn't find a decent place for Mary to have her child
But Mary said it just seemed just right and she blessed it with her

Represents the gifts that baby Jesus received the night he was born
He got all his presents from three wise men
Who followed a star
And walked a long long way to the stable
So everytime you tear open one of your presents
Think about that baby and say
Happy birthday Jesus
I'll open this one for you

Reba McEntire,"She looks at the clock, it's a quarter past nine.  
She hears his car as he pulls in the drive.  
Dinner's still waiting from hours before.  
She knows he's been drinking when he walks through the door.  
In anger he strikes out and she starts to cry.  
How much more can she take, how much more can
She lie.  

And she fell down the stairs again.  
But it hasn't happened since she don't know when.  
Was it in spring when she packed up the kids, or
Maybe in winter with his job on the skids.  
Oh but just like before she'll have to 
Pretend that she fell down the stairs again.  

A short time ago, she started 
A job, serving chicken fried steak and corn on the cob.  
She started out shy, but she ended up sure, 
That a ticket to anywhere could be the cure.  
But he couldn't handle her change for the better.  
She tried to leave him , but he wouldn't let her.  
He says he's sorry, he'd never mean it.  
He swears it won't happen again.  But she's so confused, 
She wants to believe it. She just wants this nightmare to end.  

And she fell down the stair again.

You'll need a  new car more than me, so I'll take the second hand.  
We'll each keep our own friends, divide the rest in two.  
The older kids seem to understand,
Still there's one thing left to do. 
It's over in the corner, 
Our little one sits and cries.  
And behind that swell of tears 
She's asking with her eyes. 

What you gonna do about me, 
What you gonna do about me.  
Is it daddy on the weekend, mama rest of the week.  
Will I have to make new friends, live on a 
Different street.  
Who's gonna be the one who tucks me into sleep. 
Oh what  you gonna do, what you gonna do about me.  

I gave her a hug, she pushed me away.  
I said in time you'll understand, 
And maybe we both will someday.  
I  wiped her tears, and said ""It won't be so bad."",

Somebody should leave
But which one should it be
You need the kids and they need me
Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in

He keeps everything but me

pain aside and I say to you with my eyes,

My heart stopped dead in it's tracks.
Across the room I could see him there,
A ghost from my past.
But he's too caught up to notice me.
She must be his new love.
I never dreamed that it would hurt this much,
It's just

I know how he feels.
How warm his touch is.
Oh how he feels.
How soft his kiss is.
And it cuts right down to the bone
Cause I let him go.
I know how he cares.
How strong his love can be,
When he believes it's real.
Oh I've been there.
I know how he feels.

As long as I kept him out of site,
I kept from going out of my mind.
Tried to believe that leaving him was some how justified.

We started out as friends.
You'd think I would have learned from the hurt before.

 And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh

Reba McEntire,"Red sun a-rising, over the hill
I've had enough of this desert to last from now until
I'm tired of living day-to-day and hand-to-mouth
This could be the day I finally find my way out

I'm gonna climb that mountain high
I'm gonna see what's on the other side
I'm gonna kiss this town good-bye
I'm gonna climb that mountain

How I arrived here, heaven only knows
Seems more like the kind of place the devil would've chose
To spend my life here, is more than I can do
I know somewhere down the road my dream will come true

What will I have to show
But if I make it over
Then everyone will know
I'm gonna climb that mountain high

Reba McEntire,"He says he loves her, what can you say to that
He's made up his mind and there ain't nothin' you can do
And as you swallow hard, maybe you drive all night
Tryin' to figure out where the whole thing started goin' wrong
And in the silence something begins to unravel
You never knew him like you'll be knowing him now

[Chorus]
Fallin' out of love and back into your life
Pullin' your heart out from under the knife
Closin' the door on all those dreams you used to know
Fallin' out of love and back on your feet
Turnin' away from that dead end street
Finding out that nothing feels as good as letting go

That's when he called you up out of the blue one day
And you know he thinks he's talkin' to the girl you used to be
So when you tell him he's just a memory
Ain't it funny how his voice cracks when you're sayin' goodbye
And in the silence something begins to unravel
He never knew you like he'll be knowing you now

[Chorus]

Oh and nothing feels as good as letting go
He said he loved her",Fallin' Out of Love,1990
Reba McEntire,"I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then Mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips then I stepped into a satin
Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood

She said here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
When she started to speak
She looked at a pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your Pa's run off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heel shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin' Mama what do I do
She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy
And they'll be nice to you

She said here's your chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out
Well it's up to you
Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown

Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back

But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly
What my Mama's been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow
That I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I don't know when or how
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame you know
I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

It wasn't very long after a benevolent man
Took me off the street
And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite

I charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
In an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrite
That would call me bad
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had

But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ear

She said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Your Mama's gonna help you uptown

I guess she did",Fancy,1990

That you love me desperately
Why did you wait so long to say those words to me

I think you should know

Tore it to pieces this morning at two

So I got rid of every picture you left

I close my eyes and I still see you saying goodbye

And she's been sitting in the lobby since nine

And time can move so slow

She says she's expecting company

Reba McEntire,"Bobby pleaded guilty to the charges that they read
As they led him from the courtroom, a young voice turned his head
A little boy, dressed in blue, was standing at the rail
He said ""I hope they kill you, I hope you go to hell""
They put Bobby in a jail with forty other men
They all knew what he had done, they were glad to take him in
They'd all seen the headlines about Bobby and his wife
How they loved each other, and how he took her life
Day after day, he sat alone
Night after night, they'd hear him sing his song (he'd sing)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around
I am not afraid of what people say or do

The little boy dressed up in blue grew up to be a man
When he fell in love himself, he came to understand
How it was that Bobby took the life they both adored
Cause Bobby couldn't stand to see her suffer anymore
He took out the papers from the trunk beneath his bed
And all the years just disappeared as through his tears he read
The stories of the accident that robbed his mama's mind
And the man who held her in his arms and chose to cut the line
And the one about the man who sits alone
Year after year, singing his song (he'd sing)

[Chorus]

The young man drove his car up, and parked outside the gate
They led him to a cold gray room, the guard told him to wait
When the guard brought Bobby in, the young man finally knew
He still missed his mama, but he'd missed his daddy too
And when the guard left the two of them alone
He took Bobby in his arms, and the young man sang the song

Daddy, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down

Should I ruin my life or my pride

Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?

You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

[Chorus]",The Heart Won't Lie,1992
Reba McEntire,"It's your call, It's her
Would you rather take it in the other room
She's hangin' on and so am I
Yeah, I know all about it don't act so surprised

It's time to end this game you're playin'
She's not the only one who's waitin' on the line

It's your call
It's up to you
And I won't try to stop you if you go
But if you stay tell her goodbye
I can't take another minute
I can't stand another night

Of wondering if I even matter
It's something only you can answer
Here's the phone, It's your call

There's no easy way out this time
Cause I won't live this way
She called here to talk to you
With a message that I can't take

Oh, I've got to know if I still matter
It's somethin' only you can answer

Reba McEntire,"I guess it finally dawned on me you're gone
Well maybe I can make it on my own
I don't stay up wonderin' if you'll call
And some nights I don't dream of you at all

Your memory's still hurtin' deep inside
That's something I'm still learnin' how to hide
Though this heart of mine has lost an ache or two
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

[Chorus]
Lookin' down the line sometimes
I think I see a change
But then I think again and think of you
Here and there I've turned a stone
But the mountain hasn't moved
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

I'm still afraid of turning out the light
And it takes all my strength to face the night
Cause that's the time I face the bitter truth
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

[Chorus]",Lighter Shade of Blue,1992
Reba McEntire,"The stars are way out of reach, they all said
Those are crazy schemes that fill your fool head
But it was clear from the moment we met
We could prove them wrong

All my life I heard that same old story
Dare to dream and you'll just be sorry
I might have given up my shot at glory
But then you came along

[Chorus]
We're not expecting this to go down easy
We're not expecting any sweet dreams
Sure thing
But with a little luck
Could be we'll be
Winding up the way we planned
Heading for our promised land
Holding one last good hand

Something's calling us I know you hear it
Day by day I feel us growing near it
But once you find a kindred spirit
There's nothing you can do

Oh, baby I'm not saying we won't ever stumble
Some days will be rough and tumble
You and I know that life's a gamble
But I'll
Bet mine on you

I need to hear it straight from you
Is it rumor or truth
It would break my heart in two
But if it's gonna be bad news
I need to hear it straight from you
I need to hear it straight from you

They all know her name
You didn't spare me any shame
I wonder did you even try to hide
I think that you owe me
Just a little honesty
And even though you told me with your eyes

Reba McEntire,"You talked me into moving in and giving you my key
You said you'd be a mess now if it hadn't been for me

If this is how you act when you give your heart away
Well, take it back
Take it back

You told me I was everything you wanted and more
Then tell me what you're doing now sneaking out the back door
You're bringing home flowers and a bottle of Chablis
You forgot I don't drink wine I know that bottle's not for me

Oh, you must think I'm blind
And I don't smell your new cologne
You don't think I notice
All the nights I spend alone

Well, I'm not one for sitting 'round in some ole pity pool
You think you got a ticket and I must be some kind of fool
I hate to steal your thunder but your playing days are through
At least they are with me cause babe, I got no use for you

Reba McEntire,"On a cool gray morning, I watched with my own eyes
As he headed out the driveway and finally out of my life
Oh I knew he'd soon be miles from my mind
So why should tears start fallin' after all this time

[Chorus]
How can a memory last this long
Will he ever go away
Even the stars burn out and fall
Will he ever go away
How can someone who left so long ago
Still be here with me today
Will he ever go away

Shouldn't I start living my life for myself
Shouldn't it be easy to fall in love with someone else
Oh why should it be his touch I feel in the dark
And will his voice always echo through my heart

Is this the real thing
And heart could he be paradise
Cause in his eyes 
Do I see love looking at me

Oh am I ready to feel what I've dreamed about
Love that I've lived without finding
Is finding me

To reach out for someone
And find there's nobody there
Is it weighing on you
Cause it's sure killing me
Tell me how does it feel to be free

Funny how love is so hard to find
And yet so easy to lose
Maybe in time this old heart of mine
Can learn to be free without you

I said I can't complain
Oh, I'm doin' fine

As the people rushed by

We laughed about old times

Reba McEntire,"Daddy used to tell me
If I ran too fast I'd fall and hurt myself
But the ice cream man would ring his bell
And I'd get there before anyone else

I'd see a puppy in the window 
And I'd run and press my face against the pane
And Daddy'd say slow down girl
After all these years I guess  nothing has changed

[Chorus]
That little girl I knew
Ran after you
But she fell this time
And broke her heart in two
Hey that's just like a little girl I knew

Back home there stands an old house
With a picket fence beneath a big oak tree
I can almost see the backyard
And a little girl with freckles
That was me

And there were dreams of toys and storybooks and 
Lord it seemed I wanted them so bad
Now 20 years have come and gone 
And I'm still chasing things that I can't have

Yes, I'm still that little girl

They find me dreaming all alone once more
Memories come around to haunt my sleepless sounds
Now's the time I must be strong
I believe it won't be long

To end these lonely nights
'Til love comes again
To drive these tears I cry
It's darkest just before the dawn
And I'll just keep holding on
'Til then
'Til love comes again

Somewhere someone feels the way I do
And like me they dream of the love that's true
One day I'll look into his eyes I'll know the moment's right
Until then I'll just wait
No matter how long it might take

So please have snow and lots of mistletoe
And presents under the tree

He'll find the note I left hangin' on his door
And he'll laugh when he reads the part that says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that man so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque he'll be workin'
He'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But he'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall, that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma he'll be sleepin'
He'll turn softly and call my name out low

Oh, he just didn't know I would really go
I would really go",By the Time I Get to Phoenix,1995
Reba McEntire,"Tear drops fell on mama's note
When I read the things she wrote
She said, we miss you girl
We love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack
I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

It's hard to tell the state I'm in
Where I'm going, where I've been
But there's a dream I've been following so long
If mama knew the things I've done
She'd forgive them everyone
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Can't remember when I ate
it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right
I'd be with them all tonight

Reba McEntire,"I know you're tired of being all I ever wanted
You no longer feel the love I have for you
What happens now, what will I do with all the memories
And the dreams of all the things we'll never do

But I won't mention it again
I won't think about tomorrow
Just let it happen
Live each hour day by day
But let me tell you before you go, how much I love you
Then I won't mention it again
I won't mention it again

I feel my life
Has reached an early sign of autumn

And everything that once was warm and new is gone now
Leaving nothing but this hunger in my soul",I Won't Mention It Again,1995
Reba McEntire,"So many times I said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Somethin' in my heart always knew
I'd be lying there beside him

On my own, On my own, On my own

So many promises never should be spoken
Now you know what loving him costs
Now you're even talking divorce
And you weren't even married

On my own
Once again I'm
One more time by myself

No one said it would be easy
But it once was so easy
Well I believe in love now here I stand
You wonder why

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

So many times I know I could have told you
That losing him would cut like a knife
He walked out and there went your life
I don't want to live without him

On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to end
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

Please come to Boston

So far we can't be found

Down the canyons
And then lie awake at night
Until they come back around
Please come to Denver
I just said no boy won't you come home to me

Now that drifter's word
Goes round and round
And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop

And all that I ain't got
He's still needs to lean to
Somebody he can sing to

He said please come to L.A.
To live forever

Is just too hard to build
I live in a house that
Looks out over the ocean

And vowed that I'd never love anyone else again

Lord, please forgive me even though I lied
'Cause you're the only one who knows just how hard I tried

I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in my needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band

When there's time on your hands

When I add up all the countless nights I cried myself to sleep
And all the broken promises you somehow failed to keep
He can't blame me

He's the one who left me too many times alone
In a three bedroom prison
I tried to make a home

That's how I pictured you would be. 

And you don't have long hair. 
I thought you'd have long hair. 
So this is all a shock to me.

I didn't know if you would meet me. 
Or believe me. 
When I said that I was fooled.
I really thought that I would hate you. 
I know I meant to. 
There'd only be one of us left when we're through.

[Chorus]
Now that we're face to face. 
And I put myself in your place. 
I see the truth. 
I see who's really to blame. 
And I won't play his game. 
Or try to get even. 
He'll know he's lost watching us leaving.
I blamed you, but I see my mistakes. 
Now that we're face to face.

I believe in true love something to be sure of. 
Isn't that what we deserve. 
There's no blame here, we both end up the same here. 
A little wiser than we were. 
There was a time this would have killed me. 
And it may still be. 
Hard to look you in the eye.
And now that all the spells are broken. 
The truth's been spoken. 
My heart has the strength to tell him goodbye.

We'd spend this life side by side

Someday we'll be together
Forever love
I won't give up

His head turned and my heart jumped. 
When I saw that it was him.
After two long years the love of my life. 
And I just held my breath in. 
Standin' there smiling. 
While his eyes locked on mine. 
He couldn't hear me screamin on the inside.

CHORUS
When I said, tear don't you fall. 
He's done let him go. 
Eye's don't look back. 
Down that empty road.
And lips you may move. 
But don't you say too much. 
Oh and please, please heart hush.

I said somethin' stupid. 
And reached out my hand. 
After makin' love and movin' earth. We were shakin' hands.
A million sweet memoriers. Pinballed through my brain. 
The want to hold him one more time. Ran through my veins.

Then he stopped talkin' and kissed me tenderly.

So I wouldn't know
I'm getting tired of people askin' 
Why can't they just leave me alone 
Cause I couldn't care, I couldn't say, I wouldn't know

I don't get out anymore to our old stompin' grounds
Cause some old friend is bound to ask me why you're not around

A little voice in my head is saying not so fast.
If you really want this love to last.

I'm gonna catch my breath. 
I'm gonna count to ten. 
I'm gonna leave you wonderin' when you'll see me again.
I'm gonna say goodnight with one passionate kiss. 
And leave you with the strongest feeling there is.
I'll give you something to miss. 

I'm not doin' something I'll regret.

He was laughing with his friends
But she captured all of his attention
Just by walking in
Confident and self-assured, he liked her attitude
And the moment their eyes met
Every girl in the room
Became

Just out of view
Invisible
Like a pane of glass
He could see right through
Invisible

They married in October
She made a beautiful bride
His whole world revolved around her
They had a picture perfect life
But when the baby came in August
Time started spinning like a wheel
She expected to feel tired
But she never thought she'd feel

Just out of view

Alone by myself or alone with you. 
And if I have to be lonely I'd rather be lonely alone.

I'd rather miss someone out on this highway. 
Than someone who's sittin' just three feet away. 
And I'd rather be fightin' some old memories,

Telling myself that there's nothin' wrong.

Everyday your heart beats a little stronger. 
But my nights for me get a little longer.

You've gone on a million miles from here. 
Swept up like a feather in the air.
Well you make it look so easy. 
That doesn't seem quite fair. 
'Cause baby I'm still tryin' to 
get myself up and flying. 

I should be farther on by now. 
I just can't seem to catch a breeze somehow. 
I should be free to leave the ground.

Said I wasn't gonna do it. 
No how. 
No sir. 
No way.
I wouldn't give my heart up. 
Gonna keep my guard up. 
And save it for another day.
Then you walked in with that crazy grin. 
And everything I swore before got lost in your eyes.
And flew right out the door.

[Chorus]
Suddenly I heard love songs. 
Playing real soft on the jukebox. 
Somebody ordered up moonlight.
And painted stars all across the sky. 
Is it gravity or destiny. 
Either way there's nothing I can do. 
Looks like I picked the wrong night. 
Not to fall in love with you. 

I briefly resisted but my heart insisted. 
It was gonna be giving in. 
Hard as I was trying there was no denying.
Which one of us would win.  
You came up beside me and asked if I'd be wantin' to have dance. 
And right then I knew.
This thing was out of my hands.

Reba McEntire,"We ordered up one more bottle of wine
You told me your story and I thought about mine
You said when you lost her you lost everything
It all started having a familiar ring

So I asked you to take me some place quiet
We wound up at the river for the rest of the night
Somewhere around the break of day
I could hear it coming from a mile away

So don't say that word
Not the one we both heard too much
You may think you do but you don't
It's just the fear of being alone

Reckless hearts can clear a path
Wider than a hurricane's aftermath
We've both traveled down that road
Where in the name of love anything goes
Like a child in the night
With no one to hold you
And tell you everything's gonna be all right
I must admit it's been fun
But that's no reason to jump the gun
If this is real time will tell
So let me bite my tongue and remind myself",The Fear of Being Alone,1998

Reba McEntire,"Well back in 1876 an ol' boy named Bell
Invented a contraption that we know so well
By the 1950's they were in everybody's home
There's a crazy little thing they call the telephone
Now there's one on every corner, in the back of every bar
You can get one in your briefcase, on a plane or in your car

So tell me why, haven't I, heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I said now darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you

There's no problem gettin' to me
Baby you can dial direct
I got call forwarding, call waiting
You can even call collect

When the service man he told me that my phone was workin' fine
And I've come to the conclusion the trouble isn't with my line
I'm sure the operator will be glad to put you through
So dial zero for assistance if this all confuses you

So tell me why, haven't I, heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I said now darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you

There better been a flood, a landslide of mud
A fire that burns up the wires
And thunder so loud with a black funnel cloud
A natural disaster I know nothin' about

Tell me why, haven't I, heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I said now darlin', honey, what is your excuse

Somewhere close to midnight
Another time, another place
She lays in the darkness
With tears on her face
While he talks in his sleep
Confessing his love
And calls out a name she's never heard of

And the roses heard it all
The rose in the vase that set by their bed

There's a story to tell if roses could talk

She never told him
She never let him see her cry
Only the roses know

And the angels took her away

Me against this heartache to survive
I may slip and I may fall
But even if I have to crawl
I'll break through to the healing side

Reba McEntire,"I can feel the darkness reaching in
As I touch the place you may as well have never been
Love can hurt much more than one can bare
When a heart beats for someone whose not there

How many times must I tell myself that you're gone
When will the rest of me wake up and see what went wrong
So wrong
And turn on the light and pick up the phone and just call
And lay pride aside
If I had any sense left at all

Voices call that only I can hear
Who would have thought love was somethin' I would fear
Almost hold, almost smell, almost taste
On my mind, in my heart, on my face

How many times must I tell myself that you're gone
And when will the rest of me wake up and see what went wrong
So wrong

Or having lunch from time to time

Reba McEntire,"Moving Oleta was the hardest thing he'd done
The nurses saw an old woman cryin'
But he saw the love of his life
She don't know where she is
But she knows this isn't home
Love is a hard, hard road

He met her in the summer of '37 
in a brush arbor down on the Rush Creek shore
He loved her black hair and the mischief in her smile
But she won him with her eyes

All the years and children gone, 
he still sees her the same
Love is a hard, hard road

He woke up each morning and drove into town
He stayed all day till her dinner came
Then he took her to a room, leaned on her wheelchair like a walker
Covered her with a quilt she'd made
Only God and a couple of nurses helped the old man shoulder the load
Love is a hard, hard road

He said ""They tell me this is all that's left, 
Say this hell on Earth is best, 
I lost all those reasons and I still don't understand""
He cursed his body old and weak
Tears of failure burned his cheeks
He said ""Oh, don't you know I prayed to die before this day""
Love is a hard, hard road

There's a shadow much darker than the valley of death
When you fear the reaper night not come today
The line 'em up in Laz-E-Boys out in the sunroom
The TV keeps the quiet away
She can't recall his name and she's the only love he's known

When she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cup
He jokes about his love life
And tells her he's about ready to give up
That's when she says I've been there before
But keep on looking because maybe who your looking for is

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a strangers face instead
Its that blue eyed girl from two floors up
Maybe she's the one
Maybe he could fall in love with

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
The moment they both missed until that day
When he saws his future in her eyes
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why he searched so long
When she was always there at that diner waitin' on

Somebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there

He was always Santa Claus to them
Every year he'd magically appear here in our den
They would laugh and tease and say you look a lot like Dad
He'd just smile and ask, ""Have you been good or bad?""

Oh, but life ain't always like a holiday
Some things change, and sometimes people go their separate ways
He just called and said he'd like to be here for the kids
Wish them Merry Christmas when they open up their gifts
And even though it might be hard on me
How can I let them down?
So Santa Claus is coming back to town

Here it is Christmas Eve - the kids are sleeping
Lights flashing in the trees - I keep thinking
Tomorrow I'll see him, tomorrow I'll see him

I guess I ought to try to go to bed
I can't rehearse tomorrow any longer in my head
He'll walk in so nonchalant, as if he'd never gone
They'll be glad to see him, I'll be barely hanging on

And roped real good
And tried to get his ranch out in the clear

He didn't want us kids to rodeo
He wanted more out of life for us
Maybe banking, or a lawyer
Or maybe even driving some old bus

And his pride grew greater day by day
And I know his eyes grew misty
The night I sang up on the Opry stage

The grass grows now where none used to be

Five years ago September, he bought more steers and hung up all his
Ropes
But he often tells the stories about the rodeos he won and cowboy jokes
Well it's funny that the first big roping that he won some thirty years
Ago
Was the same day that I sang on the stage of the Grand Old Opry show

Toting hay
And branding the Y.O.
And his hired hand's there to help him

And listening to the kids sing through the years

Like I have all the answers
I hope, I have the ones you need
I've never really done this, now I know what scared is

Sometimes, I'll protect you from everything that's wrong
Other times, I'll let you just find out on your own
But that's when you'll be growin'
And the whole time I'll be knowin'

You're gonna fly with every dream you chase
You're gonna cry but know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair but if you hang in there

You're gonna see that sometimes bad is good
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me
You're gonna be

I'm afraid you'll have to suffer through some of my mistakes
Lord, knows I'll be trying, oh, to give you what it takes
What it takes to know the difference between getting by and livin'

?Cause anything worth doing is worth doing all the way
Just know you'll have to live with all the choices that you make
So make sure you're always givin' way more than you're takin'

You're gonna fly with every dream you chase
You're gonna cry, but know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair, but if you just hang in there

You're gonna see that sometimes bad is good
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me
You're gonna be

Someone's everything
You're gonna see
Just what you are to me

You're gonna fly with every dream you chase
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me
You're gonna be, always loved by me

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening (Reprise),2006

Live in this town
And I had to run into him
When I saw him there
On that busy street

There was no where to run
No where to hide

Looked in my eyes

And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him

He said how've you been
It's great to see you again
You're really a sight for sore eyes
I said I can't complain
Oh, I'm doin' fine

As the people rushed by

We laughed about old times
And all we went through
That's when he hugged me
And said I've missed you

Reba McEntire,"I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then Mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips then I stepped into a satin
Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood

She said here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
When she started to speak
She looked at a pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your Pa's run off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heel shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin' Mama what do I do
She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy
And they'll be nice to you

She said here's your chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out
Well it's up to you
Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown

Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back

But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly 
What my Mama's been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow
That I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I don't know when or how
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame you know
I might have been born just plain white trash 
But Fancy was my name

Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

It wasn't very long after a benevolent man
Took me off the street
And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite

I charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
In an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites
That would call me bad
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had

But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ear

She said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Your Mama's gonna move you up town

To save the best for last

I don't know where we went wrong
When I watch you walk away
I'll miss you when you're gone

Baby, shed a tear for me
And I'll shed a tear for you
Oh, let's set this heartache free
And in time we'll make it through, well

Come On baby, take a look outside, it's a big blue sky


We didn't listen when they tried to tell us we were to young to know

They tried to slow us down but, we always found another way to go.

Before you know it we were waving goodbye, driving away

off into the big blue sky

We went out lookin for the best jobs kids like us could get

We got hired and fired, and worn out tired but we never quit.

To dumb to worry or wonder why

we were chasing our lives off into the big blue sky.


Chorus

I guess we were just

nothin but a big blue sky


We've had earthquakes, twisters, hurricanes, tidlewaves and hail down n our heads

We've been knocke down, sucked in

spun round, shaken up, thrown away

and left for dead

but somehow we always made it out alive

on the other side of the Big Blue Sky



Chorus

Maybe we were just crazy enough

to try and out run the rain

The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through anything.

you'll never see how good it can be

until you spread your wings and fly

baby take look at our lives it's nothing but a

Big Blue Sky


It's nothin but a big blue sky


Baby lookin back

everthing they said

Like how we wouldn't last how far we'd never get,

It's a great big lie

ain't nothin over head

nothin but a big blue sky


Chorus

Maybe we were just crazy enough

to try and out run the rain

The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through anything.

you'll never see how good it can be

until you spread your wings and fly

baby look at our lives

Take a look at our lives

Yeah look at our lives

It's nothin but a Big blue Sky


Nothin but a big blue sky

In a bed of Kleenex
Stuffin' chocolates in my mouth
On the phone with my best friend cussin' my ex
He broke my heart

And, the sun was shining

In the pillow cryin' over us
But I ain't, ain't love

On one of those dresses
Those strapless black ones
That are so famous for teaching lessons

Next to me on a westbound plane
He said ""I was married sixty years
I swear it feels like she's still here.""
Then he took out a picture

Staring at that black and white
The tears filled up in his eyes
I said ""You were a lucky man.""
He said ""I feel like I still am.""

When he told me her name
I heard myself say

I wanna be Somebody's Chelsea

Their first date and her father's doubts
He said ""Even as her hair turned gray,
She still took my breath away.""
And that it never changed with time

It'll hit you from your blind side
Kick you in the backside
Barely even break a sweat

It's a roll with the punches
Funny little life we lead
Oh, but I'm in it for the long haul
Win, lose or draw, y'all
It won't get the best of me

'Cause I been down to the wire
With my feet to the fire
But this livin' ain't killed me yet
Well I been tested and tried
But I still got some fight
No, this livin' ain't killed me
Livin' ain't killed me yet

I won't let a couple mistakes
Wrong turns that I've made
Be a noose around my neck
Hurt will hurt if you let it
Unless you just forget it
Shake it off, and say what's next

It's an up down, spin around
Crazy kinda world we're in, oh yeah
But I'm in it for the long haul, win, lose or draw
Might fall, but I'll get up again

Reba McEntire,"She wasn't wearing a wedding dress
In a Vegas wedding chapel
They were herding 'em in and out of there
Like they were cattle
Not exactly the fairytale that she had planned
But mama said, ""Aren't you supposed to get married, girl
Before you bring a baby in this world?""
And all she could say was ""yes ma'am""
She called her from that chapel
In Love Land
She said, ""mama, I really love this man""
Love Land

Seemed like a lifetime, driving from Vegas to Oklahoma
""If you're allowed a number of mistakes in life,"" she said
""Maybe I filled my quarter""
They called in a reception, saying you did the right thing
But they smiled, their broken smiles said
""Who needs to walk down the aisle?""
As she showed off her wedding ring
They walked away hand in hand
To Love Land
She said, ""I really love this man""
Love Land

Amazing all the progress we've made
Since the days of Thomas Edison
Still only God gives life
In spite of modern medicine
The doctors' voices whispered
""We did all that we could do
But your baby wasn't strong enough
To make it the whole nine months""
And as their world broke in two
He said, ""I'll carry you through
To Love Land""

She said, ""for the longest time I've blamed myself
Thought I was paying for my mistakes""
But they tried again, now they're watching him
Blow three candles out
He's daddy's little man
She said, ""only God could've planned the steps I've taken
That led me to where I am
Love Land
Love, Love Land
Anywhere you hold my hand is Love Land
Ooh, Love Land""",Love Land,2015
Reba McEntire,"You're gonna hurt sometimes, leave you to be
By the side of the road with the dirt and debris
Your name in the dust on your face
And you can't shake it off
You're gonna learn some things you don't wanna learn
When the taste of the fruit leaves a bite and a burn
You're taking your heart and your phone
And you're turning them off

But still you're gonna love somebody
Don't you wanna love somebody?
You ain't alive 'til you love somebody
Everybody wants to love somebody

Don't say that you're done
'Cause you're never done
Go on, go on, go on
And love somebody

You're gonna find someday the thicker the wall
The higher the fence, the harder the fall
When you're tryin' to sleep but you can't
'Cause it keeps spinning 'round
You're gonna go somewhere that you've never thought
You'd ever go again, there's no way to stop
And there's no way to know that you're lost
Until you're finally found

That's why you're gonna love somebody
Don't you wanna love somebody?
You ain't alive 'til you love somebody
Everybody wants to love somebody

You can damn and doubt it
You can cry about it
But you can't live without it

She was feeling 'bout as faded as the flowers from that wallpaper
Nobody'd even asked for her ID when she walked in there
Don't know how long she'd been there
She was fixing up her hair and fumbling though her purse
She was tired of feeling lonely
She was tired of feeling old
She was hating the idea of going home alone

So she got drunk last night
Drunk enough to call
That number in her phone that she would never call
Without the alcohol
But she needed an excuse
To let herself get used and so that's why

She got drunk the way she'd never
The way she hadn't in forever
But she needed to feel better, and wanted, and beautiful
Even if he didn't love her
And it had been a long time over
She had to make one more mistake
And she couldn't do that sober

It wasn't when I sat down and had myself a real good cry
Oh, it wasn't when I tore your picture from the frame
Threw it in the fire and sent it up in flames
I still felt the same

Oh, but then tonight, I met someone
We went out and we had fun
He made me laugh, we danced all night
And I didn't see your face when I was looking in his eyes
That's when I knew
I was over you

I was staying busy, trying to keep you off my mind
Baby, but your memory, it put up a real good fight
Oh, I went out with friends to have a drink or two
They tried to cheer me up, there was nothing they could do
I was missing you

But then tonight, there with him
It felt so good to feel good again
He took my hand and I didn't mind
And I didn't try to stop him when he kissed me goodnight
That's when I knew
I was over

Crying in my pillow
Praying that you'd come home
Waiting for the phone to ring
Wondering where it went wrong
Wishing I could move on
Thought I'd never feel this way
I thought I'd never see this day

Oh, but then tonight, I met someone
We went out and we had fun

Oh you're lookin' so good with your bags packed
On the front steps waitin' on a yellow cab

Shoulda make a beeline for your door
If you could see all the broken pieces
You would redeem my heart for sure

Don't know what you want till you need it
Don't know that it's love until it's leavin'
Oh, when you left I shoulda come runnin'
You were right about everything
I was up to no good and you knew it
And now I'm down here on my knees

Sometimes you don't love somebody until they don't love you
Sometimes you don't love somebody until they don't love you

Reba McEntire,"Try and put your arms around the 100 year old tree
Climb up on a horse and let it run full speed
Take a look down at the world from 30,000 feet
On your next flight

Watch a flock of birds against the morning sun
Close your eyes and listen to the river run
Catch a firefly in your hand or a raindrop on your tongue

How much proof do you need?

Plant a seed and see what comes out of the ground
Find the heartbeat on your baby's ultrasound
In a few years hear it laughing
Don't it sound like a song?

Stop and think about what you don't understand
Things like life and love and how the world began
Hear the doctor say we can't explain it
But the cancer is gone

There is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much more proof do you need?

Science says it's just all circumstance
Like this whole world's just an accident

Reba McEntire,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Alone and afraid
But You came close to me
And I'm forever changed

So much more than I can say

You've given me Your all
Now I?ll never be alone

You never stopped loving me
You've held onto my soul
And I'm never letting go

Forget these wide eyed fears.
I'm here; nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you

Say you'll love me
Every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you,
Now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light.
You're safe: no one will find you
Your fears are far behind you

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me

Then say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you here, beside you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me,

Think of me, 
Think of me fondly when we've said goodbye, 
Remember me once in a while 
Please promise me you'll try. 

When you find, 
That once again you long to take your heart back and be free 
If you ever find a moment, 
Spare a thought for me
We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me
Think of all the things we shared and seen
Don't think about the way things might have been
Think of me, 
Think of me waking, silent and resigned. 
Imagine me, 
Trying too hard to put you from my mind.
Recall those days
Of when the seagulls fly
Of the things we'd never do
There will never be a day
I won't think of you

Can it be? 
Can it be Christine? 
Bravo!

How young and innocent we were

And my smile is back again it had been away for so long,

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for

The only one my arms will ever hold

Rebecca Hansen,"The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound
Half in hopeless sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
To drag us all away
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldier's feet
But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us knows where
The stones been rolled away
And now his body isn't there
So we both ran toward the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell
Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die
Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same
But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried
Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into his eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt in my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I'd ever had
Just melted into peace
He's alive yes He's alive
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
Has alive yes Has alive
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven

Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad

Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love

That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,2007

Dickon, if there is ever anything we can do

Sir, what is to become of our Mary?
Why, Mary, I'd nearly forgotten you in all this
It's hard to remember everybody sir

No, it isn't
Three isn't very many people at all
I should be able to remember three people quite easily
Would I be one of them?

Mary Lennox
For as long as you will have us, we are yours
Colin and I, and this is your home
And this, my lovely child is your garden

Come to my garden, nestled in the hill
There I'll keep you safe beside me
Come to my garden, rest there in my arms
There I'll see you safely grown

And on your way, stay here in the garden
As days grow long and mild
Come to the garden
Come, sweet child

All I would ask is care for the child of our love
Come, go with me, safe I will keep you

There I would, there we would, there we will go

Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go

And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird

With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music

My heart wants to sing every song it hears
My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees

My heart wants to sigh like a chime
That flies from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips


And falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
And the traffic wrote the words

It came a-ringing up like Christmas bells
And rapping up like pipes and drums
Oh, won't you stay? We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on the wall

Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon
Oh, won't you stay? We'll put on the day
Theres a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly and papers lie awaiting to blow away

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of oranges, too

And the sun poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses
Oh, won't you stay? We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight, by jewel light if only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you wake up, it's a Chelsea morning?

Down on me

Rebecca Lynn Howard,"From the pocket of an honest preacher
To the empty hand of a homeless bum
To the cash drawer at the liquor store
Where he bought a pint of rum

To the bank clerk who past me off
To the single mom trying to pay the rent
I can't even count all the times 
And all the ways I've been spent

I close my eyes and hold my breath
When the bad man steals me
And ruins my name
If I had my way I rather be
Passed off in the offering plate

I've been in the hands of a rich man
In a shoebox under a farmer's bed
Help post the bail of a stubborn boy
Who could have walked but he fought instead

I've been torn in half over some silly bet
Taped back together and then they tossed me
In the case of a beggin' Cajun fiddler player
On Bourbon Street

Some people call me George
Some people worship the color green
I don't really mind of course
I just like the company

'Cause I'm sure one day 
I'll be a thing of the past
I'll be sitting folded up 
In some old woman's hope chest

She'll be telling her grand kids
How she used to spend me
On a pack of gum, and jackerjacks
A can of Coke and a quarter snack
And she'll say ""back then you could get so much for a dollar""
And they'll say, ""what's a dollar?""

But for now I'm sitting in a piggybank
Of an eight year old trying to buy a bike
I'm proud to be a dollar twenty three
On the way to thirty five

She pours us out onto the carpet
Counts us all then holds us tight
Then she puts us back in one by one
Blows a kiss then she says good night

And there ain't tellin' where I'll end up next
In a bra or a bible it's anybody's guess
Maybe in a bottle just floatin' in the water

No not us, not today
Love won't make it
Without changing your moves

Every time should feel like the first time
C'mon baby, now let's show them what we do
To put a new twist on an old groove

It ain't worth holding in this pain
When we're both about to burst
I think its time 
We take a long hard look at us

We should try to shine a light

And when I'm holding you

You just sing 'cause you loved to

Daddy would sing 'Ring of Fire'
Someone would play the 'Wildwood Flower'

To 'Amazing Grace' in three part harmony

And passed it down to you and me

Rebecca Parris,"Just when I thought that fate was unkind,
That happiness wasn't to be,
I got a shock and I changed my mind,
A miracle happened to me.

If the moon turns green and shadows get up and walk around,
And clouds come tumbling to the ground,
I wouldn't be surprised,
'Cause didn't you fall in love with me?
If the stars turn blue and Willows that weep begin to sing,
And winter changes into Spring,
I wouldn't raise my eyes,
'Cause didn't you fall in love with me?
I thought I was foolish to think of romance 
With someone so charming as you,
Thought I was hoping without any chance.
But ev'ry hope came true.

If the moon turns green and rivers begin to flow up stream,
And this is all a crazy dream,
I wouldn't be surprised,
'Cause anything can happen if you can fall in love with me.",If the Moon Turns Green,1993
Rebecca Parris,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

With memories

And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere

I know that I'll soon go mad

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Where God's air is sweet and I touch the sky

Leaving the streams of sorrow far down below

You can be a model cover every magazine
You can walk on every stage or be the host of M.T.V
You can win the medals, run it, swim it, perfectly
You could have a turn at Indy, you could even own the team

I saw a man up on a box

He was preaching up a storm
As I passed on by he said

Don't worry about your life
Cause if you hold it too close, you'll lose it
Don't worry about your life
So won't you let go before it's gone

A little further on I saw a beggar on the street
He asked for change and then gives me his life story
Says he was a millionaire, made some bad decisions there
Now a dollar fifty would
Feed him for a week and he said

Don't worry about your life
Cause if you hold it too close you lose it
Don't worry about your life
So won't you let go
Before it's gone

Then I see the birds, I watch them fly
They've got everything they need
They show me why I can be free
Knowing You will care for me

Finally at the grocery store
My mind is filled with many thoughts
As I bump into a girl I knew from high school
She said, what's different about you girl?
And I smiled and said this is what I know is true
And I pass it right along to you

Rebecca St. James,"Grant me serenity to accept things
The things I cannot change
Grant me the courage, Lord, to change what I can
Wisdom to know the difference
In my weakness You can shine
In Your strength I can fly and

And You make everything, everything beautiful
You make everything, everything new
You make everything, everything beautiful
In its time, in Your time
It's beautiful

Grant me serenity, Lord, and patience
For things will take time
Grant me freedom to walk a new path
And let me feel Your love
In my weakness You can shine
In Your strength I can fly and

And You make everything, everything beautiful
You make everything, everything new
You make everything, everything beautiful
In its time, in Your time

Rebecca St. James,"Oh how beautiful the sound
That has saved a wretch like me
I was lost but I am found
I was captive till You made me free
It was grace that taught my heart
How to marvel at Your name
Breaking all my fears apart
Taking all my doubt and shame
And it all comes down to this
Yeah it all comes down to

Your grace is amazing to me
Your love is still such a wonder
Your cross is still bringing me to my knees, oh God
You still amaze me

When I stand before Your throne
I will bring eternal praise
For my heart has found a home
And a reason still to say
That it all comes down to this
Yeah it all comes down to

Your grace is amazing to me
Your love is still such a wonder
Your cross is still bringing me to my knees, oh God
And I am amazed

How You paid in death every sinner's wage
How You loved me first, so You took my place
And redemption came through the work of grace
It's amazing, so amazing

And it all comes down to this
Yeah, it all comes down to

Your grace is amazing to me
Your love is still such a wonder
Your cross is still bringing me to my knees, oh God
You still amaze me",You Still Amaze Me,2011
Rebecca Storm,"You must be mistaken
It couldn't have been
You couldn't have seen him yesterday
He's doing some deal up in Baltimore now
I hate it when he's away

You must be mistaken
I'm sure that you are
There's more than one car with stickers on
And lots of young guys wear corduroy pants
And I'd know if he hadn't gone

Take that look off your face (take that look off your face)
I can see through your smile (I can see through your smile)
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well, I've got news for you
I knew before

If I'm not mistaken, it started last year
I'm not very clear how it began
I noticed a change but I just closed my eyes
As only a woman can

No, I didn't dig deep (No, I didn't dig deep)
I did not want to know (I did not want to know)
Well, you don't interfere
When you're scared of the things you might hear
When he's back, you think I will end it right there and then
Well, my fair weather friend, 
You're wrong again

Rebecca Sugar,"Take a little piece of this until the winter start
Make a little circle right before you fall apart
I lay down with caution like the way you fold your arms
Take a little piece of this before you fall apart

We've been wrestling something, reckless assumptions
Lately you've been skipping the parties, loving nobody
You say you're not distant for nothing, just wanna feel something
But this all this all consistent with loving, if you want private

Is it true? Take a little piece of this until the winter start
Is it true? Make a little circle right before you fall apart
Too good to be true
I lay down with God just like the way you fold your arms
Too good to be true
Take a little piece of this before you fall apart

And now you're shaken from something
Here come the assumptions
You say you've got skin on the table
But you're not afraid of
Friends that you no longer reply to
You're keepin' it vague
Then lay down in deep isolation
Hope you can make it

Too good to be true
Take a little piece of this until the winter start
Is it true?
Make a little circle right before you fall apart
Too good to be true
I lay down with God just like the way you fold your arms
Too good to be true
Take a little piece of this before you fall apart

Rebecca Trehearn,"Some have said, down through history
If you last it's a mystery
But I guess they don't know, what they're talking about
From the mountains down to the sea
You've become such a habit with me
America, America

Well I come from, down around Tennessee
But the people in California
Are nice to me, America
It don't matter where I may roam
Tell you people that it's home sweet home
America, America

And my brothers are all black and white, yellow too
And the red man is right, to expect a little from you
Promise and then follow through, America

And the men who fell on the plains
And lived, through hardship and pain
America, America
And the men who could not fight
In a war that didn't seem right
You let them come home, America
