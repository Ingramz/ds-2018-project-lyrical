Tupac Shakur,"The nights grow cold
My search for gold is leading nowhere
Whichever lonely road I take
It seems to go nowhere
It's a fight to survive just until tomorrow
How can I display what I know I'm worthy of
When they turn me away

The doors are closed to such as I
A boy from nowhere
But not to those who merely buy the right to go where
They'll be met with respect, not humiliation
A man's place on earth
I have come to realize is decided by birth

So what's the future
No matter where I go
I will still belong in Andalusia
Where we don't know where
The next penny's coming from
Something's wrong

I'm bound to Spain, I won't remain
A boy from nowhere
There has to be a place for me
And I must go there
I don't fantasize, unlike a million others
Who must bow and scrape
For my one means of escape
Is to flourish a cape

I'll fight all odds
And fight the Gods if they oppose me
I have to win, I won't give in
No one who knows me would expect me to fail
For the want of trying
Not a man alive
Had to beg or steal or fight
More than me to survive

So what's the future
No matter where I go
I will still belong in Andalusia
Where good, honest men grow weak
And the rich grow strong
Something's wrong

Another dawn, another boy
A boy from nowhere
My destiny will guarantee
And I must go there
It's a fight to survive just until tomorrow
One more mouth to feed
And the way things are 'round here
That's the last thing they need",A Boy From Nowhere,2002
Tupac Shakur,"Nigga, we doing this shit from Cleveland to LA
Nigga whatever you niggas want, we bringin' it!
Thug Luv, nigga. What time is it?
Yo, I don't give a fuck where you lay at
Nigga, it's time to slay these bitch-made niggas!

They ain't even knowing what type of niggas we is
Where my thugs at? Bone thugs-n-harmony
I know you niggas been waiting for this for a long time
Well, here it is, nigga. Here it is. What you gonna do with it?

Well, it must be close to the Armageddon, Lord
Know that I won't fly by that lesson
You taught me to pull out my Wesson you brought me
And I'm not stressing it softly
Get 'em up off me, cause all we
Wanted was harmony, been bombing em
Yell up out of my ghetto, I won't settle, get on my level
They can't stop me and pop me
Nigga, they got me? Fuck no
Little Pac gets schizophrenic, and manage to damage all y'all
I'll talk about 'em, and you don't really want it
'Cause they're cornered, and I'm want 'em to not jump
I'd rather say that we came to shut 'em all down
So quick to test, bullet, yes, declare war
Roll, I'll flow when I get the gun for the murder
Mo' horror! Why? They did it all, pause for the cause
And I finna to pull a 9 or pistol, and lit a nigga with mine
Fuck them niggas, it's on
All y'all fall! Bizzy getting bitches to test me
Bless the floor, and any attempt to arrest me, stress me
Lord, looking at death with the last of my breath
Follow, follow, my kids!
No, don't sin in my steps!
Yet the weapon is kept with the best of my secrets
Deep in the reach, I'm alone. Nigga believe
That I can see it, if needed, and if you really with me
And well then let it be, get the greens and we running up over Cleveland

Ha, ha! What's poppin', nigga?
Put your muthafucking hands on your strap, nigga
Thug Luv, nigga. Yeah, we can do this like gangstas and slug it out
Or do this like punks and punk it out
Pull your strap on me, nigga, you better kill me!
Thug life, baby. Thug Luv

I'll probably be punished for hard living, blind to the facts:
Thugs is convicts in God's prison, hands on the strap
Praying so Father please forgive me! Police be rushing when they see me
I flaunt it: America's Most Wanted, live on T.V
Life: pleasure and pain, stuck in this game, holler my name!
We all gon' die, we bleed through similar veins
Please explain to me, now. Don't panic when my guns burst
Heard the last jam, nigga? This one's worse!
My nigga Bone held the chrome 'til I came home
Thug Luv players tell these bitch niggas ""bring it on""
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathin'
Now, who do you believe in? Hit the weed and breathe
It's a cold-ass world; niggas kill you in your sleep
Watch me until they stop me, bury, murder me or drop me
I got Thug Luv for my nationwide posse. Feel me!

Little thug from the Land, nigga, never ran
Muthafuckas out to get me. They don't understand
It's the #1 nigga out with a nation of niggas
Down to put it some work and do some dirt
Fuckin' around with the band Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
Follow down the road, we stroll to meet karma
Everything I do, it seem to cause drama
Ready for the war like a knight in my armor, bomb ya!
So quick to test us, nigga wanna crash me, eat dust
For the love of the lust, niggas busting on us
Hit 'em up with the buck, 12-gauge eruptions!
It's the Art of War, putting niggas on the floor
When I'm coming through the door, bringing nothing but terror
Causing much pain to the nigga that dared us
Tried to put a twist in this thugsta era. Paired up
With a nigga like Pac, and a nigga like me: gotta stay high
Thug luv 'til I die, keep my prayer to the sky
But I'm still in the hood, smoke and fry
So I beg the Lord save us all: escapers of misery
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries, soldiers of the century, yeah

Here to get it, told my niggas they need get the hell
Down with the dirt, and we don't fuck around
Buck a couple a rounds, and if your passing through
Then hit the ground and don't get caught up in the crossfire, nigga
Artillery thick, and you don't wanna get to fucking with this
I'm straight devil, not a punk and pretend
I reload, buck a little mo'
Flee the scene 'fore the po-po even know
""So, who ya looking for?"" They don't know!
A mothafucka with a leatherface
Hey, man, she said I ran this way, said I ran that a way
Ya hoes'll never know because I got away
A criminal mind to keep a nigga on the level
Sometimes I get high and analyze your crime
Correctly organized and with results, you'll be surprised

Oh, nigga, can you feel the vibe? We can ride
Playa hating niggas, you got to die, it's only right
It's over with Bone, better leave it alone
Mo Thugs come crack their fuckin' domes
Still in the hood, where the thugs play
Fuckin' with nothing but thugs, mane
Ain't taking no shorts or no losses
We cracking them domes around my way
Give it to 'em on another level, nigga, get a shovel
You can dig a hole; bitches is dead!
Infrared to your head. You can beg, you go fled
But still gonna bleed bloody red
Fuck with mine, we'll be seen in the moonlight
'Cause we out riding, looking for you
Better run for cover, nigga, duck!
We about to bust. Straight got the infrared, put it on his forehead
Makes a move, send flowers straight to his home
Put a card in the muthafucka, send it to his mama
Tell her he was dead wrong, dead wrong, now he long gone, long gone

Pac Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
Pac Pac run with us! Pac and Rip with Thug Luv
Pac Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
Pac Pac run with us! Pac and Rip with Thug Luv
Pac Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
Pac Pac run with us! Pac and Rip with Thug Luv

Part 2
This is for all the homeboys who couldn't get their happy home
As long as one of us got it some of us got it
Stay down for me, hold on

Verse 1:
Sometimes you made me feel like I wasn't good enough for you
So I punished us both and didn't stay true
So much pain I know I've caused you
Truly I'm sorry every day that I'm away girl
Things went down that just don't make sense
Time and place is all now irrevelant
Cause I'm still thinking about the love that's gone
Morning, cooking breakfast back at home

Chorus:
I never meant for this to end
But we couldn't just let it go again
We broke up, it's been years and we can't turn back
But I still remember my happy home, home, home

2Pac:
Goin' through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest, it's a hard role just to keep up your faith in God
Knowing you'll get scared though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's momma, made her my wife now
I'm tryin' hard y'all, maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watching older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it'll help our child grow then together we die
Why question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
I wonder what you must feel like now you know
That I'm having a seed with someone else
I didn't plan it to be this way
But things happen with time
And you know, time don't wait for nobody baby Oh, now I gotta handle my responsibility
Even though you still mean so much to me
Baby I can't say enough that I'm sorry
Oh, I never meant

[Chorus]

Tupac Shakur,"I'm loyal to the game

Now I've got task on a nigga's ass
Tell me will they blast me
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
It's gettin' crazy after dark
These narcs be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penetentiary
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me
I'm stackin' G's buyin' all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low
Although I'm young I'm still comin up
I'm gettin' paid pullin' razors on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull the strap when there's drama
Buster you ain't heard?
I been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain

Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone
I'm gettin' used to the needles on the bathroom sink
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think
So look like I'mma be the man of the house
Gotta have somethin' to put in the air when it's out
Up early in the mornin' the first to get it
They say if you really want it then come on with it
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars
And I only spent 30 days behind bars
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid
I handled any beef that they sent my way
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change
It's thug in my veins
I'm loyal to the game

I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'

Yeah
It ain't my fault I came up fast
And your the name niggas bring up last
And all the dames get a king up ass
10 grand on every ring I flash
Deep frog--and I'mma have to fling your ass
I'm on the block where it's scorchin' hot
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block
I get 'dro by the pickle jar
These broke niggas wanna get the star
So I don't keep the four-nickel far
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin' her brain
Get more slugs to boil in your frame
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain
The paint's the same color as oil in the Range
I'm stingy ain't got nothin' for you but some change
I'm good now but the fact still remains
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name

I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'

All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride

For each other, cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets,
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it

On W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling

Damn near gone, floatin on cloud one-nine
Liquor sto', so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up two
Seven, eight, nine ten eleven twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug the hoe out
I fixed me some food, then go the hell out
Two A.M. on the dizot, I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeah, and I'm feelin alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog don't blame me

Now do I love them hoes? (HELL NAW!)

Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a hoe

Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
And I rock them, like la-di-da-di

How do you want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane; I'm for real
How do you want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane; I'm for real

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm bout to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessey
A favorite of my homies when we floss, on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how you want it

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk am I a fool or what?

I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' til the show is over, cause I'ma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alize, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggas play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, youse a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggas top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga tell me how you want it

Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof, because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, SkyPager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetary
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade em all, these taxes
Got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin like they know me
Hahaha, but I'ma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out

A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls

Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up

(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?

And will I be the G that I was?

I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality

Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag

I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two

Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothing without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mad public
My attitude was, ""Fuck it,"" cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
And my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the tele hoe""
Equipped with money and a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smoking bomb-ass weed feeling crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustling and prayers, to breaking motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishing
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressing (boo-ya!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches getting suspicious
Started plotting and planning on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggas be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me

Peep it, it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and mother fuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screaming as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggas got?) witness my steel
Spitting at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flying when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doing jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thugging for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops cause I know they comin for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfucking menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
Getting much mail in jail, niggas telling me to kill it
Knowing when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a who ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me,
And all the cowards that was down with it

I wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin', and now I'm gone
Tryin' to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out befo' them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the East coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business, and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic, thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend

All that is dead though, I'm changed, I'm tellin you..

You're my nigga, my best friend
Never gonna call you a bitch again
Yea yea yea, oh

Witness the evil men do, all this shit I been through
Never meant to hurt you, can we make this work boo?
I know you been feelin pain, things are not the same
""Waitin to Exhale"" while I'm sittin in the county jail
Keep yo' head up, cause things are gettin better
My cellmates shed tears off yo' last love letter
Told 'em you would find a friend so keep yo' eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch
Even though you ain't the type to trip, sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon

You got a brother feelin' mellow like a Cuban cigar
You truly a star, we'll take the days one at a time
I think we make the perfect pair, cause you my one of a kind
I say we make a full house, live out the family dreams
No jokers, no jacks, just kings and queens
And we should leave the clubs alone and take trips to islands
Give you all of my heart and flood your hands with diamonds
No more livin' like a playa, stop chasin' the hoes
I never put you in a shuffle, use my ace in the hole
I live a life full of riches we got places to go
So no bluffin', no rushin', just takin' it slow
Let your man do the hustling while you lay in the shade
I'll throw a deuce to the haters, call a spade a spade
And let you know I'll never hurt you, baby girl
You made me hurry up and wait and I know patience is a virtue

Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on

Pictures of penny, sippin' my glass full of Henny
Hands on my semi—automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact, 'cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire, niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap, it's a trap, a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks, makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say, we murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the crack out, my lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed, then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like yay-yo
Niggas pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy me, it’s fatal
Efficiently I delete then flee
The art of war, livin' sucka free, get wit' me

I'm starin' through my rear view, doin' 'bout 90
The pedal to the metal, so I can't see what's behind me
Buckle up your seat belt eyes on the road
They know we ridin' dirty gotta play it how it go
They close down the projects the clubs been closed
And then they wonder why niggas breakin' down o's
I'm a run away slave
Ya get it nigga off the chain
I got that thug life shit runnin' through my veins
And now they scare, they know that I been heaven sent
And yeah we know the dope comin' from the president
But look at us, we ain't got shit to lose
Feel like we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes
In the ghetto or better yet home sweet home
This is the land of the free, but to me that's wrong
I'm on my way to the white house strapped wit' my heat
So don't fall asleep

They say that the mo' they hate ya the mo' that it motivate ya
My mind set on grind, my mental set on the paper
62 hours and countin', and I'm still awake
And they slippin' me sleepin' pills, wit' the will I break
Broke nigga always tellin' ya how to make ya cash adjust
So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media 'cause they always mad at us
I don't see 'em tryin' to mediate, when we get gats and bust
They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape
It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff
I'm takin' back my money counter 'cause it wasn't fast enough, yep
I got a couple problems (word) and none of 'em is money
Just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to maneuver with the Ruger
To live like Freddy Krueger these nightmares just ain't as bloody
In meetings they always askin' what my passion is
(And the) money talks so I always have words to answer this (yep)
I can't relax 'cause it's like I'm a fetti activist
Might see me on TV never a mat-tress

Soon as I get home

Dear baby, it's me again, stuck inside this mad pen
Tryin' to pay my debt for all my sins, these is penitentiary times
Be so heavy on my mind, at times, it's like I'm livin' just to die
I'm livin' in hell, stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail, waitin' for my chance to post bail

I wanna be paid in large stacks and mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder how long will I last
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated

Bustas is shady
So I'm dumpin' on cowards crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear, I see it

Even though you mad at me, you'll be glad to see the strategy
Of makin' these chips come so easily
I max out in the morning, baby life is good
Me and you against the whole hood
Soon as I come home

Garb my strap, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I come home

Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin'
But now you out in the world while I'm twisted in prison
Love letters come daily, words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures, beggin' for some sex

Stay wide open, keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is keep it it real or you could die squealin'
Plus I never have to worry about a visit
'Cause you're there daily, guards tryin' to get your number

You don't dare tell me, tongue kissin' steady humpin'
Tryin' to touch you somethin' 'fore the C.O. in the corner jump in
Frontin', late nights reminiscin'
Everybody's quiet, I think somethin's in the air

Prepare for the riot, it's padlocks in my socks
Steel from the bed springs, I touch 'em with thug love
And then let they heads ring, started a war but now I'm gone
Release me to the streets in the morning

Take and pick like they keep a see-note

Depends on how many rocks, the young nigga cook up
Narcotics got drastic, seen 'em niggas you blated
Wantin' me in a casket on the grind coppin' plastic

Yeah, nigga I heard little Moo gave the word
You get parol on the third, it's all out we just heard
We out here frontin', still here but all about nothin'
My double o's what I'm wantin' and I'm tryin' to see somethin'

That we ain't never had luxury life results, livin' bad
Tricks of the trade, shit that should've been taught by dad
But learned through the crew, lessons between me and you
And once we lock this shit down, it ain't a thing they could do

Meanwhile, I stay waitin' by the phone
Hopin' I get the call, tellin' a nigga that you home

Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now what's next
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now what's next

Caught up in the middle
My life's a riddle
Don't let it get ya
I wanna be legal
But it's this hustle that get me richer
One love to my peoples makin' money
I can see you bubblin'
Avoid all trouble
Beware of devils continue strugglin'
Nothin's impossible if there's a will there's a way
So get your mind on official business
You can be great
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave
So get paid
My niggaz do this every fuckin' day
We parlay
Through politics and conversation
This information to my thug niggaz in the congregation
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation
Separation is self destruction
What's needed is unification
Cause the world ain't hardly scared
If not prepared
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there
But no one cares it's there to share
All we get is stares
Because of fear we'll evaporate
Say your prayers

And what's next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

Makaveli tried to warn us
But niggaz ain't listen to Pac
Naw (listen listen) nigga really listen to Pac
Shit yean got it yet (no)
Then you won't get it
Might as well measure 'em up
And have his ass fitted
Why
Caught slippin' dog trippin' didn't soak game
Got his wig split like dem shutters on the airplane
Never will change niggaz wit' no name no shame
Might open ya head foe mess broke change
I stay posted like a flag (flag)
Starin' through my rear view ballin' in a jag (jag)
Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town
We gon' put these artificial bustas in they place now
Time foe a change
Real niggaz rollin' wit' me
Money makin' swift decision we controllin' the streets
Side track by the broads and the frauds
Ain't it strange
It's the reason so many niggaz get scarred in the game

Whatz next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

That money gotta make it
What I gotta do to make it
Do I really gotta take it
Put this mack up to you face it
Doin' what we gotta do to survive
Just ask Kweli doin' what we do to get by
Some niggaz stick to the crime
Pitchin' nickel and dimes
What the fuck we s'pose to do
Who gon' give us a job
So I tried and tried
Tried to get out the grind
But the block kept on callin' me back
Fiends kept on callin' for crack
So I supply 'em wit' that
Gave 'em a reasonable fee
Nigga don't blame it on me
Shit just look where I'm at
Niggaz in gardens
LAPD is the target
Niggaz is heartless hustle regardless
Look that dope spot use to be an apartment
But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet
We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin

Whatz next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game

I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

I'm on a mission to the point motherfuckers think I'm smokin 
Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the H-shot fifth 
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit 
Don't you know that killin is thrillin 
All the blood spillin, is all up on the drug dealin 
A broad gangsta my daddy was a thug 
Had a .38 wit the hallow point slug 
So when he lit shots 
Niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor 
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes 
Payin dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's 
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster 
Got the Mac .11's swingin from my shoulder 
It's a damn shame I got to put my mom through the strain 
I'm livin in a house of pain

Is anybody listenin and tell me can you can see this God be surroundin me

And it's gettin blury, I'm gettin worried cause it's gettin hard to see 
When your lampin in the house of paaaiiinnn

Who gave you the heart to see a nigga? 
Before you bust, my name is spoken on the tongue so many foes 
Bustin motherfuckers out the blocks and I ain't even go 
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame 
From doin fix to bustin tricks out the fuckin frame 
Got these bitches on my jock niggaz on my block 
Jealous ass suckers got it duckin for my fuckin glock 
And bustin niggaz ass is to stay alive 
Skinny ass playa watchin victim motherfuckers fry 
They ask me how I'm livin? how I'm a hustler? 
Buckin busters ‘til they die 
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard? 
Niggaz got they AK's headin for the bird 
Aimin at free ass bitches let 'em rain 
Givin 'em, wettin 'em, welcome to the house of pain

Wendy Williams say I stayed dust maybe I should 
cuz these rappers'll have your phone tap like Savion Glover 
And on the West the police corrupt, some are bloods 
But these Teflon I loaded explodin some mugs 
I'm like Furious in ""Boyz In the Hood"" 
But at the drive through I'm ain't runnin I'm dumpin 
Crazy like a paru and load up, know how Nas do 
I'm callin Henchmen to save shit, to organize a black truth 
And we party hard party wit Nas 
Since they ain't no more - Mardi Gras 
And Bush won't apologize 
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize 
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize 
Ya'll yellin my name but y'all soon die in 
Tryin to portray real but they be ly-in 
Cuz they want the real niggaz to die so they can game

Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man

In that UPT, they got that monkey on they back 
Niggas in that 3 won't hesitate to leave ya crack 
If you slip in Uptown, then you fucked nigga 
Pullin' triggers full of that brown ducked out nigga 
Totin' choppers 
That's wet ya leave ya foul nigga 
Uptown don't give a fuck, and they wild nigga 
In that Magnolia, nigga knock ya head off ya shoulders 
Reload to LD will fuck clean over ya 
Left with no figgas 
Fucked up from 50 niggas 
6 ft. is where you'll be 
On t-shirts is ya picture

In that 3 we pack 2's that'll bruise when we spit 
Choppers with 50, so it ain't no way we won't hit 
Playin' a game with no rules so you get crept on 
Red dots beamin' you better have your vest on 
Uptown consists of nothin' but them real niggas 
Packin' steel niggas 
Won't hesitate to kill niggas 
Sharp shooter ? nigga at far range 
Killin' you niggas ain't no thang so yo' brains hang 
Choppers be ringin' like a motherfuckin' church bell 
Niggas get served like a junkie with a drug sell 
Runnin' shop is them off of ? 
? and they strapped with autillary 
In that Melph, niggas will leave ya where ya standin 
Poppin' trunks and they pullin' out the cannons 
Pullin' triggers that'll soak ya leave ya brainless 
50 shots will stop ya 
Body be flamin'

With glocks to mack in the hoop in 'dis black on black

Sellin cane and fame ain't nothin but a thang to me

You gotta gun so what nigga my gun bigger 
If I'm up wit no stuntin I pull tha trigga
Aim for yo chest or head you die quicker
Nigga this young nigga here don't play
Thug'n everyday and I roll wit a K
Don't hesitate I'll blow you away 
Have yo family plannin yo funeral in tha way
If you don't want my trouble you betta chill
Learnt this along time I kill or be killed

Ohhh
Man, somethin' stank
Ooohh
You smell that?
I don't know what that is

Killin' is like a hobby: somethin' that B.G. do for fun
It don't help to run - I'll empty 'em all out the drum
When it come down to one-eight-seven I don't play
When it come down to you or me, it won't be me
Got quick hands, call me ""Quick Draw"", I'll draw first
Hit ya, loosen up your head, watch your shit burst
Been about gun-play, puttin' bustas on T-shirts
Creepin' down the one-way lettin' that AK work
Ain't too many niggas I beef with still here
Might could count a few rollin' 'round in a wheelchair
Nigga know my background - so, cowards, stay your distance
Know if you get into it with me you get splitted
Know you could cause your momma or sister to come up missin'
It could be broad daylight - I'll walk up and twist 'em
I don't give a motherfuck - act like ya know
If not, then ask the police for my M.O.

(Hook-4x [Turk & B.G.])
[Turk] God damn!!! What's that smell?
[B.G.] That's that nigga who will never get well

[Turk]
I'll make sure that a nigga is cooked and well-done
Stand over the bitch - give it to him one by one
I gotcha down bad, I'ma leave ya, cousin
No matter what time it is, I'ma leave ya, cousin
A nigga won't go in that ocean for ya - bring it on
Do or die, nigga - you or me gon' be gone
I ain't scared at all - my nuts hang low, wodie
Try sizin me up, that ass gotta go, wodie
Six under the dirt
Is where you'll be fuckin' with this nigga: Turk
I'll knock your head off, put your back in your chest
Play the same twitch straight to the project
Just chill - sit back and lay low
Stay on my p's and q's - keep the four-four
You know how it go: give bitch-niggas hell
And I'll make sure they'll never get well

I got bad nerves - don't make me click if I do
What happen after I finish with you is on you
I warned you - you can't never say I didn't
Brains painted on the ground when I stop spittin'
""To society I'm a menace"" is what the judge said to me
Trippin' 'cause I keep a automatic that's fully
Finger stay on the trigger - see my enemy, I'm pullin'
Bitch-nigga say he feel me, laughed at me, say I wouldn't
You know Geezy couldn't let that slide by
I do walk-up's, never drive-by's
Grab a nigga by his head, whisper to him 'fore I do him
""Why,"" I said, ""you're here, wodie?"" - execute him
That there raw, huh - I know, nigga
Geezy ain't no ho, nigga
Been cutthroat, been playin' the game how it go, nigga
So if you like livin', mind your own business
Or you gonna be traced in white chalk, ya here me

Listen,
It's a fresh package I got - why not move it
Keepin' it in the house 'll have the Feds locked to it
Business as usual is goin' on in the slums
We want the whole cake, n**** - we don't want no crums
Stupid s*** - we avoid it
Dope - we exploit it
Had our s*** tight b****es done destroyed it
Now n****s gettin' out lookin' for employers
Made a deal with the D.A. and the lawyer
Swearin' he would never tell - put it on his daughter
Sayin' he was outta town - n**** crossed the border
Should've bust his head, but I don't need the heat
I'll send another n**** out to handle beef for me
It's a test 'cause I've been given him a ki a week
Let me see what they gon' do up on the streets for me
And if he hand me his business, I'ma make sure he's straight

Started out with a seven-gram quarter, flipped to half-a-ounce
Tryin' to keep clothes on my daughter and food in her mouth
It don't stop from sun-up to sun-down - I'm on the grind
In two weeks I was workin' a 16-25
Tryin' to get it - only thing in my vision is ballin'
Jumpin' out a 500-S cla** on brodders
So you only had a nickel like me hustlin' hard
'Fore I knew I was workin' four ounces and two quarters
Not a taker I'm scarred from
Swore he was gon' front just bringin' his s***
Now I got a quarter ki - broke it down to six and two quarters
It's cooked already - I got these n****s runnin' like water
Slowly, I'm comin' up - scorin' a ounce since fronted nine
Had this n**** - only said what they workin', the block is mine
Got hustlin' skills in my blood - come from my pa
That's how I know the game 'cause at a young age I was taught

Met this bitch named Kitty ­ around-the-way bitch
A nasty hoe that every nigga done hit
But it's cool, though
I'm in it to use the hoe
To hook me up with her brother ­ get the dope and the coke
You know (uh-huh), brother-in-law-type shit
Get cool with the nigga then you know I'm all in
Now he breakin' me off, then put me on my feet
But I got this funny feelin' that the nigga playin' me
Ten ounces a week ­ all the shit at my house
I'ma play it like he playin' - know what I'm talkin' about?
I ain't givin' him shit ­ my nigga, do somethin'
Heard he was a hoe, so he ain't gon' do nothin'
Kitty say I'm down bad, so I smacked the bitch
She ran upstairs and got on the phone quick
and called her brother, and now he pissed off
What would you do? What would you do, dog?

[Turk (verse 2)]
Nigga done plotted
Broke in my crib tryin' to get me ­ I'm in the closet
Hopin' and prayin' that they don't find me
I got a thirty-eight with only two bullets in it
Two niggas ­ What I'ma do? I gotta think quickly
Should I run and try to get away?
Should I stay? Try to shoot both of ?em in the head or the legs?
Man, I'm all fucked up, stuck like chuck, dog
And these niggas really tryin' to bust me up, dog
I swear, if I live through this
Her brother and his boy gon' get killed for this
And I put that on everything ­ you can believe that
Gon' get all of these bullets ­ they gotta bleed for that
Playin' with me? Uh-uh, I ain't havin' it
On the for rizneal, I ain't havin' it
Stupid bitches ain't even check the closet
I'ma start ridin'
What would you do?

[Turk (verse 3)]
Let my mommy and my brother see the car for the day
Not thinkin' these niggas gon' run up with the K
Lookin' for me ­ talkin' ?bout I owe them somethin'
Now if they want to, they could whack moms and my brother
in broad daylight ­ these niggas playin' it raw
Handlin' my folks with the gun in the car
On that dope, so you know that they don't give a fuck
Make one false move, and you know you're stuck
My people scared as hell all because of me
All of these niggas for the last past week
And they tired of waitin', and they wan' do somethin'
Either they get they n's or they gon' shoot somethin'
I gotta do somethin' real real fast
Before it's too late, and I hear that gun blast

It's nothin' to bust a head, put a few wholes in ya sweater
Never get in a situation wit me involvin' guns
Never able to sleep always on tha run
One way or another you gonna come
Outta isolation, if it mean killin' ya ??

That I won't soften ya head & come split it

Grew up around killas, hung wit tha big dawgs

Run ya mouth too much, get found in a hall way
Wit a head shot, look that's how niggas get it
Keep it on a tuck, nobody know who did it

Bitch now you want me behind ya, I don't want have none
You did a dirty deed, bitch you played me sour
You left me stranded like ""Gilligan""
To be honest with you bitch you was killin me

No bath, brushing teeth, or braid my hair

When I'm banging never missing, you can ask my dog
I ain't give a motherfuck about whoever, whatever

Out there head first, had to get me

Stealing through your peeps, when you living that life
Or was it just me, who was living that life
Caught up in these streets, just living this life

Bitch (Bitch better have...)

That bitch better have my money

Mackin' n pimpin' these hoes



[Turk]

I make a bitch call me daddy like I made that bitch


Like I'ma take her to the movies, fuckin' where I meant to
Dressed up keep her healthy tell her crazy shit

Makin' a bitch confused that's what I'm in to

Five minutes all it take, I can brake any race

Black, white, Hispanic it don't matter to me

Cause nigga pimpin' ain't dead, nigga just scared
Lovin' these hoes and steady gettin' paid


Fall weak for a bitch, never did never will

Beat a hoe like Ike nigga that's on the real

Tryna go under, and I find out

Strip her naked put her in a tub of ice in my house
Get a python snake scare the bitch half to death


I bet, I don't have problems after that

Keep my hoes in line, look never disrespect

All they do is make money and bring it back to me



[Kenoe: Chorus x 2]

First I mack the bitch, get her on my team

Make her fall in love fill her head up with dreams

Then I pimp the bitch have her makin' green

All day and night bring it back home to me



[Kenoe (Turk)]

Pimpin' ain't easy that's why we dog these hoes

Might over macks we don't love these hoes

Rule number one, never ever trust a bitch

Cause a hoe will getcha fucked up and leave ya dick sick

Puerto Rican, Dominican all kinds of bitches

Like to suck on they titties put my dick in they kittens

But I'll bat a bitch up if she cross me
Like that hoe named Ashley made her suck me


Bitch please, you try to keep my car

I putcha truck on ?? punch a girl in the jaw

Like Turk said (Bitch you must not know my background)

Night rider, Skinny Pimp n reppin' that Oaktown

Got a ?? in every city and I fly for free


Gettin' brain on the plane gettin' high with me
My uncle Snoop Dogg told me to maintain my G

Fuck a captain save-a-hoe

I make the hoe save me



[Kenoe: Chorus x 2]



[Turk]

Kenoe, look..
Nigga pimpin' ain't easy but somebody gotta do it


Put these hoes to work, make them think it's all good

Gotta let a bitch know where the fuck she stand

Which one wear the skirt and which one wear the pants

I tell a bitch go get money

She bringin' it back

When I program the bitch

Have her bringin' me stacks

All business no pleasure

Cash, no checks
??... just don't play with me




[Kenoe]

You can tell I'm a mack by the way that I talk


You can tell I'm a G by the way that I walk
You can tell I'm super fly by the way that I dress


Ya own momma wanna fuck talkin' bout I'm a mess
Now follow me

I keep a gangsta hoe on my side that'll shank a bitch

I've been in the game been pimpin' hoes and have 'em suckin' dick

Can I take y'all way back to 1996

I've been in the game been pimpin' hoes and have 'em suckin' dick




[Kenoe: Chorus x 2]


[Turk talking]

It's like that

Pimpin' these hoes

It ain't over

you understand?
I gotta send my shouts out


To all the motherfuckin' pimps across town

you understand, that nigga Don Juan

That nigga Pimpin Ken, Ice Berg Slim, ??

My nigga T.I., can't forget my nigga Snoop Dogg he a pimp

Oh boy, my nigga Too Short you understand

And guess what... Turk and Kenoe

Yeah, and it's like that

My niggaz who got the block hot
Ya understand
Check it out, look . . 

[ Verse 1: Turk ]
Everyday all day, I be getting my grind on
So I can live lovely and get my shine on
Early in the morning, to late at night
I be doing my thing, going on flights
Catching the night ramblers, and the early birds
Best believe they coming, all they need is the word
Where the fire at, and they gone crowd your world
Especially if you got big bags of pearl
For the dope fiends
Crack for the crack fiends
Weed for the weed fiends
Coke for the coke fiends
I'm a all around hustler with every drug
And I serve everybody, don't care where you from
When it comes down to money, then I gotta get it
In order to stack hundreds, I gotta get out and get it
And make something out of nothing
Try to shake something
Got enough fetti on the strip for me to shake something

[ Chorus 4x: Turk ]
I hustle eight thousand seven hundred and sixty hours
Nigga, Nigga, you put it together

[ Verse 2: Turk ]
(Look, look)
I hustle 52 weeks straight
12 months, 365 days cause they got money to make
Doing bad is something I hate
That's why I take
Penitentiary chances, every single day
I gotta feed the little one
That's why I do's, what I do's
Behind a project fuckin' building
It's must I make ends meet
Cause ain't no nigga, no nigga gone take care of me
I been strugglin' for too long
That's why I hit the corner and get my groove on
Selling coke and heroine
Watching the words that I speak on my cell phone
From the shop to the block, nigga
Our spot be hot, and I, got it on lock, nigga
And only I got the ki'
So that means, ain't no nigga could hustle with me

[ Chorus 4x ]

[ Verse 3: Turk ]
(Look, look)
All I know is how to sell drugs
How to make a quick come-up, my nigga, and get it in bluff
Been making dirty money all my life
Since 12, got off the porch, my nigga, and started livin' trife
Dropped out of school and I didn't finish
Runnin' the streets so hard, I ran down my tenni's
That's just the way that I was livin'
From sun-up to sun-down, just spinnin' and flippin'
Up and down the block, in and out the hallways
Back and forth to stashes, like a chicken with no head
I had to get paid, 'cause I like nice thangs (why)
Cause them hoes, jocks a nigga who got change
Come on man, you know how it go
Plus a nigga ain't frontin' ya shit no mo
I gotta get me, get it 'till I can't no mo
Ball 'till I fall, 'till it ain't no mo

[ Chorus 4x ]

[ Turk ]
Uh-huh, that's how it's going down, nigga, from my town, to yo' town
Get yo motherfuckin' paper nigga by all means. If you gotta
Murk yo way to get it, work your way to get it
However nigga, get yo shit, nigga. Turk said that. Motherfuck them people
Yeah. And it's like that. I'm a motherfuckin' hustler

Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for

Not if my love can't bind your heart

Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)

Turner Cody,"In a town, in a city, in an eyeball, on a rock
In a fence where a goat was alone by himself

There was a boy Who was there
A boy who built a snowman out of himself

I've been popping out of closets in robin hood suits
I've been spotted in pictures with Navy recruits
Look at your costume you know that it's true
Any one could pop in as you

Try to untie your lips but they were double knotted
I tried to break into you brain but all the entrances were rotted
If the moon had minute hands it would have meant a lot
But God would have made the moon as a clock.

Look, look, look at me doing this
Look, look, look at me doing that
Look, look, look at the way that I am

Bye bye bye to the crazy ones
Bye bye bye to the crazy ones
Bye bye bye to the crazy ones

Look, look, look at the way that I am

Look, look, look at me doing this
Look, look, look at me doing that
Look, look, look at the way that I am

But if everybody was the best
There would be so few of the rest
Oh the places where you've never been
Oh the world was just a baby then

A million ways you learn to cry
When the boy's little waves pass you by
Oh never to be there again
Oh the children where so old-fashioned then

Coffins decked out on the street
Who's the stranger with the purple feet
Don't I remember him from somewhere
Before his feet lost his hair

But if everyone is coffin-bound
Then I'm so scared of being not around
I'm so scared to never make a sound
I'm so scared of being underground

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Little things of jade

And anagrams

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

On main street of an old forgotten town

On weathered stores with open signs
They may as well just close ‘em down

Of moonlight falling on the avenue

And we've all been looking for you

How the holy all have sinned

Well she was born in the morning late October San Antone
Aw she’s every girl I’ve ever known
She don’t talk about religion she talks about the stones
Oh she’s every girl I’ve ever known

And her tongue is like the Devil when she tries to concentrate
She says she don’t want marriage but she still believes in fate
And she stands her ground to defiantly but cries when she’s alone
Oh she’s every girl I’ve ever known

Now her voice it is a melody that sings just like a bird
Oh she’s every song I’ve ever heard
And her heartbeat is a rhythm that commands her every word
Aw she’s every song I’ve ever heard

She reflects the world in happiness and echoes all the pain
Her smiles the world of sunrise her cries to make it rain
And she hides the truth discretely you’d have to take her word
Aw she’s every song I’ve ever heard

She’s a sober Sunday kitchen conversation with my dad
Aw she’s every friend I’ve ever had
Well we never failed to cut a trail whenever times were bad
Oh she’s every friend I’ve ever had

She’s a flighty good time buddy in the corner of the bar
But she’d fight the Devil for ya just for being who you are
And she’s the last to cast a stone though she’d love to leave you mad

Turnpike Troubadours,"Well on a greyhound bound for Shreveport I spent too long in my seat
We stopped off in a no name town to grab a bite to eat
And the ceiling fans they hung above a screened in patio
Crawfish hotter than a chimney fire the beer was cheap and cold
And the bar maid smiled that kind of smile that knocked me off my stool
Said hang around I'll show you things they don't teach in school

Across the way an old blues man was playing on the street
Well he moaned just like a black and tan I found myself a seat
He sang Lord he lives above us and the devil sleeps beneath
He growled it mean and low between his three or four gold teeth

And I wish I was in Shreveport just a gambling like a fool
Yeah you can learn some things down there they don't teach in school

Well I dreamed that night of a pretty girl I dreamed of a riverboat
Til a man in blue kicked at my shoe said come on boy let's go
I said oh officer oh officer please don't take me to jail
He said you can't sleep outside now my hands are tied I knew that feeling all too well
He said if you play in must town son you'll play it by the rules
That downtown time shed light on sights you won't see in school

Out of jail I found myself a walking down the road
So glad to hear that old Jake brake come purring nice and slow
He said I'm gone as far as Fayetville I've got some room to spare
Could you drop me off in fort Smith sir well I've got family there
And he barred the Jack on that big black Mack kicking back I played it cool
From a shotgun seat I learned some things they don't teach in school

Had to nearly come to gun just to get that day
February, only presidents that represent me
Is M-1 and my nigga S-T-I-see
And St. Valentine, he could kiss my ass
The 19th for Malik El-Haj Shabazz
Celebrate him for real, that's love ??
He worked for us, George made us work the field
St. Patrick's Day, crackers better shut they mouth
I'm wearing khakis, pinch me, I'm gonna knock you out
I don't care about no shamrocks or 4-leaf clovers 
Ain't enough luck for cops not filling they quotas
Can't fool me, April 1st, I'm still on ??
Even then I'ma still drop the truth on George
There ain't no Easter egg hunt or no Easter bunny
Just another day for black folk to spend they money
Cinco de Mayo, my Latin homies still ain't free
Capitalism made'em where they still can't eat
So we can't eat
Mother's Day, mamas deserve a lot more 
Than the Sunday they set aside to observe
Memorial Day, never will I do that there
Patriotism for America, I do not care
Father's Day got me thinking about the one's in jail
All the ones who stayed around, all the ones who bailed
Fourth of July, really dog, why ask why
First of all, damn watch the fireworks in the sky
I seen red and blue lights all the time that night
Real guns going off for the ???
Second of all, that ain't my independence day
1776 we was baling hay
Niggas was slaves, busy chasing what they call freedom
And we still wear chains, only now we can't see them
So they made Labor Day 'cause my ??? got jerk?
Even though most niggas still be scheduled to work
Trick or treat, kids? getting candy to eat
Later on down the road start rottin they teeth
And you wonder how the dentists 
Keep gettin dough from us
Trick like the Earth trick Christopher Columbus shit
Hittin America was all a mistake
Stupid faggot ass crackers couldn't find they way
But neither could we 
'cause niggas still fight for this bitch
When the service need soldiers, we the first to enlist
I feel it for vets but how I'ma gon respect they set
They the same white folk that laid the natives to rest
Thanksgiving it's the same, thanks for giving us what
Small pox and gonnorhea from the shit they fuck
All the way up to the ?? make my folk corrupt
Jive turkey, my hollow-points will gobble your guts
And if that ain't enough, right when you think that's it
Christmas the 25th straight takin your ??
Bank accounts cleaned out trying to purchase them gifts
Tis the season for the po' to starve, loadin them clips
Packin them fifths, and you could keep your ho-ho-ho
Gimmie your dough, my house feel so cold
And we need heat, let's be in the spirit to give
I have more than just the wreath 
From the door to your crib nigga

Anyway, back to the jam
Most holidays we celebrate ain't nothing but scams
And lies and tricks and all the real meaning be lost
For me it's time and a half or just another day off
c'mon nigga

Know what I'm sayin
Tired of that bullshit dog
What's up with Huey P. Newton Day 
Or some shit like that, Fred Hampton Day
Fuck that what's up with People Army Day dog
Hedrush Day, DP's Day, I.T Day

Turtle Soup,"We walked hand in hand from the patch 
Playing in the middle of the city 
Down the street we walked westerly 
Wind breezin' through her hair pretty 
My love in the city is good, so good 
When things around me slow down, slow down 
I think about my love in the city, in the city 
I think about my love 
(instrumental, then scat singing) 
I know she waits for me nervously 
Trying to keep busy in the city 
Sleeping in her bed patiently 
Waiting for me, come home with love to me 
My love in the city is good, so good 
When things around me slow down, slow down 
I think about my love in the city, in the city 
I think about my love in the city, in the city 
I think about my love in the city ",Love In the City,1969
Turtle Soup,"I looked at your face; is that the face I love? 
It's been a long time since I've seen you 
You've got a lovely place; the kids must send their love 
We stood there lonely, baby, without you 

CHORUS: 
& girl, you don't have to walk in the rain 
'Cause baby, I know things can be just the same as before 
When you walk through my door, you'll be home, girl 
When you walk through my door, you'll be home 

I was so afraid I almost turned away 
But you know I need somebody to cling to 
I looked at your face; I love you anyway 
It's been a long time since I've seen you

Tuts Washington,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1984
Tuts Washington,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?,1984
Tuts Washington,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1984
Tuts Washington,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1984
Tuts Washington,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Georgia, you'll always be home to me

Tutti Camarata,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1995
Tutti Camarata,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

There are dreams I must gather
Dreams we fashioned the night you held me tight

I'll always be near you wherever you are each night
In every prayer

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber

When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

Here among the shadows, beautiful lady, open you heart.
The scene is set, the breezes sing of it,
Can't you get into the swing of it, lady, when do we start?

When the lady is kissable and the evening is cool,
Any dream is permissible in the heart of a fool.
The moon is high and you're so glamorous,
And if I seem over amorous, lady, what can I do?
The night is young and I'm in love with you.","The Night Is Young and You're So Beautiful, song",2003
Tutti Camarata,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

This could be Paris, this could be London
We've been going hard and fast since sundown

Twelve shows in a row
There's no stopping us
It's what we're living for

10 miles to go, 10 miles to go
10 miles to go until we rock again
Until we rock again

We're driving on, another day behind us
Broken hearts and broken strings won't stop us

Eighteen shows in a row
There's no stopping us
It's what we're living for

10 miles to go, 10 miles to go
10 miles to go until we rock again
Until we rock again

We're gonna make you sing the chorus
That ain't a threat, man, it's a promise
You can try but you can't stop us

The scene is new but all too familiar
Staying up and lack of sleep won't kill ya

And so much better than me
You think you've fooled us all

Forgetting half the stories that you have told
I bet you thought you'd fooled us
And that we'd never know

You're out of luck you couldn't trick her
Paranoia will destroy ya
Don't turn your back or it'll get ya

One girl just ain't enough for you

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Its dying is a brief affair
And then it it brings relief
Yet what convulsive death

So it falls apart

Without my love, my love
these words are not a bit profound

Outside ecstatic love
what did we think we'd find?
Over that broken road
out past the land mines

I'm gonna keep your heart
I'm gonna keep your heart
With the world all falling apart
I'm gonna keep your heart

Can I coax it out its shell
Brush the dust off
Get its wings on
In this little bell
We will also feel the singing, oh

Shine on, light of love
On all these bruises and scars
Ruins in every less
But it can't cancel out the stars

Dropped all your clothes and life
Wonder who won mine
Kneeling above this playful body
Teach Superman to fly

How'm I gonna keep your heart?
How'm I gonna keep your heart?
If the world all falls apart
How'm I gonna keep your heart?

Time alone will tell
If you're the kind who keeps the veil on
Biding time will tell us
When and if to sail on

All these blues I have cried
Seem to have come undone
Tried all the new designs
Still ended up in love

Still we're kind of shy
You've nothing to be ashamed of
Though its hard to tell

 We want to think we´re having fun 
 As we stare into the barrel of a gun",I Know What You Want,1999
TV Smith,"Unless you force yourself to hang on every word you could end up looking like some kind of fool, getting distracted while they write their own rules, what was the last true thing you heard?
I heard I'm going to be the next man on the moon, prosperity is coming soon, scientists have bred a three-winged bird, what was the last true thing you heard?
Someone said that it's a caring, sharing world, the lamb can lay down with the beasts and as the sun sinks slowly in the east, what was the last true thing you heard?
Despite the glamour of the politics, a child of three could do those magic tricks, there's a rumour that the Big Bang never occurred, what was the last true thing you heard?
Sometimes openly, sometimes secretively they sow your good ground with their poisonous seeds.
The line between belief and disbelief is blurred, we've been conditioned to accept the absurd. Thank the lord we're overpaid and underworked, what was the last true thing you heard?",Last True Thing,1999
TV Smith,"A room without a view 
Where the clock has stopped 
Far from the global soapbox, 
The small town circus never comes, 

They roll up the streets at night, 
You're saving up for the bright lights 
But meantime the world rushes on. 
With all these momentous changes 

To take you in your stride. 
All these momentous changes 
And you've got so much on you mind. 
This is the dumbest thing to get so stuck, 

It costs a fortune just to keep up. 
For all that, the money never comes, 
New skills you should be trying, 
All you can offer is joined-up writing, 

Meantime the world rushed on. 
With all these momentous changes 
You´re getting left behind 
By all these momentous changes 

And you've got so much on your mind. 
Someone should pick you out, 
Show you where to start, 
Show you how to take part. 

In all these momentous changes 
You just feel deprived 
By all these momentous changes 
And you've got so much on your mind",Momentous Changes,1999
TV Smith,"Rebels and ranters, 
Holders of banners , 
Anarchists, acid-heads, 
Street marchers, stay in beds, 
Sometimes your protest 
Just won´t get noticed, 
Depends on timing 
Whose star is rising, 
What story´s in the news, 
Which way they pitch the truth, 
Which way they shake it, 
Subvert and shape it 
So they can make it pay 
But you can stand free 
Under the statute of liberty 
Just keep on pushing them away 
Media outcries, sketches and outlines, 
They´re irresistible, one sound-bite 
And you´re full, columns and leaders 
March through their readers 
Until they all think the same 
Chorus 
Who airs the voices? 
Provides the choices 
Of which interest to protect? 
Gags some and not the rest? 
Free speech can scramble, 
Words are a gamble, 
Happends so often and to so many, 
First they are the coming storm 
Then they´re the uniform, 
Then they desert you 
Harass and hurt you 
Until you what they say. 
Chorus",Statute of Liberty,1999
TV Smith,"Right around the corner where our money's spent inside the great white establishment where the rules are bent
I think the wheels are stuck we need a strong horse to pull our carriage out, out of this rut
Our heels are dragging time is standing still they've left us living off the pickings from the landfill

We need a strong horse, a straight back and a sure foot to lift us away up out of this rut.

So awake little Britain, and arise I'm so sick of being put down I feel like I've been vandalised, schoolrooms are bursting with our wasted youth it feels like you're doing something shameful when you tell the truth",Strong Horse,1999
TV Smith,"The bandwagon starts rolling before you even reach your teens, 
Role models for a restless world and the fuel to fill your dreams

Where will you go, when you take your first step on your own? 
Where will you walk? What if they led the way and no-one followed?

They lead you out onto the catwalk like a dog upon a leash, 
They fix your feet upon the party line but there are places it won't reach

[Chorus]
What if you woke up one morning and weren't under the influence? 
What if you won back your independence?

Some routes will take you down the backroads some will take you down the main strip, 
Or you could head off through the undergrowth where the civilized image slips.

[Chorus]",What If?,1999
TV Smith & the Bored Teenagers,"I'm lying in the hospital 
I'm pinned against the bed 
A stethoscope upon my heart 
A hand against my head 
They're peeling off the bandages 
I'm wincing in the light 
The nurse is looking anxious 
And she's quivering with fright 

I'm looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes 
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes 

The doctors are avoiding me 
My vision is confused 
I listen to my earphones 
And I catch the evening news 
A murderer's been killed 
and he donates his sight to science 
I'm looked into a private ward 
I realize that I must be 

Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes 

I smash the light in anger 
Push my bed against the door 
I close my lids across the eyes 
And wish to see no more 
The eyes receives the messages 
And sends them to the brain 
No guarantee the stimuli 
Must be perceived the same 

When looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes 
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes 

Gary don't need his eyes to see 
Gary and his eyes are parted company",Gary Gilmore's Eyes,2007

Toothless, hopeful, about to explode

To wake up looking in her face

All the tears and the smiles shed for me
She'd disappear to the world around me
Everything to be a powerful memory
(so I could carry all that we'd been with me)

So I brought her to the swamp she loved so well
Where I gently placed her in it
I brought her soul to ease with kisses
And I said to her as I's about to begin it

Don't cry
Don't feel
You won't die
Because I don't think death's real
It's good
It's mine
And it should be

And who will take it down? the freedom it brings

No, I can't let them touch me
And I can't let them see
Crack in the wall
The only place I can crawl for safety

I'm crawling inside
But I've still got to know
Why am I afraid to go

Had I slipped into the wrong door
Even though it felt so fine
Crude sunlight rolling through my window
Telling me it's not your time

And still the voices calling, ""Come on""
Crack in the wall
The only place I can crawl to safety

When I was dead
Three headless voices that said they loved me
Such a love was blinding
There I can't fall

And the floor is the wall I'm scaling

Gonna give them all the slip
I've had it
I've got to abandon ship
Never gonna go back there

Never gonna go back there

I've got to abandon ship

While looking over my shoulder
At the older, taller man saying, “No, no, no”

With colored candy, colored nuts
All sold by the weight

Here’s where it all begins

So shut the door and shut off the light
Guess, I’m staying here tonight
It’s been a long time

My first painting in class
He took one to finish it
Painting white on the background, I got upset
The painting didn’t end up in the show
He told me later

It was because the teacher said
It wasn’t good at all
We were pretending this in the lobby earlier
But I don’t play bass
As my grandmother pointed out 4 crocodiles
Or maybe they were alligators

Guess, I’m staying here tonight
So shut the door and shut off the light
Guess, I’m staying here tonight

I’ll be late
Don’t stay up and wait

Yet in steaming night I smile to downplay this, my failing
And make a noise to bury all of your weeping and your wailing

And then in bed by a little light, I'm closed off from it all
I must try and bring a conscious end tonight
And hope that dreams begin to fall

The color of my dreams, they would be you, Ruby
Oh, if I could close my eyes and bring you to me
And push your head into, make you not you, not you, not you but me

And then in dreams I wander free
And see some things I'm meant to be
And sometimes even I see thee

And would the night go on and on
And not tomorrow end at dawn?
Whatever mat I lay upon, dissolve

The color of my dreams, if I had dreams, they would be you, Ruby
Everything I do is done to bring you closer to me
When you sleep your breath, it blows in right on through me, oh

Help soak this silky disguise
Pull back my mask and watch me die

A killer lurks inside

Tossing and turning I fight
My stomach can't hold what's inside
The promise of sleep I can't find

A sleepwalkers murderous plight
To kill the demons at night
Has left me with no place to hide

Strike Up the Band and Babes in Arms

In the mornin' I will always feel you touchin' on me.
I got another man,
But he ain't like you.

So take a red eye.

up and down my spine.
I'll give what you been missin,.

If everyday I saw sunshine and it never rained the blues
If my fear's with tears I wonder could they fall
If a smile could stretch a mile even if I had no money at all

But I'm willing to take whatever life brings
Cause you're the only one that seems to know me
And even if the bad times call

If I had you back I wouldn't complain at all
I wouldn't complain at all

I can dream about tomorrow even if it's still today
I'd wear down my knees every night even if I had no hands to pray
If my friends were dead and gone leaving me here alone
Could I depend on some spirit to ease me when my soul's on its own
If my eyes were blind and I couldn't feel at all to see
Nothing in this world but you complete me
And even if the bad times call

If I had you back I wouldn't complain at all
I wouldn't complain at all

Come back to me

If you just want to hang out with the boys
I wouldn't complain
I wouldn't make a fuss no not a noise
I wouldn't complain
Leave your socks on the dresser and not in the drawer
I wouldn't complain
Just as well if you want to watch your favorite sport baby
I wouldn't complain
Change my way of living
I wouldn't complain
Show you much understanding

So shook I had to catch my breath

Swallow my pride, let it ride
And parted, but this body felt just like mine

""If the thought processes of an individual can be permanently limited
To the point of strict conformity to an outside source of thought,

She does not fit official standards

There's something in her eyes that says
The struggle's gone too deep

Watching acolytes of doubt
Try hard to fight their problems out

To spread the message

In papers full of lies
She hears that every time she breathes
Some foreign kiddy dies
She's convinved it's her fault
She's tortured by the strain
As words of judgement pour out of the
Mouths of those who make their mark
By keeping people in the dark
Those who bite worse than they bark
Are loudly shouting

A private vocation has no sense of nation.

The maintenance of power can be so fulfilling,
Just as long as all the slaves are willing.

So this is an order:
We must curb thought disorder.
With a miniature transmitter
We can pavlov the litter
And train it to do as we tell it,
State surgeon, the seed plant
Thought soon get a new slant.
So tiny a dogma idea turn to quagmire,
Thrum-humming transistor a brain wave insistor,
Closed circuit hypnosis an inbuilt psychosis,
Not one self expression deliberate supression.
A cycle to squeeze out anyone who we doubt
Will must be pliable to be reliable.""

The sun will still rise, I thank the most high

The sun will keep on shining
(I'mma keep on shining)
The sun gon' keep on shining
Give love to the most high God

Even if they hit me on sight
Everything gon' be alright
Everybody have a good night
We gon' make it to the daylight
Even if they hit me on sight
Everything gon' be alright
Everybody have a good night
We gon' make it to the daylight

I can't even begin to explain the type of epidemics representing Carol City
Killing then little youngins really ill in these streets
We tryna make a way to put the foolishness to sleep
Keep mixing the antidote
No nonsense my mama metallic gold
Play my cards just 'cause it's harder come to recognize I got a clean slate
And finally getting to the point of feeling free-ee
Hovers my energy
Body scars put the pain in my heartbeat so I gotta drop ether
We touch the soul because we young niggas that gotta eat
They perpetrating promoting the shit they gotta reap
My family is the reason that I even speak
Every decent memory of people still be living shife
And you ain't really gotta die to lose your life
Think about it, it's a lot of niggas living outta sight
How 'bout you niggas ride the pipe as we reaching higher heights

The sun will keep on shining
(I'mma keep on shining)
The sun gon' keep on shining
Give love to the most high God

Even if they hit me on sight
Everything gon' be alright
Everybody have a good night
We gon' make it to the daylight
Even if they hit me on sight
Everything gon' be alright
Everybody have a good night
We gon' make it to the daylight",Good Night,2017

Twentieth Century Fox Orchestra,"He's not so good in a crowd
But when you get him alone
You'd be surpised
He isn't much at a dance
But then when he takes you home
You'd be surpised
He doesn't look like much of a lover
Don't judge a book by its cover
He's got the face of an angel
But there's a devil in his eyes
He's such a delicate thing
But when he starts into squeeze
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look very strong
But when you sit on his knee
You'd be surprised
At a party or at a ball
I've got to admit
He's nothing at all
But in a modest chair
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look like much of a lover
Don't judge a book by its cover
'cause he's got the face of an angel
But there's a devil in his eyes
He doesn't say very much
But when he starts into speak
You'd be surprised
He's not so good at the start
But at the end of the week
You would be surprised
On a streetcar or in a train
You'd think he was born
Without any brain
But in a taxicab
And when he starts to grab
I said a taxicab
You'd be surprised
This one's a real danger",You'd Be Surprised,1996
Twentieth Century Fox Orchestra,"Oh, it really wasn't my intention
To disregard convention
It was just an impulse
That had to be obeyed

Though it seems convention we've been scorning
I'll still not go in mourning
Though my reputation
Is blemished, I'm afraid

With just one kiss
What heaven, what rapture, what bliss

Honestly, I thought you wouldn't
Naturally, you thought you couldn't
And probably we shouldn't
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Actually, it all was blameless
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless
So let's keep the lady nameless
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Socially, I'll be an outcast
Obviously, we dined alone
On my good name there will be doubt cast
With never a sign of any chaperon

No matter how they may construe it
Whether or not, we have to rue it
Whatever made us do it
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?

Whatever made us do it
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?",Aren't You Kind of Glad We Did?,1997
