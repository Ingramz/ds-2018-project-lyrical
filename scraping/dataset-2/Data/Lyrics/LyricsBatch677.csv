Ashton Shepherd,"I've gotta pocket full of money I shouldn't spend
To drink him away again
My heart stops cold in my chest
There he is in the back of the bar lookin' his best
He passes me by and grabs a stranger's hand
He pulls her on the floor to dance
Oh no, I don't understand
He don't even know who I am

He's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman 
I should've already set myself free
From that old memory that don't remember me
He don't remember me

But I remember the smell of his cologne
And tonight he has it on
And I remember the feel of his skin
And I can't help but go back there again

No He's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman 
I should've already set myself free
From that old memory that don't remember me
He don't remember me",Old Memory,2008
Ashton Shepherd,"Hey, hey now
Don't you wanna come down
Bring your guitar
Here we play music with our own sound
A lot of our friendship and music's been born 
And bred right here in our backyard at the pickin' shed

I remember the first time I walked through the door
I felt at home though I'd never been in there before
The band was playing and I sang a few songs
I gotta admit I was hooked from then on

Hey, hey now
Don't you wanna come down
Bring your guitar
Here we play music with our own sound
A lot of our friendship and music's been born 
And bred right here in our backyard at the pickin' shed

Its the place we built for the music that we play
Or you can shoot pool or you can throw darts any day
Its like our own private bar that's open every night
There ain't no closin' time
And no rules to go by

Hey, hey now
Don't you wanna come down
Bring your guitar
Here we play music with our own sound
A lot of our friendship and music's been born 
And bred right here in our backyard at the pickin' shed

And there's never any pressure
You can just relax
And if you ever hang out here
I bet you're gonna come back

Hey, hey now
Don't you wanna come down
Bring your guitar
Here we play music with our own sound
A lot of our friendship and music's been born 
And bred right here in our backyard at the pickin' shed

Right here in our backyard
At the pickin' shed",The Pickin' Shed,2008
Ashton Shepherd,"I'm not tryin' to start anything
By comin' up to you tonight
I know that he's yours now
It's sinkin' in with time
But tonight I've had to much to drink
And he stays on my mind
I just wanted to say he's the best thing you'll ever find

'Cause he ain't your regular Joe ya know
And I'm the crazy fool who let him go 
And if he says he loves you 
Then that's what he means
He's the best man I've ever seen
I just wanted you to know
He ain't your regular Joe

She turned to me sharply
And said you think I don't know that 
I can't believe you even spoke to me 
What nerve you must have
I said no you don't understand 
You don't wanna be in my shoes
It took him leavin' me 
Before I ever knew

That he ain't your regular joe you know? 
And I'm the crazy fool that let him go 
And if he says he loves you then that's what he means
He's the best man I've ever seen 
I just wanted you to know he ain't your regular Joe

So she drove home from that bar 
To say that She was sorry to him
She was wrong to have stormed out to go 
Somewhere she shouldn't have been
He said hey baby that's okay
Everybody has their days
That's when she turned to him to say

You ain't your regular Joe,
You know?
And I don't ever plan to let you go
Cause when I say I love you
Then that's what I mean
You're the best man I've ever seen
Oh baby, I love you so
You ain't your regular Joe",Regular Joe,2008
Ashton Shepherd,"Hey baby, let's jump in yo' truck
We'll ride and watch for lightnin' bugs
We'll ride with the windows let down
There's nowhere else I'd rather be right now

'Cause there ain't nothin' like the sound
Of a cooler slushin' on the bed 'a yo' truck
And ain't nothin' like the sound of real country music
C'mon, turn it up
And I love to hear the whippoorwill singin' at night
And the crickets out in the woods
Ooh, (and) don't it feel so right
Don't it sound so good

We'll stop on a ol' dirt road bridge
Do you remember when we painted our names on it
And we'll listen to the creek as it runs
And we'll count the stars
Every single one

'Cause there ain't nothin' like the sound
Of a cooler slushin' on the bed 'a yo' truck
And ain't nothin' like the sound of real country music
C'mon, turn it up

And the crickets out in the woods

Don't it sound so good",Sounds So Good,2008
Ashton Shepherd,"I had a headache when I woke up this morning
And a picture of you beside my head
And I drank 'till two
And I fell lying on the floor
The whiskey won the battle 
But your memory won the war

And I can't figure out
Just what went wrong
I play it in my head
Like an old Hank Williams song
And I can't do this
I can't do this anymore
The whiskey won the battle
But your memory won the war

Oh, and it tears me up
Knowing she's with you
Oh, and I drink some more
For your memory I gotta lose

I had a headache when I woke up this morning
And a picture of you beside my head
Oh, and I drank 'till two
And I just fell lying on the floor

Yeah, yeah

Ashton Shepherd,"It's gonna be a scorcher of a day and the water is callin'
Got an iced down cooler and a seventeen footer we're haulin'
Baby, back her down the ramp and don't jackknife it
Let's see how many people we can fit inside it
I think we've got half of the town invited 

For some beer on a boat on a Saturday
A few good friends just floatin' away
The world looks better through a cool pair of shades
With some beer on a boat on a Saturday

Got the girls on the inner tube 
Hangin' on tryin' to prove what they got
And if you ain't wet yet 
Then Buddy's gonna get you with a belly flop
There's some boys on the dock wavin' and whistlin'
Some old men yellin' that we're messin' up their fishin'
But they're just jealous cause they know they're missin' on

Some beer on a boat on a Saturday
A few good friends just floatin' away
The world looks better through a cool pair of shades
With some beer on a boat on a Saturday

Ain't nothin' like a sunny day to make your troubles fade away and disappear
Wouldn't be all bad if we all ran out of gas and got stuck here

With some ice cold beer on a boat on a Saturday
A few good friends just floatin' away
The world looks better through a cool pair of shades
With some beer on a boat on a Saturday

Gettin' redder by the minute but we got it made
With some beer on a boat on a Saturday",Beer on a Boat,2011
Ashton Shepherd,"Bobby said, I gotta get outta this town
Pulled up the roots that his Daddy laid down
Country boy thought he'd try the city life
Tired of workin' the dirt, watchin' the sky
I won fifty bucks off of Bobby's little sister
She said he'd last a month, I said it'd be quicker
Bobby said, it wasn't what he thought it was
He had to come back to the place he loves

'Cause there ain't much of nothin' out here
Just a bunch of fence and pasture
Grain elevators and a couple old tractors
Little bitty church, big ole steeple
Ain't no noise, no red lights
Ain't no buildings messin' up my moonlight
Ain't no doubt, why I live out 
Where there's more cows than people

I saw on the news where the interstate
Might be movin' out this way
To make this a better place to live
Well hell, I like it just like it is

'Cause there ain't much of nothin' out here

Ashton Shepherd,"Have you ever rode a dirt road with the windows rolled down 
Smelling that honeysuckle vine 
Riding for no reason and you're lookin' not seeing 
A house but every few miles 
Have you ever been rockin' on the porch with your daddy 
Watchin' the world turn slow
That's where country grows

It's in the hearts of those who know what life's all about
It's laying your head on your pillow and fallin' to sleep proud
You bow your head to Jesus 'cause He's where it all comes from 
And you know He'll forgive you for the wrong you've done 
Ooh, it's in the earth and the church and the words that we speak slow
That's where country grows

Have you ever seen a young boy open up the door 
For an old lady walkin' in slow 
Or a shoe polish heart on a second hand car 
Saying ""Shelly loves Billy"" on the window 
Have you ever heard a mama cry saying goodbye 
But she knows her soldiers gotta go, oh 
That's where country grows

It's in the hearts of those who know what life's all about 
It's laying your head on your pillow and fallin' to sleep proud 
You bow your head to Jesus cause He's where it all comes from 
And you know He'll forgive you for the wrong you've done 

Ooh, it's in the earth and the church and the words that we speak slow
That's where country grows

You bow your head to Jesus cause He's where it all comes from 
In the end He'll forgive us for the wrong we've done 

Ooh, it's in the earth and the church and the words that we speak slow

Ashton Shepherd,"The word is faithful, look it up
It don't mean sneakin' around
Behind my back like you ain't gettin' enough
How 'bout forever,
Just look it up
It means through thick and thin
And  pitchin' in even when the times get tough

The word is easy, look it up
And you'll see a picture of that piece of trash
Ridin' 'round in your pickup truck
Let's try liar,
Just look it up
But you'll need boots to wade through all the bull
You tell me when you come home drunk
It's just like you to be so clueless
'Cause you never thought I'd do this

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up

You said you're sober, look it up
It's right next to hell is freezin' over,
Flyin' pigs, and all that stuff
And how bout baby, look it up
It's what you call me and it's how you act
Every time I call your bluff
It's just like you to keep denyin'
Save your whinin' and your cryin'

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up

The word's forgiveness, look it up
It's what Jesus has in store for you
But I don't no matter what
Quit your beggin' and your prayin'
Can't you hear what I've been sayin'?

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up

Asshole

Just look it up, look it up",Look It Up,2011
Ashton Shepherd,"You call me up to tell me that you're sorry, 
But sorry is as sorry does

You can call it what you want to,
But dammit, don't you dare call it love

You've got the nerve to ask me if I'm OK, 
Boy give it a rest.

'Cause I'm good, and getting' better at being my best.

They say time can heal all wounds, 
Well the sooner the better for me

'Cause a heart at war 
Dang sure will make you be all that you can be

You tore me down piece by piece 
But believe me there's plenty of me left.
Boy I'm good, gettin' better at being my best.

I've been thrown a lot of curves in this ol' world 
But it's only made me strong
I suggest you do what I've done 
And make this call your last one, and move on
No's my final answer, rest assured 
That I'm not after anything less
Boy I'm good, gettin' better at being my best.

Oh I've cried a river, but you don't remember,
Let me refresh your memory one last time.

Ashton Shepherd,"I guess I'm just a woman
And that's why I feel the way I do
Sometimes I wanna hold you tight
And other times I wanna yell at you
And sometimes I'm happy
Proud as I can be feeling glad
And sometimes I wanna cry
Because I feel so sad

And I guess I'm just a woman
And that's what women do
We carry the weight of the world on our shoulders
Making sure every little thing goes through
And I know you're doing all you can
And I know that after all
You were just a man
But you should understand
That I am just a woman
I guess I'm just a woman

And certain things stand out to me
See I worry when you treat me like a stranger
But you greet the stranger on the street
And there's bills on the table
And I am a banker you would think
When you're a mama and a wife
Let me tell you
There ain't many things you ain't

Yes I am just a woman
And that's what women do
We carry the weight of the world on our shoulders

Ashton/Becker/Dente,"Where there is love there is a peace 
And in the cages that bind the bitter heart it is release 
Hold it close to your chest, let it move and let it rest 
For it is here to set your mind at ease 
Where there is love there is a peace. 

Where there is hope there is a dream 
To rise above, to remit and to redeem 
To go back, to go where there's no hurt or anger there 
To find the song that you once could sing 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is faith there is a chance 
To alter the course and fight the winds of circumstance 
Not to scar, but mend, not to break, but to bend 
And not to know but to understand 
Where there is faith there is a chance 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is love there is a peace...

I get a little bit closer

Were ever real, were ever really happening

Ashwin Sood,"Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon
And dig your grave
Heartless challenge

Pick your path and I'll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise- loves- to go down
Lousy lovers- pick their prey

But they never cry out loud
Did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love

Is it over now- do you know how
Pick up the pieces and go home.
Rock on- ancient woman
Follow those who pale

In your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Did she make you cry

Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now- do you know how
Pickup the pieces and go home.",Gold Dust Woman,1999
Ashwin Sood,"The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous

The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

[Chorus]
Mama's in the fact'ry
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for the fuse
I'm in the streets
With the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

[Chorus]

Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""

The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
Saving, ""The sun's not yellow it's chicken"" Chorus

The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

[Chorus]

The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
'Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

[Chorus]

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

We have to run, life has just begun

Asia,"This problem is insoluble
The answers seem impossible

Who tells the wind which way to blow?
I wonder who will stop the rain
The rocks that hold the secrets, they don't know
So who can stop the rain?

We've lost the path for all we know
Now tell me when will it start again?
And as the old man lifts his hands
Please can you stop the rain?

Like they never did before
A new moon shining
Like it never will again

Anytime that you call
Anytime if you fall
Anytime I'll be there for you
Any moment of fear
Anytime say the prayer
Swear that our word is true

Should I go
Should I stay?
I won't turn my head away
Cross the line, the great divide
So kill the silence, where we hide

Oh, never a moments doubt
Oh, feel it so scream it loud

Are you losing your touch?
And if you walk away
Don't you know you'd better change

From these early days
Don't want to let go

Was it so good
To paint the face the scars of youth?

A silent dare

Oh how he ran
So he lived his life alone
Where he lay was home
Then they made him move along

From town to town
With his head held down
Then he turned towards the gun
Again how he ran

From the badge he had no chance to understand
Oh how he ran

Don't cut the wire, in the final hour

He always thought of you

Shoulder to the stone again
Praying for the evening
Hiding as the fist hits steel

Enough's enough

As we push against the tide?

You must breathe on
You must be strong

Lighting up the mind, as the wind blows stronger

Pushing back the sea, as the storm is calling on
Louder than before, in the raging river
Faster than the stream, will it last forever?
Holding back the time, as the world stops turning

Feels like love...
Tell me, does it feel like love?
We look to the sky, to the statue of hope

(scratched)
I've got a few things I wanna say

(Gift of Gab)
I'm gunnin', ya runnin away, do not stay
'cause the wrath of the gift will be hittin' ya spliff
And a lot of the crews got sprayed and yelled RAID
Like a couple of roaches, as struggle approaches,
A brother'll blow this
Another ferocious jam, I smother the ?grossagran?
I hover above the land of lame emcees that don't blow
I'm poppin' the clip and then bo bo with the gun
And a once in a munch chest, rest in peace
And I ?bellow you to beast? I abolish emcees with sounds like these
Run over enemies and I rest in the west
Dark hemisphere, burn wit a fear is nothin but a mere setback
Hear when I'm here,
Earn wit a clear conscience in the middle of the jet black
I'm a dog, running through the jungle
Wit a hoodie and black hat choppin down ?noonsies?
Not a frog, cunning yet I'm humble
Gotta do the jewels tack wack talkin clowns
Tip me, I'ma knock 'em all around, bust a front
With a fat blunt swinging on a vine in the homeland
I'ma tack 'em in the sound little punks when the rap bump
Springin on the rhyme I bowl man
Gifted when I'm lifted off a spliff hit,
Reminisce shit, riff with dipshits
This shit is the mischievous style of the gifted,
I'm a whiz kid, get a whiff kid
Swingin' down low, breakin' down flows
With a new flow medley outgrow when you step back
To the black with a fat rap with a fat sack
With a little bit a funk in my napsack
Take it back to the brother land
And I was smotherin' stupid idiots like Tarzan
Givin' back to the brother man and get another land,
Man gimme it, its Or-land-o
How easy and tight wishin' into the depths
Up in the sound in the heart of the jungle
Gettin' wild with the art of the rumble,
Never amount to be smarter than Dumbo
Make 'em mumble, make 'em humble,
Get me round from the start, you will crumble,
And you tumble, and you stumble
And I do it like that
From the end to the other end never gonna end,
Set a trend with the maniac mic clutch
Hey ?bob by the ba?, said you keep your day job
My competitors never know the right touch
Have to bail through the backstreets, raisin' hell to a black beat
Rappers fail to attack me, like a sail with the slack g
I attack 'em like acne, exactly UGH

(spoken)
Mindless cretins grow through idiosynchrosy
Peels up, rising up, down

(Lateef)
Steppin' up through the deep, dank murkiness
No telling what is lurking
I hero it, but will I sense a jerkin
I proceed to bust a buster
'cause I trust the finer design in the mind of the rhyme
Just about impossible to find
What a disgrace to the race of wack mc's
I am because I choose to stand my ground
FIRM and blowin' the rhythm the vermin and learnin'
All I know is we've earned every entry attained
And strained the game, and what I'm tryin' to explain is that
The deeper we're creepin' the more we find sleepin'
And slippin' just shootin' dead lips on a mission
Its missin' the reason the gift we've been given the rhythm
'cause that just the way we've been livin
And thrive in the essence, survive and its easy
To recognize when analyzing ?the bo?
Surprises the lame in this line and tryin'
To get you to buy into their fantasy world
Can it be damaged the ?emina? bones
Of the fellas and men that's exploting my culture
Can't understand every breast that you touch
Was as up ?paper scun? be one hung motherfucker
Such as nowadays, its fallin' and splinterin', just timber, instead of
Gettin out of my way, and what I'm -- meaning to say is that
The canopy that covers me now is the blackest, attack this
I thought we already established the wackness
Presented in the cemented jungle
By the bumblin' brothers stumblin' tumblin' down
Surround me in a cannibalistic style, but I just smile and
Silence 'em like the lambs, they all the whole flock
We just one magic stock style
I'm gettin' 'em off like crack viles, and wicked the whole fuckin while
Not trippin over no vines, or over no swine, or over no mines
Or over no line at the plot
Thinkin' of whippin' 'em like a glock in the jungle

(spoken)
Now in the beginning of the journey
Not in time, but in the mind
Imagine the camels being loaded up
The men, loading themselves up
It's a long journey -- the oasis is all in the clamor
As we start from the top we go to the very bottom
Of a myserious place -- a very mysterious place
What's that I see? Ahhhh

I can't even describe you, so I ain't even gon' try...hmmmm
Making hell of mc Asia is now this I don't dispute but you knew
You knew Lyrics Born was a ripped off note sheet of a hundred
And you scrape the paint off your bumpers making sure you beat the buzzer
Making sure Lyrics Born came out his mother's stomach
Covered with the lyrics that kill
No bumper, right? 'cause mo'fucka
I know you can make colors rhyme
And have the whole goddamn planet yellin uncle at you and even
Still take the time big up little ?egg?, can you imagine?
Big up Asia Born, this little bottle
Or that you would even be lightly concerned with little, little words
That you would tug at the line, pullin' the kind
Of lyrics out my mouth that make me big bad don, takin' kids' legs home
You can't even back a sliver roach, you know
That type shit, and then watch me wreck this stage
Boy like I got your daddy's style hangin' around my waist
And then watch me forget -- the way
Good lyrics taste, thinkin' I just ain't little rabbit eyes in your heart
Man, 'cause if I thought it was just
Lyrics Born that made lyrics born, lyrics born
And then suddenly I can't do no more, I'd be like

Off of my perts I automatically look good
Make my way to ya door
Hopin' they like a gentlemen
Take you by the arm
A Kodak flash
Take you to the bar
Buy ya your favorite drink or two
And all ain't gettin' it
So I can try to sleep with you
What person in their right mind wouldn't wanna be wit' you
You da type I take home and show to my peoples boo

end himself. One of the attackers got injured and later died after refusing treatment. Satpal was subsequently charged with murder.

Satpal was provided with lawyers who refused to argue his case. They made him change his plea of self-defence to that of manslaughter. Most of the prosecution evidence came from the group that attack
ed Satpal.

The all-white jury missed vital evidence because no interpreter was provided. The judge said he would interpret but couldn't speak a word of Bengali.

The jury weren't asked to consider if Satpal's actions were in self-defence and found him guilty.

Buried deep beneath your feet

Remain a mystery

Obliterated wisdom, covered up faces 

Truth is lost in the mists of eMpTy Vision, 
And found in the notebooks of those 
Wrongfully imprisoned, 
And in the evidence that was never brought to trial, 

But not in the void behind the newsreaders' smile. 
Truth hides whenever we lose our focus 
Slips out the back, quickly replaced by the bogus, 
Fleeing soundbites disguised as facts 

That reappear in the small print on every contract 
Truth hides on the other side of a two-way mirror 
In countless documents sent straight to the shredder 
That might finally give us the whole of the picture 

But until the day we decide to dig a little deeper 
We know that truth will hide 
Under fallen rocks and stones 
At the end of a disconnected phone

coming home to roost on a Soviet landmine

Walking through the. station breaking into a cold sweat

Have you been snorting white lines with President Gas
Crawling from the wreckage of my tumblin' tower block

It was the enemy of the enemy

At the mercy of the skies there's no escape velocity
And as your eyes meet my skin see the terror on your face
Do You want it to stop put yourself in their place
Where what your life is worth depends on where you live
Too many generations down the line to forgive

I've noticed you only contact me when I've got some weed
And when I'm in need to help you with something you need to do
I must have been a fool 'cause now I see the real you
You couldn't even look me in the eye
I knew something was wrong you can't justify -it's all lies
Telling me other's business and telling me how they be 
Come to think about it you could be doing it to me
The pieces of the puzzle are now fitting into place
I know what kind of person you are you're a disgrace
I don't hold a grudge even though what you did
I just can't trust you with absolutely anything
If I see you it just hi and bye keep going my way
'cause I've got things to do, I've got bills to pay
I've had enough of your two faced company
And that's the way its going to be my friend welcome to reality
Remember the times it was cold outside
Everyone said blurt but I said na come to mind
Hours and hours of blazin', feel fine
did you think your parents would allow it at that time
I didn't think so well now you know how
It was growing up with ungrateful brothers about
makes me want to scream ,makes me want to shout
ask what I did for them and their mind blacks out
Day by day pushin me away others them a turn
others stayed tried to relate
to make me see I was wrong no its too late
back biting,street fighting it the mess that was made
Great I spent half my life with you guys
Now you want to cut and rush me in front of my mothers eyes
I don't know why you did it and you was high
Two face people die twice no lie
To all them a boy them a liar liar
With their mouths on fire they say it's human nature
they are playing with lives
slowly burning wire
You'd better be aware 'cause in the end you'll suffer
Two Face,two bait when it's written on your face
Two fake, too straight when your out on the estate
after all the lies you've gone and spread about me
You put on your disguise and go on like we're sweet
Who needs enenies when you've got brothers like these
they be smiling when they're with you
but you know it's full of cheese
Oh please who else be trying to eat up our cake
Your'e two,you're two,you're two face
'cause they're the masters of deception
they want to bring you down
your phone keeps ringing taking you for a clown
The threats keep coming make you want to leave town
not before you find out who's behind this showdown
Your best friends been makin others real mad
you're tellin this dude eveything and now it's real sad
he's rollin with your enemies and now they seem glad
they know all they need and got their pen to the pad
So why do they do what they do against you
Fake arsed brothers you're life they want to screw
It's true when I say all they want is attention
to satisfy their needs with no consideration
To all those people who've got more than one face
You better be on your defense 'cause now were on the case
The mace that you sprayed has been cleared from my eyes
what comes around goes around you better realize
chorus 2

They come down your home pretend to be your mate
but deep inside their souls it's just you that they hate
And whenever you were hungry you placed food on their plate
and any time they were in trouble
you always helped them escape
Indirect or direct they try to put you down
put you down,low down,way down
underground with no sound
And all the bullshit that they talk
they can't just even hold down
with their mouth full of rubbish

Talk to me, just tell it like it is 
Just two afraid souls
Going at each other, at each other 

We're at the crossroads going separate ways
Time to say it as it is 
And if we bump into each other one day 
It will be better, then 
Maybe we can start all over again

It's the state of conscience that makes me go blind

We are gathered here I'll be staying this time

Askil Holm,"I come from down in the valley 
Where mister when you're young 
They bring you up to do like your daddy done 
Me and Mary we met in high school 
When she was just seventeen 
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green 

We'd go down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we'd ride 

Then I got Mary pregnant 
And man that was all she wrote 
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat 
We went down to the courthouse 
And the judge put it all to rest 
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle 
No flowers no wedding dress 

That night we went down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we did ride 

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company 
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy 
Now all them things that seemed so important 
Well mister they vanished right into the air 
Now I just act like I don't remember 
Mary acts like she don't care 

But I remember us riding in my brother's car 
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir 
At night on them banks I'd lie awake 
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take 
Now those memories come back to haunt me 
They haunt me like a curse 
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true 
Or is it something worse 
That sends me down to the river 
Though I know the river is dry 
That sends me down to the river tonight 
Down to the river 
My baby and I

Please Don't Lie
Or have my legs been rubberized
Tell me true friend am I high

Or was it the booze that got me so confused
Perhaps that cocaine caused me to exclaim

And deny the part of me that says you'll leave me too
Cause yesterday reminds me  that what I've lost is gone
Your love may linger on  but I wonder

It's the noise that you hear when my baby hits town.
With his long hair flyin', man, he's hard to take.
What you s'posed to do when your baby thinks he's a train?

He eats money like a train eats coal.
He burns it up and leaves you in the smoke.
If you wanna catch a ride, you wait 'til he unwinds.
He's just like a train, he always gives some tramp a ride.

You need some compensation to get back in the black

And read the situation from the front to the back

So put it right back in the rack, jack

And lead the life of Riley in a beaten down shack

Asleep at the Wheel,"My pappy said son you gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln

Have you heard the story about the hot rod race
When the Ford and the Lincoln were settin' the pace
That story's true I'm here to say
Cause I was a drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders and uses them all
And an overdrive that just won't stall

It's got a 4-barrel carb and dual exhausts
4:11 gears that really get lost
Safety tubes and I'm not scared
The brakes are good and the tires are fair

We left San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars were shinin' bright
We were drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passin' cars like they were standin' still

Then all of a sudden, in the wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said boys that's the mark for me
But by then the taillights was all you could see

Now the fellers ribbed me for bein' behind
So I started to make that Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it down into overdrive

Well I wound it up to hundred and ten
Twisted the speedometer cable hit top end
Had my foot glued right to the floor
I said that's all there is there ain't no more

Now the fellas thought I'd lost all sense
The telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said slow down I see spots
The lines on the road just looked like dots

I took a corner and passed a truck
I crossed my fingers just for luck
The fenders clickin' the guard rail post
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

Smoke was comin' outta the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him and hoped I could pass
But when I did I'd be short on gas

Had flames comin' from out of the side
You could feel the tension man what a ride
I said look out boys I've got a license to fly
And the Cadillac pulled over and let me by

Now all of a sudden a rod started knockin'
Down in the depths she started a rockin'
I looked in the mirror and a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln

They arrested me and put me in jail.
They called my pop to throw my bail.
And he said son you're gonna drive me to drinkin'

Asleep at the Wheel,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit path that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Her lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit path by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

But it wasn't really serious 
'Cause we were much too young
Number two felt more true with each line
Number three, chemistry, but
Inevitably wrong for me
Number four, he was too old for me
And I never loved so hard
Never hurt so bad
Never been such a fool for love
And I never want so bad 
Just to do it all again
Find one who's golden
Never let go when it's love
Or you'll find yourself waiting alone
And you'll dream back the way that it was
And wonder which was love
Which was love
Number five, hello goodbye
He was sort of famous 
So it was a story for a while
Number six, why should color matter
Number seven, should be revving
But he wanted to get deep too fast
Number eight, vulnerable me
And I never loved so hard
Never hurt so bad
Never been such a fool for love
And I never want so bad 
Just to do it all again
Find one who's golden
Never let go when it's love

And I don't mind dreaming 
But if it's all a waste 
If your heart won't breathe 
I'll choose to stay awake 
And make a mess

The sun in me will die if you bottom out 
So while smiles don't stick around 

I'll be here 
If you want me 
I'll be here 
If you need me 
I'll be hanging on a cloud of open invitation 
Holding on to that keeping you here 

Sounds like a roof came down on you 
Left windows nagging 
and you were edged between getting away 
And feeling slapped and blue 
Here's a song that will never be too far 
My love protest of how I care 
So while you feel that you're caught there 

I'll be here

So forgive me if I sing nervous 
For once I'm gonna be assertive

That you, too, need to know you've heard it 

So here's to believe 
That I'm feeling love for you 
Here's to believe 
My heart is on your side 
Here's to believe

While looking for a melody to come alive 
So come alive 

Listen close and look as I stumble deeper and you will see 
'Cuz you can hear under my breath when I hardly breathe 
More than butterflies 
I'm feeling hot like bricks on me 
And simple words are so so far from coming to me 
So I'm making my own measure

With a promise you'll feel better 
If you read this song like a love letter

funny how 4 weeks ago

Why gotta shut me slowly down? The road from here

What a selfish thing to do now leave me stranded here

How I thought that years would count for something good
But to erase the loneliness it warns me
Officially my kiss will miss you

The places we could be doing now
Unfortunate and shamed you're totaled out of touch from me

Did you ever know how much I felt for you?
But to defend the damage done
Outweighs the crush eroded, you're demoted

To know you know I'd give the sequence of my youth

the puzzle fit perfect. with storybook affect. but i needed something to make it complete.
so i told my roomate. if i saw a rainbow. i would adore you.
then i opened the curtains praying for rain. and i pled every long night.
for a waterfall sky. 'cuz then I'd know for sure. my heart didn't lie.
i was growing to love you. convinced that it was glue. but did not wanna
jinx my affirmation clue. so i told my roomate. if i saw a rainbow. i would adore you.
and i opened the curtains praying for rain. forty days and nights.
nothing but clear skies. most wouldn't complain. but i needed a fight.
i was crossing my cutdowns. for a thungermous breakdown. in hopes for the makeup.
and a colorful sky. so i told my roomate if i saw a rainbow. i would adore you.
then you closed the curtains before it rained. then the radio went wrong.
it sand me a sad song. with no falling starts to balance it out. and so that was the end.
to my last boyfriend. i learned where love went wrong. was when i wrote this song.

To tell you you're the sweetest boy I've ever known
Remember the USO when we met
You almost didn't go
Well, me and your two sons are very glad you did
When your eyes found me I could hardly breathe
I wanted you
Glad you wanted me

I never stopped falling in love with you Wally
From the first day I saw you
I was sailor-bound, I just knew
You had me, I was yours
We danced out, on the floor
And with each passing day
I only loved you more

That night was pure magic
Who would have imagined
It would become 55 loving wonderful years
Your job was not all easy
Those last years I could hardly speak
But when I looked at you, I knew nothing had changed
And when I was leaving
I could feel you hurting
But then I saw those angels
And I knew your love would want this for me

I never stopped falling in love with you Wally
From the first day I saw you
I was sailor-bound, I just knew
You had me, I was yours

So while you're waiting
Know that I'm saying I love you
I love you

As if it were you
And swayed through the fields

And nature's working against us and chewing down the plants

Alles schwarz, ich kann nicht sehen
ich kann die Welt nicht mehr verstehen
Der Mond reißt mir die Augen aus
Ich bin gefangen und ich komm nicht raus
Weißt do wer ich bin ?
Ich schwebe durch die dunkle Nacht
und ein Gefühl ist mir erwacht
ein Gefühl das keiner kennt
die Augen leer mein Gehirn verbrennt
Und ich tanz auf meinem Grab
Und ich tanz auf meinem Grab
Ein weißes Tuch verfärbt sich rot
ein neues Leben oder Tod
Mein Gefühl das keiner kennt
alles leer und mein Herz verbrennt
Und ich tanz auf meinem Grab
Und ich tanz auf meinem Grab
Sünden des Körpers niemals frei
Die Qual des Weges nie vorbei
Den nach dem Tod beginnt mein Leben
er wird mir neue Kräfte geben
Ihr seht mich nicht doch bin ich da
als Alptraum räch ich mich Jahr um Jahr
schwarze Rosen brennen an dem Kranz
ich tanz und tanz und tanz und tanz den Totentanz
Wenn der Sturm dich mit eisigen Klauen hinwegfegt und dein Leiden mit ihm vereint
Wenn kein Licht dich mehr führt, wenn dich nichts mehr berührt und die Tränen die letzten geweint
Wenn do schreist, weil do weißt was es heißt, wenn die Hoffnung nicht mehr als ein leeres Wort ist
Wenn do gehst und do flehst, daß dich jemand erreicht, weil do immer noch ganz allein bist
Wenn die Schatten wie immer nicht loslassen, dann stehe ich engelsgleich hinter dir
Und ich halt meine Hand über dich, wenn der Druck zu groß wird und do alles verlierst
Und ich breite die Arme für dich aus, wenn do weder Wärme noch Liebe mehr spürst
Und ich bin da wenn do ganz entblößt, in der Sonne die Seele brennt, dennoch erfrierst
Ich bin unendlich wie ein Ring
Ich bin der Schwarze Schmetterling
Und mein Gefühl das keiner kennt
glüht kurz auf
und verbrennt",Schwarzer Schmetterling,2001
ASP,"Viel zu oft beherrschte mich die Angst vorm Fallen
Nur einmal wollte ich erneuert sein
Viel zu lang hielt die Furcht mich in den Krallen
Supernova, dies gehört mir ganz allein

Viel zu lang ließ ich mich von euch verbiegen
Schon so lang tobt der Wunsch in meinem Blut
Nur einmal laß ich los, denn ich will Fliegen

Komm mir nicht zu nahe, sonst kann's geschehen
Daß wir beide lichterloh in Flammen stehen

Nur einmal will ich zum Himmel schreien
Nur einmal will ich hoch zur Sonne schweben

Berühr mich lieber nicht, es hat keinen Zweck
Sonst reißt der Strom aus Feuer dich noch mit mir weg
Bleib mir lieber fern, weil es sonst überspringt
Und weil das Fieber auch in deine Seele dringt
Faß mich nicht an, sonst kann's passieren
Daß wir uns in der Hitze dieser Nacht verlieren

Komm mir nicht zu nah, sonst kann's geschehen

Like an aura. apparently invisible habitat
I look, which view of the close sheet roof beschirmt,

So impenetrably nevertheless at the same time just as easily destroys
Completely equal as close we stand yourself for' n, we are nevertheless
Actually all alone in this world belongs to us

Ah and a storm behind your eyes and 
Ah there is no one left to see

ASP,"Einst lag ich unter dem Grase so kühl
Nicht stört' mich auf ein Laut noch ein Gefühl
Wo mich nicht Strahlen trafen
Nicht Sonne noch Mond dort wo ich mich hab eingewühlt
Warum lasst ihr mich nicht schlafen?

Ich ruhte tief, überdauernd die Zeit
So fern von Hunger, Gefahr und Leid
Und begann mich sicher zu wähnen
So lag ich im herrlichen tröstenden Erdenkleid
Und trocknete mir die Tränen

So geschah's dass ich das was ich einst war vergaß
Nur das eine von dem ich niemals genas
Lässt sich nicht aus den Träumen entfernen
Und das Sehnen lebt immer noch unter dem kühlen Gras
Zu wandern zwischen den Sternen

Ich fiel aus den Himmeln, dem Nachtlichtermeer
Ja ich fiel so tief und ich fiel so schwer
Und ich stürzte durch die Schwärze
Und ist es auch ewig und ewig und noch länger her
Trag ich doch die Sterne im Herzen

Dort lag ich zerschmettert so nackt und so bloß
So regungslos unter dem grünen Moos
Und es heilten meine Wunden
So lag ich gebettet in deinem zarten Schoß
Auf immer mit dir verbunden

Ich träumte den Himmel im nachtschwarzen Hort
Entrang meinen Lippen niemals ein Wort
Und flehte doch, mir zu verzeihen
Und alles Getier floh den einsamen schrecklichen Ort
Hörte es meine Seele dort schreien

Doch warn's nicht die Sterne in mondheller Nacht
Die mich zu sich riefen mit all ihrer Macht
Weiß nicht woher sie kamen
So bin ich in eisblauem schneidenden Mondlicht erwacht
Und sie gaben mir einen Namen

Sie wuschen mich, flochten mir Blumen ins Haar
Ich schmeckte den Trank den sie mir brachten dar
Den süßen purpurroten
Sie salbten den Körper mit Öl, den sie aufgebahrt
Mit sich trugen wie einen Toten

Im Rausch ließen sie mich alleine mit ihr
Die niemals je fremde Hand gespürt
Und ich lernte neues Begehren
Danach hab ich sie wie die Sterne nie wieder berührt
Muss mich nach ihr immer verzehren

Sie rissen mich fort, eine Krone zur Zier
Banden sie mir ums Haupt, jagten mich wie ein Tier
Sie hetzten mich endlich zu Tode
Sie schlugen und hackten und alles was blieb von mir
Verscharrten sie im Boden

Than youÂ'll ever know
I have been weak but now IÂ'm stronger

Feed me with your darkness! Feed me with your pain!

IÂ'll sip your soul in
Wake your desire
I am the promise and a liar

Show me your hands and
No misbehaving
IÂ'll pin the wire and youÂ'll be waving

You will be wrapped around
My finger yes I know for sure
You will be trapped in your disease
And I am not the cure

Feed me with your sickness! Feed me with your hearts!

Feed me with your darkness! Feed me with your pain!

Well, all you lovely children
Start to feel and stop to think
Thank god for your bewilderment
And force your eyes to blink

Say, all you little fellows
DonÂ't you know where you belong
Come down here in my cellar
Dance with me and join my song

Be good and stop to struggle
Dangling on your puppet strings
Hush hush my babies snuggle
In the nest under my wings

Say, all you little fellows
DonÂ't you know where you belong
Come down here in my cellar
Dance with me and join my song

No one knows where it will end or when it starts
Feed me with your darkness! Feed me with your pain!

I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind

Her girlfriend want to get bi and they ready to go

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub

My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, nigga, I came up and I ain't changed

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate 
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub

Let me be your Sunday driver 
Let me be your Monday man

It doesn't matter where you want to go 
Just gotta decide girl and then you let me know 

Oh, did you ever want lovin', so you're callin' 
Up your baby and she's stallin' with the neighbors 
And the night keeps gettin' longer 
And the urge keeps getting stronger 
So you try him and your dyin' and you're wonderin' does she love you 
A knock comes at your door

Assassin,"Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the mornin'
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screamin'
'Cause they seein' destruction before they a see human bein'

So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
'Cause they all broke an' why do ghetto birds die?
Before we learn to fly, somebody else's child caught in guns

Smokin' weed can all make a change
So I'm told but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hopin' please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead

Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free

Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens, rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers be wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies

We can only learn to take our anger an' our hate
Control our mental state, settle down an' just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump our brakes
'For we said it, regret it later an' let it escalate

'Cause by then it's too just late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow an' tolerate
Up to the point that he just breaks, snaps an' that's all it takes
You'd think that we was learnin' from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't

It's plain to go against, with every artists comes the image
He portrays an' a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger an' this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster
An' I ain't hear no complaints

But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead an' never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me an' that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free

To this day the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me an' no matter what they do
There will never be another you

You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts an' your minds, we will never die
We are forever alive an' we continue growin' one day at a time

Don't be caught in the publicity an' caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money an' light
Searchin' for fortune an' fame an' super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest

Now the hip hop police, the villains is watchin'
An' kids think beef is they only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories could die but Makaveli lives on

You think the industry is fun an' no pity with guns
An' when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died an' came back, would he try to save rap?
We needin' a change, the drama remains

I spent my whole life fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
An' every now an' then I take rights from the left
I'm still just like a kid lookin' for stripes on my belt

An' that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray an' hope God take a like to myself
No matter how much, I try stay alive
I'm gonna die mad, still standin' there in love with my pride

My heart frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income comin' in an' collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
An' I finally realized that we not in the same game

The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4 5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery an' keep your eyes on the rollers

They do what they gotta do to shackle an' hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
An' we continue growin' one day at a time, damn",One Day at a Time,2007

Assault,"[Thes One:]
Yo, I think this time I've found a shorty for me
We talk a lot, take walks a lot, she doesn't bore me
In fact she won't ignore me when I'm speakin music matters
She's intelligent, fly style flatters
My own style, chickens scatter when she floats through the club
Child matters,
Love, I'm thinkin,
I met her one night drinkin, I suggested a show,
She walked up and said, ""I know you
You're from the P-U, T-S, I think your name is Thes too,""
Would you like a soda, I'm underage
Slipped her my number, tipped away
And said give me a page later
In typical Latin lady flavor she said ""Maybe,
Que si"" That's how it should be
And see she played me close, next night dinner,
The champagne toast, sunset pacific coast,
And most while, everything to me was like tight groovy
Always a treat, man, she took me to the movies
Made love to beats, woke up and made me pancakes
And this point I knew my shit was land or lakes
Fellas, I might be in love but something's still not right,
We didn't fight but she didn't call me last night
She got mad loot, no jobs, and plus a high renter
Cellular phone to check the Pac Bell message center,
Which she does too much, and I'm really not with it
She tells me that she loves me so I guess I'm committed

Turndown days...
No way, no way
""It gets better, this girl's kinda clever""

[Double K:]
Yo I was coolin' at the club about ten on the dot
Drinkin' Hennessey and Coke, feeling like 2Pac
Me and the crew hit the stage in about a half of one
Trying to ditch security 'cause I'm under twenty-one
Just then, I see this fine Latin chick walk past
Face like never before, body like an hour glass
So I was lookin' at the booty, it was lookin' right back,
You would have thought she wanted loot but it wasn't like that
Yo this girl stepped to me, asked me, what was my name,
I told her, Mike, she looked with a grin, said, that's right
Then for a minute I started to wonder how she knew who I was,
Yo, we've been doin' mad shows with the underground buzz,
Then I asked her her name, yo I heard that somewhere,
Matter of fact, I have, but yo the K didn't care
All I wanted was the ass, only that and nothing more,
Talked a cool 15 minutes, got the number, hit the floor,
Saw Thes, gave him the DAT, we rocked the show,
Woke up the next day, aww shit, here we go
Seen a number in the pager that I didn't recognize,
Matched it up with the little paper received last night,
Word up, I'm 'bout to hit the skins like it was my first
Returned the call, got the address, and quenched my thirst,
Took a quick shower, was out in five minutes,
Big grin on my grill 'cause I knew I'd be up in it,
Her crib was in four, so I strolled down the road,
Kinda high off the blunt, bangin' on the front door,
She opened up, still in her nightclothes,
Foreplay was in effect before I closed the front door,
You know how it goes, fingers in her shoobie doobie,
Whispered in her ear that I wanted her to do me,
And we did it homeboy, all day and night,
But even after that, something still wasn't right,
What the fuck, Thes's beat tape doin' on your night stand?
Yo, I figured it out, it was a game-plan
I asked her what's up, she said I got a man,
And I got a what, what, what, what

Y'all didn't see me all day, I stayed at the bay awaitin',
The car from the maiden I had met when I was chasin'
Down the bus which I missed but I wasn't too pissed
When I spotted a sis, who lit my eyes like the trees
They put up on Christmas, I said, hey, how are you doin' today?
She said, aiight, the frame was tight so I continued her way,
Shootin' the breeze like LA, conversation was cool,
She went to school, had a job, and no meat was the rule,
Now not to send like a gay librarian,
I appreciate the fact you're vegetarian,
I eat some flesh once in awhile, was her reply,
And then she looked at me with an old look in her eye,
I said, what, I'm not your kind of nigga?
Not quite, but I'll be very interested to hang out with you tonight,
I thought whoa, huh, this girl's a sick puppy,
If she chills at the crib I'll probably get lucky
But she never showed... All day, I missed work...
But she never showed up...
I think she was bisexual
She had a fat ass...
It was like red, kinda like reddish brown

Tu passe même devant son père 
Aussi comblé par cette merveilleuse aventure 
Car après tout c'est son sang sa progéniture 

5 minutes d'insouciance 
9 mois pour prendre conscience 
Qu'1 bébé est la et tu pense 
5 minutes d'inconscience 
9 mois teinté d'absence 
1 enfant qui a manqué d'chance 

A tout les pères qui r'connaissent leur mômes 
Qui s'défilent pas 
Assument comme des bonhommes 
Mêmes quand il pleure toute la soirée 
Capable de préparer le biberon 
Changer ses couches, le bercer 
Les femmes trouve ça mignon, ben oui 
Maintenant c'est tout pour lui 
Sans doute ta raison de vivre 
Aujourd'hui ton point de repère 
Tes appuis, t'a le rôle du père 
D'ailleurs tu dois mieux comprendre le tien 
Encore plus celle qui ta mis au monde 
Qui te soutient, c'est la nature 
C'est pas plus mal, ça te rend plus mature 
Quand tu pousse la poussette 
Ou qu't'amène à son siège dans la voiture 
Tout tes potes les plus durs sont attendris à sa vue 
Te félicite, le couvre de bisous ? 

5 minutes d'insouciance 
9 mois pour prendre conscience 
Qu'1 bébé est la et tu pense 
5 minutes d'inconscience 
9 mois teinté d'absence 
1 enfant qui a manqué d'chance 

Les jours et les années passent, le bébé grandit 
Souvent ça s'passe mal 
Quand le père garde le profil de bandit 
Pour tout les couples de banlieue 
Les papas du ghettos 
Qui pour remédier aux problèmes financiers 
Risquent le pénitencier 
Bien mal acquis ne profite jamais 
Faut faire un choix 
Les visites au parloir en larmes 
C'est pas la joie 
A force de déprimer 
Tu te lasse de ces promesses 
T'a mis de cotés des études 
Sacrifié ta jeunesse 

Ma vie mon bonheur tout est gâché 
Il m'a laissée, moi je l'aimais 
Même ma mère ne veut plus me parler 
(Et la sienne) 
Plus aucune nouvelle 

Et le gosse va bien 
Et l'laisse pas n'importe qui 
Pour aller n'importe ou, n'importe quand 
Faire n'importe quoi 
Avec n'importe qui 

Oh, n'importe quoi 

Prends le pas mal 
J'dis ça parce que y a des nuits 
Ou qui s'laisse aller comme ça 
Ma mère a toujours été la pour moi 
Et j'en suis fière 
Mariée vierge à quinze ans 
Elle ma eu à l'age de seize ans 
Contrairement à mon père, 
Présente à toute les saisons 
Garde la foi, restent sains avec toi même 
Tu comprendras mieux ta raison 

5 minutes d'insouciance 
9 mois pour prendre conscience 
Qu'1 bébé est la et tu pense 
5 minutes d'inconscience 
9 mois teinté d'absence 
1 enfant qui a manqué d'chance 

Un jour tu sentiras 
L'honneur d'être papa 
Le bonheur d'une mama

Assia,"Je me pensais comblée
Une vie meublée
Mais la passion
M'a rappelé

Que nul ne retient son coeur
Et surtout personne n'en a la clef

Te rencontrer
C'était plonger
Dans les questions jusqu'alors jamais posées

Retour à la réalité
L'un des deux va me manquer


Ce n'est pas le bon moment pour te choisir
J'attendrai une autre vie trop vont souffrir
De l'illégal amour
Je préfère qu'on vive le doute hey
Ce n'est pas le bon moment pour te choisir
J'attendrai une autre vie trop vont souffrir
De l'illégal amour
Je préfère qu'on vive le doute
Illegal love

Dès que le premier souffre
J'en ai l'oeil humide
Quand le sourire
Du second m'illumine

Trop certaine avant le doute
Maintenant prisonnière de l'amour en double

Il faut abandonner
Avant de se donner
Je ne peux le nier la gorge nouée

Trop tard pour désavouer
Même nos yeux fermés tout se voyait


Nous étions de bons amis
Imperméables à toute tentation
Puis de suite devenus hyper aimables
Certaines décisions sont irrémédiables
Comment garder l'auréole et aimer le diable
Ma femme a des doutes quand je lui donne le nom d'une autre
Dur de faire passer la truffe pour un pruneau
Aucun amour sans grumeau
D'excuses sans arguments
Deux êtres humains qui s'accordent forment un instrument
Dont tous connaissent la chanson
Parlons des pires notes
Rouler dans le désert des regrets plein le semi-remorque
Je ne voulais garder que deux des quatre yeux
Mais les hommes ont du mal avec les adieux


En somme obligé-bligé de tout oublier
Nous sommes obligés-bligés de tout oublier

Ce genre d'histoire c'est quitte ou double
Doubler sans quitter égal soucis en boucle


En somme obligé-bligé de tout oublier
Nous sommes obligés-bligés de tout oublier
En quittant tout tout de suite
On sera jamais libre dans la fuite
En somme obligé-bligé de tout oublier
Nous sommes obligés-bligés de tout oublier
Libérons-nous sans rien dire
Mais comment vaincre un amour qui grandit

Smack my head until I understand. Seems like lately I don't give a damn.
Everything is all right when we open up all the time. You look at me, look at you and discover things we never knew.
You keep it real and say what you feel. It seems like lately you don't even hear me.
All our time ends up spent on trying hard to defend. Why is it so hard to let go? There are just some things we'll never know.

Keep the rock pucks in the basement with the lock shut
Used to sliding under street lights with the peace pipe
Keep the heat tight by my side so I can eat right
All I knew is hit the block and how to crack deals
Make it hot with this rap shit and stack bills

With thoughts in my head knowing crack kills
Out for papes gotta let the desert eagle blow
I get cake, this rap shit is legal though

Then hit a nigga pockets for the last of his change
Then put a slash through his veins

When y'all was on them lots dropping cash on the range
I was tongue kissing blocks stashing them things
And now my nigga on only half of the chains

"Astaire, Estele","Frankly Dear, your modesty reveals to me 
Self-appraisal often makes me sad 
And if I add your funny face appeals to me 
Please don't think I've suddenly gone mad 

You've got all the qualities of Peter Pan 
I'd look far before I'd find a sweeter pan 

I love your funny face 
Your sunny, funny face 
Though you're a cutie 
With more than beauty 
You've got a lot of 
Personal-I-ty for me 

You fill the air with smiles 
For miles and miles and miles 
Though you're no Mona Lisa 
For world's I'd not replace 
Your sunny-- funny face 

I love your funny face 
Your sunny-- funny face 
You're not exotic 
But so hypnotic 
You're much-- too much 
If you can cook 
The way you look 

I'd swim the ocean wide 
Just to have you by my side 
Though you're no Queen of Sheeba 
For world's I'd not replace

Astarti String Orchestra,"Beneath the old iron bridges, across the Victorian parks
And all the frightened people running home before dark
Past the Saturday morning cinema that lies crumbling to the ground
And the piss stinking shopping center in the new side of town
I've come to smell the seasons change and watch the city
As the sun goes down again

Here comes another winter of long shadows and high hopes
Here comes another winter waitin' for utopia
Waitin' for hell to freeze over

This is the land where nothing changes
The land of red buses and blue blooded babies
This is the place, where pensioners are raped
And the hearts are being cut from the welfare state
Let the poor drink the milk while the rich eat the honey
Let the bums count their blessings while they count the money

So many people can't express what's on their minds
Nobody knows them and nobody ever will
Until their backs are broken and their dreams are stolen
And they can't get what they want then they're gonna get angry

Well it ain't written in the papers, but it's written on the walls
The way this country is divided to fall
So the cranes are moving on the skyline
Trying to knock down this town

But the stains on the heartland, can never be removed
From this country that's sick, sad, and confused

Here comes another winter of long shadows and high hopes
Here comes another winter waitin' for utopia
Waitin' for hell to freeze over

The ammunition's being passed and the lords been praised
But the wars on the televisions will never be explained
All the bankers gettin' sweaty beneath their white collars
As the pound in our pocket turns into a dollar

This is the 51st state of the U.S.A.
This is the 51st state of the U.S.A.
This is the 51st state of the U.S.A.

I'm a man without a soul...Honey---
Who lost it while parading it, in a town full of thieves--
why'see I didn't want to be with any people I know.
But god knows, I didn't want to be alone--
So I showered down--left my little room
And jumped in my car for protection from hostility
Well it ain't easy to be bold--in an unknown city--
I was feeling strong mouthed, but weak willed.
When I ran into the cure...for my ills--
Don't tell me what your name is--
I want your body, not your mind,
I want a feeling, worth paying for before I say goodbye
But as I was talking, I couldn't look her in the eyes,
I just kept wondering,--
How many men unleashed their frustration between her thighs?
Well my adrenalin, was curdling like cream,
as I was being led by the hand.
through the sound of sirens--
and the distant noise of some drunken jazz band,
through the stench of disinfectant--
that ""INFECTED"" my head,
through the darkness of a corridor
and into a strangers bed.
Well I didn't want to hurt your feelings, honey
but I couldn't suppress my own,
I had to pull myself outta this nosedive
by proving something to myself.
She was lying on her back
with her lips parted.
Squealing like a stuffed pig--
I was going through the motions
faking the emotions,
and wriggling around like lizard in a tin.
Trying so hard to cleanse myself,
I was turning into somebody else.
I was trying so hard to please myself,
I was turning into somebody else.
I was trying so hard to be myself
I was turning into somebody else.
Come my love--with your desire--
Out of the blue...and into the fire!!

Aston Martinez,"I am a shotgun rider,
For the San Jacinto line,
The desert is my brother,
My skin is cracked and dry
I was ridin' on a folk coach
And everything was fine,
'Till we took a shorter road
To save some time
The bandits only fired once,
They shot me in the chest
They may have wounded me but,
They'll never get the best
Of better men
'Cause I'll ride again

I am a river gambler,
I make a livin' dealin' cards
My clothes are smooth and honest,
My heart is cold and hard
I was shufflin' for some delta boys,
On a boat for New Orleans,
I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen
But the captain bumped a sandbar,
And an ace fell from my sleeve
They threw me overboard,
As I swore I didn't cheat
But I could swim
And I'll ride again

We are heroes of the homeland, American remains
We live in many faces and answer many names
We will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind
Our memories live on in mortal minds
And poets pens
We'll ride again

I am a mid-west farmer,
I make a livin' off the land,
I ride a John Deere tractor,
I'm a liberated man
But the rain it hasn't fallen,
Since the middle of July,
And if it don't come soon my crops will die
The bank man says he likes me,
But there's nothin' he can do
He tells me that he's comin',
But the clouds are comin' too
He ain't my friend
And I'll ride again

I am an American Indian,
My tribe is Cherokee
My forefathers loved this land
They left it here for me
But the white man came with boats,
And trains and dirty factories,
An' poisoned my existence with his deeds
Nature is our mother,
We are suckling at her breast
And he who tries to beat her down,
Will lose her to the rest
They'll never win
I'll ride again

We are heroes of the homeland, American remains
We live in many faces and answer many names
We will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind
Our memories live on in mortal minds and poets pens
We'll ride again",Seduction,2012

tarde o temprano
detiene su andar.

haya matado mi vieja ilusion,

Astor Piazzolla,"Si arrastré por estemundo
la vergüenza de habersido
y el dolor de ya no ser...
Bajo el ala del sombrero,
cuántas veces embozada
una lágrima asomada
yo no pude contener...
Si crucé por los caminos
como un paria que el Destino
se empeño en deshacer...
Si fui flojo, si fui ciego,
sólo quiero que comprendan
el valor que representa
el coraje de querer.

Era para mí la vida entera,
como un sol de primavera,
mi esperanza y mí pasión.
Sabía
que en el mundo no cabía
toda la humilde alegría
de mi pobre corazón.
Ahora, 
cuesta abajo en mi rodada,
las ilusiones pasadas
yo no las puedo arrancar.
Sueño
con el pasado que añoro,
el tiempo viejo que lloro
y que nunca volverá.

Por seguir tras de su huella
yo bebí incansablemente
en mi copa de dolor,
pero nade comprendía
que si todo yo lo daba
en cada vuelta dejaba
pedazos de corazón.
Ahora, triste en la pendiente,
solitario y ya vencido,
yo me quiero confesar.

¡Si aquella boca mentía
el amor que me ofrecía,
por aquellos ojos brujos
yo habría dado siempre más!

In the picture of the soldier
In a world that's getting colder
Colors balms for my kind
Some were looking for this haven
Rumors blowing in the wind
Oh please, let me stay for a while

They came across the water
To escape from the slaughter
I took my chance but I wnted to pay
A poor boy has to lose; it's black, white and grey

There was fear in their eyes
There was blood on the walls
I can still recall
All the fear in their eyes
When their world had to fall
There was fear in their eyes

No medication from a doctor
Could ever heal this broken man
I needed someone to hold
The purgatory of life
Brought the violence to my heart
Sorry babe; forgive me babe
Now I'm gone

My execration
Of the world that rules the nation
I'm not a boy, I stand equal to God
Don't need any money
I do what I want

There was fear in their eyes
There was blood on the walls
I can still recall
All the fear in their eyes
When their world had to fall
It was in their eyes

For the knight of the swords

Faking a smile and I try to move on
Calling the shots like the king of the flies
Hiding myself, but my art's gonna take me higher
So much higher again

Cry out in anger, got nothing to say

In the shade of sin; to live you have to die
Convicting yourself to the cross; it was your loss

But the eyes of the beholder will try
To drag you from heaven to hell, I tell
The treasure, the struggle in pain
All in vain

Still it's not too late
There's no bail; Siberian trail
Doomed to live my last days
Like a cursed in the dark

From the eye you can't hide
When the fatherland decides you're Christ
In their state they create a better race

But take my warning

Gonna send me off
To Stalingrad

A fatal birth of one mans earth
Now it's all too late
Curtain of iron, confusion in the crowd
A union made by violence, greed and force
To tame all the men in the land
And to crush their houses of glass; in flesh
On my way to Gulag this preacher spoke

He said:
Take my warning
It is right before your eyes
A new time dawning
We will die
For the traitor of mankind
They made me fight in Stalingrad
All the people died in Stalingrad

It's time to rock
It's time to rock
When your cell is down and locked
It's time to rock

There is a lonely man
He's taking control
He might be doing wrong
It's eating his soul

Came out; riding the law
They're forced to say: we'll open the door
In between; lost inside a riddle
And we may have to die

He live upon the edge of danger
They'll hold their weapons down
But I will never stop

It's time to rock
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
Yes, when your world is down and locked
It's time to rock

[Solo: Nordlund]

Their haunted houses were made of strangers
He'll break the sun and light
The maker's cleared and locked

It's time to rock
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
Yes when your mind is cleared and locked
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
Wes when your world is down and locked
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
All around the world
And I will never ever stop
And I ain't never gonna drop
It's time to rock

He's an unholy ranger, not a logical trainer
A prior and preacher with style
No one knew he was able
No one heard 'bout the chamber
In the darkest of dark
On the back side of religion

Enchanter and Judas; murderer and thief
Tempting the weak and foretold about the

Glory of heaven, it's for now and forever; you and I
The Bride of Christ
Not evil, but afraid he would leave here there behind
She's the Bride of Christ

She had been there forever and she wasn't so clever
She fell just like rain from the sky
He stood in the middle; Stan played on his fiddle
They danced in their church
To celebrate their new Messiah

Glory of heaven, it's for now and forever; you and I
The Bride of Christ
Not evil, but afraid he would leave here there behind
She's the Bride of Christ

""You can all meet Jesus.
You can all be a part of his great big family.
So come and join the army:
Be a soldier in the name of God!""

No, no

And waiting still as fresh in your flesh for my

By the time I return to earth

But that's the spirit of the age, that's the

Every fiber of my flesh and bone is identical to
The others
Everything I say is in the same tone as my test

And there's no choice between us, if you had ever
Seen us you'd rejoice in your uniqueness
And consider every weakness something special of
Your own

Has just been written by another twenty

Are illusions while you're waiting

She play Mr. Shakur
That's her favorite rapper bumping ""Brenda's Got A Baby""
While a pervert yelling at her and she capture features of a woman
But only 17, the 7 cars start honkin'
She start running like FLo-Jo don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
She give all to her daddy but she don't know her father,
That's ironic see a block away from Lueders park, I seen the El Camino parked
In her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

Her castle is about to be destroyed, she's always paranoid
Watching the law inside the streets undercover the dummies that look like decoys
Remember the sergeant let her slide,
Said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise,
To no surprise she took the ultimatum around the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome to fill him right below the navel

Of the black man, white man, needed satisfaction, at first
It became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
This muthafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that
Block away from Lueders park, I seen a El Camino park

And now I'm wondering
Whether weather like this gets you too

It may go on like this for hours
Too late in fall for April showers
So what we got here, got a thought or two
I need to share with you, here goes

Darling, tell me now
Have I done wrong somehow
That you won't look at me
Need it pointed out
Can't keep my wits about
When you won't look at me

Is there something I oughta know?
You're finding hard to say
Well, there's just a trace
Hiding on your face
And I've learned it that way

Just another soul
That really knows my soul
And you won't look at me
Does that take the prize?
How much I love those eyes
And they won't look at me

Now the rain has gone
But something lingers on
There's certain sadness here
Now that the sky is clear
And it's so, so clear
Yes, it's all so clear to me now

And I can't help but fear
That certain sadness here to stay

",A Certain Sadness [*],1966
Astrud Gilberto,"A certain smile, a certain face 
Can lead an unsuspecting heart 
On a merry chase 
Afleeting glance can say 
So many lovely things 
Suddenly you know why my heart sings 

You love awhile and when love goes 
You try to hide the tears inside 
With a cheerful pose 

*But in the hush of night 
Exactly like a bitter sweet refrain 
Comes that certain smile 
To haunt your heart again

Teu cabelo é de sereia 
E a pergunta que não sai da mente

Tem um ""que"" que me tonteia

If you should think of leaving me
Think of rain
And think of yesterday again

Think of rain

Laughing all the time
And stopping to kiss
Under the weeping willow tree

Think of rain

Maybe then you will forgive me
I'd want you to forgive me

Like a nightingale without a song to sing.
Oh, why should I have spring fever,
When it isn't even spring?

Walking down a strange new street,
Hearing words I have never never heard,
From a man I've yet to meet.

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way,

It might as well be, might as well be,
It might as well be spring.",It Might as Well Be Spring,1990

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,1991
Astrud Gilberto,"Someone to hold me tight 
That would be very nice 
Someone to love me right
That would be very nice 
Someone to understand 
Each little dream in me
Someone to take my hand
And be a team with me

So nice, life would be so nice 
If one day I'd find
Someone who would take my hand
And samba through life with me

Someone to cling to me
Stay with me right or wrong 
Someone to sing to me 
Some little samba song 
Someone to take my heart 
And give his heart to me 
Someone who's ready to 
Give love a start with me

Oh yeah, that would be so nice
I could see you and me, that would be nice",So Nice (Summer Samba),1991
Astrud Gilberto,"Who can I turn to
When nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know
So I must go
Where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way
And after the day
The darkness will hide me

But maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter
'cause with you, I could learn to
With you, on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away?

With you, I could learn to
With you, on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away",Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me),1991
Astrud Gilberto,"There's no use to pretend
We have come to the end
All that's left is to say goodbye
If I hold you with lies
It will show in my eyes
All that's left is to say goodbye
So when you go I won't stop you
But I will remember
How deep, how beautiful it was
And all this beauty of love that was our love
And now leaves me sad
I don't want to deny, don't want to betray
Don't want to forget

Because my love in my life, 
You have been like a day full of sun.

So when you go I won't stop you
But I will remember
How deep, how beautiful it was

Don't want to forget
Because my love in my life, 
You have been like a day full of sun.",All That's Left Is to Say Goodbye,1991
Astrud Gilberto,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day [*],1995
Astrud Gilberto,"A insensatez que você fez
Coração mais sem cuidado
Fez chorar de dor
O seu amor
Um amor tão delicado
Ah, porque você foi fraco assim
Assim tão desalmado
Ah, meu coração que nunca amou
Não merece ser amado

Vai meu coração ouve a razão
Usa só sinceridade
Quem semeia vento, diz a razão
Colhe sempre tempestade
Vai, meu coração pede perdão
Perdão apaixonado
Vai porque quem não
Pede perdão
Não é nunca perdoado",Insensatez,1995
Astrud Gilberto,"If it takes forever, I will wait for you
For a thousand summers, I will wait for you
'Til you're back beside me, 'til I'm holding you
'Til I hear you sigh here in my arms

Anywhere you run to, anywhere you go
Every day remember, how I love you so
In your heart believe what in my heart I know
That forever more I'll wait for you

The clock will tick away the hours one by one
And then the time will come
When all the waiting's done
The time when you return and find me here and run
Straight to my waiting arms

If it takes forever, I will wait for you
For a thousand summers, I will wait for you
'Til you're here beside me, 'til I'm touching you
And forever more cherish your love

",I Will Wait for You,1996
Astrud Gilberto,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1996
Astrud Gilberto,"If you're feeling sad and lonely 
There's a service I can render 
Tell the one who loves you only 
I can be so warm and tender 
Call me, don't be afraid, you can call me 
Maybe it's late, but just call me 
Tell me, and I'll be around 

When it seems your friends desert you 
There's somebody thinking of you 
I'm the one who'll never hurt you 
Maybe that's because I love you 
Call me, don't be afraid, you can call me 
Maybe it's late, but just call me 
Tell me, and I'll be around 

Now don't forget me 
Cause if you let me 
I will always stay by you 
You've got to trust me 
That's how it must be 
There's so much that I can do 

If you call I'll be right with you 
You and I should be together 
Take this love I long to give you 
I'll be at your side forever 
Call me, don't be afraid, you can call me 
Maybe it's late, but just call me 
Tell me and I'll be around",Call Me,1996

So whatever you've got to do
You've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true

And I hope whatever you've got to do
Is something that can be done by two
For I'd really like to stay

It's a lovely day today
And whatever you've got to do
I'd be so happy to be doing it with you

But if you've got something that must be done
And it can only be done by one
There is nothing more to say
Except it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day

If it is then you could stay

It's a lovely day today
But you're probably busy too
So I suppose there's nothing we can do

For if you've got something that must be done
And it can only be done by one
There is nothing more to say
Except it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day

It's a lovely day today
If you've something that must get done
Now don't forget two heads are better than just one

And besides I'm certain if you knew me
You'd find I'm very good company
Won't you kindly let me stay?

Astrud Gilberto,"Ondulado e permanente 
Teu cabelo é de sereia 
E a pergunta que não sai da mente 
Qual é o pente que te penteia 
Quando tu entra na roda 
O teu corpo bamboleia 
Teu cabelo a couve flor 
Tem um ""que"" que me tonteia 
Minha nega, meu amor 
Qual é o pente que te penteia 
Misamplis a ferro e fogo 
Não desmancha nem na areia 
Toma banho em Botafogo 
Qual é o pente que te penteia 
Nega do cabelo duro 
Oh nega 
Qual é o pente que te penteia 
Qual é o pente que te penteia 
Qual é o pente que te penteia",Nega Do Cabelo Duro,1996
