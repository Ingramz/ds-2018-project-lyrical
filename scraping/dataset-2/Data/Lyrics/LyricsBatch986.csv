Scott Stapp,"I'm not evil
No matter what you think of me
I'm just human
There's a part of you that's just like me

I have fallen
I have broken every piece
Heard heaven calling
I could only reach this from my knees
And now I believe

[Chorus]
I can't let this life pass me by
In a blink of an eye it ends
I can't let my tomorrows decide
What I am in this life
It's like committing slow suicide

It's no secret
I can't pretend, I can't forget
What I've done
Every day I live with the consequences
I let it beat me, let it kick me, let it throw me to the floor
Those days are over
I'm moving forward
It can't hurt me
And now I believe

[Chorus]
I can't let this life pass me by
In a blink of an eye it ends
I can't let my tomorrows decide
What I am in this life
It's like committing slow suicide

So many days I chose to suffer, living a lie
So many ways I chose to die
Oh, had to feel less than nothing
Shame and suffering
To see with my own eyes
I wasn't living
I was committing
Committing slow suicide
Committing slow suicide

And now I believe

[Chorus]
I can't let this life pass me by
In a blink of an eye it ends
I can't let my tomorrows decide
What I am in this life
It's like committing slow suicide

Committing slow suicide
Committing slow suicide",Slow Suicide,2013
Scott Stapp,"Go ahead and throw it in my face
Remind me of each of my mistakes
Turn on me tell me I’m wrong that it’s all my fault
I feel I’m losing control
Putting my fists through the wall
This is the place that I break I can’t take anymore
I see the fear in your eyes
I’m frozen standing still in time

What would love do
What would love do
If it were here in this room standing between me and you
What would love do
What would love do

I broke down and fell to the floor
Said I can’t do this anymore
I almost lost the one thing I could never lose
I felt completely disarmed
Naked stripped down to the heart
Humble and shaken its time to start healing these wounds
How do I break from this hell
It’s time I start asking myself

What would love do
What would love do
If it were here in this room standing between me and you
What would love do
What would love do
It would look in my face and stop me from hurting you
That’s what love would do

Its time to come out of the dark
And step into the light
When fear tries to tear us apart
And we’re torn between two sides

What would love do
What would love do
It would look in my face and stop me from hurting you
What would love do
What would love do
If it were here in this room standing between me and you
What would love do
What would love do
It would look in my face and stop me from hurting you
That’s what love would do",What Would Love Do,2013
Scott Stapp,"Look at me I am the sun
I’ll blind your eyes, the only one.
Look at me when night sings blues,
I’m the only one, yes I’m your muse.

Look at me, make no mistake,
Fashioned with earth, molded with clay.
I’ll tell you how I face the day,
Live life, raise hell, left nothing undone.

Who I am, who am I to you?
You know dammit, I speak the truth to you.
Who I am, who am I to you?
Why can’t I be who I am?

Look at me, I’m not like you.
I’m number one, not number two.
Look at me a pride and joy,
I came to win, I came to destroy.
Look at me, look in my eyes Heart of a lion,
I'll fight till I die!
Life’s too short to expect less
Even when I fall, I get up swinging

Who I am, who am I to you?
You know, dammit, I speak the truth to you
Who I am, who am I to you?
Why can’t I be who I am?

Who I am, who am I to me?
You know dammit, I speak the truth, you see
Who I am, who am I to me?
I just wanna be who I am
Just wanna be who I am
Just wanna be who I am",Who I Am,2013
Scott Storch,"This ain't go be easy, uh
You got it, you got it
Put it in

Tables turned into a situation
Now you standing in my face and you been patiently waiting
Fumbling over words, forget the conversation
Thinking maybe we could make the combination
Want to see me lose my breathe, want to hear me moan
Better be ready, will and able when we get along
You was talking tough up on in the telephone
So you better put it in when we get it on

No turning back from this party
Put you through enough to come play (hey)
And is not no coming down from this high
My love Do not go nowhere less I say

Now you looking like you looking for an explanation
Is the curve on my body for you motivation?
Skip the petty needs, no time for complication
Use both hands to make sure I reach my destination
Better leave a good impression fore you hit the door
'Cause you Do not want me talking about your business on the low
You show it off, I had to fit you in my schedule
So you better put it on me when It is time to go

Scott Trotter,"Lydia, oh! Lydia, say have you met Lydia
Oh! Lydia, the tattooed lady
She has eyes that folks adore so
And a torso even more so
Lydia, oh! Lydia, that ""Encyclopedia"" 
Oh! Lydia, the Queen of tattoo
On her back is the Battle of Waterloo
Beside it the Wreck of the Hesperus too
And proudly above the waves 
The Red, White and Blue
You can learn a lot from Lydia
 
She can give you a view of the world 
In tattoo if you step up and tell her where
For a dime  you can see Kankakee or Paree
Or Washington crossing the Delaware
 
Oh! Lydia, oh! Lydia, say have you met  Lydia
Oh! Lydia, the tattooed lady
When her muscles start relaxin'
Up the hill comes Andrew Jackson
Lydia, oh! Lydia, that ""Encyclopedia"" 
Oh! Lydia, the champ of them all
 
For two bits she will do a Mazurka in Jazz
With a view of Niag'ra that no artist has
And on a clear day you can see Alcatraz
You can learn a lot from Lydia. 
La la la La la la La la la La la la

Here is Captain Spaulding exploring the Amazon
And Godiva, but with her pajamas on

The ships on her hips made his heart skip a beat

Scott Trotter Orchestra,"I love that Christmas feeling
It does my heart so much good
Strangers I meet all seem like friends
And the world's just a neighborhood

So here's to the joy of Christmas
Here's to the ones I hold dear
May you have that Merry Christmas feeling
All through a happy New Year

Scott Vestal,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Scott Vestal,"If there were no words
no way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears
no way to feel inside
I'd still feel for you
and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart
until the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

All of my life
I have been waiting for
all you give to me
you've opened my eyes
and showed me how to love unselfishly

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
but in my dreams I couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart
untill the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart
until the end of time
cause all I need is you my valentine
oh
you're all I need, my love, my valentine",Valentine,2004
Scott Vestal,"Between the perfect world and the bottom line
Keeping love alive in these troubled times
It's a miracle in itself  
And we know too well what that's about
Still we made it through, only God knows how
We must've had a little help
(Must've been)

Wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby what else could it be

Well it must've been hard, it must've been tough
Keeping up with crazy fools like us
'Cause it's so easy to fall apart
And we still break each other's heart sometimes
Spend some nights on the jagged side
Somehow we wake up in each other's arms
(Must've been)

Wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby what else could it be

There are some nights
I watch you while you dream
I swear I hear the sound of beating wings",Wild Angels,2004
Scott Vestal,"I been thinkin' 'bout our love situation
All this attraction in the present tense
I've reached the only logical conclusion
Love ain't supposed to make sense

This ain't no thinkin' thing, right brain, left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
It's a chemical, physical, emotional devotion
Passion that we can't hold back
There's nothin' that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't no thinkin' thing

Forget mathmatical equations
Self help psychology
Gray matter don't matter much darlin'
When it's gettin' down to you and me, oh

Scott Vogel,"Don’t give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you
Enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do
What to think, and what to feel?!
Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder
Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men
You have the love of humanity in your hearts
You don’t hate, only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural.
I see the way you all suffer the same
Try to tell me there’ no other way
I hate how you shove this in my face
Day after day after fucking day
Fuck the way you try to turn my world
Black and white
I won’t let you bleed the color from my life
I choose nothing
I choose no one
I’d rather lose than ever be like you!
There’s always a way
Nothing, no one
I refuse to hold your smoking gun.
I’d rather lose than ever be like you
There’s always a way, always a way, always a way!
I don’t live my life by your made-up rules
I can’t identify with your twisted views
No one dictates my life for me
Don’t even try!
You will never understand me

Scott Waara,"I'm in a sentimental way
So stay with me
I'll ask the orchestra to play
Your fav'rite song

Thoughts that we would blush to say
Come easily in song
So why the rush to say so long

There's no one calling you away
So stay with me
What say we while away the day

And pay the price
For just this once
Let's not think twice

",Stay with Me,1990
Scott Wade,"You call this equivalence
No, I call it a lie
There's no respect for life
Now come and find me
Come erase it now?
(Come on let me up)

So sit behind your desk and tell me
How I'm supposed to feel inside
You know I'm slowly dying
And what I have left is for you to decide

We keep on suffering everyday
The victims of opportunity
One nation under God, they said
We are all born dead

We are born dead but it's filled with love
But if it's lying
There's no respect for life, life never stops
Is this what [Incomprehensible]

So flex your muscle as you barricade
The whole world piece by piece
How long until the ocean overflows
Into our yards and streets?

We keep on suffering everyday
The victims of opportunity
One nation under God, they said
We are all born, we are all shaped, we are all born dead

We can't escape this
Until we unify as one
We'll fight the sickness
Until my time has come

We keep on suffering everyday
The victims of opportunity
One nation under God, they said
We are all born dead

We keep on suffering everyday
The victims of opportunity
One nation under God, they said
We are all born, we are all shaped, we are all born dead
",Born Dead,
Scott Wade,"Built to land hard
That's exactly where we left it
Slippery downslide
And you could never fake it
I apologize, so excuse me
Slow we pacify
Come in full swing

Silence
Maybe it'll seem like it's gone
Vacant
Knowing what you want when you can't
Balance
I could never stress it enough
Of all the right choices
I start with the wrong ones

Still falling, reckless and on again
Rumor mills got me locked in
Killing time, just hope it doesn't kill me
What is free? 
What is free when you won't stop watching me?

Everything I do is adding up  
Now I'm taking the warning
Everywhere I go…
I can't avoid it, but I can control it
Everything I do… I can't avoid it
Everywhere I go… 
I can't avoid it, but I can control it.",Full Swing,2013
Scott Walker,"What was it like when we were young
Sleeping in each others arms
Walking in each others dreams
Was it only yesterday
I've forgotten anyway

What was it like to hear your name
Where's the girl that I once knew
Running home through winter parks
Arm in Arm and heart in heart
Now like children in the dark
We hold hands and watch the rain

When you kissed my eyes awake
Running mornings crowded streets
Just to find we've missed our bus
But we'd laugh , kiss, what the hell

When you'd burst in from the rain
Clasp my head between your hands,
Kiss away the darkest day
Always there to understand.
You could make me proud again

Now I go aimlessly at night
Sleep with faces I don't know 
Always coming back to you
And the shadows of this room

I must search you eyes again
Just to find that they are dead

Always coming back to you",Always Coming Back to You,1967
Scott Walker,"In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam

There's a sailor who sleeps
While the riverbank weeps
With the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam

There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken down fight
And in the port of Amsterdam

There's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn
By the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats

Only fishheads and tails
He will show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can swallow the moon
That can haul up the sails

And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
Bring me more fish
Put it down by my side

Then he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he gets up and laughs
And he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to paunch

They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaks 
Splitting the night with the
Roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of
The accordion bursts

Then out to the night
With their pride in their pants
With the slut that they tow 
Underneath the street lamps

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He drinks to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love
To a thousand other men
They've bargained their bodies
And their virtue long gone
For a few dirty coins
And when he can't go on
He plants his nose in the sky
And he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry
For an unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam",Amsterdam,1967
Scott Walker,"Each night I meant to say
I missed her through the day
But I'd forget it
I never said it

I passed the flower shop
Lord knows I meant to stop
But I said tomorrow
Perhaps tomorrow

Tomorrow there'd be time
There'd always be another spring
Time to make her laughter ring
Time to give her everything

Angelica, my Angelica
There's so much you never knew
So much I always meant to say
And do, for you, for you
Angelica

And then the cold winds came
And when I spoke her name
And felt her near me
She couldn't hear me

Her shadow had been cast
Too many springs had passed

Now in my solitude
I tend the flowers that I buy
As they slowly fade and die
Watered by the tears I cry

And do, for you, for you

Scott Walker,"Now it begins, now that's you've gone
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn
Watching the clock till you return
Lighting that torch and watching it burn

Now it begins, day after day
This is my life, ticking away
Waiting to hear footsteps that say
Love will appear and this time to stay

Each time you go
I try to pretend
It's over at last
And this time the big hurt will end

Now it begins, now that's you've gone

But if you don't come back again
I'll wonder when, oh when will it end

Scott Walker,"My death is like 
A swinging door 
A patient girl who knows the score 
Whistle for her 
And the passing time 

My death waits like 
A bible truth 
At the funeral of my youth 
Weep loud for that 
And the passing time 

My death waits like 
A witch at night 
And surely as our love is bright 
Let's laugh for us 
And the passing time 

But whatever is behind the door 
There is nothing much to do 
Angel or devil I don't care 
For in front of that door 
There is you 

My death waits like 
A beggar blind 
Who sees the world with an unlit mind 
Throw him a dime 
For the passing time 

My death waits 
To allow my friends 
A few good times before it ends 
Let's drink to that 
And the passing time 

My death waits in 
Your arms, your thighs 
Your cool fingers will close my eyes 
Let's not talk about 
The passing time 

But whatever is behind the door 
There is nothing much to do 
Angel or devil I don't care 
For in front of that door 
There is you 

My death waits 
Among the falling leaves 
In magicians, mysterious sleeves 
Rabbits, dogs 
And the passing times 

My death waits 
Among the flowers 
Where the blackish shadow cowers 
Let's pick lilacs 
For the passing time 

My death waits in 
A double bed 
Sails of oblivion at my head 
Pull up the sheets 
Against the passing time 

But whatever is behind the door 
There is nothing much to do 
Angel or devil I don't care 
For in front of that door 
There is you",My Death,1967
Scott Walker,"Mist falls and his voice cracks from the morning
Flowers and my body feels like lead
Someone should have stopped the birds from singing today
Hammers from striking nails into clay

Her face penetrates the blue gray morning
Her eyes pregnant pools produce a tear
Someone should have shouted you had gone in her ear
That summer was stolen away

Such a small love
Such a little tear
You would laugh so loud
If you could see us here

With my one suit
Badly pressed and worn
Like a child left
In the world alone

He speaks I don't hear a word he's saying
Hang on to the pine trees and the snow
Reach out grab the memories that are left for your hand
They'll help you get by for a while

Such a small love
Such a little tear
Is this all that's left
On your cheek so pale

His shallow half lit eyes
His rotted teeth grown on
A drunken madman nights
Ending up in hjail

With night fallings
Drenched in day-glo red
Words collided
Things we left unsaid

Perfumed pillows
Girls that clung so near
Such a small love
Such a little tear",Such a Small Love,1967
Scott Walker,"Through a long and sleepless night
I whisper your name
Through a long and sleepless night
Of who is to blame

So alone, so without you

Why must I re-dream, re-live

Scott Walker,"Hello Mr. Big Shot
Say, you're looking smart
I've had a tiring day
I took the kids along to the park

You've become a stranger
Every night with the boys
Got a new suit
That old smile's come back
And I kiss the children good night
And I slip away on the newly waxed floor

I've become a giant
I fill every street
I dwarf the rooftops
I hunchback the moon

Stars dance at my feet
Leave it all behind me
Screaming kids on my knee
And the telly swallowing me
And the neighbor shouting next door
And the subway trembling the roller-skate floor

I seek the buildings blazing with moonlight
In Channing Way
Their very eyes seem to suck you in with their laughter
They seem to say

You're all right now
So stop a while behind our smile
In Channing Way

Oh to die of kisses
Ecstasies and charms
Pavements of poets will write that I died
In nine angel's arms

And they all were smiling
Still seductive as sin in their eyes
The man I had been
No more hard luck stories to wear
Nothing left to give
Why the hell should I care

Ann knows my smile and buries my shadow
In Channing Way
And with her cellophane sighs
Corrina the candle
Begs me to stay

You're all right now
So stop a while behind our smile

Scott Walker,"I've watched her from the river banks
I knew her when she danced with dreams
White doves were there to dress her hair
And so was Madelaine

At night the people's faces danced
Like pearls colliding on the breast
Of fat Marie whose thunder laugh
Was just a thread from crying

Her sailors stained her cobblestones
With wine and piss and death desire
And sometimes blood for Madelaine
Whose laughter was the night

Her girls would lift their dresses high
And breathe the stars and kiss the sky
She'd smother them with whispers then
Embrace them with her sighs

Before the bottle dulled my eyes
And made me so I couldn't stand
I'd overact and play the clown
When Madelaine would cry

And now I watch from riverbanks
I watch it weave it's memories
White doves turned gray and flew away
And so did Madelaine",The Bridge,1968

Are as fast as a game
Are as bright as a flame

The girls
Are as cold as the sphinx
Always dreaming of minks
They drive you to drink

The girls
Are as soft as a sigh
That whispers good-bye
And leaves you to cry

Well, they're only dogs
Just wagging their tails
As they watch it end

Will treat you like trash

Then they take it all back
Tie it up in a sack

They will give it of course
But they give with such force
That it gives you remorse

They give nothing at all
They just lift a leg

Mustache large like smoke from his cigar

Swallowing the pinwheel clowns
Consuming all the women
Like a giant sponge

They're just more wrong than right

She shrieks her gold teeth flash
With rapturous delight
Earthquaking the sawdust ground
He grabs my arm and out into the famished night

The tiny waltz of a merry go round
Cascading lights for every heartbeat

Hurry faster don't look back

I ride upon this giant storm
Through rust-red rooms where shadows breathe from every
board

The world is up for auction sales
A thousand lies descend
The women's tear-tracked cheeks
Still we'll dance them on and on
We can't stop now
Not now until we reach the dawn

Give us your thighs
Give us your sad and devouring eyes

In a mobile army whorehouse
Gift from the army, free of cost

A little touch of tenderness 
Maybe a word, a smile
An hour of happiness
But, next, next

Oh, it wasn't so tragic
The high heavens did not fall
But how much of that time
I hated being there at all
Next, next Now I always will recall
The brothel truck, the flying flags
The queer lieutenant who slapped
Our asses as if we were fags
Next, next

I swear on the wet head
Of my first case of gonorrhea
It is his ugly voice 
That I forever hear
Next, next

That voice that stinks of whiskey
Of corpses and of mud
It is the voice of nations
It is the thick voice of blood
Next, next

And since the each woman
I have taken to bed
Seems to laugh in my arms
To whisper through my head
Next, next

All the naked and the dead
Should hold each others hands
As they watch me scream at night
In a dream no one understands
Next, next

And when I am not screaming
In a voice grown dry and hollow
I stand on endless naked lines
Of the following and the followed
Next, next

Or burn myself alive

Never to be next
Never to be next.",Next,1968

A string tied to his underwear
Through cobbled stone streets a child races
And shouts ""Billy, come down from there""

""My mother's calling"" his voice whimpers

A child murmurs a weary sigh
My mother weeps, and weaves her hair
With worries please, Come down from there

Through fields of clay and granite grey
They play without a sound
Plastic palace Alice
Blows gaping holes to store her fears
Inside her lovers head

They rip your face with lies
To buzzing eyes you cry for help
Like gods they bark replies

And they took the detours that scattered the way
They departed from summer like two ragged soldiers
Dragging their heels through their fantasies

There were meals in the missions for two frozen statues
And long drafty sermons devouring their knees
Sometimes passions in winter turn to cold soundless moments
That teared in the eyes of their fantasies

There were nights on park benches, stale bread for the pigeons
Good mornings to faces who just turned away
And on one road confusion, the other desire
So they took to the road of their fantasies

One would speak of a lake where he used to go swimming
The other had no memories left for his mind

Laughed through a war that they couldn't see

And talk about virility
With some old grandmother
That might be decked out like a Christmas tree
And though pink elephants I'd see
Though I'd be drunk as I could be

And phony virgins
If I had banks on every finger

And every country ruled by me

Surrounded by some china men

Cause down below is really nowhere

Then I would know where I was going
And then I would become all knowing
My beard so very long and flowing
If I became deaf, dumb and blind
(was: If I could play deaf, dumb and blind)
Because I pitied all mankind
And broke my heart to make things right

When my angelic work was through

Would sing my childhood song to me

Lady's name was Susan Moore
Daddy was the law
Didn't know that I was poor
And lived outside the law

Daddy said I was a thief
Didn't have the love
But I was Susan's true belief
Married her for love

I was there to steal the money
Take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none

Now she lived and built a wall
To keep the robbers out
Didn't care a thing at all
That's what I'm about

Scott Walker,"The little clock's stopped ticking now
We're swallowed in the stomached rue
The only sound to tear the night
Comes from the man upstairs

His bloated belching figure stomps
He may crash through the ceiling soon
The window sees trees cry from cold
And claw the moon

But we know don't we
And we'll dream won't we
Of Montague Terrace in blue

The girl across the hall makes love
Her thoughts lay cold like shattered stone
Her thighs are full of tales to tell
Of all the nights she's known

Your eyes ignite like cold blue fire
The scent of secrets everywhere
A fist filled with illusions
Clutches all our cares

Every month was may

Scott Walker,"Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky, love
But now it must fall to the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal just how badly you feel
'Cause there is no easy way down

The view from the cliffs must have been exciting
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone and the past is unknown
And there is no easy way down

No, it isn't very easy when you're left on your own
No, it isn't very easy when each road you take
Is one more mistake, there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home, yeah

Scott Walker,"Oh I can see them now
Clutching a handkerchief
And blowing me a kiss
Discreetly asking how
How came he died so young
Or was he very old
Is the body still warm
Or is it already cold
All doors are open wide
They grope around inside
At my desk my drawers my trunk
There's nothing left to hide
Some love letters are there
And an old photograph 
They've laid my poor soul bare
And now all they do is laugh

Oh I can see them all
So formal and so stiff
Like a sergeant at arms
At a policeman's ball
And everybody's pushing
To be the first in line
Their hearts upon their sleeves
Like a ten cent valentine
The old women are there 
Too old to give a damn
They've brought along the kids
Who don't know who I am
They're thinking about the price of my funeral bouquet
What they're thinking isn't nice
For now they'll have to pay

Oh I see all of you
All of my phony friends
Who can't wait for it ends
Who can't wait till it's through
Oh I see all of you
You've been laughing all these years
Now all that you have left
Are a few crocodile tears
Ah you don't even know
That you're entering your hell
As you leave my cemetery
You think you're doing well
With that one who's at your side
You're as proud as you can be
Ah she's going to make you cry
But not the way you cried for me

Oh I can see me now
So cold and so alone
As the flowers slowly die
In my field of little bones
Oh I can see me now
I can see me at the end
Of this voyage that I'm on
Without a love without a friend
Now all this that I see 
Is not what I deserve
They really have a nerve
To say these things to me
No girls just bread and water
And your money you must save
For there'll be nothing left for us
When you're dead and in your grave",Funeral Tango,1981

I saw him playing chess with Death yesterday
His crusade was a search for God and they say
It's been a along way to carry on

Anybody hear of plague in this town
The town I've left behind was burned to the ground
A young girl on a stake her face framed in flames cried
I'm not a witch God knows my name

The knight he watched with fear
He needed to know
He ran where he might feel God's breath
And in the misty church
He knelt to confess
The face within the booth was Mr. Death

My life's a vain pursuit of meaningless smiles
Why can't God touch me with a sign
Perhaps there's no one there answered the booth
And Death hid within his cloak and smiled

This morning I played chess with Death said the knight
We played that he might grant me time
My bishop and my knight will shatter his flanks
And still I might feel God's heart in mine

And through confession's grille Death's laughter was heard
The knight cried No you've cheated me!
But still I'll find a way
We'll meet once again and once again
Continue to play

They met within the woods the knight his squire and friends
And Death said now the game shall end
The final move was made
The knight hung his head
And said you've won I've nothing left to play

The minstrel filled with visions sang to his love
To look against the stormy sky
The knight his squire and friends
Their hands held as one
Solemnly danced toward the dawn

We came riding through like warriors from afar
Our black horses danced upon the graves of yesterday's desires
Haunted by our visions framed in fire
I greet you, for you still believe in what's behind a door
You've seen the children freeze upon their knees
And praying to the wind
Descend their grey madonnas back again
Fire the guns, and salute the men who died for freedom's sake
And we'll weep tonight, but we won't lie awake
Gazing up at statues dressed in stars
We won't dream, for they don't come true for us
Not anymore
They've run afar to hide in caves
With haggard burning eyes
Their icy voices tear our hearts like knives

We came through
Like the Gothic monsters perched on Notre Dame
We observe the naked souls of gutters pouring forth mankind
Smothered in an avalanche of time
And we're giants as we watch our kings and countries raise their shields
And Guevara dies encased in their ideals
And as Luther King's predictions fade from view

And all my love's faces

Her cloak in her arms

The king of all places
And your tenderest warnin'
Could bruise all her charm

But don't lose your heart
To that beautiful sinner
She walks without shining a light now

She stands in the shade
And the sun is there in her
But you'll never know till it's night

All my love's softness
And ll my love's graces
She carries all things
In her tiny white glove

She hides all her lostness
In satins and laces
And everyone says, everyone says
She's searching for sweet love

But don't try to hold on
To Satan's proud lady
She stands with her flock
All alone on the hill

Her stockings are hung
And her eyes are so shady
She's winning and you never will

There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes
Against the sun that rises over the land

I watch you walk away
Somehow if have to let you go
Now it's over

If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget

Though there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say
It's over

So I turn my back
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Trying not to think at all

I send my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me
It's over

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share would always be

There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
To make us realize our night is over

Scott Wright,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2000
Scott Wright,"I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good would it do?
For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is through

I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new
Within my heart
I know I will never start

Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine

Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine

Give me, give me one more chance

Amie, what you wanna do
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer, if I do?

Don't you think the time was right for us to find

Scott Wullkotte,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight

Scott-Wesley Brown,"There is no problem so big, God cannot solve it
There is no mountain so tall, He cannot move it
There is no storm so dark, God cannot calm it
There is no sorrow so deep, God cannot soothe it

If He carried the weight of the world
Upon His shoulders
I know my brother, that He will carry you
If He carried the weight of the world
Upon His shoulders
I know, my sister, that He will carry you

",He Will Carry You,1988
Scott-Wesley Brown,"You have faced the mountains of desperation
You have climbed, you have fought, you have won
But this valley that lies coldly before you
Casts a shadow you cannot overcome

And just when you thought you had it all together
You knew every verse to get you through
But this time the sorrow broke more than just your heart
And reciting all those verses just won't do

When answers aren't enough, there is Jesus
He is more than just an answer to your prayer
And your heart will find a safe and peaceful refuge
When answers aren't enough, He is there

Instead of asking why did it happen
Think of where it can lead you from here
And as your pain is slowly easing, you can find a greater reason
To live your life triumphant through the tears",When Answers Aren't Enough,1995

Only to be told
I can't see
I can't breathe
No more will we be

And nothing's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse,
See, its a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these

Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground

And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can choose a color
Of her child
That's not nature's way

Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion

She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile
It's like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do
Coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
And I come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Good-bye
The sky it was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal myth
Will lift you up until you break
It won't stop
I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm and a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up
I took the hit I was given
Then I bumped again
And then I bumped again
How do I get back there to
The place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Good-bye
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling
An earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right
All right
When the plane came in
She said she was crashing
The velvet it rips
In the city we tripped
On the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
The days you were wearing
That velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties
They pass the test
Slide up around the belly
Face down on the mattress
One
Now you hold me
And we're broken
Still its all that I want to do just a little I
Feel myself with a head made of the ground
I'm scared but I'm not coming down
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws just locked now in smile
But nothing is all right
All right
I want something else
To get me through this life
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say

His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.

Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.

And they open my eyes to the woman of my dreams strolling in
With a small touch of shyness and a smooth kind of style
She kisses me on the cheek and she says with a smile
""I've been waiting all my life for you baby, where have you been?""

Oh, I've never been more ready than I am right now
I know sooner or later, someway, somehow
Somebody's gonna walk up
And join somebody sittin' right here
So wherever, whoever you are the coast is clear

Girl, wherever, whoever you are the coast is clear
Afternoon low tide, I'm just workin' my plan
Right now, right here the coast is clear oh, yeah

Scotty Emerick,"You’ve been a part of my life so very long
It’s hard for me to believe sometimes, you’re really gone
I tuck your memory away in my special hiding place
Just hoping no one can tell by the look on my face

That you’re still in my heart
Always on my mind
A part of my everyday

Like just last night, I went out for a bite
And I tried to have fun with her on my mind
But even the laughter, it wasn’t much of a break
'Cause right in the middle of my strawberry shake

Bobby Joe walked in
With a couple of friends and said
""Hey man, have you seen her at all?
Like where’s she been?""

And it struck a nerve and it hit a vein
You’d think from all the tears I’ve cried
This broken hearted pain
I wouldn’t have to carry you around with me

But it seems like everywhere I go
There's somebody wants to know where you’ve been
And are you coming back again
I swear I can’t take you anywhere

So I left all alone, I just headed on home
As I listened to the messages on my telephone
There was one from my sister and one from an old friend
(Hey man, I drove by your house tonight, dude, but uh)
You weren’t in

Just checkin' up on you, boy
I hope you’re doin' alright
Oh, by the way, man, I seen her last night

And it struck a nerve and it hit a vein
You’d think from all the tears I’ve cried
This broken hearted pain
I wouldn’t have to carry you around with me

But it seems like everywhere I go
There's somebody wants to know where you’ve been
And are you coming back again

Oh baby, I swear I can’t take you anywhere
No no no no no
I can’t take you anywhere, baby
Oh, no no

She saved me the trouble of watching her cry

In the time we've spent together I have learned to trust in you
So many things you've given before I even asked you to
But reality and romance are sometimes far apart
So what I really need to know is can I trust you with my heart?

Can I cast my cares upon you, can you stand a heavy load
Can I count on you to walk me down that long and winding road
If you promise me these simple things I can guaranty

He swore that it saved his life
His only hope when there was no hope left
Was in that Old King James

Passed it down to Momma on the day he died
Sat there for the longest time just gathering the dust
But when life would take a sharp turn every now and then
And she would just start missing him, I'd see her pick it up
Now the cover's torn
and the leather's worn on that Old King James

You'll find on every other page
Yellow lines or tear drop stains
Every chapter of that good book
Been through cancer, war and crazy kids
All the stupids things I did
I may never know the toll I took on her
And that Old King James

Yeah I'm the one who's got it now

[Chorus]
It's always too soon
It's always too fast
There'll never come a day
That you don't want 'em back
It ain't about the numbers
Chiseled in concrete
It's how they lived their lives
In the dash between
In the dash between

He was a steelworker's son
Homecoming king
He trained day and night
For that championship ring
He found him a girl
Made her his queen
And he fought for his country
And he gave it everything

[Chorus]
It's always too soon
It's always too fast
There'll never come a day
That you don't want 'em back
It ain't about the numbers
Chiseled in concrete
It's how they lived their lives
In the dash between
In the dash between

Their first breath and their last
Marks all the memories of the past
That little black line defines a legacy

It's always too soon
It's always too fast
They're always too young
It's always so sad
It ain't about the numbers
Chiseled in concrete
It's how they lived their lives
In the dash between
In the dash between

Scotty McCreery,"I park the car out on the beach, let the water kiss my feet
Can hear the music coming from the pier
The beat is fast, the bass is loud
I could disappear into the crowd
But I think that I'll just stay out here
'Cause since you're gone

[Chorus]
I can't hear another feel good summer song
The sunshine only lights up what is wrong
I should just give in and sing along and laugh like we used to
The tide is high, the sky is blue, but how can I get over you
When every station is playing a feel good summer song

It seems like you were just right here
The sand was white, the coast was clear
You kissed me just so you could steal my shades
We snuck off underneath the dock
As the waves crashed on the rocks
You told me that you'd always feel this way
But now you're gone

[Chorus]
I can't hear another feel good summer song
The sunshine only lights up what is wrong
I should just give in and sing along and laugh like we used to
The tide is high, the sky is blue, but how can I get over you
When every station is playing a feel good summer song

Since you're gone, the music's trying to sway me to move on
But I just wanna stay here all night long missing you
Wishing you would come back but you're gone

I can't hear another feel good summer song
The sunshine only lights up what is wrong

Yo, I break punks up like a fight. Give me the mic, I'm hype. 
(Damn kid, you're starvin' for life) 
'Cause people be tellin' me, brothers be gellin' me, 
Tryin' to get fame from my name but they chumps and they but soft. 
They know I'm wilder than a dog with hot sauce. 
A mic, a stage, a crowd, and I won't stop: 
I set it off and get live like an alarm clock. 
People thought Scoob and Scrap was just a nickname; 
Now that we rap, we sell more records than cocaine. 
Awww, shucks, now I'm back from the down-low, 
Here comes Scoob with the curly afro. 
No chemical reaction, no need for askin', pure satisfaction, 
My last name's Jackson. 
You slip up, I get ill - my boot to your grill,

Yo, I drop science kinda like a pigeon
Over rough tracks I tax any midget with a small digit. 
Smooth and mild but complicated, 
I put the crowd to to smashed like a driver that's intoxicated.

But wouldn't squeeze a lemon in a cocktail. 
Don't say ""huh?"" or ""what?"", and don't ask who, 
'Cause if you hear me, I must be talkin' to you. 
You probably thought I couldn't steal it, 'cause I was a dancer, 
I didn't have a chance, but ya'll can kill it. 
You gotta be off your rocker, 
I'm lettin' suckers know that Scrap got more soul than Foot Locker. 
And if you heard I got skills, believe it's true; 
Suggest for Pete Rock, for reminiscin' over you. 
It's not a threat, it's a bet, 'cause hey, 
The last sucker who tried woulda been 25 today.

Big Daddy are ya with me?

Yo-yo-yo-yo, look out, get out the way! 
Here comes the K the A the N the E - huh, ya better flee. 
'Cause I don't need no hoodie to be hard, shoot: 
I'll kill a nigga in a three-piece suit. 
I don't be havin' it so the rear I'll attack, 
A size-15 to the buttocks, a-matter-fact. 
A hard-core blow to the face I'll provide, 
To give you a Crooked eye, just like St. Ides. 
Leave you home and you must be screamin' and yellin'; 
Not even cool Moe Dee shades can hide your swellin'. 
I bring it rough, tough; 
I said that I was Browner than Bobby, so you know that it's good enough. 
I'm untouchable to rappers my size. 
You dreamed of beatin' me, you better wake up an apologize.

But with me, you'd have no Ranks if your name was Shabba.

Ha, I'm not a chocolate brother, but I don't' mourn, 
'Cause I swear this vanilla kid got it goin' on. 
So don't even step to me if you're worth nothin', 
Because I just might hurt somethin'. 
My competition thinks twice, 'cause yo, for a young nigga, I'm kinda nice...

There's the Devil to pay - he can keep the change - I can't stand the thought

I found there was a hole in my spiritual parachute after I jumped from the
Astral plain
No escape from four stone slimy walls I built up while trying to knock them
Down
DEATH warrant DEATH wwatch DEATH rattle DEATH'S door - ain't I died enough
Before?
Deliver me from this treachery... Deliver me from this AGONY
Stop trying to make a man of me... I ain't got the raw materials, see?
I'm a killer with a label and a blueprint of Babel and all of my DEATH cards
Are on the table
I met my maker and I don't like what I see... Medusa is fondling me
Blut und Boten are strictly verboten, it's a classic case of mort subite
But what I thought was the quickest solution turned out to be satanic destiny
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE
The jig is up - my fate is sealed
I'm stood on the gallows again
The inscription on my tombstone reads ""WISH YOU WERE HERE""

I'm KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKIN' on DEATH'S DOOR
Do you remember where you've SEEN this CADAVER before?
This swan-song's floating on a watery grave...
BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT BABY!!!

SATAN PLACE)
",Satan Place,1984
Scraping Foetus off the Wheel,"Lurchin' round the parking lot
A man possessed of not a lot
Skin and bones and rings and crown
Legs reach right down to the ground
Swivel hips and loose lips
Stab the dagger, turn it round
His life's an open book
Scribbled in his own blood

His constant companion is always at hand
Making entries in his diary
The diary of Sick Man

Overcome by waves of lechery
One for you sixteen for me
Kill the monkey on his back
He kisses big, he kisses black
Profile of Neanderthal
Leaves his debris in the hall
Pushover furniture, barroom brawls
Taking notes from toilet walls
His victim screams, he has a ball
The bigger the head, the harder they fall

He lives a life of luxury, he lives a life of misery
The entries in his diary are the entries of Sick Man
His constant companion is always at hand
Making entries in his diary
The diary of Sick Man

His pen's as mighty as his sword
Bites off more than he can afford
The torture-meister relishing
Intimidating everything
Typewriter rhythms drowning the
Newly acquired insecurity
Gets in fights, stays up nights
Rends and mends companion's tights
Forcing symptoms of his own disease
A boy for you, Black Plague for me

His constant companion is always at hand
Making entries in his diary
The diary of Sick Man
His constant companion is always at hand
Making entries in his diary
The diary of Sick Man

Blackheaded Blackguard with a blackjack
Laced his coffee with spoons of RATSAC
Hangs his trophies on walls of his place
Hangs his carrots in front of his own face
Lust and greed has swallowed him
Tearing limb from hymn to limb
He's worried now, he got a gun
Swallowed in his clammy hams
All he got for Christmas was
A chip on his shoulder
And a constant reminder

Left companion in pool of blood
She had tried to make him taste his own medicine
Gone down dead end alleyway
""Hey, Sick Man! Suck this, Sick Man! Eat hot lead!""
He's grinding, shaking, dancing dead
Illegal entries in his diary, diary of Sick Man

His constant companion is always at hand
Making entries in his diary

The SNOT-GREEN sea - the SCROTUM-TIGHTENING sea
Cast thine bread upon the water - the SALTY water of the BRINY DEEP
Eternal backstroke in the vasty deep of the ocean of fire and brimstone
Looking at a haunted void - I'm all at sea, flat on thine back
As buoyant as the Titanic fifty years on so COME ON, Neptune, DRAG ME DOWN
Tadpole in the dead dead sea - FIREWATER! FIREWATER!

I could walk on water 'til I landed in strife now I'm treading water
NOW I SWIM FOR MY LIFE

Stuck my wet to in a live hot socket
STUCK MY WET TOE IN A LIVE HOT SOCKET, WET TOE IN A LIVE HOT SOCKET

I got a BIRTHMARK/DEATHMASK shaped like the USA
SEE ME SQUIRM with the sins of a nation see me
RUN ROUND IN CIRCLES of bitter frustration
My neckties turned into a hangman's noose, I'd cry in pain if the tearducts
Could cut me loose
My head's turned to rust... My skull's about to split
I can't get rid of this EMOTIONAL SHIT!
KILL!!! KILL!!! KILL!!!
I got hangnails on my hangnails... Visions of the blackhooded hangman's noose
Every time I close my fingers (I) try to use my nailclippers to cut me loose
My cuticles are screaming for MERCY... Fingernails are bitten to the quick
And the DEAD

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Pick up lines like ""What's your sign"" won't get

When me and all my girls go walking down the street
It seems we can't go anywhere without a car that
Goes ""Beep-beep""

I can't blame those horny boys, I would make me
Mine

Back up boy, I ain't your toy, or your piece of ass

Then I drink so much, I am a Sprite man
Do it solo, I don't wanna hype man
I can make a song off top, I rock and write, fam
Anytime I speak, that's bars for the fans
I've been on a high note from I started my plans
Got a face for music, hail up Chams
Wasting any time ain't part of the plan
It's about man grabbing yellow dots like it's Pac-Man
Be your own boss so a man can't sack man
Drop the first one, drop the sequel
You might last long in the game just like Lethal

My face is bait, I can't hide it
I make the beat sound better when I ride it
We're top of the game, they don't like it
I hit the road everyday like a cyclist
They can't battle with us, we're like vikings

When you see me, I will leave you no doubt
I'm the coolest man that ever walked this earth
I've been the coolest since the day of my birth
I am the cool

I drive a little red sports car, as you plainly can see
Them young girls, I can't keep 'em away from me
You know Madonna? Well I saw her yesterday
Had too many women so I pushed her away
Walked into the Paramount Hotel in New York City
There were 72 women waiting there just for me
Just one problem with all these women so fine:
So many of them, so little time
I am the cool

I wear the coolest clothes that ever could be
I look so good even Calvin Klein stares at me
Red bands on my hat, a glass of chavvers in my hand
One look at me and the little girls understand
Someone come up with a gun to steal the rolex off my wrist
Two seconds later he was down with one blow of my fist
I dragged his sorry ass to the town in the middle of the day
I hung him up on a flagpole with a sign, ""Don't mess with Screamin' Jay""
I am the cool

The finest restaurants, well they all know me by my name
They gave me the best table and send everyone else away
Pheasant under glass, lobster and steak tartar
Finished it off with a fine cuban cigar
Headed on back home to my penthouse suite
With a fine young lady who's good enough to eat
She feeds me grapes and cheese and opens a Dom Perignon
And we made love until the night time's gone

Well I know his son and I stole his daughter

Well what's so hard is we're all confined
By the laws of something that's more divine

Everywhere and everyone has something going on
Anytime the sun don't shine or you're left behind or out of season
Constant changes moving on, shine over me

So I lost my sense of humour
I hope it's gonna find me sometime soon
Those times when you cannot be prepared
They suck the life right out of you

All you ask is to continue
But it leaves you spinning round and round
You don't need that pain within you
You've gotta wash it out, wash it out and kick it down

Anywhere and anyone, anytime or any reason
Everywhere and everyone has something going wrong
Anytime the sun don't shine or you're left behind or out of season
Constant changes moving on, shine over me

Well everywhere and everyone has many types of different reasons
Anytime that it all goes wrong just shine over me
Anytime you're left behind or the sun won't shine or you're out of

Constant changes moving on, shine over me

Anywhere, anyone, anytime you care to mention
Everywhere and everyone has something going wrong
Anytime you're left behind and the heartache and the pain take over
Just stick around and shine over me

Cracks in your walls greet me just like before

You gotta lose your way to find it

Broken hearted daydreams in back of all our minds
Welcome to reality it's not a realization
It's everlasting but I would go through

tears are falling and I feel a pain
Wishin' you were here by me
to end this misery and I wonder

But who's in charge of your destiny
Some dumb fucker or is it you know
It's not what's in between your legs
But what's inside your head that counts
You say you're worthless
But I see through the bullshit
You're not helpless you can stand on your own two feet
So why do you let yourself be treated like a piece of meat
A fucking piece of meat
You call it life I call it rape, I call it prostitution
I don'w know why you hate yourself
Cause you're not ugly at all
So let the sunshine in
And chase away your blues
Smilers never lose and frowners never win
So let the sunshine in
I know it's fucking hard
But now it's time to try and start to
Let the sunshine in
So when you feel fucked up like your life is in the gutter
Think about it for a minute
It's what you say that matters
Don't call it life, call it life, call it prostitution
And you won't have to hate yourself
Beacause you're a beautiful person",Sunshine,1988

and I look the other way
I'm just going home I've had a long day
I'll leave you alone I'll stay out of your way
I'm just going home
is it the way I look or just cause I'm a man
it would be easier to take if I don't understand
why you need to worry
there's a lot of creeps out there
what can I say to show you that this time
you don't have to be scared
try to say something it's all I can do

Was it just a game to you
But I m in so deep

Do you have to, do you have to let it linger

But I was wrong, but I was wrong

Impossible to count

Underlying values occupying too much time

Who's gonna be the first to hold onto their stone
Admit they are mistaken leave sin alone
Who's gonna be the last after the stone cold cast
To leave friends behind to much to ask

What we do says where that we go
What we do says where that we go
What we do says where that we go
What we do says where that we go
And friends can be so many real so hard if any",My Crazy Life,1997

Ayo, Auxillary cops be grillin' me out patrol cars
why's my chain so big with no job?
remain so jig with no scars, infinite names
ain't it funny how the innocent change?
used to be kinda quiet, 
a whole different way, fake permit in my wallet 
until the shit expired
learned to drive at age Twenty-Five, see I used to catch cabs
smokin' lye while my girl fuck with mesc tabs
do anything just to laugh 
I'll cop anything to to have
rock it once, put it in a hustlers path
I got signed with no rhymes wrote
wrote it quick, throwin' rhymes out for free so ya'll could know my shit
know my zip, 11101
pretend thug niggas own one gun
bust shots and don't run
late nights the police don't come
and if you still don't know where I'm from...

real, the love (organized crime)

Verse 2: (KL)
Livin' life on the edge way back
now I get money and stay black
some find it funny, others hate that
reason why the angers developed
put a shell up in the chamber, let the gun smoke from the Nine I tote
bassheads numbed off coke, a rib got broke
police slid
Yo, yo, you see what they did?
a lot of money to be made, now they raid the spot
niggas engagin' to pop shots 
aimin' to drop cops
the block's hot, niggas on the roofs of houses
there's a thousand niggas with schemes for gettin' figures
the Bridge blossoms with gossip
chicks who cock suck
niggas who hardly wash up
and they light as paper weight
I guess it's safe to say my hood's got tradition
Q.B. Cobolition, while you be tryin' to listen
regradless of the district we ballin' on a mission
at any given moment I destroy competition.

Chorus 
Verse 3: (Kyron)
Fuck, I hate 'em and the Fourtieth will put the chamber to their brain
and bang 'em
you violatin' Q.B.? had to lay 'em
I'll serve you if you onto that
hit 'em up with all of that
Seventeen, applaudin' they gat, I wrote a song to that
twist the erb, dispose of that sack, ain't no more of that
it's 2:30 am black, where ya Daughter at?
the truth hurt, now I'm up in shorty boo's skirt
take a sip of Jack D and relax G, it attracts me
you want to know who's Donnin' these hoes? just ask me
the way the jewels flash makes 'em want to be nasty
Cuban Link cable, Dom Peri on the table
look unstable, now I see why Brother Cain killed Abel
love thy neighbor, we can live in the World
that's your Man Fifty Grand 'till he fucks your Girl

Tellin me he's comin home, and how he's gettin off

With new plans, to expand, to jerk his mans man
We had the ultimate stick up, drop, on the brick pick up
But yo he can't, ''cause he's still locked up
Jump back on the horn ''cause his vibe was strong
Contacted the kid and told him lets be gone
I talked to Poet first, yo son, I got a mish-shon
Grab the ammunnish-shon, pump up your pythons
I know a spot where niggas gettin it, and we can flip on
Son they frustrate me, ''cause these niggas pump with no heat
They play the night time sweet, like they can't get beat
I got their address, to where they rest and stash their shit
Yo, I peeped it out how we can creep, yo yo yo
These niggas stay sleep 
Makin sales, smokin out, and they all get ?geeked?
Lets catch 'em zoning, brain under, high and headed home and
When they least expect it, lets put the gat to his dome

half a pie in the trunk with the music blastin
Clouds of smoke, yo this lifes no joke
We from QB son, we ain't tryin to be broke
We makin moves to where the money's at, get it up and bring it back
New cats the boogie OT knew how to work it
Get the money, couldn't keep it ''cause they jerked it
Bad habits, livin lavish, rockin front and cabbage
Tyrin to follow the leader, but paul paid for peter
The dirty south ain't the place to sign, son keep ya heat up
I'm from NY, city slicker, beat'choo with the G quicker
Business so well I'll have your towns clientelle
Kyron but me on through the cell, my OT
Get that brick money son, I'll meet you back in QB
See we flee off, know how to gee off, know how to eat off
Know how to make moves so we can keep the heat off

It seems like life's tryin to put me through a test
'cause every fuckin day it's just gettin worse
what's worse? Might go out, die hard and end up in a hearse
But no time to think about the consequences
The years in jail, fuck the death sentence
All I know is that I need mad cash in a flash
Befo' I gotta kill somebody ass
Might as well be in jail or dead
'cause if you ain't gettin paid then you ain't gettin ahead (that's word nigga)
Sittin in my room with the lights out thinkin'
I'm alive, but I ain't livin, I'm leakin'
I made my bed and I'ma lay in it
But I ain't gonna stay in it
I might start sprayin shit
I should've stayed in school, but that's a dead issue
Fuck a G.E.D., that's like toilet tissue
All my friends are hoodlums and hustlers
Runnin with a bunch of stupid crazy motherfuckers
Niggaz fuckin their money up, niggaz gettin knocked
And jealous motherfuckers, they want the whole block
Though I could start flippin gettin on a mission

But I need much more, no time for bullshittin'
Niggaz listen...

The H-E-A-T- makes me crazy
I want to bust somethin, figures, touch somethin'
The heat is on, got a niggaz blood rushin'
I want to touch somethin, niggaz bust somethin'

Yo, all I know is guns, all I do is slug
I'd rather plug you with the heater than to have you front
My life revolves around the snub 4th
Stay gettin those outside of New York
Bullets from the cornerstone, I'm bringin home a arsen
Interstate 95 North to the Jackie Robinson
Watch out for D's in caprices in tauruses
Empire mistakes for cops, mad nervous
Back at home sell a few burners
Keep a miz and a seven mil for my personal
Walk with benevolence, holdin twin fifths
380's in the whip, a mini-eagle for my chick
That nigga P is sick, I need a silencer connect, see me
Niggaz be lyin, tellin stories, tell it walkin'
My nigga's into drugs and extortion
Knotty head for them niggaz on the nightshift pumpin'
The heat is on nigga....

Life's full of love and hate
So we got crums to make
Survival's at stake
We under pressure
Still, we need to treasure
No exceptions, drastic measures
Its my life, no exceptions
Life's full of love and hate
So we got crums to make
Survival's at stake
We under pressure
Still, we need to treasure
No exceptions, drastic measures
You got one life, no exceptions

Now who ran guns with Bounty, did a joint with Rakim
A song with Mariah that had the whole world poppin
Who that be the are-A-Double P-E-are
Niggas fuck with this and they get sent to the E.R.
Now I'm rockin jams with the Screwball fam
They connected so thick, with them men in submission you know who ???
Screwball and the Mobb so sick
We repin' QB son, they wouldn't understand it
We roll so thick that niggas get Noyd
Niggas don't want it 'cause Noyd bring noise
No way, niggas can't stop me, son it shocked me 
They tried, I pulled out and popped three

Chorus

Hey yo
Light the blunts up, cook the coke up
One Times out, so what motherfucker I'm tryin to blow up
And when they show up I put the cracks in the stash
The gats in the grass, when they roll I just blast
With no problem bumpin Primo, to niggas we know
You try, you die like Peschi in Casino
No exceptions to the rule, the Ball to the Screw
Go back like ""check one two""
Street gang to the rap game
Worldwide thang, thugstyle niggas feel the pain
Gotta go hard and sunshine they rain
Blow the block up, fuck niggas, with no exceptions

I'm'a blow my steel, grab the chicken as a human sheild
Break elbows and wheel, no exception is the drill
Is it real, I'm cryin blunt retaliation
Follow ?wallet? for your information
4-1-1, scoop all we want dun-dun
Cash is the issue, while you blab about ya pistol
But you never blast a missile, ship your bagette pistol
Gettin scissors on they gun shot wound, you doomed
With no exception

Chorus

Yo, the streets baptised me to money and war
Gettin yours is a law that we never ignore
We score twice or more, keep it moving twenty-four
We seven days with no rest, still fresh looking
Our names inflamed with the smell of tongue cooking
The hoods rotten, we see the ??? from the crabs plottin
The sneak kill, sabatoge our deal
But we overlook it, 'cause our environment is crooked
And hard to finger who the D's got as a singer
Spillin the beans on the dealers and the fiends
So I move separate and conversate with the connections
On the low key, gettin this money with no exceptions

Chorus

Yeah that's right
We all Screwball up in here
No exceptions baby

Drugs in my shirtsleeve 
The side bubble converti 
Eyes low cause the lye blow 
Five-oh know we dirty drive slow 
Write a line sipping a glass of wine 
The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind 
When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with 
Exhale precise shine like cocian white 
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know 
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinite's and lexus 
So send my enimies a message 
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot 
I'm still protected 
So never ask why I write so violent 
My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island 
I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and 
When I performed niggas mic's went silent 
To the kid who made my man ill will bless this

When I catch up to your ass you know the deal

Screwball,"""Basically over, basically over, basically over""--Raekwon (Scratched my Primo)

The games over, feds took your Range Rover
Your man snitched and your girl's screaming ""I told ya""
About those over the shoulder boulders that you be having
Niggas smile in ya face, behind yo' back they back-stabbing
Laughing, talkin 'bout all ya business
How much you got to score with, to niggas you went to war with
How many guns you got, and where you go to cop
You shoulda seen me coming down the block
You was gettin hot, but you didn't give a fuck
You make a G in a day and spend it up
In a black Benz tinted up, pound of weed twist it up
Henny pourin out ya cup, livin it up
?Daddy Warbuck? style

Chours: repeat x2

I watched niggas rise, I watched niggas fall down (Fall down)
I seen it all, it went down in my town (Where, where?)
Called Queensbridge, where the fugitives live
Where some rap kids (Rap kids) can turn to big wigs (Big wigs)

My niggas rollin dice and fled
Braggin to the nigga with the slice in his head
Now there's a price on his head
For pullin out on Lil Bro
Flashin his heat, he askin for beef
Conference call, ready to brawl
Caught him on a Blaz'a 
He breathing hard like he got asthma
Choice words he spoke, headed for disaster
Last to the gramma I spit
Told him ""Fuck you and whoever you get""
He's like ""Whatever kid""
Fourteen days later
Whole team made they way to my block
Young bucks with guns tucked and cocked
Like they runnin the spot
I'm'a load one bullet for all of y'all
You saw it on my face, war ready
I'm callin the pace, its gettin more steady
Don't bite what you can't chew
Dumb little niggas like ""That ain't'choo""
Yo, recognize what it coulda came to
Put a whole in you, just like a navel

Til they only child, you pull car you'll get a wild

A wise one, step ahead, keep my fam fed
Broke bread off this game and I held my head
You want details, then lets negotiate crack sales

Ay-yo who shot Rudy in broad daylight for cash?
I woke up this morning and hear the newsflash
They said it happened down at City Hall
He had his wife with I'm from the crowd made him fall
It was chaos and pandemonium blood covered up the podium
Covered his face, and wouldn't show me him
I had to see if it was true
Secret service was mad nervous, so was the boys in blue
Scatterin', like rats and ants, with the lights on
Man hunt the suspect all night long
Interrupted episodes, every channel show
Barricaded the city and blocked every road
Jakes in riot gear, blacks smilin' it is
Reporters cryin out in the street, ?""It ain't Rudy!""?
He ain't dead off, somebody blew his head off and skated out
Commissioner live on channel five when they announced his death
Wifey was stressed, she was right there
She stated: it was like a nightmare
One-time, was combing the streets, had the whole force on the beat
Flyin' in cars and on feet
The D's came through stompin'
Ghetto birds had the projects lookin' like Compton with marksmen
With dirty thirties out the window
I'm in my room smokin' boom, playin' Nintendo, high off the indo
Who shot Rudy?

[Chorus]
From courthouse to your house
Rich house to poor house
QB to Shaolin, Brooklyn Long Island
BX to Money Makin', YO and New Ro
The news final, yo, who shot Rudy?

They speculated it was mob related
Every wise guy with mafia ties, interrogated for lies
Every king and yeta, had the linguistics
Snatchin' they gats for ballistics and expert statistics
Were drawn out, gang unit was all worn out
Investigatin' his body and everybody else
Whoever gave threats, made bets or wages
Cash donators from the campaign stages
Cab drivers and frank vendors who protested
Were roughed up like Abner, gettin broom molested
Sharp lawyer suit-breasted, double-breasted reporters
Was mobbin' daughters and other mourners
Pushin' cameras away, blockin' the sights
Had the riot squad at Washington Heights
Kennedy Airport, stoppin' flights, niggaz was tight
Cause the couldn't sell a dime all night, but that was alright
The devil died and nobody cried
They was real like some Jews celebratin' when the pharaohe got killed
Glasses of Henny were spilled and we got twisted
Smokin' blunts on the corner like we used to cause we lived it
Knowin' he was gone for good ???, it got me thinkin'
Ay-yo, where the fuck Dinkens?
And Harlem World, Shaolin to Brownsville
Did Sharpton and Farrakhan make the shit real?
Was it Khalel? you know he keep mad steel
Did the Bloods or the Crips smoke Rudy on the hill

Shoot the breeze, volley how the computers might freeze
So I'm'a store water, guns, can foods and keep order

I'm on the hill high off the real, pumpin' my bolos (Yeah)
Prediction told us turn into rollers, don't let the street control us (What happened)
'Cause when those crackers pull the plug they gonna creep the holders
I send my deacon donors, black re-bels, who kill de-vels
And move through cells we rule this hell (Screwball)

Bomb the White House run up in the pentagon and spray it out

Powerful crimes in America, corna' to corna'

Aimin' for the kill, layin' still
Permanent forever chill in heavens field
Spreadin' doin' deals, more electric than eels
Respectin' the reals, countin' what'choo build
Prepare was heal journey, with hard times
Examine it, playa's have money at random
Sittin' pretty, sayin' come and get me

Standin' in front of the gates of hell
Smackin' niggas, pullin' out the gat on niggas
Sold crack, plus I'm a rappin' nigga
I got rhymes for days, I got gats that blaze
Ready for motherfucking war
See this is whatcha'll wanted, you know it got to be me (Screw B)
Everybody talkin' 'bout they whips with the TV
I need some of this motherfucking rap money

But some playa hater tryed to end a party there
Niggas didn't care they burned it, put it in the air
I took it personal readied up for warfare

Ways to move I pay dues; I'm talking to all of you
Warfare is when you go
For the cash ''cause I reach for them... reach for them
Street life is all I know
Full bellies and cellis, close enemies to siece memories
Warfare is when you go

Yo..It's Hostyle ¿que pasa?
No masa; tu eres no problema
¿Cliente hah?
Drama with dada is dangerous
Bang with anguish; Flame with a touch
Deranged ain't enough
Gunpowder laying on my cuff
Call my bluff   
The streets don't stop; it's like a marry-go-round
The beats don't stop; multiply various rounds
Of hard knock, bar locked gates
These are the brakes
Family ties without a trace
Old G's ? With sheets of casper toke
Premeditated plans later dated
Haters waited with iron plated heat
Designed, made miraculously dated in deep memory
So...keep countin' dollars
Keep mine moving scholars of rap
With a lot of gats; holla' back!

[Chorus]

You'll win by all means
Struggle for the cream
Hustle by ways of being
Don't let prophecy end
Don't let the Po-Po knock me again
Don't let the 'nine' cock freely in sin
Missiles through your flesh tissue... military issue
Guess you understand the risk you take
Dissed you on your forehead snake
More dead weight
Pitch fork love; It's for coke thugs
Bitches huffin' & puffin'; huffin' & puffin' about nothin'
Watch you say I hold against you in the court of law
Gun firing; wall to wall
? closed from burn holes
Fires turned on my stone... Fuck That!
'Cause I gotta eat; pockets so swolled
From reasons of livin'
The breath I'm givin'
All the checks I'm scribblin'; it's real baby!

[Chorus]",Street Life,2001
Screwed Up Click,"[Z-Ro]

It's like tears doesn't matter to you, it's like you laughed at my pain

Put me in a position to pick up a pistol, and I'll blast in the game
I'm going crazy, being murdered by the hands of cancer

Auntie asked if I wanted to die, but couldn't understand my answer

See it's fucked up when you loving, they don't love you in return

Fuck around and wait till you get on your feet, and slug you till it burn

Niggas is flies yeah they over rise, but I hide in the dark

Cause where the fuck was these niggas at, when I resided in parks

Bitch I slept on the bench, ten feet away from the bullet proof fence

But at least, I ain't have to pay no rent

I'm thinking of espree, damn near positive that you regret me

But I pray to God, you'll never forget me, remember me

I represented for the both of us, how could you love me

And not trust me, somewhere hated now there's no more us plus

Sammy Lee it was a tragedy, your boo was found dead

Here's my shoulder for you my nigga, rest your head



[Chorus - 2x]

This is where they all fall down

Putting burners to they brain, till it bang

There's no way for the real, to maintain

This is where they all fall down

Pay your dues, cause you owe

When it's your time, God'll give you the go



[Den Den]

I sit back and put my thoughts, on paper and rhymes

Tripping on the situations, that I'm facing in life

All this shifeness around me, but I still prevail

Get caught some shit we done together, and I'm making your bail

Cut your tail, while you fall down homie

Plus I'm in the kitchen cooking, so your family won't come hold me

Fuck that phony shit, that these fake niggas on

I get that pony bitch, then I get that hustle on

Staying strong like ammonia, as I bleed the block

Leaving that bitch swollen up, like I beat the cops

Going rock for rock, breaking down every zone

95 hundred woofing, where these niggas be strong

Staying alone to my own, with my baby and wife

Plus I'm keeping the bread a nine, cause I'm guarding my life

Ain't no slipping in my game, doing a dance to make it rain

Put a pistol to your head, and ease your pain



[Chorus - 2x]



[Z-Ro]

I feel like I invented pain, might go any minute mayn, starting a bit of

robbery

Homicide and lean on they destiny, in an attempt to get the pain

Constant strain, here we go again another day in the life

If I'm blessed, can I just get one successful day in my life

My life is the prime example, of a good nigga gon wrong

And I trust no one plus I'm not friendly, so leave me alone

See I don't need a click of yes men, when I walk the block

My retaliation is only, when I chalk the block

I stay in a sweet leaf, each time I meditate on how to live

Nothing but negative everywhere I turn, ain't no more positive

Nothing but drama, cause drama makes the world go round

But pretty soon, it'll make the world go down

Just get a weapon of situation, if you starving then you hungry right now

I can't wait a whole pay period, I need money right now

So when I bleed the block I'm not gon bleed a lot, just enough to keep

The bills paid, and enough to keep some fiddles in a pot

[Z-Ro]
I thought I had a lot of partnas, but I've only got some
Since I can't depend on my niggaz, I put my faith up in my shotgun
Rolling around in my '78, reminiscing on the past
16 years old trying to get into Boomerang, smelling all our lil cash
Now it's like we never knew eachother, motherfuckers act strange
It's like they got intentions, on putting bullets up in my brain
Why they can't look me in my eyes no mo'
Even though I miss my T. Jones, at least mama ain't gotta to cry no mo'
I done seen my nigga get rich, leave the hood, make a lot of rich friends
But try to come back to the po' partnas, when all the richness end
Tell him to come watch me perform, but they don't go, and if I'm
Stranded and I need a ride, they say they coming but they don't show
Picture me walking down the feeter, everybody masking me up
Oh good it's that nigga from the hood, chunking a deuce passing me up
That's alright though, I gotta make a top flight hoe, smoking and thinking
When I get I want no nobody, but a Benjamin Franklin cause uh

[Hook - 2x]
Friends just ain't friends no more
Ain't no love, cause money is all we adore
Friends just ain't friends no more
I don't need you motherfuckers round me

[Cl'Che]
Most of these hoes say they your friend, but they really ain't down
Cause when you broke and got no ends, them same hoes don't come round
The main hoes that talk down, most friends turn to foes
That's just the way it go down, that's why I stay blowing pounds
Cause Mary Jane don't change she stay the same, help maintain
And ease the pain, stay free from the bullshit people bring
Cause the world is full of evil mayn
That's why I stay one deep, fuck these niggaz and these hoes
I be solo on my creep, no one in the passenger seat

[Den Den]
First he's riding high, now he busting Mack 10's
Watch you go from homie to foe, then try to come back again
There ain't no returning with the fuck shit, that's why I murder with one click
These fake ass G's I'm done with, selling my shit for one sill
But claiming you down to the ground bitch, bitch you ain't down with
Just another fake friend, trying to chop the Benz
Helping to plead my ends, looking for a win
Lying with a grin, trying to sneak back in

[Hook - 2x]
[Z-Ro]
Remember back in '97, we was living it up
If they had it and we wanted it, they was giving it up
Through it wrong together, I think we wrote our first song together
Matter of fact, we smoked our first zone together
Look at you now oh you a rich nigga, thinking that you running thangs
But you ain't running a damn thang but your mouth, cause you's a bitch nigga
Going against the grain, cause you done made a lil change
But I can't flip the script want to get rich, I gotta remain the same
I had visions of us balling together, pulling up at the Past at New Orleans
Together, everyday all day shot calling together, but now I'm only rolling solo
Don't get it twisted I still got love for my niggaz, but I don't fuck with em no mo'
Cause everybody want me to do, what they want me to do
And they want me to do it, but I'd rather stay full of embalming fluid
But you know what you can do for me, give me a whole lot of leave me alone
Cause the only partna I got left, got 17 partnas of his own and uh

Take life like this, fuck around and I take my own life like this
Or click me a bitch nigga, in the windpipe like this
That's right bitch, I'm a ignant son of a bitch
And I do click quick, it might be halves and zones

I'ma use that, even though a nigga mind gone
It ain't lost, cause I know where it's at
Just on another level than boys, around here
For the paper stack, cause I'ma go where it's at

It's still Guerilla Maab, and ain't a damn thang changed
I just peeped the game, and these niggaz be shife
Over the years, I seen a lot of niggaz turn fake
Riding thick on the cool, and then I have to erase
You see me and the Maab, done learned without a thang
Man most of these niggaz, be around for the fame
It ain't no more love, therefor if you ain't kin
And if you get up in mine, you gon meet your end
I'm one of a kind, I think you better check yourself
And it don't mean a damn thang, if I shake your hand
If I ain't too enthused, and I got on a mean mask
You better stay on note, cause I'll beat your ass
It's Guerilla Maab this, and Guerilla Maab that
I think you better get back, and shut the fuck up
For you straight step off, and get fucked up

And I ain't got none left, didn't nobody wanna care

Screwed Up Click,"What's up baby, Mexican D hollering this
Just getting back with you, told you we was gone chill
Come through, blow something, smoke something
You know how we do it, keeping it real on this side
Letting y'all broads know, we too real

What's happening I see you capping trying to play that role like
You don't know me
Come into my world of diamonds and pearls cause you look a
Little bit lonely
I decided I wan to to cut, couldn't help but notice the shape of
Your butt
And the way you stretch just drive a player nuts, man what's up
Could I just talk to you for a second I don't want to take up
All your time
But see your 36, 24, 36, done blew my mind
I can't take it the way shake it to make me have to push up on
You
To see if we have anything in common, you see I like to smoke
Marijuana
Would you be interested in smoking a square, running my fingers
Through your hair
Go to the Residence Inn with a 3's and 10's coming up out of
Underwear 
See I'ma be chilling, I won't be hard, got a wife at home so
Don't leave no scars
On my back, cause Z-Ro penetrates so if you gone see stars
I'ma get the roof up out killing out when I have
Do a little wine and take a little bath
Sip a little wine to ease my mind then it's back to knocking you
Down
All you got to do is put me in the penn
Got to bet it won't sink, I'm around the way
Make you want to tell somebody cause I'm a square or something 
Keep it on the low and we could do this today

[Chorus]
Let's chill, so I could knock you down
Cause all that I want to do, is fornicate with you
Let's chill, and we can bump and grind
I want to get into you, that's all I want to do

OK, seen you peeping a storm, so I took the opportunity to jump
In my ride
And we could bump heads again and see we could go inside
With our minds, you got something that I cut for
The bald head and the thug in you, that makes me want to lust
You
You balling with your boys, while I'm funk deep with my girls

Diamonds glistening to the tip of my chrome just missing the
Curb
Hey love, what I got to give is probably more than you could
Receive
But we can compromise and bump many times my body's at ease
Did I shock you when I approached when I said let's chill
Or did I shock you when I didn't knock you for coming straight
Up and real
Show me a good time, make me feel like I'm in paradise
Me and you, one on one I ain't trying to claim to be your wife 
So let's just chill, and take time for two of the same minds
To make twice the hustle and grind and fornications that's on
Your mind
Won't you meet me at my place, I say around 10 and don't be late
Cause I want you to feel me when I say classified ladies want to
Chill baby

[Chorus]

I can feel your earth, wind and fire so retire to my rap sure
If you grin it means I win and then your skins have been
Captured 
If you one to five times and knocking five times of running away
Together
Bumping and grinding, smoking and leaning steady reclining up on
The lever
Get aqua tinted with each other as we feel the Mo City
These cats ain't having it when they do they thang and no never
Show pity
But if you scared, I mean you not alone
It might be the ghetto but I call it home
90 percent of the killers are cool with me
So it's cool to sit back and blow a bag with me
So if I said I wanted to be your better half, you know that I
Was lying
No disrespect but I want some sex, can a player get up in
Between the thighs
But if you say I move too fast, I'ma slow my role and romance
We can go to the Papa Do's and all of those fancy places and
Then slow dance
Under the candle light, sipping Dom Perignon
The stereo bumping our slow jam song
From 2 to 6 we ball in the mix and chains sex places getting it
On
Cause I'm a pimp baby, not a simp and I want to be the trick in
Your life
It's plain and clear that a g came here to put this dick in your
Life

When I pull my gun, then I'ma use my gun
And I ain't tripping, I'll put you in a murder scene
But I try to stay humble, and hold what I got
Never let a nigga know what I got, keep my bidness to my own
So don't bring none of that there, to my home
I love my people, and that's a fact
But I want to know, where's the fucking love at
I don't want to put a motherfucker, in the grave
But I will to keep on, keeping on busting back

[Chorus: x2]
Wake up before you get caught up
Don't keep on selling your soul, until your life bought up
And my eyes on the prize, and never fall off the straight and I roll
When you slip, hollow tips are sharper than an arrow

I decided August 31, 1999
There's no more time for fake partnas, there's only time for my grind
All of my friendships came about, because of the verses I say
That nigga Z-Ro got partnas, but what about Joseph McVey
Everytime I'm on the microphone, nigga want to tag along
Want to see me, when I do my song
Or when a nigga be smoking the marijuana, and the dope all gone
A nigga right back, all alone
I had to regulate, or be surrounded by fakes
At all times looking over my shoulder, but I came out of that as I got older
Cause I realized, if it's written scriptures don't lie
That's why I'm thugging cause life is a bitch, and then a nigga die
I rap about the struggle, cause balling is foreign to me
Z-Ro be t-shirt and Dickies, ain't no Ralph Lauren you see
Cause every dolla that I make, is a dolla well earned
And I'm putting it back in the game, to sco' some crack
And a strap, to dip sherms
Hopefully I can make it, to see the sun rise
Fiending for them back in the days, of hide and seek
And throwing mud pies

[Chorus: x2]

Bout to swang by that sun, is wait for me be right back
I'ma roll a optimoe fat as a wiener, and light that
Cause it seems I can't confine without, clutching a sack
Puffing the sho' dipping the black, or raping the track
And I be tripping and sipping, and pimping this rap
I'm writing my rhymes, through my fetty's no slack
I'm ready to the sell the, the better my chedda
Tell her to the fella, I doubts the shredder
A better competitor, I dwell I'ma get her
Better get fella, I sell-a my yella
To hella thoed nigga, that wreck accapella
The fella that tell it, nobody he got em
He got 'em and shot em, and don't talk about em
Plotted and followed, to get where I started
Out of my product, the plot of my problem
Got off my bottom, to talk to my father
My ceiling is ending, my ending is finished
These women keep grinning, to swim in my linen
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
What's up what's up, had lean in my cup
Been asleep ten years, and I just woke up
The alarm on slow, all my ten minutes up
Gotta make my bed, gotta watch my butt
Gotta clean my room, gotta iron my stuff
Gotta wash my car, gotta shine my buck
Gotta change my oil, cause the road is tough
Keep my eyes on the road, and don't slow up

Why, do we live this way
So many murders, where the children play
And it's about, to make me lose my mind
We're running out of time, too many of my people dying

[Z-Ro]
Day by day it's more impossible, to hold on
I'm going head up with the shadow of death, and getting stole on
Will I survive, is God gonna come and save me
I started out as a Christian, now look at how this world made me
I'm crazy, and I can't make it no better
Cause I can't stand none of my friends, my only love is for the cheddar
I remember, sipping on Tangaray and getting high
Down with eachother, long as we was barely getting by
We grown men, and all living in sin
Shooting a kite to my people, cause he in prison again
Letting him know that the streets ain't changed, still wicked
Plus I been burying so many motherfuckers, we bound to kick it
Up close and personal, cause niggaz be pushing my button
I handle my bidness, and exit they homes gangsta strutting
One deep, nobody's got my back
Motherfuckers just be hanging around me, because I rap
Trying to stab me in my back, and if they could they would
That's why I pack my twin bitches, cause I don't even feel safe in the hood
At least on lock, you know what the danger is and what's not
Free world you'll be evicted, when a coward bust shots
That's the life cycle, kick it with real niggaz
And never let the shife by you, because the devil is they idol
Man they tied up my nigga, and sawed off his head
The cold part about it, they ain't even take no bread

[Hook]
[Z-Ro]
My nigga Grady took seven shots, and one bullet hit him twice
Although he's blessed, my nigga just can't leave the thug life
You know it's fucked up, both of us was in class with honors
But soon would drop out, addicted to cash and marijuana
And the fast life, we bled the whole hood last night
Hard headed dumb niggaz, just trying to get they cash right
Hustling, hoping we can get a million
But like a chameleon, nigga the game done changed
Wish it would rain sometime, to help a nigga wash away the pain sometime
I shed ghetto tears daily baby, I can't hide the fact
Feeling like everybody's out to get me, so I don't hide my strap
I ride like that, with one up in the chamber
On my block if you ain't got a glock, you's in danger
Continuously head busting for nothing, my friends and my enemies
Nothing but recollection, as I remember the memories
If I could be like Jesus, I'd spread the love
But I can recognize the demons, so I spread the slugs
These motherfuckers say they love me, but I'm peeping they lies
Feel like jealousy and envy, when I look deep in they eyes
That's a friend for you, laced up with your girl and then try to
Spend your ends for you, and when it's drama they won't send for you
That's the reason Joseph, is one deep until he die
I ain't gotta wonder why, my people want to see me fly, fuck em

I only roll in the fattest whips, got mega chips
Hanging out with some of the baddest bitches, with mega hips
Sexy lips with the Hazel eyes, got to have plenty thighs
Rolling Acura's with Slip-N-Slide
All my niggas ride,
With the heaters on the front seat, only one deep
On the semi with a bad freak, always on the creep
Chickens ride mother plucking but that ain't nothing
And she down for the sucking fucking hit it on the button
And it's something like some more clucking from my bucking
The KFC when it comes to busting
We stay on crushing
But they got to holla for that dollar
So when I holla out the window of my friends Impala
You know I got her
When she go to looking at her friends
And turn around and started giving me that half a grin
It's foggy and my homie sipping on some yen
Run some came and my name then I know I'm in
Oh that's your cousin
Even better when I'm drinking yen
On the average player scale she about a 10
And her cousin too cause she got some beautiful skin
We picked em up, knock em up
Kicked em out and did it all again

My little sister even known for spitting that pimp shit
My little brother he the brain we call him gifted
Some women hate me so they put me on they shit list
Because I'm known for breaking them off with a stiff dick
And breaking out before they even know I had a trip
Goddamn baby you got some beautiful lips
Sometimes I'm wondering if a nigga picked a fit
I fuck them to the point that they screaming that they got to piss
A freaky nigga but you can keep a chain and whip
And every time I bust I'm 'bout to sink your battleship
I hit and run, sorry hun, but I got to dip
I told your sister that I'd hit her right around six
And if I'm late then you know that bitch gonna want to trip

Scribe,"Check it out, 1, 2, hey yo, hey yo
I came a long way since back in the day
From a teenager trying to make a rap in this way
Ever since I was a kid I had something to say
Rocking mics was a dream I didn't care about pay
I sacrificed late nights and going out with my friends
Just to stay home alone with my pad and my pen
Had my eyes on my prize, my mind on my goal
As I carved these rhymes out with my hear and my soul
I didn't have a CD; all I had was a tape
On the dole through my flow was my only escape
From a world where they didn't want to see my prevail
Didn't want to see me take it all
They'd rather see me fail

Its like ...
I was down and out
Struggling
Wondered how I'm gonna make it through
I got a dream (I got a dream)
Holding old (I'm gonna hold on)
I can't let go 'cause I gotta make it come true

Hey yo
I got a dream to make it big in New York
Give up the drugs and alcohol
I didn't want to distort
My vision to be living life to the full
And I wouldn't of made it if it wasn't for you
You picked me up every time that I fell
When I was going through hell you told me that I would prevail
You said I had exactly what it took to be great
That I was young and in the future would a man I would make
Its like you saw something in me I couldn't see
You said I would succeed and be anything I wanted to be
I'm 23 and I just want to be me
want to be free
want to be everything I can be
But I don't have many choices
Can't afford to be wrong
All I do is try to stay true to the words of my song
Just don't hesitate and wait too long
'cause like a dream when you wake up its gone ... its gone

I was down and out
Struggling
Wondered how I'm gonna make it through (I had no money in my pockets)
I got a dream (all I had was a pad and a pen)
Holding old (that's all I ever needed)
I can't let go 'cause I gotta make it come true

Hey yo
It was a sunny day and we were feeling high
Jamming the song underneath the baby blue sky
Thinking 'bout in the time when we were so poor
'Member the kids used to laugh at the clothes we wore
We always knew one day that things were gonna change
And from that day I was never gonna be the same
I went to sleep that night; I dreamt I touched the sky
And ever since I've been trying to keep my dream alive
So when you see this Scribe, dropping the Ill'ed rhyme
To find how I'm living mine in this day and time
I'm working 9 to 5; I'm slaving over beats
Its hard work living the dream I hardly ever sleep
I'm in the rhythm deep, Yo just trying to do my thing
Its funny when you shine and people hate to see the gleam
No matter what they say keep on doing what you do
And don't give up 'cause only you can make that dream come true

Its like...
I was down and out (I was way out)
Struggling
Wondered how I'm gonna make it through
I got a dream
Holding old
I can't let go 'cause I gotta make it come true

I was down and out ...
Wonder how ...
I got a dream ...

Shows cost a hundred, like I'm triple platinum
Triple platinum, Triple platinum, Triple platinum
Me and HOV back and forth, like I'm triple platinum
Triple platinum, I'm out in Cannes, Club Gotha

Double R's on the gates, like I'm triple platinum
Couple pawns in the lake the couch is in the plastic
Had a phone call with Drake so we could fix the madness
Time for the real niggas just to really cash in
Murals of Machiavelli, wealthy my mind states
Everyday the net worth racing the crime rate
Sweat drippin' from my fitted giving niggas chills
Only ones who standing still, the ones who on the pills
Summer school and scholarships we said was sucka shit
Straight out of high school they had us touching bricks
In the trap with the white was such a sacrifice
Sentences for selling dope, just pray your casket nice
But I got a lawyer like I'm triple platinum
His retainer was the change up in the kitchen cabinet
Everybody mad at ya when you're living fabulous
Self made, mean you never out here kissing asses
Still hand-to-hand like they chicken patties
Mad at the world, but you trigger happy
Double R's on the gates, it's like I'm triple platinum

Four hundred acres like I'm triple platinum

Triple platinum without an album sale
Three million grams, I left a powder trail
All gold Rollie, face like a diamond feel
Fire on me nigga, this is not a fire drill
Real trap nigga, live like I'm triple platinum
Marble the floors and put gold on my cabinets
My voodoo lady still keep her couch in the plastic
Triple platinum, they hatin', niggas alter they captions
Ten years and it's time for revenge
Paintings on my wall a gift to my kids
Versace drawers like I'm triple platinum
Wore 'em once and disposed 'em after
Bitches fuck me like I'm triple platinum
Like Prince in that purple jacket
Purple rain, pop a Perc' and half a Xanax
Trap star, livin' like I'm triple platinum
These are the jewels of many gods, the secret blessings
Scripture's written on platinum plaques, decode the message
Voice of a legend, Grammy nominated
Ramadan once a year, my sacrificial payment
Stone thrown at my Jesus piece, help me Lord
But tempt me, kill my Judas with a platinum sword
A king, but I'm punished with a crown of thorns
Triple platinum nails force these open arms
God's child, my soul triple platinum
When I speak, it's with the richest accent
I die for the ones that I love
All the pain, I just fill it with void

I seen it from afar, blessings from the Lord
When a nigga that's so sharp, have his conscious loss
Before you buy a bottle, let's enjoy a glass
May it flow just like a faucet every time you ask
Got the trunk like I was Luke and the Two Live Crews
Minus one, burger moves, let the lions loose
Retaining ownership is all I want in this
Maybe two Phantoms, a bad one that got a bone to pick
Somebody tried to kill me, still I'm optimistic
Told the detectives ""Fuck 'em"" and I bought a rocket missile
Bathing Ape draped on my label-mates
You not a boss until everybody at your table ate
100 bands on me, really that's my sneaker money
'Cause when they land, they be whiter than the Easter bunny
Cuban links on me like I'm triple platinum
The triple beam still up in my kitchen cabinet

I closed my eyes and we were there in John Frost Square

I threw away my one true love
I watched us standing at the station

I told you then I didn't need you, girl

And say your name, and ask me why
And so in time I tried to find you
I sent a message care of Sarah, and you were there and said:
""I was time you put behind you""

The new release, time to make cream, time to take a piece

And at the same time, time to rebuild, time is rilla
I swear I bring the heat, the tracks to Val Kilmer
You know that time waits for no man, in time you'll see
That you're wasting all you time while you're watching TV

You catch a L in the see like Christopher Reeves

Do you all believe that these cats threw dirt on my name?
Give 'em time, they couldn't win if I gave 'em point game
At times I used to swerve, now I'm learning my lane
Trapped in time, what a shame with nobody to blame

But I admit there are a few things I'm afraid have impressed me less.

So I'm writing to apologize for all the horrors committed in my name, 
Although that was never what I intended, 
I feel I should take my share of the blame.
All the good I tried to do was corrupted
When organised religion got into full swing, 
What I thought were quite clear messages were taken to unusual extremes.
My teachings taken out of context to meet the agendas of others, 
Interpretations taken to many different ways and hidden meanings discovered

Religion became a tool, for the weak to control the strong
With all these new morals and ethics, survival of the fittest was gone
No longer could the biggest man simply take whatever he needed
'Cause damnation was the price if certain rules were not heeded
Some of the deeds committed in my name
Just made me wonder were I went wrong.
Back at the start when I created this, the foundation seemed so strong.
See all the elements were already here, long before I began, 
I just kind of put it all together
I didn't really think out a long-term plan.

I made the sun an appropriate distance and laid the stars across the sky
So you could navigate the globe or simply watch the sun rise
I covered the earth with plants and fruits, 
Some for sustenance and some for beauty
I made the sun shine and the clouds rain
So their maintenance wasn't your duty
I tried to give each creature it's own attributes
Without making them enveloped
I gave you all you all your own space to
Grow and in your own way space to develop

I didn't know such development would cause rifts and jealousy
Cause you to war against each other and leave marks on this planet indelibly
You see, I wasn't really the creater, I was just the curator of nature
I want to get something straight with homosexuals right now, I don't hate ya
I was a simple being that happened to be the first to wield such powers
I just laid the ground, it was You that built the towers

It was You that invented bombs, and the fear that comes with them
And it was You that invented money, and the corrupt economic systems
You invented terms like just-war and terms like friendly fire
And it was You that didn't know
When to stop digging deeper, when to stop building higher
It was You that exhausted the resources I carefully laid out on this earth,
And it was You that even saw these
Problems coming but accredited them little worth
It was You that used my teachings for your own personal gain
And it was You that committed such tragedies, 
Even though they were in my name

So I apologize for any mistakes I made, and when my words misconstrued
But this apology's to mother nature, cause I created you",Letter from God to Man,2008

Scrubs,"Uncomfortable thoughts I've been avoiding 
I just turn my shoulder; let em bounce right off my shoulder blade 
Like the end of the world we just don't think about it

Yeah I know where this leads 
It leads to heartbreak every time 
I'll learn what a broken heart feels like 
Well I wish I could do something 
But every time means every time 
When the bomb finally drops will I survive? 
Will I make it to next year; will I make it past that night 
I'll do whatever it takes; anything I swear 

Cross my heart and hope to die 
And die I think I might 
I might be happier in hell 
'Cause hell would keep my mind off you 
I don't want to live without you 
And I don't want to die without you

Fucked up on my knuckles
Tryin' to sell some dirt weed
Taxin' off a ten speed

For sure nigga I kept frontin'

I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days, gettin' paper any way

And I kept lickin' on that clit
Till she gave me that shit
I've been fucked up for so long
Swear to God I gotta get it
I put my back into it
Servin' bags to them students
Tell 'em I got that fire
On that porch right there by the Buick
I'm just tryin' to get my mind
Go worry nigga 'bout yours
Rollin' up that swisher
Pourin' up a four
Servin' in them hallways
The courtrooms all day
Hoods kicked the door down
Now we in the Coney

Slow days, fast days, gettin' paper any way

It's the same old shit
Everybody in the manor is locked up, boxed up
It's killin' me
Niggas wanna get rid of me
Cause I lyrically bust on the riddim
Fill the room with humidity
Stick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm bangin' out
Doubling my money gettin' my hustle in Canning Town
Listen up Danny Brown
I been doing this thing
Skipped in, then I come and lyrically assist 'em (WOO!)
I had my dubs on the step
I never stopped cause I sit in the booth
Flipping the truth, while you're running and chatting
Thinking you're realer than Scru

Als ich Mädchen noch scheiße fand
Ich fuhr sie einfach mit dem Dreirad an,

And was playing soft

But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Caught the sunday smell

And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song

I hope I didn't wake you too soon
Because my mind is growing tired
Too much thinking what I should do
I picture you out there
It must be beautiful this time of year
All those East Coast leaves
Floating round like embers from burning trees
Well the weather out here is just the same
But the garden that you planted remains.

Now it's only work
Each day bleeding into the next
Barely scraping by I tire myself out just so I can rest
But rest it rarely comes
And when it does I cannot go home
Because it's much too quiet
Seems that I'm not suited to being in love
And everyone around me's changed
But the garden that you planted remains.

I think about you
Maybe more than I should
But the smog is getting old
The drugs I'm taking aren't so good
So will you talk to me
Even though you've had a late night
Because I need a little help
Baby, tell me I'll be alright
Cause everything around me's changed

And I had someone warm to hold
To watch the clouds move through the skies

And I made a resolution, 
I said ""never going to sing another sad song again.""

I decided I'd admit it, 
I'm not an intellectual, 
Though the words never come easy unless I'm singing them, 
And the hills that I was born in will never leave me 
No matter how hard I try.

And then my brother was murdered 
While my father was in prison, 
And the girl that I sometimes loved up and moved away, 
And my body filled up with blackness, 
And the darkness it wanted to drown me, 
And I heard my father's footsteps catching up to me, 
And he took me by the shoulders 
And he said ""son, my hands are strong, 
But I hope you have the strength to shake us free, 
Shake us free boy, shake us free my son, you better shake us free.""

And now I'm lying in the van,
Chicago in the springtime,
And the rain outside was falling sounds just like popcorn,
But before I open my eyes I think I make this resolution, 
""no I'm never gonna sing another sad song for as long as I live""

And the light coming through the windows is making everything glow
And he took me by the shoulders 
And he said ""son my hands are strong, 
But I hope you have the strength to shake us free,

There in the constellations, a big dipper far below
We walked through the blackness, felt the endless space around
And you bent down on your knee and picked an apple from the ground

Out past the forest where the Saint Lawrence lies
We heard the cargo ships go pushing through the ice
You turned when we heard them, your breath hung in the air
And you said, ""Just 'cause we can't see them doesn't mean that they're not there
But I'm not afraid of what I can't see
Don't need a reason, don't need to believe""

We climbed up a latter that leaned against the hay

I hope you'll find the sea

Flew away from me

In a poor country

On your way down
Just someone new
To throw your arms around

Time to forget
Your mistakes and regrets

Sometimes I swore
You're in my house
Was a trap too

And I had black nights
When my hope had died
You, you're a friendly knife

So I let the werewolf out
I let the [Incomprehensible] have their way
I've looked down on you
From my mountain, I slept by your feet

And when you come out
With your strong winter moon to drown in sound

Work my way through the sea

Is quite impossible and if

Not them fake ass shoot em up type
But the type that shoot you ass when the time's right
So would you tell me what's your mack like
What's your stack like
Slanging crack on a track making stacks to the day light

She does her best to blow the cobwebs away
And if it's still light, maybe she'll skip breakfast
Hope that someone can throw a little stardust her way, yeah

Crossing the room the day after, night before nightmare
Pink blue eyes drink in the aftermath
The world's her oyster anything she chooses
This little girl doesn't know where her shoes is, yeah

Sixteen sweet Chablis sham kisses
Seventeen nothing's whispered in her ear
Eighteen attempts on her best pair of knickers
1999 was a hell of a year

She likes to rise early in the morning
She does her best to blow the cobwebs away
And if it's still light, maybe she'll skip breakfast
Hope that someone can throw a little stardust her way, yeah

That must have been a night to remember
Shame she forgot
",1999,1997
Seahorses,"How would you feel if I was to kneel right down
At your feet? Right now
Is the way it's going to be from now until forever
Let's have less of getting clever with me

Who would you blame for blowing the flame right out
Is it me? There is no doubt
I can do what I want to do from now until forever
Let's have less of getting clever with me

You're wasting your time and my time as well
L-l-living a lie, I guess that time will tell
You're making excuses for the things you've never done
Walking in circles, blinded by the sun
Blinded by the sun

Who would you blame for blowing the flame right out
Is it me? There is no doubt
I can do what I want to do from now until forever
Let's have less of getting clever with me

You're wasting your time and my time as well
L-l-living a lie I guess that time will tell
You're making excuses for the things you've never done
You're walking in circles, blinded by the sun
Blinded by the sun

I don't mean to sound unkind to you
You'll just have to go and find something else to do
And don't ask me what went wrong
The list goes on and on and on and on
The list goes on and on and on and on
The list goes on and on

Seahorses,"I asked the boy in the picture
What could he see?
He said, it's been twenty long years
But you, you still look like me

If you find somebody that you need
Go ahead and tell her, show her what you mean
And soon you'll find that love is blind and free

If you see Sally or Smokey, say hello from me
Tell them I hope they're happy
Working the beach, just out of reach but free

I asked the boy in the picture
How's your brother been?
He said he's doing just fine, now
But he's still a little too thin

If you find somebody that you need
Go ahead and tell her, show her what you mean
And soon you'll find that love is blind and free

If you see Sally or Smokey, say hello from me
Tell them I hope they're happy
Working the beach, just out of reach but free

And then the boy in the picture
He asked me
Got any tips where do I go wrong
And who am I gonna to be?

Seahorses,"Happiness is eggshaped
And love's a circle with no end
It's only four o'clock in the morning
And you're still driving me 'round the bend

I'll tell you something, I'll tell you, it's true
I've got a letter to send to you

It's twenty feet tall and it's sprayed on a wall
I'm gonna post from a fifth floor window
Yeah, yeah, crash it right down on your car
I don't know maybe then that'll teach you
Not to kiss the sky too hard

I'll tell you something, I'll tell you true
I've got a letter to send to you
You're too busy dreaming so what am I gonna do?

I got to get you right off from my back
'Cause you're no fun, girl
My whole world's turning black
'Cause you're no fun, girl

I know it's two sides to every story
You can keep your kiss of death
'Cause I choose glory, yeah

Happiness is eggshaped
And love's a circle with no end
It's only four o'clock in the morning

Seahorses,"I know the wind and the rain and the lightning
And the thunder's filled my brain
Have I changed ? I'm asking you

All I know is the sun and it's shining
Way above my cloud so high it can't be found
We all look around

For the times we left behind
Oh well never mind, I'll take you there tomorrow
And I'm sorry if I seem to always vent my spleen
It's not the path I choose to follow
So hello

And I hope you're still my friend
I think I'm on the mend
And you know I don't mean to offend
I wish we all could fly

All I know is the sun and it's shining
Way above my cloud
So high it can't be found",Hello,1997
Seahorses,"Did you think that you had it all worked out,
But then they changed their minds?
You're left with the feeling that you've been left out,
Without a thought for who you left behind

Well there's a tried and tested potion that I know,
Go out and get loaded go and give it a go,
I want you to know, yeah I want you to know

Were all of your cards marked in advance,
As they threw them on the table?
There's no such thing as a second chance,
Look at Auntie George and Uncle Mabel

Well there's a tried and tested potion that they know,
Sat down with arms folded they don't wanna know

Did you think that you had it all worked out,
But then they changed their minds?
You're left with the feeling that you've been left out,
Without a thought for who you left behind

Well there's a tried and tested notion you should know,
Now you're feeling loaded you've got nowhere to go
I want you to know...
Yeah I want you to know...",I Want You to Know,1997
Seahorses,"We lived in a dogfish egg case  You could barely call it home  Sorry little lot no roof on top  But the fish left us alone  Try a little more said the girl next door  It's time to roam    Mad Lizzy Crumbs blind cobblers thumbs  Were a sight to behold  She was a rum old slapper and we always   tried to get her pants off when she phoned  Left her cap by the sink it's not what you think  Oh take me home    Now we know where we're going baby  We can lay back and enjoy the ride  Take in the sights and drown in our senses  Love is the law so take me deep inside    Strap-on Sally chased us down the alley  We feared for our behinds  Oasis was a shop with shoes so hot  They were sure to blow your mind  Running so fast I can taste the past  Oh take me home    Now we know where we're going baby  We can lay back and enjoy the ride  Take in the sights and drown in our senses  Love is the law so take me deep inside    These waters run deep it's clear my little one  Blue velvet star sky not a sound  The light in your eyes, the smile on your ruby lips  Tells me my lost soul is found    Now we know where we're going baby  We can lay back and enjoy the ride  Take in the sights and drown in our senses  Love is the law so take me deep inside",Love Is the Law,1997
