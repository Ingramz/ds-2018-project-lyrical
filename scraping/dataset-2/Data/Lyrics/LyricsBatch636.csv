Lush,"( desire lines ep )

You can be someone but you can't be me
And I know that somehow I will never be free
Years ago in the darklands I was dressed like a toy
Now this doll has her own hands and she wishes you felt joy
When there might be another it makes you shiver in the cold
That is why I don't bother involving you in my world
Smashing glasses and breaking bases you lied to me
Over and over you never listened to me
There was too much affection you treated me as if I were clay
Home became like a prison in my mind I kept running away
",Girl's World,1994
Lush,"You are the one
In your concrete arms I adore you
Dirty and dear
Block out the sun
In your twists and turns I invade
You show me no fear

We blow around like tiny leaves in a big storm
Finding there's nothing left to breathe or to keep warm 
You ebb and flow and your rhythm beats my head
Leave me alone while you swallow up your dead

You are the one
You cradle me and kill
Caressing my face

Leave me undone
You suffocate and have me
This is the place

Every door conceals a dream and a nightmare
Nothing is ever really pure in the stale air

And when it's dark everything becomes more clear
Lie in the park when I want to have you near

You are the one
In your concrete arms I adore you
Dusty and dear
Block out the sun
In your twists and turns I invade
You show me no fear

Left it unsung
I shall leave but I'll return
Poison my lungs, my blood is full of lead
Things unsaid
My love for you still burns",Lovelife [Suga Bullit Remix],1994
Lush,"Just hold my hand and stroke my hair
And ask them not to stand
And stare my mind is scattered everywhere
And all around I see despair my heart was broken long ago
I've come so far and sunk so low the truth's
A man without a soul I find him everywhere I go

All is fair in love they say liars liars I found only misery
Love is cruel I can close my eyes and see something better
Fairy tales and fantasy let me sleep let me dream
Just hold my hand and stroke my hair
And tell me everything's OK
I'm waiting for my millionaire just lie to me
And say he's there

They say the truth is beautiful
Liars liars what do they know of the truth anyway
I can close my eyes and see something better fairy tales
And fantasy that's the world for me",White Wood,1994
Lush,"Drinking
Sitting in a corner smiling to the others
Arriving here we are again.
Talking
Telling all out stories laughing at the thins
That we've all been though over all the years
And as the hours pass 'til midnight
We'll sing together in the moonlight
And looking back to when we first met
We seemed so different so many years passed so much time
And we're still here whatever times may come don't ever change
Oh we'll be laughing in the moonlight singing songs 'til midnight bunny,
Kate, & Emma, Maxine and Melissa laughing in the moonlight.",Cat's Chorus,1994
Lush,"So, you want to be alone
Run and hide inside your home, home
Watch you fall away from me
Sinking into misery

Taste your smile and hold my hand
Make you laugh and make you dance
I remember this
Everything was in our kiss

Sink my hands into the sea
(Sink my hands into the sea)
Reach your fingers up to me, me
(Reach your fingers up to me)

Trust me one more time
I can only try
Throw yourself to me
And I'll try to pull you free

Let me try to pull you free
Let me try to pull you free
Let me try to pull you free",Undertow [Spooky Remix],1994
Lush,"I'm not interested in what you have to say
You're just a vacant space
Other people's lives upon which you prey
It's a permanent disgrace

Why do you think you know what's best for me
What I should and shouldn't do
Why do you judge my history
And tell me to improve

In the confines of your mind
You think we're all the same
I've left them all behind
Though you wish I hadn't

In finding fault in others I can't see
What you have to gain
I know that you get pleasure from
Other people's pain

You're not so perfect and I realise the scene
That you're all coming from
When you say you care I know what you mean
You're really lying

All the people around here
Love to hear about a fall
They all surface and disappear
In an instant

In the confines of your mind
You think we're all the same
I've left them all behind
Through you wish I hadn't",Blackout,1994
Lush,"It's raining in this room
And it's so hot outside this room

I don't know no one here
I don't want to be here
In this room

We hold parties in our sleep
We fill ourselves up in our sleep

And I'll heal you when you're ill
Though it's hard keeping still
In our sleep

Pries the hair out of her mouth
Whilst the circus is heading south

While we search in the sand
Don't ask them to understand
Why they cover up their hands
And their mouths",Desire Lines,1994
Lush,"A silly girl I run around and never know my reasons
And though you're laughing with me I know what you say about me

I can't explain, it's not your business anyway
So don't say you understand
And don't pretend you're on my side

And I remember when you hated her for sleeping next to him
I see your smiling face but I know you've done worse to me

You hypocrite,
Don't talk to me
'Cause you're not fit to know me
So don't pretend
That you could've ever been a friend

And still I'm sure you think it's OK
What you've done to me
'Cause I'm so bad to him
Don't even try to hide behind that stupid lie
I know your kind and I know where your loyalties lie

The silly girls we run around and never know our reasons
And though I understand I guess I'll say that you betrayed me

I'm a hypocrite,
I dish it out but I can't take it
I know you think it's wrong
And maybe you're right but this is my song

And still I'm sure you think it's OK
What she did to me
'Cause I'm so bad to him
Don't even try to hide behind that stupid smile
I know our kind and I know where our loyalties lie",Hypocrite,1994
Lush,"Oh

Outside you are waiting for me, hiding

You catch me when I am
Needing a friend to hold

You can soothe me, lie above me
Press hard

Then you strike
And I think that I'll die
'Cause I can't breathe, can't breathe

Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming

Oh

Please let me start screaming
Eyes are open seeing nothing
Hands are tied and I can't function

Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming",The Invisible Man,1994
Lush,"Tiny children on their own, they learn so fast
How to make new friends, how to play their new games

I remember a man he had shiny hair
Always hanging around when you went away

Little eight year old, she knows too many secrets
Much too young to understand what it means

I remember a woman with silver hair
And the smell and the taste of the bed we shared

And that's how I behaved
Every time that you went away
And now, though I'm older nothing's changed
(playing the same games)

And I knew every day
Came a chance that you'd leave me
So I found what I could to take your place

Told me not to cry
Said that I'd survive
As he waved goodbye

And I want to try
Not to make you cry
Want us to survive
Never say goodbye

But that's how I behave when you go away
Because though I'm older nothing's changed
(Playing the same games)

And I know every day
There's a chance that you'll leave me
So I find what I can to take your place",Kiss Chase,1994
Lush,"He lives his life in a world full of women
And he takes what he wants
from their love
And he throws the rest away

I cling to him and pray
But still he slips away
And now it's just too late
To wish him back again

She won't put up with this life
so she leaves him
And she finds someone else,
falls in love
And she travels far away

I say that it's okay
And swallow all my pain
And now it's just too late
To wish her back again

They left me here on my own
in a nightmare
And I just can't forgive anymore
So I smile and turn away

Don't listen when they say
They wish I could stay
And now it's just too late
To wish me back again",Light from a Dead Star,1994
Lush,"You feel like I do
Like the whole world's forgotten you

And your life is so dull and predictable

Your room seems like a cell
And you don't sleep very well

And your friends only talk to point and to mock
And to ridicule

One day things won't seem the same way, I know

Morning in the mirror
Things will suddenly seem much clearer I promise, it's alright

His words don't flatter me
And they're printed for all to see

I don't care, he's not there
It's all history

The future's yours to hold
And you're really not very old

And your life is so white, so clean and so bright
And holds mystery

Morning in the mirror
Things will suddenly seem much clearer I promise it's alright

One day things won't seem the same way, I know

One day things won't seem the same way, I know

One day things won't seem the same way, I know",Lit Up,1994

Lush,"Only children sometimes comprehend
Loneliness can often be a friend

Have to shut yourself in
Don't know how to begin
Telling it to someone
Who doesn't fit in

I am sunken in biology
I cannot control that part of me

I don't want to hurt you
But I know I will do
Maybe we could find out
What are we to do

I don't have long fingernails to use
Would we care if we were black and blue?

We're both sick but still you hold my hand
We're together but I understand

Walk along the seaside
This is not a joyride
Tell me in the meantime
It's okay",Never-Never,1994
Lush,"Walking at midnight
In the darkness, alone
Standing in the shadows
And I'm watching your glow

Standing in the red light
And I'm smiling at you
Dreaming of the starlight
Just waiting for you

I'll do anything to
Make you mine, make me shine
Take me if you want me
I don't care, I don't mind

I want your starlight
Make it mine, make me shine
Touch me with your light
And I'll burn like a star",Starlust,1994
Lush,"So you want to be alone
Run and hide inside your home

Watch you fall away from me

Everything was in our kiss

Sink my hands into the sea
Reach your fingers up to me

Lush,"If you walked in now
I wouldn't start I wouldn't frown
And if you just appeared
I wouldn't cry or think it weird

'Cause you are still around
You're in the air, you're in the ground
And you can't go away
I am afraid you're here to stay

Friends don't understand
They close the door, they raise their hands

She says she heard your voice
Of course she does, she has no choice

I was hours ahead
When they removed you from your bed

They drank all the while
Until you said goodbye

Why are we sitting here in ourselves?
Why are we sitting here in ourselves?
Why are we sitting here in ourselves?

I don't look up, I don't look down
I look ahead and make no sound
My love was there,
I only stare

Healty in my dreams
Is what you are, is what is seems

What does it all mean?
You're only hiding behind a screen

Curse the English day
For what it forces us to say
Banish all the pain

'Cause when I die, die
I'll see you again.",When I Die,1994
Lush,"Everybody knows a woman like me
Insecurity is my philosophy
I see other women as the competition

I'm always nice to men and so they're nice to me
But other girls always seem to be bitchin' about me

I say they must be jealous
I say that its because their boyfriends all fancy me

Close my eyes and fantisize
Of all men envying me
So much fun to be number one
What good are sisters to me?

I just can't relate to some men
Unless I use my sexuality
Normal conversation always leave me insecure

Men are so much more approachable
Clever, kind and intellectual
And I never feel uncomfortable in their company

Male appreciation is my one ambition
Its a competition I must win

When I talk to girls its just monotonous shit
Because I don't want their friendship just their jealousy",Tinkerbell,1995
Lush,"It's at times such as this she'd be tempted to spit
If she wasn't so ladylike
She imagines how she might have lived back when legends and history collide
So she looks to her prince finding he's so charmingly slumped at her side
Those days are recalled on the gallery wall
And she's waiting for passion or humour to strike

What shall we do, what shall we do with all this useless beauty?
Good Friday arrived, the sky darkened on time
'Til he almost began to negotiate
She held his head like a baby and said ""It's okay if you cry""
Now he wants her to dress as if you couldn't guess
He desires to impress his associates
But he's part ugly beast and Hellenic deceased
So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny

[Chorus]
She won't practice the looks from the great tragic books
That were later defaced, disgraced celluloid
It don't even make sense but you can bet

If she isn't a sweetheart, a plaything or pet
The film turns her into an unveiled threat
Nonsense prevails, modesty fails
Grace and virtue turn into stupidity
While the calendar fades almost all barricades to a pale compromise
Our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts
They still think they're the gods of antiquity
If something you missed didn't even exist
It was just an ideal
Is that such a surprise?

[Chorus]",All This Useless Beauty,1996
Lush,"Just because they seem to understand the way you feel
It doesn't mean they'll feel the same way too
Just because they seem to hold a mirror to your life
It doesn't follow that they'll be just like you

Take no heroes,
Its no good
They don't stand up to you
Just take the bit you think they can use

I remember when I was younger
I thought the answers were locked in people
So I admired the ones whose lives were a source of envy to people like me

But do you really want to meet
The ones who write your dreams
Believe me, it's a fantasy
You won't like the reality

If you want heroes keep them safe
They don't stand up to life
So lock them in your soul and lose the key

(I love you, I don't want to meet you)

When I see you it makes me feel
There's someone else out there like me
You touch my soul with what you do
It all makes sense when I hear you

You understand the way I feel
I know exactly what you mean
It's like I've known you all my life
I think of you I feel alright

But in the flesh how would it be
If you could really see
The weaknesses you never knew
Alive and staring back at you

If you want to heroes keep them safe
They don't stand up to life
So lock them in your soul and lose the key",Heavenly,1996
Lush,"Shake, baby, shake, you know I can fit you in my arms
Brake, baby, brake, taking me in with all you're charms

I've never been inside you but you're so alluring
They call you ""little mouse"" by name in Rome and Turin

Looking now at your famous shape
They don't make them like anymore

Shake, baby, shake, you know I can fit you in my arms
Brake, baby, brake, taking me in with all your charms

When things are looking good there's always complications
I can't be with you so I'm at the railway station

Let's run away and be so alive
Escape the drudgery of this nine to five

Shake, baby, shake, you know I can fit you in my arms
Brake, baby, brake, taking me in with all your charms

Shake, baby, shake, you know I worship from afar
Brake, baby, brake, how I wish you were my car",500,1996
Lush,"I've been so happy since I walked away
I never thought that I could feel as great as I do today
'Cause you were nothing but a big mistake
And life is wonderful, now that I'm rid of you

Oh I must've been crazy to have stayed with you
I can't believe I thought I was in love with you
But now the scales have fallen I can really see
And I say go to hell, 'cause that's where you took me

Well, I've felt better since I slammed that door
You always cramped my style, I never noticed before
It's been a non-stop party since I flew the coop
I can't believe I fell for such a loser like you

And is it any wonder that I felt so blue
When I was always having to put up with you

Oh, here we go again, just lay the blame on me
Don't say another word, 'cause sweetheart, you're history

I know that you miss me really, bet you wish that you still had me
You'll never find someone like me but I've got no regrets at all

'Cause I've met this girl and she's so good to me
She's really beautiful, fantastic company
Oh, when I'm with her I realize what love can be
'Cause she's fifty times the person you will ever be

Good luck, mister, do you think I care?
Since you've been gone the offers have been everywhere
I've got a million guys just lining up for me
I've turned a corner, boy, my life is ecstasy

Well, I've been in heaven since I walk away

Lush,"I've tried to be strong, I've tried to be tough
But I think that this time I've had more than enough
I've seen too much of your games and your immature stuff
You're a waste of time

All the people I've known throughout all the years
Too many vodkas and too many beers
And I've learnt a few lessons from all of the tears
You're way out of line

I feel so lucky sometimes
I sit down and look at all my friends
They mean more than the stupid fools that pass my way

I used to prefer those who weren't good for me
Somehow the attraction beat reality
Now all the rubbish they spill, it means nothing to me
I'm just much more wise

Some people grow up and some only pretend
They're all over the place, these children dressed up as men
They can't imagine how a woman can be only a friend
And they deal in lies

I feel so lucky sometimes
I sit down and I listen to my friends
They say more than the empty words that pass my way

And I feel so lucky sometimes
I've got a feeling I've been here before
I can see the world for what it really is

You think that I'm jealous, well don't be so vain
I can tell in your voice you think I want you again
Well, if I did you know I think I'd be a little insane
You just leave me cold

Ooh, you and her in your sad little world
You can only exist with the help of a girl
Well, I'm glad it's not me, I've got my life to unfurl
You're just way too old

Lush,"Will I ever be Olympia?
Will I ever be a girl like her?
Will I ever have to say the word

Could I ever deign to have the look
Instead of have to read a book?
Will I ever be Olympia?
Will I ever be a girl like her?

And if ever there's a will
There's a place in Notting Hill
You can go and visit still

And if ever there's a way
To find a hopeful ray
Will I find it all today?

Will I ever be Olympia?
Could I ever have a cat like her?
Could I ever lie around all day eating chocolate and marmalade?

Now it's time to find the perfect world
Dress myself up like the perfect girl
Could I ever be Olympia?
Could I ever be in love like her?

Come to me with wounds you want to heal
I'll listen and I'll try to understand the way you feel

Never fear that I'll be gone from here
I'll always be around for you to talk to me, my dear
We can try to justify reasons for and reasons why
Some are true and some are only lies

But I see he's feeling itchy
Trying to play us off each other,
""Girls, girls, please don't fight"" (you get the picture)

Hey you, the muscles and the long hair
Telling me that women are superior to men
Most guys just don't appreciate this
You just convincing me you're better than them

So he talks for hours about his sensitive soul
And his favorite subject is sex
I don't think he even wanted it
But, Christ this guy's too much (I want to tell him)

I like a bit of flattery

I know the score,

He flirted like a maniac but I wouldn't bite
I'm weak and he was so persistent
He only had to have me 'cause I put up a fight

Oh God, the boy had such an ego
He liked to talk about himself all day and all night
You think you're such a ladykiller
But you were nothing special 'til you turned out the light

When he's nice to me he's just nice to himself
And he's watching his reflection
I'm a five foot mirror for adoring himself
Here's seven years bad luck (I want to tell him)

When you say you love me you're just flattering your vanity
But I don't need your practiced lines your, your school of charm mentality so
Save your breath for someone else and credit me with something more
When it comes to men like you,
I know the score,
I've heard it all before

Ooh, you're such a ladykiller, always on a winner, thinking that you're in there
Oh boy, you're such a ladykiller, super sexy mister, call it what you will, oh

Lutan Fyah,"Good vibes
We're bringing only good vibes

Whoa oh whoa oh oh yeah

People walking 'round talking down on others
You can't know yourself without knowing about the other
And I know that ain't the right way to go

I've got a hunch that we don't want to diss
Let's move away from hate and prejudice
The racist man, yeah, he's full of it
Let's learn about the culture opposite now
Don't judge a book by the cover
People take a look at the world and discover
That beauty is the word that I think of 
When I see the different colors of skin
And I'll rejoice and sing for them

Oh, no, no, no
The hatred keeps building up, yeah
Oh, no, no, no
The tension keeps on building up, yeah
Oh, no, no, no
The hatred keeps building up, yeah
Oh, no, no, no
The racism is killing us

When we come around, yeah
Try to keep compassion on the ground, yeah
Feel a sense of freedom with crowd, yeah
Connecting people with the sound, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, it's a choice to be grateful
People focus on the enemy that's hateful
The daily news has got a picture of a man
They say I'm supposed to hate
So great, just another stereotype to make

Oh, no, no, no
The hatred keeps building up, yeah
Oh, no, no, no
The tension keeps on building up, yeah
Oh, no, no, no
The hatred keeps building up, yeah
Oh, no, no, no
The racism is killing us

Too many times that I've seen the wrong signs
Back up with your hatred in life
'Cause we're bringing only good vibes
We're bringing only good vibes
Too many times that I've seen the wrong signs
Empty out the hatred in life
We're bringing only good vibes
We're bringing only good vibes

I tell ya ease the tension
We all know my kind still got toe punt
If it was an eye-for-an-eye world we all would be blind by now
Love is the key and my yurt is my own
If we are connected by our fingers, let's start telling a line
We speak of love, no fall, but everyday we fly
And the birds fly high
No cheese to stop by
Man-made mountains climb up to the sky

Lutan Fyah,"And you asked me what I want this year
And I try to make this kind and clear
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
'Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings
And designer love and empty things
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

[Chorus]
So take these words and sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

I need some place simple where we could live
And something only you can give
And that's faith and trust and peace while we're alive
And the one poor child who saved this world
And there's ten million more who probably could
If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them

[Chorus]

I wish everyone was loved tonight
And somehow stop this endless fight
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

Lute,"I got a friend who little brother infatuated with guns
I tell him ""watch yourself, for that you know what comes""
Two shots to the lungs 'cause some young nigga thought you had it coming
And I know you not the type for running
AK sound off like the band drumming
Quick to check a nigga if he sayin' something
Under his breath, two shells is left
Everyday niggas dance with death
I got a tone that make you one-two step
You see, life's too short to be so reckless
Which one? Your life or that gold necklace
Could niggas soul check it?
And all my life I been so patient
They say ""life is what you make"" so it's all for the takin'
Seen a family get evicted, had me reminiscing
Yet I'm bitching about life, I should be happy I'm alive
But shit, we tired of flipping fries
Niggas trapping on the side
Don't need no blue check, bye, to be verified
I'm so solidified, they don't question my qualifications
Young legend in the making, I'm tryna be patient
But no time to be waiting, I'm just feeding my baby
Unemployed, no diploma, what nigga, this crazy

Gotta be another way, aye
Gotta be another way, aye
Gotta be another way, aye
Gotta be another way

All around, she gon' hold me down
Y'know, 'cause I can make her hurl many sounds like coyote howls
When I'm in the center, outer limits, nonexistent
Is you riding, is you with it?
Ain't to hard to figure out, ain't to hard to live for now
Is you artificial or your art official?
Only clean my messes with official tissue, I'm a picky nigga
Picking up on signals, crystal clear, I get the picture
Pissing off whoever watching, watch the minutes and the seconds keep on ticking
Got a cousin in Kuwait
He can't wait to see his daughter
When he left she wasn't talking, heard he sing the other day
Got a cousin in Kuwait

Craters on my thumbs from the lighters I spun
I just stopped by today to work on my lil' cash flow
Spit all your spills in they lanes, I'm more revealings than saints
And fucking willingness is the phrase that pays, my nigga
The free money, kitty, you get it all day, my daily
They heard of my city, can't tell me 'bout labor wailings
The freakiest babies with labias, only debating
Microwave pregnancies, we've no sense of time waiting
Attention span to whatever get my dick rocked
Not to mention my nigga just got slammed after fifth block
So we gon' have to handle all of that when all of the tick stops and the bell rings
No hiding at the neighborhood pit stop, shit
I'm on my own, so if I make it home, know I ain't have to use my chrome
I ain't have one to own, let alone two to rub together, just to fuel the growth
So when Judas ran up on me, gave him two boost to the throat, 'cause there's, 'cause there's

Has to be another way
Gotta be another way
Gotta be another way
Gotta be another way
Gotta be another way
Gotta be another way
Gotta be another way
Gotta be another way
Gotta be another way
Gotta be another way
Gotta be another way

Took two steps back just to get it right

Took off my work badge, realize I'm back in the hood
Like what's good, my cousin called, told me he coming through
Like ""Yo what up, why you back bruh?
See you should be laying tracks with J. Cole and who knows
Maybe he sign yo ass
See I don't know just how this rap thing go
From the looks of it you closer than most niggas that I know
Please explain, way I see it bruh, you paving lanes
What you don't believe cause boy your songs did some things for me
Had me thinking we was trapped, but lute you set us free
Niggas stay focused, when it's right for you, it's meant to be
Every time I play a song you gain a fan
Nigga you the man, drop a song, what you waiting on?
You in high demand and that's life
Only one time to get it right
Take a flight, view this world from a different height
See this hood still the same, no matter how you view it
You got dreams, I just rather you pursue it
Just promise you never change, I don't care just how you do it
Fuck them niggas you ain't gotta prove shit
And see this hood still the same, no matter what you doing
So for you I empty out a whole clip""

Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right

As I let the Chevy skate, like Trae Waynes back in the day
Wish upon these stars like ""God, show me that way""
Cause ain't no looking back
Been in the trap so long, I'm tired of shooting back
Keep your eyes peeled, don't let the steel hit you
Envy be that bitch that fuck the niggas that chill with you
That's why I can never trust these niggas
Trigger finger itchin', contemplating should I pull it
Lost more friends to bullshit than a bullet
Brother Pooh called me up, he told me stay consistent
""The fact that you yourself what make you different
Like fuck the gold chains, diamond rings
Keep your eyes on the prize, that don't make a difference
Cause you're still a young king without the bling
Keep your eyes on the prize, shine on these niggas""

Luther Allison,"Toute la nuit, il a joué sur sa guitare
Au fond d’un vieux café
Un peu de soleil, sur le goudron mouillé
Les gens s’en vont, le jour va se lever

C’est la dernière chanson d’un amour blessé
Y a la guerre quelque part, loin du café
Comme un amour bizarre qui veut jamais rentrer
Tout ça est normal et la guitare fait…mal

La femme qui vient le soir, s’habille en noir
Elle sourit quand il joue le blues
Elle demande chaque soir la même chanson
La même chanson qui est toute son histoire

Et c’est son parfum qui traîne dans le matin
On empile les chaises, pour balayer
C’est toute une histoire qu’il faudrait oublier
Tout ça est normal et la guitare fait…mal

Il y a pas si longtemps, pas très longtemps
Il jouait pour pouvoir l’aimer
Malgré les journées où il perdait sa vie
Pour la voir arriver quand venait la nuit

Il attend la nuit et cette femme aussi
Comme on attend son dernier train
Qui va l’emporter vers son vrai destin
Tout ça est normal et la guitare fait…mal

la guitare fait…mal",La  Guitare fait mal,

She made my darkest days look bright

Concerning the great speckled bird

On the pages of God's holy word

I am glad that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing

At the close of each week to be wound

And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again

I bought her candy canes and dolls and flowers
And I took her to coney Island

And played everything just right
Then came the news telling me not to worry
The show is selling out tonight
Well, the lights went on and suddenly the crowd began to scream
And as you could well imagine, it was like living a dream
Oh, but when the lights went down and the standing ""O"" was done
I was just another lonely guy who didn't have no one

I wanted your love 
Your love, your love, love, love, love, love

So busy daydreaming 'bout you baby
I didn't even hear the phone
Then when my friends rang the doorbell it scared me
They said, ""we're so glad you're home! 
You just won a million dollars and a trip around the world?
Better get yourself and forget about that girl
They thought I was acting crazy not to get excited too
But all the money in the world could never take the place of you

All over the city the lights were so pretty
The holiday was filled with cheer
The stars really glistened and lovers were kissin'
It was the special part of the year
So what a perfect time it was to find someone to say  ""I do""
Thought that I could still be happy even though she wasn't you

There was another guy looking in your eyes

I don't want, don't want us to fuss and fight
From right now 'til tomorrow night

It was  ""Hey, Jimmy Mack""

'Cause your love is the spice of my life
But if you hurry back in the mornin'
Then, alright, I'll let you slide tonight

You've got to come back
And love, love, love, love me right
And, huh, I'll let you slide tonight

I can't wait till tomorrow, baby
Can't you come over tonight?
I can't get to sleep my baby
Come and rock my cradle left to right

But there wasn't anybody home
It makes me sad, I need you bad

Let's take the morning off, I've got some plans for you

Making love by the moon can be mighty fine
But when the sun rises, so do I
So if you rock it to me in the morning
Then alright, I'll let you slide tonight
Really missed you today, I was on the run
So wake me up when the morning comes
I think I'll dance to some music and groove on the party lights
And let you slide tonight

Get up, oooh, let's love baby
Be my sugar and spice in the mornin'
And alright, I'll let you slide tonight

Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find
Any love, any love?

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love

And I know there's a love waiting
To enter my life, enter my life

Every day as I live
I try to think positive
I pray for someone good to come
Any love

Love is sweet and so divine
And I can't wait for my love life to shine (to shine)

Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love

I know there's someone waiting for me
To enter my life, come into my life

Suddenly I'm up in clear blue skies
Lonely tears start to fill my eyes
I can weep, but I refuse to cry
I've got to keep holding on

I got to be very strong
To keep holding on

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love

And I know, I know I know, I know she'll come into my life
Come into my life

Luther Vandross,"Anywhere you say to be
From the sky down to the ground
If I hear you calling me
I will never let you down
What if I were far away
Would the love fire still burn
I want to know if you would be
Still in love when I return

Are you gonna love me
I'm who I should be when you're loving me
Are you gonna love me
And give this love a chance ...would we dance

I know the way you feel
I shouldn't worry 'bout the future now
It just gets in the way
Don't want to make you sad
Just want to know you're gonna love me
When it's not a sunny day

Are you gonna love me
When the skies are grey and I'm far away
Are you gonna love me
If I have to go ...do you know

Interlude:
It's all about (You and me, you and me)
Will you wait for me
(It's all about love, love, love)
About your love

You were feeling kind of blue
When the job took me away
The reason that I'm calling you is
I'll be coming back today

Are you gonna love me
Girl, it's been so long
Is the feeling gone
Are you gonna love me
That's what I'm asking you
Whatcha gonna do

I'm reminded it's you I miss
I just love when we love like this
I can tell you that
Please forgive me if I pout
But my world would turn inside out
If on leaving me you insist
Let me tell you that

I start to hold you but you pull back, 
not much just a little
I can't control you
When you get so caught up in the middle
First you say yes, then you say no
Said you're gonna stay, now you're gonna go
You know I'll tell you honey
But I think you already know

I can tell you this
Anytime you go I really miss you
Nothing to do, tired of my friends
Won't you come back and love me again?
So I can tell you that
You've got me forever girl to love

The way true love should feel
I'm strong enough to show you 
The heart can always heal

It shouldn't be so hard 
to let our love just live

the love we need to give

I've been dreaming, I don't wanna be awake

Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

You thought, your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

Can't stop until we are one

I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it

Luther Vandross,"What happened
It seems like every time love comes
You're never ready
That's why they call it?
The Rush

Tell me, are you there?
Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer
See, I've prayed for peace and love
Like so many of us do
Then I prayed to find someone like you
Up in the morning
Fell out of my bed
Worn out, I couldn't sleep
Thoughts of you filled my head
How could it be?
This is scaring me

Seems every time I try
To rest my heart is when
The rush is back again
Maybe this time I'll
Make it work somehow
Guess I'm gonna find out now

I get a rush
And it's love for sure
What else can it be
Something beckons me
And I go back for more
Ooo such a rush
Can't pass love by
What else can I do
Something tells me to
Give it one more try

I'm not gonna die if love passes me by
It goes and comes around, I know
So maybe the next time I'll be one of the few
Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do
I will carry on wading through every day till love needs me
Waiting for the rush to come and find me
I still remember when love was an angel send
It will be back again

I can't remember when, I can't remember how
It's very different now
It's not a fantasy, it's very real to me
True to the touch
I get a rush
",The Rush,1991
Luther Vandross,"For love you pay the price
You give it up, you sacrifice
And if necessary you comprimise
Sometimes it's bitter sweet
You've got to try eight days a week
To create a good enough love to keep
You see hearts belong to fire
So does her love
She burns me up with desire

My girl's love is right on time
""Sweet"" and ""sweet and ever kind""
She's so fine
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind
Even when I come home late at night
We don't fuss, we never fight
'Cause the girl loves me to the line
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

It was out of my hands
I did my best, please understand
I was late for one of our evening plans
Champagne, dinner for two
With candlelight, she set the mood
But there wasn't anything I could do

But, she is so forgiving
The one thing I know is
It's off her love I'm living

That girl's love is right on time
""Sweeter than sweet"" and ""ever kind""
She's so fine
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind
Even when I come home late at night
 We don't fuss, we never fight
'Cause the girl loves me to the line
 She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

When I go out to play
She doesn't mind if I'm a little bit late
She knows I think about her face
Till I get home
Till I get back home
What we gonna do tonight?
It's raining heavy and it's cold outside
So let's just love until we get things right
And waste a whole lotta time
I don't mind

I tell her things she can't repeat
Makes her little heart just skip a beat
She blush a little bit
And then I find
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

Even though our love is  ""C'est Si Bon""
Sometimes I like to be alone
Ring the girl on her private line
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

Go to work early, come back late
Outta my head, can't concentrate
Sometimes my love is a waste of time but
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

She's better even than she used to be
Loving her is no mystery
Sometimes I'm not so sweet and kind
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

When I call her in the middle of the day
She's busy at work, but it's okay
But not too busy to give me time
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

Luther Vandross,"I am still your friend 
Standing by to catch you 
If ever life should let you down 
And you should fall. 
You don't need to pretend 
If ever doubt should find you. 
I don't need to remind you 
I'm there for you before and after all. 
I am who I am 
And I would never fool you. 
I feel the same way you do 
About honesty. 
But do we understand 
How love is sometimes jaded? 
It keeps us separated 
Even though we'll never part.  
So to be lovers 
We've got to understand 
Today is how today begins, 
Tomorrow's how it ends. 
And to be lovers 
Some things we rise above. 
'Cause sometimes love is wonderful 
But sometimes it's only love. 
Loving who I am 
Is something that you've taught me. 
The kind of love you've brought me 
Takes me through the day. 
And even though our minds 
Are sometimes disagreeing 
Our hearts they're still believing 
We'll work it out and stay. 
So to be lovers 
We've got to understand 
Today is how today begins, 
Tomorrow's how it ends. 
And to be lovers 
Some things we rise above.

Luther Vandross,"What are we saying?
For what are we praying?
Using the words we both wanna hear

What are we doing?
The whole thing is proving
We're feeling the same way we always did

So, here we go once again
It's just like back when
I clearly remember the way we were then
So come back and love me again

I was the one who adored you
And I waited all this time for you
But, you can't tell love what to do
It's so hard but it's true
You used to love me completely
And I'd really love you to need me
So darling, tell me you can find the way
Find a way to love me, again

I've heard the stories of hearts that get broken
But, if we take it slowly, it won't have to be
One step at a time heart, too fast and it all'll fall apart
I know we're survivors, but I'll speak for me

Even as strong as I am
I don't think I can
Lost outside the world
I don't know just where I stand
So hurry back girl, and love the boy again

I was the one who adored you
And I'd wait a million years for you
But, you can't tell love where to go
This is one thing that we know
You used to love me completely
And I'd really love you to need me
So darling, tell me you can find the way
Find a way to love me again

Find any way that you can, love me again
Just think it over and then, love me again

Luther Vandross,"Last time you thought of him, he thought of you
And it proves the magic was for real
Just then the winds of change
Brought down the falling rain, so unexpected
What should you do?

Now, you've got plans to change, some things to rearrange
Scared of tomorrow, scared of right now too
See, it's all very sad
Can't deny you feel bad
But I just don't want you to let this thing take you over
 
Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because?
Everything can be the way that it was
But keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown
Everyone says that you'll come back around
But, not if you fall too far down

No one really knows
When their clouds will go away
That's why they say we should always save
For a rainy day

Someone made some promises that didn't keep
It set you up just to let you down
Be careful not to let it push you around
And you'll be okay, if you take one day, by one day
See, I just don't want you to
Let this thing take you over

Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because?
Most of your life can be the way that it was
But, keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown
Everyone thinks that you'll come back around
But, not if you fall too far down

Too far down is where you fall when you don't care no more
But, what about love?
Isn't it worth living for?
You don't know?

Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because?
Everything can be the way that it was
But keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown
Everyone says that you'll come back around
But, not if you fall too far down

You're not the only one who's loved and who's lost
So many people too, know they've paid the cost
The thing that we learn is how to get a smile from a frown
Go ahead if you want, stumble and fall
But, don't fall honey too far down

Pick yourself up; if you're lost you'll be found
But, if you don't care, you're just too far down
I know you feel so left out; pushed around
But nevertheless, don't go too far down
",Too Far Down,1993

How can you go on day to day
Without someone to care
If I wanted to take that chance
If I wanted to be your man
You tell me that you feel lonely
But you won't love nobody
You tell me that you got a big heart
But you won't love no one
You lie and you moan and you bitch and you groan
But you won't let nobody in to love
What am I gonna do?
Hey there baby, you're not shy
We talk for hours and you seem just fine girl, but...
Every time I bring up love
You run for cover
Suppose I told you something that's true
Suppose I told you that I want you
You tell me all the guys want you
But you won't love nobody
You keep your heart in seclusion
And you won't love no one
You game and you flirt and you talk a lot of dirt
But you don't want nobody to love
What are you gonna do?
Heart feels empty, there's no one home
Nights are longer when you're alone
You tell me that you feel lonely
But you won't love nobody
You tell me that you got a big heart

I'm not just making her up in my mind
I see the stars in her eyes
And I look and I know that she sees only mine

I tell myself it's the game of love
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love

Now watch this sketch as I stretch this mall
Too live to drive so we put it in park
With Luther hoping that you feeling his groove
Get you open on the instruments too, one two, one two
And I say, jottin' down the lines
Like dots on the Parkway
My Auntie Eloise say stay on your Q's and P's
And until the days of D's, I'm doin' what I please
Ease on down like the road
Depending on the mood, definitely into more
And you can catch a yellow brick
You need to run and tell your click
That the female in town is bringing it
Now listen, Mission Impossible
Keep it general like the hospital
Shake, rattle and roll, to rock wit' chu

Keep you lookin' once again

We can make it, we can take it right to the top
Come on and never stop

And if we keep believing we can never go too high
Why don't we give it a try
Come on and keep reaching up

The people there were really something
(You know that's right)

And it used to knock me down
When Smokey came to town
(And the miracles, please)
My favorite song was ""Tears Of A Clown"", oh yeah

And Lordy could they harmonize (Oh yeah)

Don't walk a mile inside my shoes
Cause if you do, you're gonna regret it
Don't take it lightly thinking they might be 
Here or there tomorrow

Why you want to wait, communicate
Don't assume that they already know
How much, how much you're really feeling
And you really, really love them

Now it's a shame that I found out the hard way
And it ain't the same 
Cause you never ever got to hear me say
That I love you, 'cause I waited too late
It's like I would tell anybody
Don't make the same mistake like I did

[Chorus]

Those three words make all the difference in the world
You might wait and miss your chance
So don't be scared to say what you're feeling
You can't turn back the hands of time
If you get the chance, do it right 
Let it out, say it now
Say it

[Chorus: x2]

I'm ready 
Ready to shout it out, shout it out loud
So ready 
Oh how I wish I could tell you right now
But I waited too late 
So today I won't make the same mistake, no
I won't do it, and if I get the chance I'll say it

[Chorus: x3]

Luther Vandross,"How could I forget what she had on
Halter top with the capri pants on
Had a smile that would stop time
And pretty feet which is a fetish of mine
Hair down to her shoulders barely
Lip gloss with no make-up surely
I wasn't gonna let her get away
Until she heard me say

Excuse me miss
What's your name
Where are you from 
And I come and possibly 
Can I take you out tonight
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark 
So let me know 
Can I take you out tonight

Don't care if I get rejected
At least then I won't regret it
Regret the fact I missed the chance 
For romance at least
I walk away knowing I tried my best 
And I'm going, I'm going on with my day
Cause at least she heard me say

And introduce myself to you

And what to say, to say, to make you come again, oh honey
Come back to me again

Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he

If I could steal one final glance
One final step

I'd play a song that would never ever end

Luther Vandross,"Your love's never been better
So good it's a sin
But it's time for a decision
Is it me or him?
Before you make your mind up, hear me
I just want you to see things clearly
This should be about love, not money
Don't let him try to take you from me
I don't want to have to apologize
I don't want to feel I've been penalized
Just 'cause I can drive in a better car 
Live in a bigger house just like a superstar
He says that I can only give you
Material things, but that's not true
You see my heart is rich with love for you
Don't let him make you doubt my love for you
Yeah, baby
I work hard for my money
No one gave it to me
But some fools think the deeper the pocket
The smaller the heart will be, not true
I'm only tryin' to share me with you
Look at all the lovin' we do
Find the meaning in the words I'm sayin'
I'm not just another player playin'
I don't want to have to apologize (or give a damn)
And I don't appreciate being criticized (for who I am) 
Just 'cause I can buy you a lotta things
Or take you anyplace
That's just what money brings
He wants you to believe that I'm tryin' to buy your love
'Cause that's what he would do
He thinks since he's a man with nothing
That he's got better love for you
No way 
Tell him now, let him go
Or I can no longer be yours
Tell him how you feel about me
I can't keep standing on the side
Don't let him fill your mind with lies about me
Leave him with his fallacies
I don't care what bull he believes
Tell him that enough is enough
Just don't return a disbeliever
You've always been a willing receiver of my love
I don't think I have to apologize (I work for this)
I don't want to feel like I'm penalized (for being rich)
Doesn't bother me where he thinks I stand
I'm bein' my true self
Just doin' what I can
He thinks I won you with materiality
But honey, you know that's not so
And even if he understood me
It's simply time for him to go, so let him go!
I don't want to change you 
'Cause I'm in love with who you are
So I don't want to apologize for bein' a superstar
Haven't I proved that I'm here for you?
What am I guilty of?
What did or didn't I do?
Maybe I can't be myself with somebody
Who believes such things are true
I'm losing self-respect from trying
I'm losing my desire too I can't do it
I don't want to have to apologize (or give a damn) 
I don't want to feel I've been penalized (for who I am)

He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
But it tears her apart 'cause nothing's for her heart

If he could only read her mind, she'd say

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open a door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

Yeah

Now the days have grown
To years of feeling all alone
As she sits and wonders if all she's doin' wrong
'Cause lately she'd try anything just to turn his head
Ooh, would it make a difference if she'd say, if she'd say

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open the door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives
The less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives
The more that he sees
This is the story of you
And me

So I bought you a rose
On the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hoped you noticed this look in my eyes

Not all bitter, not all sweet (sounds all right to me)

So don't miss all the good, waiting for the best, there's still happiness
Right in the middle
Perfect love sounds real nice
But that never seemed to happen with any relationship of mine
It was always up and down, in then out

And you get so annoyed if you can't feel the same every night
Not all bad, not all good (I'm tryin' to tell you that it's)
Not all high, not all low (not all high and not all low)
Not all heaven, not all hell (as far as I can tell)

It's not some prize you win, you don't have a thing to prove, just enjoy the groove
Right in the middle
Cause I've learned when it comes to love, it's the exact same reality
That's why they say ""Que sera, sera""
Which means whatever's gonna be is gonna be

Whatever's gonna be is gonna be:
Not all bad, not all good (I need somebody to understand)
Not all sunshine, not all rain

And when the morning came around
Well, she had not let me down, she was still my lover
I must confess that I put her to the test
To see if there was any others

She proved to me, oh, what a real good love she'd be
And she was so excited
Deep in her eyes was a promise of the love
That I've been dreaming of

Here it is

She caught me by surprised I must say
Cause I never had seen such a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style
I was fascinated surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

Excuse me miss
But what's your name?
Where are you from and can I come?
And possibly can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

Don't care if I get rejected
At least then I won't regret it
Regret the fact I missed the chance for romance
At least I'll walk away knowing
I tried my best and I'm going
Cause at least she heard me say
I'm going on with my day
Cause at least she heard me say

Excuse me miss
But what's your name?
Where are you from and can I come?
And possibly can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

Huh, that's why I had to come over
And introduce myself to you
Cause you never know where you're gonna find love
And hopefully I found it in you, yeah

Love turns gray
Like the skin on a dying man
Night after night
We pretend it's all right

And you have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun, anymore

Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

With your empty smile

As the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter

When I'm standing on solid ground

When did we go wrong?

Creo que en medio de un berenjenal siempre estoy
A cada paso que doy

Ir de narices contra una pared, resulta cómico
Más repetirlo una why otra vez es un mal crónico

Creo que haciendo el tonto por la vida voy
Creo que en medio de un berenjenal siempre estoy
A cada paso que doy
No sé qué hacer para evitar el tropezón
No sé, no sé qué hacer para encontrar la solución
A cada paso que doy

Cada paso es un salto mortal, algo enigmático
Cada paso es un paso fatal con fin dramático

Why sé, why sé también que soy un caso único

Keep your head on your shoulders but I when I counted backwards
Only jail keeps me sweated on the daily
Because I look gangsta
I stay in all the danger
Fools want to trip ''cause I left the hood
They swear a G jack a G but to me yo it's all good
I rather be a punk OG
Than a dead OG
Doin' all that time in the county

I'm gettin paid in this game and jealous fools just make me laugh

Upon my window pane tonight
And though your love grows even colder
I wonder where you are tonight

And now you've gone to find another

I smile and I suppose that somehow maybe you are there

Without a warning and I rub my eyes and fantasize
And all at once I realize it's morning

Floating in the silence that surrounds us

looking on the mountains and the sea.
How lovely! this is where i want to be.
Here, with you so close to me, untill the final flicker of lifes ember.

A bitter tragic joke, have found with you
The meaning of existence oh, my love.",Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars),2005
Lydia Gray,"Whenever skies look gray to me and trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds become too strong
I concentrate on you

When fortune cries ""Nay, nay"" to me
And people declare ""You're through""
Whenever the blues become my only songs
I concentrate on you

On your smile, so sweet, so tender
When at first my kiss you do decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine

And so when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true
To prove that even the wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on you",I Concentrate on You,2005

Late one night, you rang my phone
You called to make sure that I was all alone
You said you were feeling down
And couldn't be seen around
One thing led to another
You became my lover, you said
""Let's keep it secret, let's not spread it around""
You send me flowers and diamonds
And said that you were in love
You said you never met a girl
That you thought so much of

Then they run off and hide

I was not upset
And then much to my surprise
One day to my regret
Well the doctor said that
There will soon be two
And there's a little one coming
There's a man in you

I was in shock
I thought I'd faint
And I was petrified

I sent you a telegram

And I did not intend to start a fight
But when you said who am I
You don't know my face
I went off, I made a scene
I really wrecked the place
And I know you might be a big superstar
And the whole wide world knows who you are
But the next time we meet
If you don't want a scene
Tip your hat with respect

Said old lady you best get home
'Cause God ain't where you said he would be
And there's something that I really need to speak to him about immediately
She said boy tell Granny what's wrong is there something I can do
I said big mama now it's a sensitive issue
And Lord knows I don't want to worry you

Shot at all the rest of ya'll

Shoulda been dead like seventeen times for seventeen crimes I committed
Took 'em all to trial and got aquitted
Left wavin' my middle finger in the air whispered in the prosecutor's ear, yeah I did it

Auctioned off my soul for material things

I figured, can't be nothing all that wrong with crying

Go on and cry, cry, cry

I done went for some of the oldest tricks
From some of the coldest chicks God done ever made

That I don't really give a damn what nobody say, I'm a man

So I've made up my mind I'm a go to church on Sunday
And sing a song that may hurt somebody's feelings so that maybe
Thy will, will be done

On earth as it is in heaven
And hopefully they will see
How much they really be discouraging a little old sinner like me 

And Lord who they think they jiving by singing these songs full of glory
Then out in the world it's a different story
I'm running out of people to pray for me
I'm not trying to act like I'm the perfect man

But if you speak about it, you should be about it not just preach about it all day
'Cause if you do you run the risk of chasing some of the most beautiful people away
And it is never my intention to discourage you rather encourage you to change your life today
This be the realest thing I ever had to say, but after this a lot of folks won't like me no mo'

I just wanna inform you that when you got somebody good, you hold on to 'em

Must be nice... having someone who understands the life you live
Must be nice... having someone who's slow to take and quick to give
Must be nice... having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick
Someone who smiles bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion

Must be nice...having someone who loves you despite your faults
Must be nice...having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk
Must be nice...having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too

Someone who loves you fa sho
You must remember to never let 'em go

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone,
She'll be by your side, still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here

Must be nice... having someone you could come home to from a long day of work
Must be nice... having someone you don't have to show;
They know exactly where it hurts
Must be nice... having someone who trusts you...
Despite what they've heard
Someone as mighty as a lion, but still gentle as a bluebird

Must be nice... having someone you don't have to tell you don't wanna be wrong
Must be nice... having someone you can grow old with until God calls you home
Must be nice... having someone who understands that a thug has feelings, too
Someone that loves you fa sho, you never let em go!

She'll be by your side, still holding on

Talked about by my friends
Played a fool by women
And had a daddy with no feelings
I lived in ghettos with my momma
Used the stove to heat our water
And had to share clothes with my brothers
Three of us one bed one cover oh

Better get home, better get home

You're still Superman to me 

See I done been mistreated and discouraged
Felt like I was worthless
Lonely scared and nervous

But he said in time I would
See it's the bad times that make the good times feel so good

Too many zeros

Stretching from the neck area to the genitals

And he don't say shit but nigga back off of me

Lyfe,"[1st Verse:]
I know a lot of women gonna hate it
but, somebody's gotta say it
And so I nominated myself to deliver the news
that its hard for a man to choose a lady
that already got a baby
Although his feelings may be strong
Having kids that don't belong to him
holding on to him somehow seems wrong to him
Exposing them to a man who may one day decide
he's tired of the family life
And now he's gotta tell that little girl a goodbye lie
when he's the only Dad she's ever had in her life
I don't want to take that chance please don't take offense
it's just the thought of hurting somebody that was innocent 

[Chorus:]
She got kids
And I don't know if I'm ready to give
Them the things that they need to live
'Cause if we become more than just friends what I do for her I gotta do for them kids
She got kids
And I just want to make sure this is
more than just some sexual trip
See all I want to do is prevent those kids from getting hurt again 

[2nd Verse:]
Most men think it but they'll never say it
but what if ya'll had another baby
And he's accused of choosing favorites, and they're right
Would he be wrong for loving his own flesh and blood a little more
Is he being human or only being immature
who's to say
that's why it's better just to wait
take love day to day
and let love spread its own wings
and if it wants to fly away or if it decides to stay
it won't be because of any unrealistic expectations ya'll done made
and he won't have to pray that little girl ain't awake
when he tiptoe out the door so he won't have to explain
I don't want to take that chance please don't take offense
I just don't need that kinda drama on my conscience
Ohhh ooooo

Rollin' my 67
Cadillac DeVille
Bumpin' that old Sugar Hill
Today I'm living proof
Your worst fear came true
I'm doing alright without you baby
I'm leaving all that darkness behind me
Making changes in my life
So when that sunshine finally finds me
I can stand fully in the light
Spread my wings and reach for sky
I never felt so alive
Kiss my kids goodnight
Tell 'em Daddy's alright I'm alright

Took a while but we finally made it through
Go 'head you can smile now all that darkness' behind you

Almost drowned but I survived
She held me under for 5
Years of my life
But today I'm living proof
Your worst fear came true
I'm doing alright without you baby yes I am
I'm leaving all those grudges behind me
Throwing fear out the window
So when these blessings come to find me
They will have room to breathe and grow
Let my blessings overflow and get my life under control
So my kids will know, Daddy finally let go
I finally let go

He took a bullet for me, how I'm gonna repay that man 
What if he woulda die, what I'm soppose to say to his fam 
The life I chose endanger all my family and friends

Lyfe,"It's from the heart
It's from the heart right here (yeah)
Everybody has a story to tell
Check this out though

I knew this chinese dude in Junior High
Part of my crew, everybody knew the kid
He was the talk of the school, intelligent
And well spoken, respected by teachers
All the other students kept their eyes on his sneakers
What can I say? You can tell he's cool if you talk with him
During fire drills girls would want to walk with him
He could have any chick up in his view
But there was only one girl he wanted to call boo
See its all true, found himself stressed in a dead end
The girl he was feelin was obsessed with his bestfriend
His bestfriends a playa, that's the reason he's pissed
Plus he treat her like she don't even exist
He ain't tryna hate on his man, but there was no help in it
Wrote the girl a letter told her how he felt in it
She was shocked at first of him revealing the truth
Till she realized that she was feelin him too

Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you

And you've been thinkin of me

Oh

Uh
So you know as time goes by
Things get a little bit serious
Just listen

It was strictly hip hop, now they bumpin slow jams all day
Went from holding hands, to makin out in the hallway
Their relationship, seemed like a dream come true
As time went by their friendship grew
Staring at the stars, trading secrets on the phone
When her parents were at work, she would sneak him in her room
He told her he was a virgin the day that they met

So on his birthday he got a gift he'll never forget
Females were jealous, but they still calling him cute
First day of summer school, they rocked the matching nautica suits
Happy in each others arms, can it be
They found true love, living in a fantasy
Then reality attacks, his pops couldn't see past the fact
His son was asian, but his girlfriend was black
Imagine having to choose between the one that you love or your fam
That's like cutting off your right or left hand, damn

[Chorus]

Uh huh, yeah

I know this sounds like a true story
Coulda happened to any one of us
It's crazy though right?

Now if this sounds like a true story
That's probably cause it is
And I know for a fact cause I'm that chinese kid
Mm, lookin back now, I know its more than just a crush
I'm sayin the whole expierience taught me so much
Love can overcome anything that gets in its way
That's reason I still think of shorty 'til this day
We talk now and then, she's doin her thing
We both full grown up, I think she rockin a ring
I know she's proud of me and all the things I've accomplished
She was there when I was nobody, that's being honest
Ain't no shame, I'll admit it she was there when I cried
So in return I wipe the tears from her eyes
As far as my pops, he's a little more open minded
If his son is happy, he's 100% behind it
Now this is a song I know I had to do
Cause all the stuff I went through might have happened to you

Oh

Uh, yeah

And after struggling for so long and still holding on
I figured, can't be nothing all that wrong with crying
If anybody says that they're that strong they're lying

Praying and laying hands on folks stomping and jumping around faking the holy ghost
But its a thin line between walking it and talking it
Living it and giving it or just pretending it's alright
And did they really think that they could pull the wool over your eyes lord
Did they really think that by faking they were saved that they would get the same reward
This be the realest thing I ever wrote for sure
After this a lot of folks won't like me no mo'
But after this I gotta go answer to you Lord
So I've made up my mind I'm a go to church on Sunday
And sing a song that may hurt somebody's feelings so that maybe
Thy will, will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
And hopefully they will see
How much they really be discouraging a little old sinner like me 

And Lord who they think they jiving by singing these songs full of glory
Then out in the world it's a different story
I'm running out of people to pray for me
I'm not trying to act like I'm the perfect man
But if you speak about it, you should be about it not just preach about it all day
Cause if you do you run the risk of chasing some of the most beautiful people away
And it is never my intention to discourage you rather encourage you to change your life today
This be the realest thing I ever had to say, but after this a lot of folks won't like me no mo'

Lyfe Jennings,"See I done been discriminated against
Talked about by my friends
Played a fool by women
And had a daddy with no feelings
I lived in ghettos with my momma
Used the stove to heat our water
And had to share clothes with my brothers
Three of us one bed one cover oh

And those were the happiest days of my lyfe
If it ain't rough it ain't right
Street lights are coming on
Better get home, better get home

Felt like I was worthless
Lonely scared and nervous
In a world without no purpose
Cried out to God I didn't deserve this
But he said in time I would
See it's the bad times that make the good times feel so good 

Yo I done changed dirty diapers
Cooked food with lighters
Shot so much game chicks nicknamed me sniper
Famous ghostwriter
Bank account retired
Too many zeros
Poppy still illegal
Chain look like nickels mixed with icicles
Stretching from the neck area to the genitals
I got a parrot on my shoulder that talk for me

But, somebody's gotta say it
And so I nominated myself to deliver the news
That its hard for a man to choose a lady
That already got a baby
Although his feelings may be strong
Having kids that don't belong to him
Holding on to him somehow seems wrong to him
Exposing them to a man who may one day decide
He's tired of the family life
And now he's gotta tell that little girl a goodbye lie
When he's the only Dad she's ever had in her life
I don't want to take that chance please don't take offense
It's just the thought of hurting somebody that was innocent

She got kids
And I don't know if I'm ready to give
Them the things that they need to live
'Cause if we become more than just friends what I do for her I gotta do for them kids
She got kids
And I just want to make sure this is
More than just some sexual trip
See all I want to do is prevent those kids from getting hurt again

Most men think it but they'll never say it
But what if ya'll had another baby
And he's accused of choosing favorites, and they're right
Would he be wrong for loving his own flesh and blood a little more
Is he being human or only being immature
Who's to say
That's why it's better just to wait
Take love day to day
And let love spread its own wings
And if it wants to fly away or if it decides to stay
It won't be because of any unrealistic expectations ya'll done made
And he won't have to pray that little girl ain't awake
When he tiptoe out the door so he won't have to explain
I don't want to take that chance please don't take offense
I just don't need that kinda drama on my conscience

Bumpin' that old Sugar Hill

Your worst fear came true
I'm doing alright without you baby
I'm leaving all that darkness behind me
Making changes in my life
So when that sunshine finally finds me
I can stand fully in the light
Spread my wings and reach for sky
I never felt so alive
Kiss my kids goodnight
Tell 'em Daddy's alright I'm alright

I'm leaving all those grudges behind me
Throwing fear out the window

They will have room to breathe and grow
Let my blessings overflow and get my life under control
So my kids will know, Daddy finally let go

No more teary eyes- no more crying for you baby

Ever seen a nigga diggin in the ashtray
It's a crumbling and humbling sight to see

Jimmy did his ten and D doin his twenty
Come get me, seems like it's no way out

Buy up some land or somethin', get what they owe us

Specially when all you know how to do is hustle down here
Lord, it's a miracle, I'm still breathing down here
Lord, it's a battle field down here

Lord, it's easy to get killed down here
So I keep my family near me down here
And keep my bulletproof vest on
Thank you, Lord, for making Teflon down here

'Cause the ghetto has a way of manipulating the children
Tricking them into believing that life has no meaning
Down here, down here

Lord, if you see my grandmother up there
Tell her I know she's disappointed in me
Hates to see me in and out of jail
But tell her life ain't as heavenly here as it is up there

I know it's probably lovely up there
But tell her I ain't in no rush to get up there
So I keep my pistols off safety
At all cost I gotta protect and feed these babies

Lately it's been hell
Keeping my black ass from coming up there
So I'm thankful every day and pray my enemies
Don't roll down on me and send me kicking and screaming up there

To my peoples trying to make it from down here
To my peoples who done made it up there
To my peoples trying to make it to up there
From down here

It's your boy Ghetto Superman
A.k.a Lyfe, a.k.a don't got a wife
What up Young Boy?

Everybody talkin' about livin' on Capital Hill
We livin' on the hill, ya know?
Talkin' about the front row, front row?
We livin' on death row

We grew up in the gutter
Eatin' peanut butter sandwiches with no jam
We looked up to the hustlers on the corner
Throat sore from screamin', ""Get your money man""

Had dreams of movin' on up to the big leagues
Like George, Weezy and Florence
But it's kinda hard when police is havin' you killed
Resurrected, rearrested for old bench warrants

Yeah, it's a struggle man, but we handle it the best we can
Only difference between folks that's free and folks in jail
Is some of us got caught on our way to Heaven
Takin' the shortcut through Hell

Ghetto Superman, faster than a speeding Cadillac
Able to leap tall buildings
When police is on your back, yeah
It's a bird, it's a plane, no

It's Ghetto Superman, talk slick as Republicans
Sold almost as much dope as Uncle Sam
Your friendly neighborhood Superman

If you played on my playground
You'd be used to hearin', ""Stay down, they shootin'""
Lost my daddy in a shoot out, chest all blew out
Another family ruined

Had dreams of findin' a good job
So he wouldn't have to rob niggas, I'm a stick up kid
Finally get what we deserved
Instead of havin' to take what they give us

Yeah, it's a struggle man but we takin' it
One bullet at a time
But it's kinda hard to get that monkey off your back
While that monkey still on your mind, on your mind

Lyfe Jennings,"Yeah, a lot a mysteries, a lot a histories
Too much blowin' up and showin' up, and not enough growin' up
I mean it happens, people change, yeah
A brother changes everyday but ah, most of all we changed

Sometimes makin' up is easier than breakin' up
We believe if we just fake it enough
We can trick ourselves into believing
That we're still in love

But in our hearts we know that it's inevitable
Though it's hard to let you go I know I must
Sometimes memories just ain't enough
Sometimes you out grow the ones you love

Sometimes it's none of the above
It's just a fact that people change

No one's to blame
There ain't nothing that stays the same
So we sit around an cry because neither one of us
Wants to be the first to say goodbye

Sometimes giving second chances is easier than dealing with the fact
That once the trust is gone you can never get it back
But you're holding on because you're afraid of being alone
So here you are holding on to something that's already gone

And don't act like it's the first time you've heard it in this song
'Cause your heart done told you all along
If your momma done showed you right from wrong
Nothing should hold you down this long

There's no one to blame
Nothing stays the same
So we sit around an cry because neither one of us
Wants to be the first to say goodbye, bye, my love, oh

So let me be first to say goodbye

Lyfe Jennings,"Never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I never meant to hurt you girl I was wrong
I always knew that one day you'd move on with your life
But I guess in the back of my mind
I thought you would come home one more time
I heard it through the grapevine you got a man
They say he treats you good and he makes you laugh
I'm happy for you baby and I ain't mad at you
May all your kids do good in school
And may all your dreams come true

[Chorus]
I'll always love you
I'll always care
And girl you gotta know that
I'll always love you girl
And no matter where you are
Know that my love is never far

A happy woman is worth her weight in gold
Loneliness is good for the soul
Expensive places, lovely faces come and go
But you only find your soul mate once
And if you miss your chance you'll never find it again
I can't complain I did this to myself
You needed me and I wasn't there to help
It breaks my heart to see you lovin' someone else
I would give anything I own
If I could just have my baby home

Lyfe Jennings,"Little somethin' for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corinne

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin' don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up

Keep ya head up, ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

Keep ya head up, ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
It ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

Keep ya head up, ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

And uh
To all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to kno' why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin' down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin' things don't all down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older and cold
From havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to my survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
Please, you got to keep your head up",Keep Ya Head Up,2006

Like questioning
Is there anything here worth salvaging?

Is it over?
How do we go about deciding?
Do we add up all the good times then divide them
By how many times we hurt each other
Or do we just ignore the numbers and vow right now to never ever take asunder?

Before all of this happened
But if we hold on
(And ask God for direction)
Where we went wrong
(We can make the correction if we)
Just stay strong
All of our up and downs
Fully come around
And there will be nothing that can shake us
Nothing that can break us
We will stay together

That my momma cried when my daddy died 
Maybe that was the reason I didn't get the attention 
That I was needing to touch 'cause
I reminded her of him too much 
Couldn't understand what she felt so I hated her, yeah
Til I was old enough to hate myself
And I felt like a slave down in South Carolina
Cursing the vagina that gave life to me
I couldn't see what I had the potential to be 
Til I got down on my knees and begged God
To please take control of my life today

And no matter how my friends try to console
They can never never know

So I turn my heart over completely
To you,yes Lord, I do

I was born in a hurry
Cause my momma had to be back to work at 8:30
Maybe that was the reason there was always this feeling
That she was rushing herself
She didn't even have the time to spend loving herself
Let alone,someone else
So I hated her,yea
Cause I loved her,yea
And I cried,yea

Cheese don't come I'ma go insane snatch me a purse, snatch me a chain

Out here on the block with the fiends and the moon
Squeeze on the glock tryna pop at a goon
He done stole my dough, he took my food
Project wasn't born with a silver spoon

In my mouth, in my grill wear six chain then niggas get killed
One in the grave the other in jail, nobody wins that's fo' real
Back way when I was a runny nose runnin' round up and down

I kept that product on me, it wasn't no problem homie

Lyfe Jennings,"We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell

Every Sunday dressin' up, catchin' gossip at its worst
Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the First Chapter and Second Verse
If we all God's children then what's the word of the reverend worth

Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facin' time
If we all made in God's image then that means his face is mine
Wait or it's that blasphemy, it's logical it has to be
If I don't look like my father then the way I live is bastardly

Naturally that's confusion to a young'n tryin' to follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law accordin' to politicians

Who was King James, and why did he think it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible?
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say that's where you go when you die
But how they know?

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us

I've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons, it was a blessin' not a curse
I learned that heaven and hell exist right here on Earth, word

Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads
That Hell is called Babylon
And that's where them crazy boarheads dwell
They got us thinkin' that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan

So it all sound the same to me, that's why when they say
One is right and the other is wrong, it just sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No, that ain't vain to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see

The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual and recognize
That life is full of miracles, you could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine 'cause it coincide with a grow in the time
That those who lookin' for God knowin' to go inside

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup

Livin' in mass confusion, lookin' for absolution
The gas induces psychopath, produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were sayin'
Tryin' to get to God but ended up doin' the work of Satan

Religion create division, make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew
Make the rules of faith that you condition to
And gotta to follow and God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto
Then you know it well

[Incomprehensible] after me
Preacher says, he's blasphemy
I say there's gotta be a better explanation

[Incomprehensible] you
I pray that God hears you
Take one look at your rear view
And if you see what I see
[Incomprehensible]

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

Hell, hell, hell, hell
Hell, hell, hell
We know that what we reap we sow

Ghetto mind state!
At fifteen, I was making moves
Drinking beer, shooting dice at school
When most niggas had a nine to five shit
On the block, we making nine to five grand
Each day, yeah, we got cheap yay (holla)
My niggas on lock, they called me on three way
The hood hot like a crock pot
Dope fiends cutting yards for a twenty piece of crack rock
Around my way, ain't nobody watching Matlock
We tryin' to hot wire cars and break pad locks
Turn soft to hard, drop it in Glad locks
And drive flashy cars, and get mad props
And still I won't change
Last week they caught my partner with a block of 'caine
And can't no amount of money stop the pain
They gave him thirty-five years 
His momma went insane

Coming up with no father figure
I guess that made me a harder nigga (Why?)
'Cause I don't like to ask for shit
When I came in the game with a half a brick (Yes!)
But I ain't telling lil' kids to go that route
But is on TV everyday, like they don't know that route
And lil' girls being fast
Being grown, tryin' to flirt
Leaving home wearing pants
Then change into a skirt
Huh!
I live in the ghetto 
I stay in the ghetto (Yeah!)
Run up grown, I'm spraying that metal
'Cause ain't shit sweet around my way
All I know is one thing: how to get paid (Yeah!)

But where I'm from, you gotta do that work

Why everybody tryin' to bring me down?
Because of me they respect H-town
Look, I was here when y'all wasn't around
The first week you did alright
But then that shit went down
Why everybody tryin' to bring me down?
Because of me they respect H-town
Look, I was here when y'all wasn't around

But then that shit went down!

Yo' mama - she was born to cry

I ain't proud of what I did and if I could go back in time (time)
I'd try to find another way instead of packin' nines

Its revelation and you best get right with god

Everyday is a storm or a flood, tsunamis, this shit ain't the norm
We got Katrina and Rita minds keep collapsing
With the fires and mud slides, I'm like whats happenin'
Got the kids in the school gettin' raped and molested
Under-funded, unprotected no wonder they tested
And the lowest percentage rate, 
In my city damn near the lowest in the state
You can equate that to the state funds 
That ain't breakin' down right,
Rich districts get more and poor ones less, and it just don't sound right
So I'm fittin' to pound right on the doors of my city hall
And kick them doors down, they killin' my city yall
We need to get my people back to where they should be
And since nobody else is gonna do it its gonna have to be me

And it ain't just with the drugs, 
We got more problems than just the dealers and thugs
They using lead based paint, and investments is killing us
We tell 'em to fix it up but they just ain't feelin' us
They rather kicks us out and tear it down to the ground
So they can put up a parking lot, a mall, or some condos
Condemn the whole place cause if you sell crack 
Shit the rest ain't do nothin' wrong, what the fucks up with that
They say one rotten apple can spoil the whole bunch 
But we talkin' bout some people not apples, this ain't lunch
Make me wanna punch a politician dead in his face
You say you represent my district, get your ass on the case
Development is good for the hood yeah thats what you tellin' us
But bitch you on the pay roll of the builders and developers
Fuck what you sellin' us, pipe dreams for suckers
You can take that around the corner to them other motherfuckers man

So much youth they sacrifice
Just to live in paradise
Play they tricks and tell they lies I know
Its hurting to see how they treat the poor
They have so much and still they still want more
I see my people everyday on the floor

Its time to educate the people man, free school and college
So everybody cross the border can get the same knowledge
 education leads to jobs and jobs kill poverty
And no more poverty means we makin' money obviously
Everybody makin' money everybody smilin'

Matter fact speakin' of eatin' lets feed the homeless in America
Let these motherfuckers handle their own shit
How am I gonna clean your house, and mine still dirty
How am I gonna feed your kids, and mine still thirsty
And speakin' of the kids we need to spend some more time with 'em
Cant turn 'em loose in the streets, cause they dying in 'em

Kiss my Granddad,

Lost his best-friend and nobody saying I'm sorry is gonna help him
Feel like smokin, 
gotta get away from this heart that's broken
Drop top rollin' on my way to heaven or to hell which ever's open
Then my phone rings, 
should I pick it up and go back to reality
Or should I not move bury all my sorrows and nobody will know the full moon

[Chorus]

Life is so confusing nothing makes sense at all
Why is it an enemy what am I doing wrong
Why am I hesitating, everybody's telling me to be patient
Why do I feel like time is wasting
Gotta figure out what God is saying

Your life to be
Or is it what you
Settle for

Is it 'cause they laugh at you
And talk about you too
They talked about Jesus Christ
What makes you think they won't talk about you
No need to worry
You are a star
And you are perfect just the way you are

And he was really talented
He just didn't get a chance
And now his blood is
On your hand

Maybe you should dig him up
Maybe you should not
Maybe you should stop listening to your friends
And listen to your heart

It's nice to be a star
But it's also nice to be just who you are

really want to quit but the kids got to eat ya'll
See money can't buy you power
but it can pay the water bill on time so them kids can take a shower
And I swear to GOD, if they keep on raising these gas prices
I'ma sell this Chevy and go buy me a bike
I'm a King, but my crown in a lay-way
And I'm just a day away from giving up.

Credit card company called said my bill is overdue
Told them I couldn't afford to pay them and rent too
They told me they were gonna sue me
I said if you didn't want me to use it then you shouldn't have gave it to me.

And nothing really gangsta about blowing up children
Would cry, but my eyes in a lay way and I just a day away from giving up.

That's change and change

It feels like somethings missing but I just don't know,
It's like I'm not the same man that I was, no more
And all these crazy places that I usually know,
Are just not as exciting as they were before.

I think about you constantly, it surprises me,
How I've changed,
My friends are coming down on me,
Saying a playa never changes the game.

Those fellas live in never never land
Right next to peter pan cause nobody wants to grow old,
Those fellas live in never never land
They'll never understand what it's like to be in love.
Never never land right next to peter pan cause nobody
Wants to grow old, those fellas live in never never land
They'll never understand what its like to be in love.

It feels like somethings moving inside of me,
My heart is doing back flips in spite of me,
And there's no place that I would rather be
Than with you and my kids, my family
I think about you constantly,
You gonna be my wife eventually
It don't matter what my friends say to me,
There's no changing my mind, so ya'll just pray for me.

Those fellas live in never never land
Right next to peter pan cause nobody wants to grow old,

Don't be putting my woman in it,

She is a deacon and she chills in the pulpit

You ain't got the disease but u expect the cure,

Jump in the window let your Nikes fly, hide the flakes
Guess up in the hill it was real to me
What a nigga woulda did if you steal from me
All my life around drug niggas villains who want millions
Niggas with them hoodies on with teks in the building
Mad fiends, bags and green, Gillette razors, fly neighbors
All our blazers designer jeans
That's why we live (yup)

Go broke, you go and rope you a Vick

I don't know when the toilet gonna back up

With rubber bezels who drive Exeleros with jewels

There's always
Somebody feels he can do better

You gonna call me a hater (hater)
But she's gonna call me later (later)
My advice to you player (player)
If you want your girl, need your girl

Show her some

Okay question
What ever happened to affection?
Pick up the phone young man, stop texting
Put in some work, dog, like you're a Mexican
Stop the fighting, you can be a veteran
Late night, nigga, they compare you to Letterman
She the type of woman you can't do no better than
You say you got game, but you sitting on the bench again
Now you're asking ""How?"", you must be an Indian

Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
Loving you from your head down to your cuticle

Whoa, girl

Show her some love
Show her some love
Show her some

Show her some love
Show her some

Show her some love
Show her some",Love,2010
Lyfe Jennings,"Young man, thirteen, running the streets
Living his dreams of being Nino Brown,
And a grandmother, who pleaded the 5th
A baby brother, who needed him
His little sister, believed in him
He needs to slow down
Then what happened next is something we see on a movie screen
Then his days as a nigga came to an end
Police found him in a pool of blood, clinging onto life
That boy looked up and he said/

Tell mama, I'm sorry, I was wrong (I was wrong yeah)
Tell mommy, I'm sorry, I was wrong

Young girl, sixteen, running
The same streets, living her dream of being Foxy Brown
And her teacher who, tested her
And an uncle who, molested her
Heavenly father still, blessing her
She just chose to play around
Then, the pain was just too much
Then, we are just living today and dying tomorrow
Said a prayer,
Then closed her eyes
Nodded slowly, then said wait God before I go
Tell my mama that I'm

Tell mama, I'm sorry, I was wrong (I was wrong yeah)
Tell mommy, I'm sorry, I was wrong

Somethings you can change
Somethings you can't
Somethings will never be the same
Some people cry
Some people fly
Which one will you choose in your life?
Mama you were right all along
Mama I was wrong
And another young life's gone!",Mama,2010

She's on the dance floor grindin'
Poppin' it and riding, her body got a mind of it's own
She bend over like shot gun, bullet in the chamber.
Baby girl is out of control
She going in like a scuba diver
Hot like a forest fire, sexy like you wouldn't believe
She say she wouldn't do me bad. I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad.
It would be my pleasure girl to sweat out your weave.

This is what it feels like in the spotlight.

Bumpin' bodies all night
In the spotlight.

Fellas stop talkin' when my baby enters the room
It's like somebody set a bomb off
Everybody's pointing they lied they ain't got nothing on you (you)
She move her body like a stripper
Make me wanna tip her (shawty go so damn hard)

She feeling a little tipsy one more shot of henny
And Ima' tare that booty to part

Yeah
She say she into spooning, I say I'm into forking
I wanna kill dat ass, call me lyfe come forking
Her body's acting up I wanna make a movie
Straight to dvd too nasty for tv.

And fired everybody and now she fired up.

Y'all settle down settle down settle down.

If you don't know where you are
This is statistics 101
And I'm your teacher
Lyfe Jennings in the flesh baby.

Books out.
Let's go!

Twenty five percent of all men are unstable
Twenty five percent of all men can't be faithful
Twenty percent of them don't mean what they say
And ten percent of the remaining twenty is gay

That leaves you a ten percent chance of ever finding your mate
That means you better pay attention to these words that I say
I'm gonna teach you how expose the ninety percent
And show you what to do to keep the other ten.

Rule number one
Don't be a booty call
If he don't respect you girl he gon' forget you girl

Rule number two
If he's in a relationship
If he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you

Rule number three
Tell him that you're celibate
And if he wants some of your goodies he gon' have to work for it

Rule number four
Be the person you wanna find
Don't be a nickel out here lookin' for a dime

Statistics!

Fifteen percent of all men got a complex
Fifteen percent of all men don't practice safe sex
Twenty percent of them come from homes without a father
And there's a fifty-fifty chance that you'll marry a coward

Something to think about when you're taking a shower
Something to swallow when you're drinking bottled water

I'm gonna teach you how to expose the 90 percent
And show you what to do to keep the other 10

Twenty five percent of all men are unstable
Twenty five percent of all men can't be faithful
Twenty percent of them don't mean what they say
And ten percent of the remaining twenty is gay

Be patient! he's waiting!
You don't gotta settle for that
Leave what is past alone!
Get you a backbone!
Stop being (sorry for) yourself!

Have you no checklist?
It's gonna take patience
Time is still wastin'

Hey

Don't be a booty call (don't be)
If he don't respect you girl he gon' forget you girl

If he's in a relationship (relationship)
If he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you

Tell him that you're celibate
And if he wants some of your goodies he gon' have to work for it.

Lyfe Jennings,"Sitting here thinking about
All the innocent people I done hurt in my past
Relationships, never felt the slightest bit bad
Until it happened to me
It's funny how we're so quick to laugh
When it's someone else
But then when it happens to us
The joke is never as funny as we all thought it was
Before we felt the same thing

And it's true that it's no fun
When the rabbits got the gun
And you're in love with the one that hurts you most
They say karma is a bitch
And I say I agree with it
Cause this whole experience has let me know

That breaking a woman's heart is like throwing a boomerang
It will come right back to you again
So remember that when it is happening to you
Don't cry when it gets hard
Because you threw a boomerang
And it came right back to you again
So remember that when it's happening to you

Used to play a lotta games with no conscious
Couple different lovers at once with no problem
Loved the way it felt to have everyone wanting me
Now I'm sitting here tryin to be strong but I'm hurting
And the sad part of it all is I deserve this
This was meant to teach me a lesson
It's working perfectly

Cause it's true that it's no fun
When the rabbits got the gun
And you're in love with the one that hurt you most
And they say karma is a bitch
And I say I agree with it
Cause this whole experience has let me know

That breaking a woman's heart is like throwing a boomerang
It will come right back to you again
So remember that when it is happening to you
Don't cry when it gets hard
Because you threw a boomerang
And it came right back to you again
So remember that when it's happening to you

Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn
And heaven won't help you hide if you break her heart
Try ya best to be honest
Try to keep every promise
Cause in the end if it doesn't work out
She won't wanna be friends
And she gone want revenge

Don't break a woman's heart, it's like throwing a boomerang
It will come right back to you again
So remember that when it is happening to you
Don't cry when it gets hard
Because you threw a boomerang

So that means that you have to learn her every day
You know? It's like going back to college, man
Let me show you what I've learned about my wife

She's got the cutest little laugh
Bottom lip twitches when she's mad
Favorite position from the back
Loves that musician, Robin Thicke
She gets her temper from her dad
Likes to say we just couldn't have
I know her like the back of my hand
So whatever she wants she can have

I treat her like college
I'm trying to get knowledge
Learning your girl is a science
Treat her like college
Go to class every day
So if you pay attention you can learn her ways
Like college, study in abroad
Learning all of her, man, ain't hard
Treat her like college
And you can gone on back
You won't need a grant for that

She likes long walks through the park
A little afraid of the dark
Her ex-boyfriend broke her heart
Her self esteem is ripped apart
She likes to gaze up at the stars
Believe there's aliens on Mars
Her favorite color is pink and orange
Her favorite food is fish and corn

I treat her like college
I'm trying to get knowledge
Learning your girl is a science
Treat her like college

Learning all of her, man, ain't hard
Treat her like college

I would take all the water out the sea to wash your hair
I would take all the birds out of the trees to sing you to sleep
'Cause I care
I would burn all the money in the world to keep you warm
And I would bring Michael Jackson back to life to moonwalk to your favorite song, baby
This is what I'd do, the impossible, do the impossible
This is what I'd do, the impossible, the illogical, we're unstoppable

And if forgiving you is weak
Then I guess that I'm weak
Or maybe I'm just growing becoming better at showing you
It's okay to make mistakes as long as
You admit you were wrong

Youre tryin' to catch your breath now
Youre the best now
And it feels so damn good
This is what you've been waiting on
All the sacrifice and then all the pain is finally paying off
Its much more than you ever thought
Youre a king for a day, youre a king for day
Lets go

Turn up the lights in this place

Losers only get to lose
Everybody loves a winner
It makes us feel like were winners too
Everybody loves a winner

Everybody loves a winner
A winner, a winner

This is history now
Youre officially living the life that everybody dreams now
And finally youre so proud
You can breathe now and it feels so damn good
Its like you work your whole life
Giving up everything in exchange for this one night
But this isn't just one night
Its the one night we made it, the one night we waited for

Turn up the lights in this place

Lyfe Jennings,"From a brick to a stone, does a feign have a soul? (Oh, Oh)
As a kid need a goal, the powder's made of gold (Oh, Oh, Oh)

Getting blowed
Thinkin' I'm so glad that I can rap cause I can't move no dope
But I do know, a few niggas that did and a few niggas that still
And a few niggas that's through, are the few niggas that's dead

So fuck a 9 to 5, they clockin' and tryna to survive
Cop a brick and supply cause nobody offerin' jobs
Bricks build, buildings build, houses build neighborhoods
Better ripped than turned into a baller or a Davis shirt
Understated to say it hurts, I was optimistic
Tryna see my gang and whippin' made me wish that I was flippin'
This college went out of his dollar pension
Cause after 4 or 5 you don't have nothing but college tickets

But them niggas tryna hold my head and work this out (tryna work this out)
Countin' numbers up in my head tryna build this house (tryna build this house)
Mama told me if I made my bed then I gotta lay down
But I never seem to keep these words all up out my mouth

Bricks bricks it's all them niggas talkin' bout
Bricks bricks it's all them niggas talkin' bout
Bricks bricks it's all them niggas thinkin' bout
Little niggas on the scene, ain't gotta dream it now

Studio getting blowed
Thinkin' I'm so glad that I can rap cause I can't move no dope
But I do know, a few niggas that did and a few niggas that still
And a few niggas that's through, are the few niggas that's dead

Look, little niggas will shoot you, they got nothing to say
Cause local celebrities only bout a brick away
If you still whip em he getting those from whippin' yay
And you got no paper, you been so patient, come get some weight
Sneaker boxes, you can see your progress
And you weekend shoppin', show people no people problem
I can see the problem, you nigga don't have no conscience
Can't shoot, can't dribble, can't rap
Young nigga don't have no options

From a brick, to a stone, tryna feed for my homie
From the powder, turn to power, and the power turn to dough
Turning head with yo whip, Is it worth what you did?
If a brick is a brick from a brick you can build
From a brick to a stone, got a feign for a homie
Turn 2 into 4, turn reef to a home
Turn the powder, into power, and the power turn to hoes
If a brick is a brick, to a brick you can throw
Bricks
(It's only one way out)

Nine years old, feds lookin' for my moms
10 or 11, held my first gun
First time I heard bricks, I was thinking construction
Until my 'migo plug from Mexicó gave me my introduction (now)
16, gettin' them bricks for the 16
Course I'm rappin' bitch but now I'm wrappin' bricks for 16
I was 17 ridin in that Lexus on 20's
18 and 19 payin nothing over 20
And a thousand 8 grams divided by 4 is 2-52
If you know what that mean you noticed it now
And if you don't, learn how to divide nigga
I'm talkin' bricks, no jump shots
I'm talkin' work, no punch clocks!

But them niggas tryna hold my head and work this out
Countin' numbers up in my head tryna build this house
Mama told me if I made my bed then I gotta lay down
But I never seem to keep these words all up out my mouth

But she don't know how that would make her feel
To see your little girl and look her in her eyes
And know that she's the reason why she cries
That would turn her up inside
And if you think about, it don't make sense, fucking up that young girl's life

Call you in the late night
Trade love for one night
Two pills and a red wine
Tough love but I know I don't mind
The words that you don't say
No love when you hold me
No calling the next day
It's a one way, no

And now the sun is up, I'm coming down
(Nobody nowhere, I'm nobody nowhere)
We just blow it up, blow it out

It glides as softly as a cloud
Is there a chance the track could bend?
Not on your life, my Hindu friend

What about us brain-dead slobs?
You'll be given cushy jobs
Were you sent here by the Devil?
No, good sir, I'm on the level

The ring came off my pudding can
Take my pen knife, my good man
I swear it's Springfield's only choice
Throw up your hands and raise your voice

And the next she'll be tired of you

Who's doing all he can
Not to give in to the city

Lyle Lovett,"They all sat around in a circle 
They were all laughing and all telling lies 
Then the tall one he bumped in a dollar 
He said boys I've got nothing to hide 
Now if the King and the Queen stood together 
Then the ace he would not be to blame 
And if the cards were all laid on the table 
Then love could be more than a game 

And if the stars didn't shine on the water 
Then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand 
And if I were the man you wanted 
I would not be the man that I am 

And I have seen my share of long nights 
And I have told my share of lies 
And I have run into the darkness 
When I saw the look in your eyes 
But if the night didn't lie in the darkness 
Then the daylight would be hard to find 
And if the truth didn't turn to a weakness 
I would have never have spoken my mind 

And if the stars didn't shine on the water 
Then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand 
And if I were the man you wanted 
Then I would not be the man that I am 

So if you're going out to Carolina 
Then don't linger in New Mexico 
And if you think of the one there behind you 
Then you might not feel so alone

Then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand

I would not be the man that I am",If I Were the Man You Wanted,1987

They'll take away by right what's yours
And make you martyrs of your own cause
When they don't know what cause it's for

And all deserted
Stand alerted
They'll love you when you're all alone
But you find a red rose in the morning light
You wait the night and find it gone

It's one of those days

Which way does that old pony run 

Which way does that old pony run 
Which way does that old pony run 
And how much is that saddle 
And a straight shooting gun 
Which way does that old pony run 

So this good life you know I must leave 
Your new car 
And your color TV 
But what's riches to you 
Just ain't riches to me 
And if you're staying out here 
Then I'm headed back east 

Which way does that old pony run 
Which way does that old pony run 
And how much is that saddle 
And a straight shooting gun 
Which way does that old pony run",Which Way Does That Old Pony Run,1989
Lyle Lovett,"She hates my mama
She hates my daddy too
She loves to tell me
She hates the things I do
She loves to lie beside me
Almost every night
She's no lady she's my wife

The preacher asked her
And she said I do
The preacher asked me
And she said yes he does too
And the preacher said
I pronounce you 99 to life
Son she's no lady she's your wife

And I can't remember
How I met her
Seems like she's always just been hanging here off my right arm
And I can't remember
How I ever
Thought that I just couldn't live without a woman's charm

And even though
She loves the smell of French perfume
And even though
She walks around in high-heel shoes
All I know
Is I'm the one who pays her price
Man she's no lady she's my wife

And I can't remember
How I met her
Seems like she's always just been hanging here off my right arm
And I can't remember
How I ever
Thought that I just couldn't live without a woman's charm

Yea she hates my mama
She hates my daddy too
She loves to tell me
She hates the things I do
She loves to lie beside me
Almost every night
She's no lady she's my wife",She's No Lady,1990
Lyle Lovett,"I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
I didn't get to sleep that night 'till the morning came around
I set out runnin' but I take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

I ran into the devil and he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills
I set out runnin' but I take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air
I set out runnin' but I take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

I got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my hearts delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

I got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child but it don't look like me
I set out runnin' but I take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

I got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child but it don't look like me
I set out runnin' but I take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight",Friend of the Devil,1991
