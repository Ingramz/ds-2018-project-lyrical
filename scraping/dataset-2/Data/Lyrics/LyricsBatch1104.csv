The Clancy Brothers,"The minstrel boy to the war is gone
In the ranks of death you'll find him
His father's sword he hath girded on
And his wild harp slung behind him
""Land of Song!"" cried the warrior bard
(Should) ""Tho' all the world betrays thee
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard
One faithful harp shall praise thee!""
The Minstrel fell! But the foreman's steel
Could not bring that proud soul under
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again
For he tore its chords asunder
And said ""No chains shall sully thee
Thou soul of love and brav'ry!
Thy songs were made for the pure and free
They shall never sound in slavery!",The Minstrel Boy,1994
The Clancy Brothers,"I've been a moonshiner for many a year 
And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
I'll go to some hollow and I'll set up my still
And I'll make you a gallon for a ten shilling bill

[Chorus:]

I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, 
I'm a long way from home
And if you don't like me 
You can leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry 
And I'll drink when I'm dry
And if moonshine don't kill me 
I'll live till I die

I'll go to some hollow in this country
Ten gallons of wash and I'll go on a spree
No woman to follow and the world is all mine
I love none so well as I love the moonshine

Moonshine dear moonshine oh how I love thee
You killed my poor father but dare you kill me
Bless all moonshiners and bless all moonshine
For their breath smells as sweet as the dew on the vine",The Moonshiner,1994
The Clancy Brothers,"Of all the money that e'er I spent
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that ever I did
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
If I had money enough to spend
And leisure to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in the town
That sorely has my heart beguiled

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be with you all",The Parting Glass,1994
The Clancy Brothers,"The Real Old Mountain Dew
Beside a hill there is a still,
Where the smoke runs up to the sky;
You ean always tell by the whiff and the smell
That the liquor boys are nigh.
Refrain:
 That the liquor boys are nigh,
 That the liquor boys are nigh,
 You ean always tell by the whiff and the smell,
 That the liquor boys are nigh.
This mountain dew is made from grain,
And mixed with water pure,
And the alcohol that it eontains
Will all your troubles cure.
Refrain:
 Will all your troubles cure,
 Will all your troubles cure,
 And the alcohol that it contains
 Will all your troubles eure.
AII learned men who use the pen
Have writ its praises high;
It fills the air with perfume rare
Distilled with wheat and rye.
Refrain:
 Distilled with wheat and rye,
 Distilled with wheat and rye,
 It fills the air with perfume rare
 Distilled with wheat and rye.
Away with pills,'twill cure the ills
Of Pagan, Christian and Jew,
Off with your coat and wet your throat
With the real old mountain dew.
Refrain:
 With the real old mountain dew,
 With the real old mountain dew,
 Off with your coat and wet your throat
 With the real old mountain dew.
So before we roll won't you have another bowl
Of the good old mountain dew?
Of the good old mountain dew?
Of the good old mountain dew?
Refrain:
 Of the good old mountain dew?
 Of the good old mountain dew?
 So before we roll won't you have another bowl
 Of the good old mountain dew?
 WE DO",The Real Old Mountain Dew,1994
The Clancy Brothers,"I'll sing you a song of peace and love,
Whack fol the diddle all the di do day.
To the land that reigns all lands above.
Whack fol the diddle all the di do day.
May peace and plenty be her share
Who kept our homes from want and care,
God bless Mother England is our prayer.

Whack fol the diddle all the di do day.
Whack fol the diddle all the di do day.
So we say, Hip Hooray!
Come and listen while we pray.
Whack fol the diddle all the di do day.

When we were savage, fierce and wild
She came like a mother to her child.
She gently raised us from the slime
Kept our hands from hellish crime,
And sent us to Heaven in her own good time.
Now our fathers oft were very bad boys.
Guns and pikes are dangerous toys.
From Bearna Baol to Bunker Hill
They made poor England weep her fill,
But ould Brittania loves us still!
Now Irishmen, forget the past!
And think of the time that's coming fast.
When we shall all be civilized,
Neat and clean and well-advised.
And won't Mother England be surprised?",Whack Fol the Diddle,1994
The Clancy Brothers,"I sat within the valley green, I sat me with my true love
My sad heart strove the two between, the old love and the new love
The old for her, the new that made me think on Ireland dearly
While soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden barley 

'Twas hard the woeful words to frame to break the ties that bound us
But harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us
And so I said, ""The mountain glen I'll seek at morning early
And join the bold united men, while soft winds shake the barley"" 

While sad I kissed away her tears, my fond arms round her flinging
The foeman's shot burst on our ears from out the wildwood ringing
A bullet pierced my true love's side in life's young spring so early
And on my breast in blood she died while soft winds shook the barley 

But blood for blood without remorse I've taken at Oulart Hollow
And laid my true love's clay cold corpse where I full soon may follow
As round her grave I wander drear, noon, night and morning early
With breaking heart when e'er I hear the wind that shakes the barley",The Wind That Shakes the Barley,1994
The Clancy Brothers,"Oh, me name is Dick Darby, I'm a cobbler
I served my time at ould camp
Some call me an old agitator
But now I'm resolved to repent

With me ing-twing of an ing-thing of an i-doe
With me ing-twing of an ing-thing of an i-day
With me roo-boo-boo roo-boo-boo randy
And me lab stone keeps beating away

Now, my father was hung for sheep stealing
My mother was burned for a witch
My sister's a dandy house-keeper
And I'm a mechanical switch

It's forty long years I have traveled
All by the contents of me pack
Me hammers, me awls and me pinchers
I carry them all on me back

Oh, my wife she is humpy, she's lumpy
Me wife she's the devil, she's cracked
And no matter what I may do with her
Her tongue, it goes clickety-clack

It was early one fine summer's morning
A little before it was day
I dipped her three times in the river
And carelessly bade her ""Good day""",The Cobbler,1994
The Clancy Brothers,"One pleasant evening in the month of June
As I was sitting with my glass and spoon
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was ""The Jug Of Punch""

What more diversion can a man desire
Than to sit him down by a snug turf fire?
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And on the table a jug of punch

Let the doctors come with all their art
They'll make no impression upon my heart
Even the cripple forgets his hunch
When he's snuggled 'side a jug of punch

And if I get drunk, well the money's me own
And them that don't like me, they can leave me alone
I'll tune me fiddle and I'll rosin me bow
And I'll be welcome wherever I go",The Jug of Punch [Live],1995
The Clancy Brothers,"Now brave boys, we're on the march

The Clancy Brothers,"Tis of a brave young highwayman this story I will tell
His name was Willie Brennan and in Ireland he did dwell
It was on the Kilwood Mountain he commenced his wild career
And many a wealthy nobleman before him shook with fear
It was Brennan on the moor, Brennan on the moor
Bold, brave and undaunted was young Brennan on the moor
One day upon the highway as young Willie he went down
He met the mayor of Cashiell a mile outside of town
The mayor he knew his features and he said, Young man, said he
Your name is Willie Brennan, you must come along with me
Now Brennan's wife had gone to town provisions for to buy
And when she saw her Willie she commenced to weep and cry
Said, Hand to me that tenpenny, as soon as Willie spoke
She handed him a blunderbuss from underneath her cloak
Now with this loaded blunderbuss - the truth I will unfold -
He made the mayor to tremble and he robbed him of his gold
One hundred pounds was offered for his apprehension there
So he, with horse and saddle to the mountains did repair
Now Brennan being an outlaw upon the mountains high
With cavalry and infantry to take him they did try
He laughed at them with scorn until at last 'twas said
By a false-hearted woman he was cruelly betrayed
They hanged Brennan at the crossroads, in chains he hung and dried
But still they say that, in the night, some do see him ride
They see him with his blunderbuss, all in the midnight chill
Along, along the King's highway rides Willie Brennan still!",Brennan on the Moor,1996
The Clancy Brothers,"Oh list to the lay of a poor Irish harper
And scorn not the strains of his old, withered hands
But remember his fingers, they once could move sharper
To raise up the memory of his dear native land

At a fair or a wake, I could twist my shillelagh
Or trip through a jig with my brogues bound with straw
And all the pretty colleens around me assembled
Loved their bold Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh

Oh, how I long to muse on the days of my boyhood
But four score and three years have flitted since then
But they bring sweet reflections, as every young joy should
For, the merry hearted boys makes the best of old men

And when sergeant death, in his cold arms shall embrace me
And lull me to sleep with sweet Erin go bragh
By the side of my Kathleen, my young wife then place me
Then forget Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh",The Bard of Armagh,1996
The Clancy Brothers,"I Know My Love
I know my love by his way of walking,
And I know my love by his way of talking
And I know my love by his suit of blue
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?
Cho: And still she cried:""I love him the best
But a troubled mind, sure, can get no rest.""
And still she cried, ""Bonny boys are few,
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?""
There is a dance house in Maradyke
Where my true love goes every night
And takes a strange one upon his knee
And don't you know, now, that vexes me.
I know my love is an arrant rover
And he'll go roaming the wide world over
In foreign parts he may chance to stray
Where all the girls are so bright and gay,
If my love knew I could wash and wring
If my love knew I could weave and spin
I'd make a dress all of the finest kind
But the want of money leaves me behind.

The Clancy Brothers,"[Chorus]
I'll tell me Ma when I go home, 
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair, they stole my comb 
But that's all right till I get home
 
She is handsome, she is pretty, she is the belle of Belfast City
She is a-courtin' one, two, three, please won't you tell me who is she?
Albert Mooney says he loves her, all the boys are fightin' for her
They knock on the door, they ring on the bell, say ""Oh my true love are you well?""
Out she comes as white as snow, rings on her fingers, bells on her toes
Oul Johnny Murray says she'll die if she doesn't get the fellow with the rovin' eye

[Chorus]

Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high and the snow come tumblin' from the sky
She's as nice as apple pie and she'll get her own lad bye and bye
When she gets a lad of her own she won't tell her Ma when she gets home
Let them all come as they will, it's Albert Mooney she loves still

[Chorus]",I'll Tell My Ma,1996
The Clancy Brothers,"While in  the merry month of May from me home I started,
Left the girls of Tuam so sad and broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born,
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;
Bought a pair of brogues rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

Well the boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in,
With a load ""hurray !"" joined in the affray.
We quitely cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down
the rocky road and all the way to Dublin,
Whack follol de rah !",Rocky Road to Dublin,1997

Who march with faces drawn,
From farmstead and from fishers' cot, 
Along the banks of Ban;
They come with vengeance in their eyes. 
Too late! Too late are they,
For young Roddy McCorley goes to die 
On the bridge of Toome today.

Up the narrow street he stepped, 
So smiling, proud and young.
About the hemp-rope on his neck, 
The golden ringlets clung;
There's ne'er a tear in his blue eyes, 
Fearless and brave are they,
As young Roddy McCorley goes to die 
On the bridge of Toome today.

When last this narrow street he trod, 
His shining pike in hand
Behind him marched, in grim array, 
A earnest stalwart band.
To Antrim town! To Antrim town, 
He led them to the fray,
But young Roddy McCorley goes to die 
On the bridge of Toome today.

More bravely died in fray

The Clancy Brothers,"There was a wild colonial boy, Jack Duggan was his name
He was born and raised in Ireland in a place called Castlemaine
He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
And dearly did his parents love the wild colonial boy

At the early age of sixteen years, he left his native home
And to Australia's sunny shore he was inclined to roam
He robbed the rich, he helped the poor, he shot James McAvoy
A terror to Australia was the wild colonial boy

One morning on the prairie as Jack he rode along
A listening to the mockingbird a singing a cheerful song
Out stepped a band of troopers, Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy
They all set out to capture him, the wild colonial boy

""Surrender now Jack Duggan for you see we're three to one
Surrender in the Queen's high name for you're a plundering son""
Jack pulled two pistols from his belt and he proudly waved them high
""I'll fight, but not surrender,"" said the wild colonial boy

He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground
And turning 'round to Davis, he received a fatal wound

The Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem,"BOULAVOGUE
(P.J.McCall)
At Boulavogue, as the sun was setting
O'er bright May meadows of Shelmalier,
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbors from far and near.
Then Father Murphy, from old Kilcormack,
Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry;
""Arm! Arm!"" he cried, ""for I've come to lead you,
For Ireland's freedom we fight or die.""
He led us on 'gainst the coming soldiers,
The cowardly Yeomen we put to flight;
'Twas at the Harrow the boys of Wexford
Showed Bookey's regiment how men could fight.
Look out for hirelings, King George of England,
Search every kingdom where breathes a slave,
For Father Murphy of the County Wexford
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
We took Camolin and Enniscorthy,
And Wexford storming drove out our foes;
'Twas at Slieve Coillte our pikes were reeking
With the crimson stream of the beaten yeos.
At Tubberneering and Ballyellis
Full many a Hessian lay in his gore;
Ah, Father Murphy, had aid come over,
The green flag floated from shore to shore!
At Vinegar Hill, o'er the pleasant Slaney,
Our heroes vainly stood back to back,
And the Yeos at Tullow took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
God grant you glory, brave Father Murphy,
And open Heaven to all your men;
The cause that called you may call tomorrow
In another fight for the green again.

The Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem,"Tis of a brave young highwayman this story I will tell
His name was Willie Brennan and in Ireland he did dwell
It was on the Kilwood Mountain he commenced his wild career
And many a wealthy nobleman before him shook with fear
It was Brennan on the moor, Brennan on the moor
Bold, brave and undaunted was young Brennan on the moor
One day upon the highway as young Willie he went down
He met the mayor of Cashiell a mile outside of town
The mayor he knew his features and he said, Young man, said he
Your name is Willie Brennan, you must come along with me
Now Brennan's wife had gone to town provisions for to buy
And when she saw her Willie she commenced to weep and cry
Said, Hand to me that tenpenny, as soon as Willie spoke
She handed him a blunderbuss from underneath her cloak
Now with this loaded blunderbuss - the truth I will unfold -
He made the mayor to tremble and he robbed him of his gold
One hundred pounds was offered for his apprehension there
So he, with horse and saddle to the mountains did repair
Now Brennan being an outlaw upon the mountains high
With cavalry and infantry to take him they did try
He laughed at them with scorn until at last 'twas said
By a false-hearted woman he was cruelly betrayed
They hanged Brennan at the crossroads, in chains he hung and dried
But still they say that, in the night, some do see him ride
They see him with his blunderbuss, all in the midnight chill
Along, along the King's highway rides Willie Brennan still!",Brennan on the Moor,1999
The Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem,"Tim Finnegan lived in watling street
A gentle Irishman, mighty odd
He'd a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet
To rise in the world, he carried a hod

With love for the liquor poor Tim was born
To help him on with his work each day
He'd a drop of the craythur every morn'

At Finnegan's wake

One morning Tim got rather full
His head felt heavy which made him shake
Fell from a ladder and he broke his skull
They carried him home, his corpse to wake

Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
And laid him out upon the bed
A gallon of whiskey at his feet
And a bottle of porter at his head

Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch

Then Maggie O'Connor took up the job
""Arrah"", biddy says, she ye're wrong, I'm sure
Biddy then gave her a belt on the gob
And left her sprawling on the floor

Who march with faces drawn,
From farmstead and from fishers' cot, 
Along the banks of Ban;
They come with vengeance in their eyes. 
Too late! Too late are they,

On the bridge of Toome today.

So smiling, proud and young.
About the hemp-rope on his neck, 
The golden ringlets clung;

As young Roddy McCorley goes to die 
On the bridge of Toome today.

His shining pike in hand
Behind him marched, in grim array,

The Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem,"It was down the glen one Easter morn, to a city fair rode I
There Ireland's lines of marching men, in squadron passed me by
No pipes did hum or no battle drum did sound its dread tattoo
But, the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell, rang out in the Foggy Dew

Right proudly high over Dublin town, they hung out the flag of war
For, 'twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud El Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath, strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's sons with their long range guns, sailed in by the Foggy Dew

'Twas England bade our wild geese go that small nations might be free
But, their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves on the fringe of the grey North Sea
Oh, had they died by Pearse's side, or fought with Valera true
Their graves we'd keep where the Fenians sleep, 'neath the hills of the Foggy Dew

The bravest fell and the sullen bell rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Easter tide in the springing of the year
And the world did gaze in deep amaze at those fearless men and true
Who bore the fight that freedom's light might shine through the Foggy Dew",The Foggy Dew,2002

In the ranks of death you'll find him;
His father's sword he hath girded on,
And his wild harp slung behind him;

""Land of Song!"" cried the warrior bard,
(Should) ""Tho' all the world betrays thee,
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard,
One faithful harp shall praise thee!""

The Minstrel fell! But the foeman's steel
Could not bring that proud soul under;
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again,
For he tore its chords asunder;

And said ""No chains shall sully thee,
Thou soul of love and brav'ry!
Thy songs were made for the pure and free
They shall never sound in slavery!

That sorely has my heart beguiled

The Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem,"In the year of our Lord, eighteen hundred and six,
We set sail from the Coal Quay of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the grand City Hall in New York
We'd an elegant craft, it was rigged 'fore and aft
And how the trade winds drove her
She had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts
And they called her the Irish Rover

There was Barney Magee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a chap from Westmeath named Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper on the Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrells of bone
We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
We had four million barrells of stone
We had five million hogs and six million dogs
And seven million barrells of porter
We had eight million sides of old blind horses' hides
In the hold of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And our ship lost her way in a fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
'Twas myself and the captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock, oh, Lord what a shock
And nearly tumbled over
Turned nine times around then the poor old dog was drowned

And a couple of two or three went on the spree one day
We had a bob or two, which we knew how to blew
And the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay
We visited McCann's, Maclaman's, Humpty Dan's
We then went into Swan's, our stomachs for to pack
We ordered out a feed, which indeed, we did need
And we finished it with speed, but we still felt slack

Johnny McEldoo turned red, white and blue
As a plate of Irish stew he soon put out of sight
He shouted out ""Encore!"" with a roar for some more
That he'd never felt before such a keen appetite
We ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, what a cram
But him, we couldn't ram, though we tried our level best
For everything we brought, cold or hot, mattered not
It went down him like a shot and he still stood the test

He swallowed tripe and lard by the yard, we got scarred
We thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill
We told him to give o'er, but he swore he could lower
Twice as much again and more before he had his fill
He nearly supped a trough full of broth says McGragh
""He'll devour the tablecloth if you don't hold him in""
When the waiter brought the charge, McEldoo felt so large
He began to shout and barge and his blood went on fire

He began to curse and swear, tear his hair in despair
To finish the affair, called the shop man a liar

Tattered all his clothes, broke his nose, I suppose
He would have killed him with a few blows in no time at all

If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight

And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted

Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather

Got so hot we had to cool it

I can speak to mountains, they will be moved.
I can speak to dreams, they will come true.
I can tell my troubles, to get away.
God gave me the power, to make my day.

I'm just steady restin', in my Father's Hand.
I'm blessed when I come, and when i go.
Everyday I'm living, living in the overflow.

Shining bright in the east, beyond them far
And to, to the earth, it gave great light, whoo whoo
So it, so it, so it, so it continued both day and night, woo

You can compromise my passion, call me fake and call me fashion, you can write away
You can rationalize a purchase with my money and say it's worth it
You can tear me up or tie me down and kick me on the ground

To make up your mind
They're out in the lot
And she's going down on him

So roll your leg over
Take the bow not the stern
And pray before you begin
'Cause this date's not your mate
And it's not where you're going
But more like where they've been

Slip a beer in your coat
Keep your arms to your side
'Cause going home,
That's a pretty good drive
Keep it under the dash
And watch who you pass

Down to where the fields were green

We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride

Then I got Mary Pregnant and man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse and the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress

We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride

But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all those things that seemed so important
Well they just vanished in the air
And I act like I don't remember, Mary acts like she don't care
And I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down by the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close to feel each breath she'd take
Those memories come back to haunt me, well they haunt me like a curse

Or is it something worse

With a card up his sleeve, what would he achieve?

In the Belmont chair playing violins

As he lays down the king of spades

There's something wrong here, he thinks
The gambler is seized and forced to his knees
And shot dead

He only wanted more time
Away from the darkest door
But his luck it gave in
As the dawn light crept in
And he lay on the floor

From the Hundred Year War to the Crimea
With a lance and a musket and a Roman spear
To all of the men who have stood with no fear
In the service of the King

Did not forsake your lover

Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag
They wore the black one
But after they died it was Mockingbird Hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My senorita's rose was nipped in the bud

Spanish bombs, yo te quierro y finito
Yo te querda, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quierro y finito
Yo te querda, oh mi corazón

The hillsides ring with ""Free the people""
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39?
With trenches full of poets
The ragged army, fixin' bayonets to fight the other line
Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearing music from another time
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
I'm flying in on a DC 10 tonight

No, not at all

Did you lie when you spoke to me

Did you stand by me
No, not at all

But it don't pay
I need new clothes
I need somewhere to stay

But without your love I won't make it through

Harlem slum to penthouse block
On every door I already knocked
There wasn't anybody that I didn't leave alone
Somebody lying under every stone
Everything that a man could need
In a bag down by my knee

Cheaper than booze down in the Bowery
Lightning strike! Old New York!
Everything's light! Strike!

Hey ho such a night
I'll see y'all when the lightning strike
A Polaroid caught in the act
You're married too and that's a fact
But I won't peek and I won't squeak

I saw an army of rebels, dancing on air
I dreamed as I slept, I could see the campfires,
A song of the battle, that was born in the flames,
And the rebels were waltzing on air.

I danced with a girl to the tune of a waltz
That was written to be danced on the battlefield
I danced to the tune of a voice of a girl
A voice that called ""Stand till we fall
We stand till all the boys fall.""

As we danced came the news that the war was not won
5 armies were coming, with carrige and gun
Through the heart of the camp
Swept the news from the front
A cloud crossed the moon, a child cried for food
We knew the war could not be won.

So we danced with a rifle, to the rhythm of the gun
In a glade through the trees I saw my only one
Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun
The soldiers were dying, there was tune to the sighing.
The song was an old rebel one.

As the smoke of our hopes rose high from the field
My eyes played tricks through the moon and the trees
I slept as I dreamed I saw the army rise
A voice began to call, stand till you fall

By chance or escaping from misery
By suddenness or in answer to pain

See the bad go down again

And the clouds are high in Spanish mountains
And a Ford roars through the night full of rain

But he loads his gun again

Knuckles grip the wheel in fear to let it go

Like a wave on the rocks, the lessons crash down on me

So take me down to the river like a little child
And take my hand and tell me it's okay to be wild

I never knew myself until I ripped off my disguise

I hope it finds you well
I hope you don't hurt like you did
'Cause I'd just blame myself

And I know it's for me that I'm out on these streets
Bleeding nightly for these people I meet
But it's you who I long for when I cannot sleep
It's enough, it could drive me to drink

And I, I am almost nowhere
And I'm getting there fast
You, you're the hope in my cold stare
You're the drink in my hand

When I picked up you broke into tears
You said you weren't busy enough
I still don't know why you need me
And my broken down love

With each second that ticks your voice rings in my ears
And memories flood back from all of our years
And I tell you it's okay, there's nothing to fear
And I secretly hope I am right

And I, I am almost nowhere
And I'm getting there fast
But you, you're the hope in my cold stare
You're the drink in my hand

You're the drink in my hand
You're the drink in my hand
You're the drink in my hand
You're the drink in my hand
You're the drink in my hand

I left you last week and you told me
""Go on and follow your dreams ""
I think about that lately
But still I don't know what it means

'Cause you're what I dream of when I awake alone
As I drift away, as we talk on the phone
You're all I want and that's all that I know
And I still just can't wait to get home

And I, I am almost nowhere
And I'm getting there fast
And you, you're the hope in my cold stare

To lead this foolish flock of sheep astray
And the clouds make fearful noises and slowly turn black and shake

And no one left to love you but the pain

Speak true words into their lives?
Will I hold them close and tell them why
The life they led was sacrifice?

And how it hurts me to give up
It hurts me to give up

A long life line that's been cut short
By the road, the time, the battle scars

Where the sunsets over the water
Someone save me from these preachers sons
Save me from their daughters

Why don't we ever tell the truth

The Clerkenwell Kid,"Must have left my house at eight, because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came

Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain

The Click,"t's the first of the month and my beeper is blowing
I can't stop cause my cash is flowing
I'm baggin' em' up bustin' em' down quickly
Cause I got five brothers waitin' on me at Thrifty's
I'm in the other bucket on the late night pursuit
With two kis and and forty ounce of brew
I ain't trippin' cause my tags are legit
Ah shit, now them tats is on my tip
So I drops my brew, what the fuck am I to do (Pass the street to shake that fool)
So I smashed on my pedal and rolled down Golden Gate
And threw these motherfuckin' kis in the lake

[Verse 2]
Guess who comes through, it's a fool
I gat tapped that ass, red dog, and boo
We kicks it on the Hill everyday
Slangin' rocks with glocks now we gots to get paid
The street life's how I'm livin' and the po-po tryin' to get me
But they can't catch up to a motherfuckin' philly
That's how I'm livin' in the day
But when it comes night I packs a forty and an AK
Waitin' for some punk to jump so I can start to pop
And put some motherfuckin' holes in his drop
The watch his ass grasp, then I laugh
He shouldn't have last so I taxed his punk ass

I'm really down for my pops and the hardcore stories
Mandatory is my money, ya best believe
Because I'm rollin' through ya town with gold tone D's
Lookin' clean with my mug on mean
But in the ghetto it ain't nothin' but dope fiends
I pull up on the turf not thinkin' of gettin' burnt
With a nine in the trunk it ain't gon' be no funk
Serious about my mail, don't give a fuck about a jail cell
Because I post bail and all hell breaks loose
Cause I got juice, though it seems to me
In reality the other man is out to get me

[Verse 4]
Forever on the run, that shit ain't funny
And I ain't never heard of no extra money
The ninety-eight cents, no food for less
I send a dope fiend to steal my Guess
The ghettos of a way where the players star
Where white men won't, where white kids won't
They say it ain't cool and it's bad for they health
And if ya hit magazine then break ya self
Cause that's the rules man and don't ask why
Either you slang, gangbang, or die
My only concern is to strive
Fucked up around in the street life

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
The reason I ain't do eighteen yet, check
Is because I got people praying for me, bet
I pays my ties even though the money's filthy
Don't wanna go to church because I feel guilty
The way of the street life is really quite scary
Thinkin' tomorrow man I might get married
So when I leave my pad I grab mt glock
And my bulletproof vest and my ski mask dock
On the gooch pal, I won't be caught out of bounds
Can't let these fools stop my life
So I strive, I might be about one eight
But in the mind I more like twenty eight
I see the po-po poppin' the brothers droppin'
Niggaz plottin' and children starvin'
All this shit in my face
I gotta get up out of this place
The middle of V ain't enough see
A nigga feel like I gotta sell D
I share a room with six little brothers
Three to a bed fightin' over covers
The crack of dawn, I read the paper
A Jewish old lady said a nigga raped her
The finger always points at the black man
But not the whites, Filipinos, or Mexicans

I'm tryin' to make enough allowance to pay my water bill
[D-Shot]
Growin' up wasn't that cool to me
I didn't have that many friends just enemies
Until I quit school and started slangin' dope
Came up and wanted a lil' mo'
Mo' mail, clientele yo that sells
Humongous clout, tryin' hard not to fail
Boss ballin' feelin' my way this mo' each day
Out smartin fools tryin' to have it my way
[Suga-T]
Well, how can a cutie come so so tight
Everybody and they mama got a gat so don't nobody be wantin' to fight
Haters be out there bad tryin' to impress their foes
Pimps turn em' out and then they grow up to be sad-a-pus
Gotta keep a child because I'm tryin to get paid
Yeah, gotta shake these city slickers outta my way
But now mother's day I didn't like a hold on, amen
Stay strong, through it all, do it all
Cause folks is straight scandalous

Scandalous, shit is gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, it's really gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous yeah
Scandalous, it's really gettin' scandalous yeah
[B-Legit]
I'm off in this game, runnin' thangs tryin to get it
I do what I do but I'm true when I spit it
Talk about the time when the grind did me bad
Broke in my pad, took everything I had
Left me with the fo' maybe I can trade her in
Rent's due and all I got is a fen
Knots in my stomach can't understand this
Fools in the town becomin' scandalous
[E-40]
I know some things that'll stun ya, make ya wonder
I seen the scandalous use to cheer the social security number
I seen fiends make pipes outta ink pens
Commit incest throw they body at they own kids
Playas become haters, if they ain't doin' it now they doin' it later
Oh you ain't heard man this here's startin' to be contagious
Can't be sittin' in the cabinet collectin' dust
Plus, man this life is so scandalous
[Chorus]
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous
Scandalous, really gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous
[D-Shot]
I remember sittin' in the pen
On the pool table hopin' that I win
Ten packs of some noodles, coffee, and some cigarettes
Tryin' to get penitentiary on the ridge
It seems fools don't want to pay
My source of income depends on day to day
Nobody on the streets cares for me
No packages or no messages
[B-Legit]
Scandocious, keep my focus would ya feel me
Got me thinkin' people close to me tryin to kill me
That's why I ride with this hill side beamer
Bust ueys and only smoke with the lueys
The other day they was plottin' on my homie Dre
Tried to slip him a mickey in his Bombay
But now we knowin' not to fall for the oakey-doakey
It's all bye-bye when it smokes
[Suga-T]
I was left in the dark scene had to run
Did what I had to do, kept my game tight and never wonderin'
Credit card scandals, boostin' falsified checks
Takin chances, scandalous
[Suga-T singing]
You know times are so scandalous
What should we do, just keep on movin'
Close your eyes, have that flow
Could it be your face I see
Up in these scandalous dreams

Bought the weed 'cause I love what it do to me

Made it so niggaz can be proud to say they from Vallel'

Ya know how us bosses step up, know what I mean
Ya do what we do and do what we do to get paid
We get paid, some quintessential, real ass niggas
Stack chips and make some money up
Ya know, I said are-realize the game

Countable, astronomical but monumental
I used sell and serve pops up out my auntie's Pinto
Still keepin' it ghetto, barbecuin' in the front yard
Slappin' bones, ton of niggas perkin'
Recitin' lyrics from my songs
Ain't nobody hurtin' we all workin'
Tryin' to have loot, in the studio
With hangovers tryin' to re-coop
I get down, ballin' like Kobe Bryant
You niggas is lousy, small things to a giant
How you gonna be swappin' up my style
And goin' off by a crack in my units
I'ma stick to the shit that made The Click
The super kind, I love to spit
That nigga 40 vicious, he got speech I heard him
Took his music out of the streets
Policy out on a small fee
Now to be clear, without equal
Both young and new MCs out for dinner
Crackin' ho ass niggas off something gravy
Especially when I get to doin' it by the way, hey
So that nigga told me, that's square
But why ya want to get in on that sucker sauce be	
I didn't ask you to get on this album
Cause he knew I'd fuck him off

It's so simple just to let it all begin
And I bend my head
To kiss your lips again

And stoop to touch your hand
It's half past eight
When I get home
So let the gas fire glow

Everybody's gone and the fever
That lights up the empty room
Floods the distance
And the emptiness between us
Like a miracle

Your make up on

Now see the dying summer moon
It's shining just for me and you
And the night that seems so alone is gone, gone, gone

Weave the sunlight in your hair, catch it in your arms
I can see you movin' in, I'm easy and I'm calm

You got my name, pick up my number
Come on, darling, let's be lovers
You got my name, pick up my number
Come on, darling, let's be lovers

So I take a walk under the trees

Summer waits the leaves
As lovely as I've ever known

Now where can I go?

Somewhere the wind
Don't blow me back
Into the conversations
Promises and situations, yeah
It's all constant, in the air

The Phantom finds you
Cryin' in the streets
Lonely cops pick flowers
On their beats

And what do they see?

The Clovers,"I took my troubles down to Madame Rue
You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
She's got a pad on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion Number Nine

I told her that I was a flop with chicks
I've been this way since ninteen-fifty-six
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said ""what you need is Love Potion Number Nine""

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She said ""I'm gonna mix it up right here in the sink""
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like India ink
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

I didn't know it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop at Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine

I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

I didn't know it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
I had so much fun that I'm going back again
I wonder what happen with love potion number ten?

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square saying, catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop

Suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggas, now, playa what it be like?
When will niggas see they got us bleedin' with three strikes
Can't seem to focus hopeless, with violent thoughts I wrote this
Got these Devils petrified, hidin' from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated, clearly click a military mind
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin', from the womb to the block
My live mind got me survivin' five rounds (shots)
My forty-five got me fortified with live rounds
When shit's thick we plot hits, when our Glock spits
All hail, out on bail, wrath of the 2Pacalypse
Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw Thug Niggas never left the boot camp

They called us for assignment, one of the squad's finest
Skills in guerilla warfare and blessed with refinement
My rap sheet, contains sections of bomb sessions
Says I'm responsible for black Smif-N-Wessun
Puttin likkle yout's in a military state of mind
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined
Cocoa Brovaz 'pon de borderline
Test de sound and ye dead same ti-ime

Man to man, I'm facin' the Devil with a plan
Judo stance, first glance, I'm makin' my advance
Animal instincts, intelligence of an assassin
Masked men, ninjas that surround me, ready to attack
I react swiftly, what father taught me sticks with me
Never forget the method, stick and move strictly
Shit be seemin' like it's closin' in
With no regrets I hold position
Cause I suppose I'm one of the chosen men

Picture being put in a position to move
And you can't move cause your move is blocked by the knight
At twelve o'clock, that's when the madness begins
So I start to focus in, my thoughts on the war
Cause the rule is the law, and the law that we live by
Is to stay true to self, in this case, BDI
Why try if ya body lie
By the block true soldier mentality, this is how we rock and roll
(This is how we ride)

Stick and move, time to show 'em how to make a move
Or get moved on, let's see who strong

In the gaze of the strange, where nothin stays the same
Where new faces come through with similar game
Now who you thought was them, really ain't
They catchin' deja vu's of the game people play
It's a call for readjustment, fine tune yo' position
You slippin' and trippin' 'stead of bobbin and dippin'
But never let this world of stress get the best of me
Takin' breathin' techniques, slay you with Tai-Chi

What does it take, to get a break in the world of snakes
And dose who fake
Elimination I'm facin' destruction
Outlawed, so I duck and down, fo'-fo' is bustin', no one to trust in
Rushin' to the goal line
Catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole mine
No swine I'm a soldier, soldier I control mine
Time to, take you, back into time - follow dis here

One way out, this black hole
For this black soul, shit is outta control
I'm fightin' for my position to be a fetus in this world I'm enterin'
And my face is sentencin' for repentance
Before my body was fully formed into a human
I was already consumin' weed
Cause my moms used to smoke back in the 70's
Maybe that's why in the 90's I drop G's when I drop degrees
When I ease across the block with 'Pac
Got all y'all niggas shocked

If you do you press rewind
And you can peep guerilla tactics in every line

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,2005

Like a brown cent went on a hunt

Getting done by Starang, when he was in range
Now its gettin cold, so you actin kinda strange
Puttin my time to you broke bitches
Don't do shit but stress me out, now I'm back in my riches
To get my blue print down to my very last dot

You never heard another MC like me

Follow my lead on the journey

But you still sittin down
Dumb fucks have a seat and keep your tongue in your throat
And don't bother to quote one note
Or in the mirror you kickin the verse to mine
'cause in the freestyle, you'll be the last to rhyme
This ain't the battle between the two best no more

If you got your eyes open, you can see the light
If you need a guide, follow wit pride...right

The Colin Busby Big Swing Band,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

There's more to love than boy meets girl

There's more to love than boy meets girl

How can one man decide the fate and destiny of innocent lovers
And why is it less of a crime to take the life of another?
Through time they've always tried to hide and cast aside this love denied
In the shadows we held each other tight
There's more to love than boy meets girl
There's more to love than boy meets girl
For love is strange and uncontrolled, it can happen to anyone
There's more to love than boy meets girl

The Confederates,"He thought he was the King of America
Where they pour Coca Cola just like vintage wine
Now I try hard not to become hysterical
But I'm not sure if I am laughing or crying
I wish that I could push a button
And talk in the past and not the present tense
And watch this hurtin' feeling disappear
Like it was common sense
It was a fine idea at the time
Now it's a brilliant mistake

She said that she was working for the ABC News
It was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use
Her perfume was unspeakable
It lingered in the air
Like her artificial laughter
Her mementos of affairs
""Oh"" I said ""I see you know him""
""Isn't that very fortunate for you""
And she showed me his calling card
He came third or fourth and there were more than one or two
He was a fine idea at the time
Now he's a brilliant mistake

He thought he was the King of America
But it was just a boulevard of broken dreams
A trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals
The words of love in whispers
And the acts of love in screams
I wish that I could push a button
And talk in the past and not the present tense
And watch this lovin' feeling disappear
Like it was common sense
I was a fine idea at the time
Now I'm a brilliant mistake
I was a fine idea at the time
Now I'm a brilliant mistake",Brilliant Mistake,1986
The Confederates,"We play these parlour games
We play at make believe

Indoor fireworks
Can still burn your fingers
Indoor fireworks
We swore we were safe as houses
They're not so spectacular
They don't burn up in the sky
But they can dazzle or delight
Or bring a tear
When the smoke gets in your eyes

You were the spice of life
The gin in my vermouth
And though the sparks would fly
I thought our love was fireproof
Sometimes we'd fight in public darling
With very little cause
But different kinds of sparks would fly
When we got on our own behind closed doors

[Chorus]

It's time to tell the truth
These things have to be faced
My fuse is burning out
And all that powder's gone to waste
Don't think for a moment dear that we'll ever be through
I'll build a bonfire of my dreams
And burn a broken effigy of me and you

The Confession,"They heard the virgins weeping,
Down to town square we go!
There they'll be cleansed by fire!
I know your yearning to burn the virgin!
Let's bring the morales back to,
Back to the town we know.
Nothing is ever sacred,
My final warning, to you I will sing.
I've got the time to lie,
I've lost my faith in you!

And there's no losing the fight, 
We tie our nooses tight.

Sluts twist through the smoke and the mist, 
So get your hand off your dick, and I can show you how!

Around the fire we chant, so just walk on by.
Hold tight, to your daughters tonight, 
Cause you know I'll fuck 'em right, you know I damn well might.

The hating the horror that haunts my day
If I can get a chance to bursh off this decay
Who gives a fuck, gimme what I need, another dose

Kneel down and exorcise prepare for what's in store, I'm resurrecting
And I stop shaking tonight pull myself up off the floor
Kneel down and exorcise, I'm resurrecting

Lock it away beneath the pain beneath the insane
Take it all in and I'll take the blame
Pushing the grave the cancer radiates in her face
You ruined my stay so I'll destroy the faith there has to be another way

I'm in the rubble contemplating the pills that thrill killin' not aiding
The hating the horror that haunts my day if 
I could get another chance I'd probably throw it away

There'll be no one left to blame us

We'll save Australia
Don't want to hurt no kangaroo
We'll build an all American amusement park there
They've got surfing, too

Boom goes London
And boom Paris
More room for you
And more room for me
And every city the whole world round
Will just be another American town
Oh, how peaceful it'll be
We'll set everybody free
You'll have Japanese kimonos, baby
There'll be Italian shoes for me

Captain?s log; Stardate: 3.142857--Aw, forget about it! This is Captain Kwirk on the Starship Intercourse. Thrusting its way through space, on another penetrating mission.

(?Alleluia? song is playing.)
HUNKIE
Captain! Captain! What?s that in space ahead? 

KWIRK
Huh? Oh no, it?s another space tricky! Darn this solar system anyway! Nothing but space trickys. Get the phasers on that bird. 

HUNKIE
Captain! Captain! All the stars have gone out!

KWIRK
No, you fool! You?ve leaned on the button! Turn the viewer back on! Now get the phasers on that bird.

LOUD VOICE
I am an Angel of the Lord!

KWIRK
(the effects slow down like a record)
Yeow! That baked him good!

HUNKIE
Oh wow, it looks just like Thanksgiving out there!

KWIRK
Don?t think about it, Lt. Hunkie!

HUNKIE
I can?t help thinking about it. Last Thanksgiving was rotten. Just that food supplement pill with ?turkey? written on it. It?s not the same, Captain. It?s not the same.

KWIRK
Turn off the view screen, we?re out here and this is where we are.

HUNKIE
Why can?t I think about it? I?m an officer, too.

KWIRK
You?ve got enough to think about, you?ve got a whole dashboard to take care of.

SMOCK
Captain, have your (?) space turkey has knocked up slightly off course.

KWIRK
Well, Lemon...

SMOCK
It?s Leh-meen, sir.

KWIRK
Now we must get back on course.

SMOCK
It?s Leh-meen, sir, did you hear me say that?

KWIRK
Nah--uh--why-yes--uh--uh, Lie-nen, uh, but we must get back on course.

SMOCK
Yes sir, we must get back on course, do you want to check the reading?

KWIRK
Aw yes, let me see, the ?quick brown fox.?

SMOCK
That is the wrong reading, I?ll check this.

KWIRK
Oh, oh, I see, yah, yes, n-now my communicator. Get me engineering.

EUBANGDERE
That?s my box, Captain!

KWIRK
Oh, oh, pardon me, Lt. Eubangdere! Allow me to apologize pro flu slay.

EUBANGDERE
Just take your hand off my box.

SMOCK
Captain?

KWIRK
Yes, Smock?

SMOCK
May I remind you that since we are traveling at a rate of Walk Factor III, that our collision with that turkey, thirty-eight seconds ago, that has put us 13 billion miles off course.

KWIRK
Well, good heavens, Smock, why wasn?t I told him this earlier? This is the Captain speaking, connect me with engineering.

EUBANGDERE
I?m sorry, but that line is busy.

KWIRK
This is the Captain. Give me engineering.

EUBANGDERE
I?m sorry, sir, but that line is busy.

KWIRK
But I have a direct line, I?m the Captain. Operator! Operator! Operator! Did you hear that, Smock? Are my people putting me on?

SMOCK
I don?t know, sir. As you know I am the Vulgarian and jokes are beyond me. (chuckle)

KWIRK
Hmmmm...That?s the first time I?ve ever heard him laugh. Hmph! Oh, wait a minute, we must contact engineering. My God, 15 billion miles off course

SMOCK
23 billion miles off course now, sir, if my calculations are correct. And they always are.

KWIRK
This is the Captain speaking. Give me engineering.

(The party music is playing. People are chattering.)
PARTY GUY
Come here, try some of this!

PARTY GIRL
Would you blow up my balloons? Flash!

(Captain Kwirk clears his throat.)
PARTY GUY
Shhh! Cut it! Everybody be quiet!

KWIRK
This is the Captain speaking.

PARTY GUY
(on ?Captain?)
Shut up!

HUNKIE
Who is it?

KWIRK
It?s the Captain! We?re 23 billion miles off course!

SMOCK
29 billion.

KWIRK
29 billion----Operator! Operator!

EUBANGDERE
I?m sorry, sir, but that line is busy, heh!

KWIRK
Smock, we don?t realize what a mess we?re in 29 billion miles off course.

LIMEY
(stupid voice)
Captain, this is engineering, Lt. Limey speaking. Do you realize we?re 34 billion miles off course?

KWIRK
Limey, I just called you! What?s going on down there?

SMOCK
Captain, according to my calculations, we?re 38 billion miles off course.

KWIRK
Thank you, Smock!!!

SMOCK
Why are you pinching your eyes together, Captain? It doesn?t help the situation or does it have any physiological effect? Highly illogical behavior. Tsk, tsk, tsk! You?ve heard me.

(Kwirk sighs in grief.)
LIMEY
Captain, where did you go? We?re 45 billion miles off course.

KWIRK
I?m still here, Limey. Lt. Eubangdere, have the computer compu--course correction coordinates, engineering, curse creation--coor--crea--curs--uuh--engineering standby.

LIMEY
It?s about time, Captain, by now we must be 52 billion miles off course. They?re traveling faster than lightning.

KWIRK
Lt. Eubangdere, where are the course readings, eh? Where? Lt. Eubangdere--uh...Where in the hell did she go?

HUNKIE
She went to church, sir!

KWIRK
Church!? She can?t be, it?s Tuesday afternoon!

HUNKIE
It?s her sect, do you know?

KWIRK
I am aware of her sex, lieutenant!

HUNKIE
No, no, her sect, her sect, she?s among with a poodle-lay(???) you know Kimiwaukee-too-long(???)

KWIRK
Ugh! When will it ever end?

HUNKIE
Captain! Captain! All the stars have gone out!

KWIRK
Lt. Hunkie, if you lean on that button once more, I will have you ejected into hyperspace through the garbage chute!!! Take over the controls, Smock! I?ll find Lt. Eubangdere myself!

SMOCK
Aye aye, sir!

KWIRK
Aw, let?s see, where did she go now?

SMOCK
She?s in the ship?s saps!

KWIRK
The ship?s what?!

SMOCK
The chapel, the meditation area. Although I personally find religion highly illogical.

KWIRK
(sigh) Uhh, I?ll have to take the elevator down. Aw these problems! You see I?m never on this level. Uh, maybe it?s in here. 

EUBANGDERE
Oh my way, oh my way, oh my way...

KWIRK
You can?t do that in there, this is the broom closet!

SMOCK
We?re engaged!

KWIRK
Well, disengaging report back to your stations. Humph! Oh, I must be down the corner to the left. Oh, I?ve got to stop talking to myself.

SINGERS
Ooh-ee-ooh-ah-ah-teeng-tang-walla-walla-bing-bang! Alive men!(?)

KWIRK
Uh, but...but where?s Lt. Eubangdere? Chaplan! Chaplan!

CHAPLAN
There?s a Room 70...???

KWIRK
Aaaahh! Oh! That mask, you scared me! I thought this was the act--uh--uh--the chapel!

CHAPLAN
I?m sorry, I didn?t mean to startle you! Since there?s only one chapel on the Starship Intercourse. I become very indebt as a number of different religious service. 

KWIRK
Oh.

CHAPLAN
I?m afraid I get quite in mast in my role. Oops, there, I?ve spattered blood all over your tights.

KWIRK
Yech!

CHAPLAN
Don?t worry, it?s only pig blood it comes off with a little lemon and salt. You know it?s really wonderful to be a Chaplan in outer space. 

KWIRK
Huh?

CHAPLAN
Space is so wonderful! So vast! So infant! So religious! I was just thinking the other day when I was doing the terrible complicated Flip-Ziggy(??) services for the worshipers from Zakaan?s...

KWIRK
Zakaan?s...

CHAPLAN
Oh! Which reminds me, Captain, that is a mind of extremely important so of which I must speak to you.

KWIRK
Huh?

CHAPLAN
It is the matter of the psychic moral of the ship...

KWIRK
Who?

CHAPLAN
Many of the mystic men. How do Americans say it? The little people?

KWIRK
Huh?

CHAPLAN
Or undergoing a great deal of strange...implants(???) are ruining about the ship. Some of the men are saying that the dietician is putting the salt Peter in the food supplement tablets.

KWIRK
Mmmm...

CHAPLAN
Then, there is the problem of beaming down.

KWIRK
Huh?

CHAPLAN
The mystic men feel that it does not fear that only officers get to leave the ship.

KWIRK
Huh?

CHAPLAN
There as they put it, going stir crazy acquainted, don?t you agree?

KWIRK
Uh-uh.

CHAPLAN
I even just alone to go dirty religious service, I overheard a room out to the effect. The ship is over 125 billion miles off course.

KWIRK
It is?

CHAPLAN
It is. Isn?t that wonderful? Space is so vast! There are so many possibilities.

KWIRK
Chaplan, this is an emergency! I-I-I must speak with Lt. Eubangdere!

CHAPLAN
Oh dear, she seems to have left.

KWIRK
Oh! (g-are-are-are-are!)

CHAPLAN
Well I?ll bet she?s back in the control room right now. You know, if you keep calm instead of turning purple like that, only your problems would solve themselves.

SMOCK
Captain?

KWIRK
What is it, Smock?

SMOCK
We?ve located Lt. Eubangdere, he?s locked in the woman?s room on Level 4.

KWIRK
Oh no!

SMOCK
We?ve sent a janitor over there with a skeleton key, we should have her out in any moment.

KWIRK
But this is an emergency! Can?t you do anything faster? Can?t you blast her out?

SMOCK
But the woman?s room on Level 4 is only three by three. We wouldn?t want to reduce her to atoms, that would be illogical.

KWIRK
Listen, Smock! We must at--quickly the ship is already 125 billion miles off course!

SMOCK
140 billion miles off course!

KWIRK
Well--W--We must do something quickly, anyway! Say, can?t you operate the computers yourself?

SMOCK
Of course, I can operate the computers, I am the Vulgarian!

KWIRK
Well why didn?t you?

SMOCK
You didn?t ask me, after all, I?m only the Squire, rule of the night, you didn?t order me, Captain!

KWIRK
Listen, Pixie-ears! Get on that computer!!!!!

EUBANGDERE
The price is ten more cents or another five, or three minutes! Whoopee!

KWIRK
I?ve really got to have that operator replaced! Excuse me, Chaplan, I must return to the bridge!

CHAPLAN
Y?all we watch over you! Now how am I to be with you? I?m a ga--uh--guide your error. May this shnook be with in you.(?) Let Christ be above you. And they unbleed(??) of the seven rooms light your way.

KWIRK
Uh, if only I can get up to the main control room in time.

(Controls had gone bad.)
KWIRK
Now, Smock, how?s the computer doing?

SMOCK
I?m programming it now, something seems to be wrong, listen to this...Maybe if I do this...

(Telephone line going fast.)
HUNKIE
Captain! Captain! All the lights have gone out!

KWIRK
Take your hands away from your eyes, Lt. Hunkie. All right, damage control, give me an estimate on the damage.

SMOCK
Well, Captain, it?s easily $27,000,000 worth of damage.

HUNKIE
Uh...$27,000,000 worth of damage?! Grrrr!

SMOCK
Well, actually, it?s only one tube that costs fifteen cents, but the service charge is enormous since the result of many light years away from the service area. That is provided and they can find us anyway seeing us we?re 200 billion miles off course.

EUBANGDERE
What?s going on here?

KWIRK
Lt. Eubangdere! If you leave the control room again without telling me! I?ll--I?ll--

EUBANGDERE
Urgent! (crying) Oh--oh--ah--oh, that?s the way you feel about it! I quit!

KWIRK
Oh! Oh no! Oh! I--I don?t--I don?t feel that way! No--here, have a seat, make yourself comfy, oh, you look nice this afternoon--evening--morning--whatever it is, it?s so hard to tell on ship boarding. When did I say ?blast? anyhow?

EUBANGDERE
Why are you pinching your eyes together like that, Captain Homie?

KWIRK
Can you fix the computer? Please!?!?

Well, of course, I?ll just stick these little old bobby pin in here!

Lead the sheep in their sleep 
To slaughter. 

Won't abide, pushed aside 
Let me know when you've decided 
I'll decline when the sign 
Says",Over There,1987
