k.,"You lured me with your diamond flower
You lured me with talk of still more talk
You lured me with caramelizing power
You lured me a lot
Clearly lifeless bare feet
And dogs just trained to sniff
You saw him struggle
Then you saw him cease his struggling
You said, we're halfway come and meet us
We're the completists

You lured me with your bad intentions
You lured me with your Mexican pot
You lured me with desert dimensions
You lured me a lot.
You loaded up your gear so well
You can pack so tight
But I can still hear your tambourine
Demeaning you through the night
Don't want to sound defeatist
But we're the 'complete-est'.

Intimate, inaccurate, a family, in a way,
Made the trip to Vulnerable and back
On the same day.
Don' t want to sound defeated.
You lured me into repetition
You lured me to want to go to sleep
You lured me into open spaces
You lure me
Clearly lifeless bare feet
And dogs just trained to sniff
You showed him struggle
Then you showed him cease his struggling
You said, we're halfway, come, and meet us
We're the completists.
Halfway come and meet us

k.,"I never meant to break you
I never thought I'd be this cruel
It's close to midnight 
The club is loaded tight
I'm moving with the crowd
At the speed of light
I feel your touch possessing me
The sounds around slowly disappear
Can you wait boy? 
Be a girls toy? 
No, no I won't shed a tear 

Stop stop no use
You can only abuse
Turn around now you're getting me confused 
Get down on the dance floor now
(Cause tonight) 

I got McQueens on tight (cause it feels right) 
Lick my lips in your sight (cause it feels right) 
Body bends in the club like touching me is so right
Beggin' for a dance (beggin' for a dance) 

Make it hot for me
Make it hot for me
Just make it hot for me (d-d-d-dance) 
Make it hot for me 
Make it hot for me
Just make it hot for me (dance) 

You came in desperation
Seeking my attention
You ain't Shakespeare 
Please persevere (Stop) 
Oh, oh, you're sickening
(Make it hot for me) 
We might do it every night
(Til the days relieved) 
We'll go out in a dive 
be a bad boy (uh)
On the dance floor

Stop stop no use 
You can only abuse 
Turn around now you're getting me confused
Take a few shots show me whatcha got
Let's disappear
Let's get outta here

I got McQueens on tight

Lick my lips in your sight

We got the perfect combination
(Krayzie: Mo Thug, Mo Thug)
So you better change your location
(Krayzie: Move out, move out)

[Tombstone]
Mo Thug be the love
Slug for the perfect picture
Chronic bud to save your struggles
So somebody suffer, scriptures
Time to rip ya, hit ya really good
I'll split ya, ditch ya
Gotta put ya in my hall of flames
And damn, it's shame
Listen up tight you can hear the storm, it's a hurricane
Bone, II Tru, Hustla'z, and Shifters (We are the soldiers!)
Bustas, no need to be runnin' from trues
Sucka, get murdered with skills
The ? to peel ya, straight up from infantry
Wars begin, we done sayin' they playin' to win
But we got it all within
So roll with the sheets, 'cause the thugs, they creep
Go and step on the ? with the midnight streets
Where they playin' for keeps, so fake soldiers...

[Mo! Hart]
Late hours of the eve
Now brothas out schemin'
Tryin' to break your heart
Gotta alleviate the problem before it even start
Sit relax and never losin' my composure
Brotha done told ya, better beware
'Cause this Mo Thug click got plenty of soldiers
Just open your eyes and realize
It's gonna be Mo Thug 'til I die
Never esitate don't flip
I can pin you all in them disguises
So if you want to come test
Definite action must proceed
But before it goes down
I gots to alert the rest of my family

[Jhaz]
why'all want no lovin' to a sister flowin'
Face me, you claim to be the sweetest
But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles
See Mo Thug, we on the rise everyday
I feel the swisha as my method of the high
No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

[Souljah Boy:]
It be the Mo Thug, it's buck, quick bandages
One of these soldiers just can't stand 'em
Make me had to do a one-eighty-seven (one eighty-seven)
With a MAC-10, reactin' like you really want to know what's happenin'
Down with buckin' why'all with me strap and best a be duckin'
'Cause I'm blastin' real fast when I see fake-ass O.G.'s

[Ken Dawg]
I'm ridin' real; Mo Thug is where I be
I'm down with Ken
So put 'em up as I cock the pistols
Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

[Tony Tone]
It's that Hustla with Hustla'z poetically known as Tony Tone
With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa
Let it be known that we're trues with weapons
Double I'm steppin', Mo Thug militant soldiers
Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart
It's from the heart
Demons that drop our lives got pinned inside
Realized they fell off
So many want to roll, but don't know how we stroll
They never know we're good go
So let's make our dough, for sure

[Krayzie]
This Mo Thug Family

[Mo Thugs Family]
This Mo Thug Family

[Krayzie]
Scriptures, we keep 'em all within me

[Mo Thugs Family]
We keep 'em all within me

[Layzie]
No competition
I gotta get mine
And scream out, ""Mo! (Mo! Mo!)""
And let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone
Mo Thugs'll follow
Chain gang remainin' the same
Flamin' my dank, and drinkin' brew
Think about that hangin', clockin' my bank
And thuggin' with trues, fools, you know it

[Tre]
Mo Thug family
I got all my thugstas with me

[Ken Dawg]
Hoes stayin' up
Close enough for ya to let ya know
It's do or die forever, ridin' together (we're ridin' together)
'Til the day of the stormy weather
Pleasure and pain is all in this trip
Only scripts to flip is these old Mo Thug hits
This click of soldiers, who keep it real until the end
Some green in their hand, and we in it again, right

[Brina]
Let a sista nip this in the bud
You can't face me, this playa
Hell of a rhyme, sayin' these family scriptures
The last to remain by sneakin' up on you, backdoor
Hear 'Brina comin' relentlessly bustin'
Trues bringin' the drama for them bustas, never no bluffin'
No, gotta run my game tight
Never know weaklings, when a sista fall victim hit 'em
We Cleveland original money makers up in your system

[Boogy Nikke]
It's the Mo Thug Family Scripture
We singin', my people and me
Ya better believe the family tree's much deeper
Than what you see and believin'
Hey, gotta give up peace to the love inside of my halo
Gotta stay headstrong for soldiers
Like I told ya we need peace (Dear Lord, can you help me?)
(Never forget) to pray for the people
'Cause when you need 'em, they there
You better beware Mo Thugs' steppin' with weapons
We comin' with the word of the Lord
To teach the people not knowin', we showin'
It's Armageddon again, we comin'
Better be ready, boy (I'm ready)
You better be teachin' your people
To write when this day's done, pray soldier boy

[Gates]
We soldiers trapped in this world
Don't step in our face or my bullets ?
Fed up with these haters, I'm breakin' 'em up
'Cause they fakers, and fakers fakin'
Pullin' them gat on Mo Thugs
But ain't no soldiers, this lunatic get the chrome
Now they get gone (on the dark
'cause the gat flipped) with them roll
And handlin' them demons makin' me crazy
Knowin' that Gates can't be fucked with
When I'm swangin' them thangs
I'm feelin' ?, and I'm bustin' men
Gotta load me clip when I rip
Then slip them slugs up out the chamber
Shoulda flexed upon me, stranger

[Krayzie]
Busta, you in danger
Tell 'em they in danger

[Mo Thugs Family]
All consequence

[Krayzie]
I take it that flippin'
Realize what it is that you have missed
Attention: be down for the family
That don't get no realer than this
Now what you gonna do when that won't get better, man?
You playin' within the game
That's why we done train and prayin' everyday
Family never divided
You heard it before, but this time you can buy
Some bustas fell off, we leave 'em behind
I'm mean we tried, but they could not fall in line
So this is what we've done, hell: eliminated haters, every one
Keepin' it real, makin' a mill
How do you feel? (I just want a mill, mill)

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Steady puttin' it down
Just the way we told ya Mo Thug soldier got ya
Back at it, (postin')
Puttin' your face on the ground
Murdered execution style, leavin' 'em roasted
All the while I'm servin' you hookas solution ?
Don't you wonder why niggas that hate me die?
With my family multiply
Scriptures be puttin up the tracks
Takin' a journey deep on the darkside
If you want fuck with
You better have the heart to handle the pressure
'Cause my niggas surin' to test
Weak niggas prove you ain't hard
Step with your ho-card, remind them of the St. Clair style
How we do it always, keep foldin'
Flippin' through the pages of literature
Scriptures, we laid...

Barely even steady out the front door
Hate my own shit, but I love yours
Fuck, I really love yours

Seven in the afternoon, half asleep, count the cars
All I think about is you constantly, that's the hard part

But I'm brighter when you make me fade
You make me fade, you make me fade
You make me brighter when you make me fade

Well, they think I've been messing with the wrong stuff
Nah, I've been messing with the right shit
Yeah, I fucking like it

But silently I've been eyeing the horizon
Patterns repeat, it shouldn't be surprising, oh

You can fight or run away
I have no struggle
Relax watch me float away
I'm coastin'
I'm coastin' on a dream
I'm coastin'
This one's for you and me

Not to set trip but my car jets west
As I drift over cliff
The sunset yes
It's me and myself
I needed a rest
The windows down breathin' deep in my chest
I used to feel hopeless
Now I feel so rare
Seats lean back
Can't see my chair
See my eyes reflect in the sky
I feel so divine givin' thanks I'm alive
'Cause we came a long way since our days in the A
Sleepless nights was tryna get right
Now I just glide
Wind in my sails
I toast to the ocean
She balance my scales
West coastin'
Got the breeze at my left
Believe in me black
When life do you wack
Stay focused
True indeed it's a fact
When those hard times come love will bring you right back

When life brings trouble
You can fight or run away
I have no struggle
Relax watch me float away

I'm coastin' on a dream
I'm coastin'
This one's for you and me

Now some pop bottles, some chase models
As if it's all live, primetime, the Apollo
Mighty big pill too many can't swallow
The pain got 'em trippin' off things feelin' hollow
Weight in my brain
Spittin' my slang
'Cause I don't wanna I don't wanna go insane
I'm forward on my mission now I'm deep in the game
Got my speakers on blast while I'm switching the lanes
Stay low-pro kinfolk
Started out at Kinko's
Ten years later out to Vegas on a G4
The seats bucket when we puff puff pass
Passports in my luggage got my beats on smash
Attitude of a winner that's some VMA
So we feel like its summer anywhere that I lay
Ay, it's C.A. To the day that we out
Stay strong through the struggle that's what life is about

When life brings trouble
You can fight or run away
I have no struggle
Relax watch me float away

West coast air my lungs are breathing
Dreaming as I walk the streets
Crosswalks all seem to talk to me
So I say what up, I'm on my way downtown
On the prowl for male pronoun
Levi's bunched in my sneaks
I've been waiting for this night all week
Green to yellow to red, the lights keep flashing inside my head
Could have stayed in but instead I got all dressed
I'm like butter and tonight's the bread
I feel incredible, and my friends all buzzed
Do it how they does it yeah just because
Stay up till five
It's so nice to be alive
When I just melt away
The world is mine today
Keep dancing got the whole night left
Been a lot of places but I ain't done yet
All of us up in the clouds
We roll by, they say wow
See the world, we're on top

And the skyscrapers with big windows
Just lego pieces built to crash
Want to slow down life time moves too fast
Trains pass by me on the road
And the skyscrapers with big windows
All lego pieces built to crash
Want to slow down life time moves too fast
Could it all be real? Still feeling ill
Dance floor on it yes sir I kill
Chill cause the night is young
Room full of love, trying to get me some
I'm a wanna have fun type lady
Gonna find a cute boy just maybe
But if not then it's still all good
Had a great night and I knew I would
Behind the club is the cityscape
Got a lot to do, but it can wait
You never know how it might turn out
Stay awake till the lights burn out
Feeling faded, let the record play
Got a lot of work, but it's OK
Check the time and it's 5 AM
Tomorrow night I'll be back again

Oh I've got tough skin
Ready for my bow
All I've got is two hands
I tied them in the middle
Ready for the red tape

I offer souvenirs
A deaf tongue and blinded ears
Can you fill the shelves in here
Come in come in

Everybody look around
Everybody look around
I don't know how to fill the space
The invitation's on the page
Open up my ribcage

Want you to want me like I'm all you got
Mama see's seeing it but can't make me stop
Telling the truth it might mean you get broken
But letting it hurt that's my method of coping

What they project on me what I've become
Down on my knees unsure what to say
No I never learned how to prey
Don't know, know who I been fooling
But you got me running in circles I'm ruined
Let you inside opened up all my wounds
Taking my ribcage and ripped it in two

Everybody look around
Everybody look around
I don't know how to fill the space
The invitation's on the page
Open up my ribcage

Tie off all my tendons
Watch how they stretch
Oh I've got the muscle
But lord, I'm spent
Knocking down my sternum
Began at a young age
Too much space between
Open up my ribcage

I offer souvenirs
A deaf tongue and blinded ears
Can you fill the shelves in here
Come in come in

Everybody look around
Everybody look around
I don't know how to fill the space
The invitation's on the page
Open up my ribcage

There's impenetrable silence inside of my head
There's nothing I can buy when I'm practically dead
I get so tired of writing everything I should have said
That maybe this time I'll put my pen down and just tell you instead
You see I opened up my ribcage and violins flew out
The organs softly played through my violin mouth
I got lights hotter than love hidden beneath my tongue
Written on my skin
It tells me your the one

Everybody look around
Everybody look around
I don't know how to fill the space
The invitation's on the page
Open up my ribcage

Open up my ribcage
Open up my ribcage
Open up my ribcage

Missing cash, blacking out, heartless in a few ways
Shit for luck, elbows shredded, I held things steady like too late
Please calm the fuck down, I'll do whatever you say
I get it, I get it, I'm living too hard and it's time that I stop it
But rising on up and then tumbling down well it's part of the process
Bar tabs on a hot night in a cold basement
You say I'm crazy but I feel amazing

I wanna hold 'em 'til they burn right through my hands
Don't ask me questions cause I'm tired of confessing
And I know that it's not much to say but I swear that I'd like to change

Screaming loud, stupid shit, scaring all of my old friends
Fell down on Bedford, hope that it's not broken
Safe to say I might have had too much of some of these potions
I love you so much, I'm staying here all night
Don't want to get up, I don't want to stop, I don't want to close my eyes
I'd rather not give a fuck and end up with some scars
The night's just long enough for me to build it all and let it fall apart

3 am and no one around

In the summer, it was blazing
You looked at my black jeans, said are you crazy?
I guess I might have laughed
And after that you stuck to me like glue
But you had a girl at home and too many tattoos
I was in a rough patch, real depressed
You took my hand and said the sun it rises in the east but I came from the west
My heart it skipped and that was that
I should have known, don’t trust a poet
'Cause they can’t do the math

I’m always in the wrong place at the wrong time
Headed on a bad trip with the wrong high
I don’t really know why
But you felt right to me
I hadn’t had a good thing in a long time
Moving in the fast lane with the wrong guy
I don’t really know why
But you felt right to me

We met on a Friday
In the winter, it was freezing
Felt a bit like history repeating
We’d been on a break but then decided 
We could try to spend the night like friends and roam the city
Knowing what that meant
So we were back and I was pouring poison
Texting you reports from everywhere I went
And you’d write back ""I miss you even more""
And it was torture for me
I should have known, don’t trust a poet
'Cause they prefer to bleed

I don’t really know why
But you felt right to me

Wrote this on a Sunday after months out on the road
Wonder if you have regrets and which direction those thoughts go
Like was it worth it in the end?
Sometimes it feels like you just used me for my mind and innocence
And now I heard you had a kid, finished a book and got a wife
Things been good to you since that last goodbye
But I just have to say my piece
You should have known don’t trust a poet
'Cause we know how to speak

In my two hands, saying no thanks
Like any way it goes cause I know things
They shouldn't have told me

Hanging by a sentence at the drug store
Barely even steady out the front door
Hate my own shit, but I love yours
Fuck I really love yours

Seven in the afternoon, half asleep, count the cars
All I think about is you constantly, that's the hard part
Static on the line, I hear it all the time
But I'm quiet when you make me fade

But I'm brighter when you make me fade
You make me fade, you make me fade

Shaking from my temple to my ankles
Sunny but I need another raincoat

Well they think I've been messing with the wrong stuff
Nah I've been messing with the right shit
Yeah I fucking like it

Make a girl wanna get stupid and violent
But silently I've been eyeing the horizon
Patterns repeat, it shouldn't be surprising

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

I'm crashing an apartment and somebody left it open
So I poured it in a cup, drank it up
I got the devil in my head but angels swimming in my blood
Plus the conscience of my dead dad
Plus my living mama plus my other father who raised me not to be sad
And my brother who says that he worries about me from my songs
And my sister who's been living like a saint for so damn long
Well I've been fucking sinning til the lights come up 
And the mics catch us saying shit that we never really meant
Crew wears all black stuff but we all act like we're so different
But everybody bleeds, right?
Everybody's waiting for the phone to ring
Yeah everybody seems fine
But everybody's got pieces missing
At minimum I'd like a little medicine to make me feel like everything
Diminishing the venom that been harshing all my mellows 
I'm continuing to fight against the sentiment that make me want to die
In a world full of uptight gentlemen 
I wanna find a boy smelling like sweet cinnamon 
To quote some Tennyson while we take Benadryl 
To make my head a bit extra light

I feel it, I want it
I need it, I love it
I'm looking for something
To make me feel nothing

Driving through the bay, pray for understanding
I'll be silent for a day, wait until I vanish 
And I'm fighting for a break, vacant kind of passion
Never really can account for all the ways in which I've acted

So I'm drinking like an addict til I'm fucking with a headache

K. Flay,"I keep on running backwards, I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers, I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient, my mother held my hand
I don't what I'm chasing, I don't know who I am
 
Woke up this morning holding my head
Thinking last night is one of regret
Washing off the bad decisions, the blurry vision
The clues that I'm still a mess
Spitting out the taste I have in my mouth
Knowing what this all is really about
Knowing there's an explanation, an expiration
I gotta figure shit out

And they're asking me if I can see the darkness down below
And I know it's true, I say I do, and half the time I don't
Maybe I can't make what it may take to leave this thing behind
But I shut my eyes and cross each line and every time

I keep on running backwards, I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers, I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient, my mother held my hand
I don't what I'm chasing, I don't know who I am

Waking in the dead of night, I can't sleep
Sleeping in the light of day for like weeks
Reality was out of focus, I could be hopeless
Instead I gritted my teeth
I didn't have the patience left to explain
Didn't wanna wait while nobody came
I know the path ahead's uneven
But while I'm breathing
I have to make my own lane

And they're asking me if I can see the darkness down below
And I know it's true, I say I do, and half the time I don't
Maybe I can't make what it may take to leave this thing behind
But I shut my eyes and cross each line and every time

Looking at a guy out here hollering my name
When last year I spent more money on spilt liquor
In bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made

Wheeling dealing, Limousine riding, Jet Flying, son of a gun

In the hood where there ain't no hope
Now everybody ridin' dirty like there ain't no soap
Everybody get to rappin' when there ain't no coke
Where the money nigga
Cop 44 a bird where I live at
Probably buy the whole load if you get it back
Fish scale when snapped rented rack
Little nigga you ain't stuntin' give that rental back, oh
I like fast cars, fast broads
And my last car was like a Nascar it go vroom, vroom
Then skrr, skrr before I blast off
She go up and down like NASA

Seen the niggas who shot him, laying in they own blood
Had to wipe Mama tear's

It's time to confess my sins, 'cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I smoke weed, pop pills, but I'm thinkin' it's time for me to chill

Now people used to tell me that if you smoked
You'd lose your hope, and it would stunt your growth
I used to chip in with the other young folks
Back when it came in little brown envelopes
Remember the day my moms found a tre
Bust my ass and at night I heard her pray
Lord don't let my boy succumb to
But it was too late, I already begun to
Hanging with the knuckleheads on my block
Smoking in the lobby looking out for cops
Sipping Private Stock, now my eyes are shifty
Who got me covered on the next $2.50?
Nigga I ain't tripping, I passed out a few whippings
On deep throats in cheap coats who wouldn't chip in
It got me flipping, now everything's serene
Purple clouds and ultraviolet dreams

My old moms said that the smoke would harm
I'd be a crackhead or die with a needle in my arm
Tried to playy me out, my father was smoking that good lye at the time
That old grown man brown weed with my aunts in the back
I'm a little nigga now saying ""Why they acting like that?""
Coming out all high and laughy off some Richard Pryor tapes
Before he blew up his face trying to base
I was smoking weed when half the niggas with me now was fronting
When cats was anti-drugs there was weed seed in my rugs
I've been to the brown bags, the clear bags, and even the glass jars
I've been smoking with stars in parties and bars
I done got actresses high, the greatest athletes fucked up
Took some niggas from DC to the spot and they came and cracked a knot
And left the spot real hot, check it out
I get up in the morning, take a pee, and light up that good tree
Old girl often ask me why I always get so high
Because it keep me in touch and keep my shit on the smash
And I ain't down with Rudy G no more cause he done fucked up the hash

Guess that's why I prefer the chunky black

Tragic how this envy can turn you to a savage
I can do anything better than you
I wish I had what you had just a measure would do
Come bite the fruit ya it's good sin severing you
And now your wife ain't good enough any new one would do
Or your car or your job yeah your life seem wack
If it is the good life you still wanna give it back

A brother progress I give no congratulations
Maybe it's because I want the spot God gave him
Supposed to make Him famous while I wanna defame men
Crazy compliments are hard for me to say
I can't stand the thought of someone else getting praise
Wanting all the glory for myself what a shame
In the end it's really in vain like heroin
Check who I'm addressing no Vera Wang buddy
I thought we was supposed to be the same team funny
The Pharisees said Jesus did the same thing
When He tried to point 'em to the Father
On the tree's where they hung Him

They trying to be rich less I'm richer than you
The fun in number 1 is the point that I'm up in front of 2
I hate it when praises go to another dude
I grind to the T (teeth) to stay in front of U (you)
They should of put me on we raw
You feeling me though right? Okay
They should've put me on me raw for eons
I'mma need my compliments with E-S-T or E-R
It's best or better when it's prime time I'm Deion
That's why I get excited when I heard you slipping off

Momma want some more Obama in me
The hood want PAC hip hop
Wanna see the Common in me
And since it's a senseless contradiction
I end up a misfit trying fit in
This ends when I stand up
And see the hands that are standard
Holy is the lamb (Holy is the Lamb)
Now we holding you to man up 'cause we were made
In his image start looking at what you came from.

Right after Adam every atom in our anatomy had to make
Adamant after what Adonai is against
Let me take you back to the tree and Eden,
If you read it you'd see that Eve was deceived,
But Adam's the one who let her eat it (Man up)
Standing leading no, we ain't leading we (Bump that)
Basically little boys with muscles and a mustache!
The femininity, we need a remedy that God made a
100 percent masculinity

We the last, yeah
Where the men at, seems like they all lost,
None of them are on the scene, seems like they died off.
They extinct but my dream is to rise up,
We chasing the prize of the King, the divine boss,
But we fell away, now we ungodly
We lose and we really got the blues like Navi,
I want to celebrate the dudes that's beside me.
Fellas let's elevate, we through with the lies man.

They lie, go ahead say boy get your shine on
If a sucker try to block you get your 9 on
And what I heard you gotta do to be a man now,
Stand up for yourself so I took it in my hands now.
And that's the problem man we busy trying to solve it
All the while we walking dead man somebody bring the coffin, boy drop
Peach fuzz now you think that your a man 'cause you feeling yourself
You need to man up!

Sex and models and tippin' bottles
Pack a pile of excuses right next to your bottle caps 
A Rolodex filled with names that you aim to please
Next to the stack of money buildin' up a heart of greed
Ice on his neck, givin' jokers the cold shoulder 
You drunk off pride plus you loving the hangover
You gotta whole lotta stuff that won't amount to gain 
Life will never make sense because you never made change  

We got it twisted, sick like a fever
Lil' man live to stack dough, Keebler
Man up, get up out of that treehouse
Leave them cookies alone, it's time to eat meat now
Tryna show you a new way to live now
No charge, you can call it a freestyle 
Without Christ you won't know what a man is
You a boy in a man's body like Tom Hanks in Big

Being a man got nothin' to do with age
You can be a boy 'til the day you lay in your grave
None of us behave like the image of who we're made 
'Cause we fallen the ways it's better known as depraved 
Running from responsibility really we crave
The easy way out of places that call us to pull our weight
Man they blowing through every day decisions are made
Responding to the call God's giving 'em from the gate

Man up!
Let the process begin, separate the boys from the men
Man up!
Doesn't matter how you started partner, it's about how you end
Man up!
Jesus is the model follow us we go follow him

And lovin, my hospitality I put it down

With these big soft asses and these nice round titties 

While you gigglin you best a hurry your ass the fuck

(Chorus) 

No need for rest haven these hoes 

Lets, show 'em what they pussy made for 

Lets me and you lay in these hoes 

And, show 'em what they pussy made for

Man, just let 'em know I'm coming in bout 25 minutes

Tell 'em don't get too drunk and keep they pussy lips smilin 

[K.B.] 

These hoes wildin, but still I got 'em under control 

Impatiently waitin for some dick that's swole 

And just some horny ass bitches that love to fuck 

Tellin me how they suck dick and swallow the nutt (they gobble it up) 

I thought I told you about one of them hoes 

I put my foot inside her pussy and took it out and suck my toes 

Yo, don't forget to stop and get some fuckin duncoms, condoms 

Forget them nigga we got a problem 

[Devin] 

That ain't no problem man, you know we must cover our bones

Man that's too much pork

[K.B.] 

But she keep her navel clean 

And at least these hgoes big and cute not big and fucked up

So just drank and smoke this dank and lets fuck these hoes

Come on and, show 'em what they pussy made for (4x)",Show 'Em,1998
K.B.,"I think it was Friday night, I met her at the club
Apple Martini-ed up, smokin bud with my thugs
Then yo yo, there she was, très bon booty ( *French* )
Like Beyoncé no fiancé, let's keep in touch
I wanted to beat it up, cause she was a superbad
I mean with all that ass, same night hit it that fast
We at her mega pad, still diggin like a sav'
We poppin x tabs, the head was extra lav'
But this her baby dad and he don't live with her
And at his grandma's pad they left the kids with her
So that explains the pictures I see of this nigga
She says she's low on scrilla, she wanted gifts for her
So she can get her nails done and get her weave fixed
And I can't stand no nappy hair bitch
And so I break off bread, nothin but pocket change
She blew my socks again and then I hopped in the Range
And then she kept on askin for bread, like everyday
""My children need some aspirine, I got some bills to day""
Now what am I to say, cause Yuk, he love the kids
Puffy sell millions, but Yuk, he love the kids
So I broke off bread, I did it for the kids
Never trust a bitch, never think Yuk a trick
I got the slut dismissed, she got the dismissal
I ain't fuckin with you, bitch, you got too many issues

You got too many issues
Here, let me get you some tissue
No, I don't mean to diss you
But you want me to give you some money, quit actin funny
Baby girl

Time after time, rhyme after rhyme
I look around, some hoe after mine
But I'm just steady on the low, steady 'bout my flow
Why try to keep a hoe steady when they be steady wantin mo'?
I don't want no hoe all on my back, all up in my sack
Before I burn one, at every corner that I turn on
Hoe, get a life ? boppin' all night like you a nigga
Need to be at home with yo damn children
Like that shit was cool, well ain't shit cool
About your children missin school
Because you done cut a fool at the club last night
And you ain't ? six
Ran into a couple of ballers cappin like you broke them tricks
But them tricks make cheese, they pop bottles for fun
And you'll fuck one just to say you fucked one
How dumb can one get, didn't even break bread to get with you
And walkin round like you the fuckin shit, bitch, you got too many issues

You got too many issues
Here, let me get you some tissue
No, I don't mean to diss you
But you want me to give you some money, quit actin funny
Baby girl

Bitch, you get rotated through every crew like a tire from BF Goodridge
Cause you 21 now, what, you actin like a good bitch?
I'm tryin to get my nigga sucked cause he from outta town
You just suck his dick while I weigh out the pounds and then you out
What you mean you don't know, don't you need a little bread?
You can feed a starvin child for just a little bit of head
You suck a broke nigga dick but won't suck a rich nigga
He a white boy, little man, limp dick nigga
Three minutes and you gone, then I hit you at your home
Give you a little for your pocket, now your weekend is on
I don't understand, huh? Then why the fuck I'm talkin?
Matter fact I'm wastin time, huh, bitch, get to walkin
You try to help a rat bitch, she'll diss you on some wack shit
You weigh 125, how you still lookin fat, bitch?
Save them cheap ( ? ) yeah, I'm tryin to diss you
You a broke-ass, think-you-bad bitch and you got too many issues

You got too many issues
Here, let me get you some tissue
No, I don't mean to diss you
But you want me to give you some money, quit actin funny
Baby girl

Nigga, fuck yo broke ass
You ain't got no muthafuckin money anyway, nigga
Don't come over here talkin about I got issues
You got issues
Nigga, you rollin on stop
So don't even try to come over here
Either you pay me or don't pay me no muthafuckin attention
So ehm that's all this about over here
When you look my way I already know you gots to pay
All this issue shit, you can take that shit to the next bitch
I ain't the one, nigga
Please
Please believe it
Fuck that
Pay me
Yeah I got issues, so what?
I'm tryin to get fly, youknowmsayin
I'm tryin to go to the Century Club

So uh, what you workin with?

Egypt is still in our nature, it changes faces, face it (who liberates them?)
I'ma need more then they payin' me I don't need money I need a eagle wing liberty
Free indeed hidden deep is a plea, I'd rather die than be Steeped beneath tyranny

Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise

Triff mich mit Klampfe unter dei'm Fenster, Baby, ich sing mi amore
Seh' scheiße aus, doch ich ficke dich trotzdem, Nico, Nico, Briatore?

Deine Mutter verkauft ihre Fotze vor Aldi
Rein in den Club, Schwänze in die Höh’
Deine Braut hat meine Wurst drin, Cordon bleu, tötörötö

Du denkst du bist mit deiner Frau bei Ikea, denn sie hat sich in einen Schrank verliebt
Mit Messer und Gabel, die Schweinekopf-Maske auf meinem Gesicht durch das Fenster
Der Bonhoeffer raus in den Norden Berlins, vertrauenserweckender Tramper
Massimo-style, ich fahre mit Wodka im Getriebe
Von dem ersten Vorschuss kaufe ich mir eine Niere
Und 'ne neue Leber und 'ne neue Lunge
Tarek, bitte, bitte mach' ein Backup, denn ich hyperventiliere
Und wenn sie nich' ficken will, denk' ich mir Scheiß' druff
Nimm' den Penis und erwische sie mit einem Streifschuss
Deine Alte sammelt jedes Wochenende Pilze, aber nicht im Wald

Die Sonne scheint mir, mir, mir aus dem Arsch
Dein Album scheint mir, mir, mir ganz schön Scheiße zu sein

Salzsäure in meiner Wasserpistole, ein typischer K.I.Z. Schenkelklopfer
Hasse den Bunker, nach dieser CD bist du Untermieter in meiner Hundehütte
Häng' deine goldene Platte an die Wand, wir ham' Platinteller in der Unterlippe
Jetzt gibt es ein' neuen Boss in dei'm Haus, Tarek K.I.Z. hat das Schloss ausgetauscht
Du hörst zu über die Sprechanlage wie ich deine Schwester mit Salz und Pfeffer jage
Dein Papa mein neuer Geldgeber, meiner sieht aus wie der Hellraiser
Ich hole dich ab wie ein Feldjäger, Gott ist ein Schiri und gab mir elf Meter

Es ist zu heiß um es wirklich geil zu finden
Ein Schritt reicht, gleich tropft Schweiß vom Kinn
Pack mein Sack in Eis und da bleibt er drin
Die Stadt dreht ab, schreit nach Wind
Man ist platt wenn man draußen Zeit verbringt
Alle Frauen halb nackt im tighten String
Wenigstens ein Fakt von dem ich begeistert bin!
Ich hab Fieber, lieg auf’m Rücken
Ich brauch Waffen für ’n Krieg gegen Mücken
Ich halluzinier', hab trockene Lippen
Und träum' von Schneeflocken und Skihütten

Meine Fresse glänzt, bin durchnässt
Kämpf mich zum Kühlschrank, hol ’n freshes Hemd
Brauch kein Testament, auch der letzte Cent geht drauf
Ich kauf mir ’ne Air-Condition, denn:

Meine Stadt hat Fieber, sie tropft und klebt!
Wir haben schwere Glieder, der Kopf tut weh!
Wir sind wie ’n alter Hund der grad noch steht
Wir ham’s verzockt, verbockt, der Doktor kommt zu spät!

Dickes B. an der Spree
Der Winter tut gut, der Sommer tut weh
Sonne knallt, die Mülltonnen qualmen
Unter den Linden heißt unter den Palmen
Die Luft steht, über mir schwebt der Smog
Ich bin 'n Krebs, werd lebend gekocht
Meine Gegend: ein Sumpf, ein schäbiges Loch
Wenn es regnet verbinden Stege die Blocks
Ich geh zur Post, mit Machete
Verwandte aus Schweden schicken CARE-Pakete
Vorräte kosten Endknete
Ich klau meiner Katze die letzte Gräte

Ich baue meine Fenster zu denn es ist ständig hell
Scheiß auf ersten Mai, die Autos brenn von selbst!
Ich brauch ein Schattenplatz für mich und meine Großfamilie
Deswegen kämpf ich für ein Job in der Kohlemine
Gestern ham’ die Kinder in der Spree geplanscht
Ich steck den Fuffi in den Slip für ein Regentanz!
Sylt ist verschwunden steht in der Zeitung drin
Wenigstens ein Fakt von dem ich begeistert bin!

Ich gehe vor die Tür, es ist sehr heiß
Vielleicht bin ich morgen nicht mehr da, wer weiß?
Es macht mich geil das die Stadt so nach Scheiße stinkt
Und bis zu meinem Sack im Asphalt versink'
Riesige Menschenmassen pilgern Richtung Alaska
Die einzige Flüssigkeit in der Stadt ist mein Arschwasser!
Hyänen reißen trockne Menschen im Park
Spontane Selbstentzündungen jeden Tag!

Du willst wissen welcher Teufel dich geritten hat?
Ich hatte ein dicken Sack und du ein Hitzeschlag
Hydranten explodieren, Rentner dehydrieren
Ich steige aufs Kamel, erteile ein Befehl!
Und die Karawane sucht sich neuen Lebensraum
Berlin stinkt nach gestrandeten Spreejungfrauen
Hier leben Atzen die dich für eine Dusche killen
Die Straßenkatzen suchen und mit der Lupe grillen!

Ich springe nackt auf die Theke sie hat 'nen Kurzen bestellt
Ich such die Nadel im Heuhaufen bin zu behaart
Und schlecht bestückt wie ein ostdeutscher Supermarkt
Ich sammle Treueherzen auf der Reeperbahn
Doch mein Pimmel will nicht groß werden wie Peter Pan
Keine Frauen die mich verfolgen und ich wichs mir ein'
Ich hab 99 Probleme aber die Bitch is' keins
Er ist behaart und ungewaschen wie ein Hard Rocker
Du hast für mich gekocht und ich bin dein Zahnstocher
Das Nonplusultra keiner hat es so klein
Wenn ich was in der Hose haben will dann kack ich mir ein'

Mein Schwanz ist so klein er reicht nicht bis rein
Ich versuche deine Frau zu vergewaltigen und sie schläft ein
Alleingelassen mach ich ein Gesicht wie beim Kacken
Mr. Lover lover ich komm schneller als mein Schatten
Ich lieg unter der Decke, onanier mit der Pinzette
Und verliere das Interesse
Ich bin ein Exhibitionist – die Fußgängerzone ist tot
Los Schlampe, guck durch das Elektronenmikroskop
Sie nennt mich einen Schlaffi und sagt „Pack ihn wieder ein!
Egal, dafür ist wenigstens mein Herz aus Stein
Ich ficke bis zum Leistenbruch
Und spritzte dir in dein Gesicht voll mit heißer Luft

Es geht mir gut ich fühl mich als würd ich ihn baumeln lassen
Aber geht ja nicht er ist so klein ich krieg ihn kaum zu fassen
Ich krieg jede frau zum lachen, ich brauch ihn nur auszupacken
Einfach draußenlassen, wenn sie lacht scheints ihr nix auszumachen
Sie schreit trotzdem vor schmerz wenn ich ihn reinstecke
Es tut ihr weh sie sagt es piekst sie wie ne reißzwecke
Ich hab mehr spaß an meinem Schwanz als diese gut betuchten
Ich kann wie Sherlock Holmes mein' Pimmel mit der Lupe suchen
Er ist so winzig und bringts nicht
Was auch immer da grad drin ist ich bins nicht
Immer wenn ich nackt über die Straße renn
Schrein sie „da kommt Ken!“
Und dann sag ich Ihnen

Ich wollte sie schänden
Ich beichte im Gerichtssaal unter Tränen
Sie sollte blasen er reichte nichtmal bis zu den Zähnen
Werd ich dieses Jahr mit einer Penispumpe belohnt?
Der Weihnachtsmann lacht sich über meinen Wunschzettel tot
Nach der Hochzeitsnacht kein Blut auf dem Bettlaken
Dein Jungfernhäutchen intakt, obwohl wir Sex hatten
Mit ""Riesenglied"" ham' wir euch nur verarscht
Ich starre voller Penisneid in das Gurkenglas
Binde mein' Schwanz mit 'nem Faden an der Türklinke fest
Knall die Tür zu in der Hoffnung, dass er irgendwann wächst
Und du kannst mich nicht schocken mit deim' Tritt in die Nüsse

K.K. Martin,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Might hug a bit, or touch
A bit, no fuck the gift

Funny how we both know
I put that pipe down, but

No sound
You make me a better me, a better me

On the pillow case

'Cause she give me smoke and she
Give me fire

Would you like to go for a ride in the country with me?
I'm celebratin'. 
Ya see the four-wheeled beauty you're leanin' on
It finally belongs to me. 
I've never owned a car before,
And I've never picked a boy up at his own front door.
It'd be a red letter day 
If you'll come out and play in the country with me.

Hey Bobby.
Will you ride a little ways down 299 to a lovely little spot I found?
It's on a hilltop.
We can park in the shade and dance on the ground to a radio
station where the hits don't ever stop.
Watch the sun go down.
See the moon rise up.
Drink a champagne toast in a plastic cup.
Rock the night away, lookin' at stars, talkin 'bout cars
Bobby, with me.

Hey Bobby. 
Do ya wanna huh?Do ya wanna huh?Huh?
Do ya wanna huh?Do ya wanna huh?Huh?

Do ya wanna huh?Do ya wanna huh? Huh?

When ya need a good memory, Bobby, think about me.

When I left here this morning 
I was bound and determined 
I was never gonna come back 
Never, never, I was running 
I was running from you darling 
I was running from my job 
I was running from the kid in me 
He never knows when to stop 
Got as far as the edge of town 
Then I turned my car around

K.T. Oslin,"Well, there's a nursery rhyme,
It's a favorite of mine.
About a little girl and some sheep
That she could not find.
They told her not to worry,
They'd come back.
Darlin, you're my shepard,
I'm your little lamb.
But you ain't always gonna know where I am,
But don't you worry, I'll come back.

I'll always come back, come back baby, to you.
I'll always run back, straight to you.
I'll never get too far away from you.
I'll never get too lost that I can't be found.
And I'm never gonna swim too far out, I might drown.
And I'll always come back, come back baby, to you.

Well there's a wooden wonder from way down under,
They call a boomerang.
If you handle it right, it'll come back.
But, you must have had one when you were a boy.
'Cause you've got the touch that turns me into a toy.
And like a boomerang, I'll come back.

Keep your eyes on the horizon.
When you start to missing me,
Just look out your window and there I'll be.

'Cause I'll always come back, come back baby, to you.
I'll always run back, straight to you.
I'll never get too far away from you.
I'll never get too lost that I can't be found.
And I'm never gonna swim too far out, I might drown.
And I'll always come back, come back baby, to you.

I can still see your head on the pillow 
I can still smell your manly perfume 
I can still hear your heart, heart a-beating 
Honey long after you?ve left the room 
I?m thinking about you when, when I?m working 
You?re breaking my power to concentrate 
Oh, better be careful ?cause I might get fired 
For thinking ?bout the fire we started yesterday 
(Chorus:) 
(This woman?s in love with you baby 
This woman don?t think you can do no wrong 
But I feel it?s only fair to warn you 
This woman don?t stay in love for long) 
And I will swear that I love, love you forever 
And when forever is over I?m gonna be kind 
?Cause I don?t see any reason 
To leave a heart all broken and bleedin? 
Especially when that bleedin? heart might be mine 
?Cause one day I?ll roll over 
And it?ll be over simple as that 
One day I?ll roll over it?ll be over simple as that

Happened so naturally

You holding me close

Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist

I need this feelin'

Then you put your charms around me

And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

K40,"It's not usual, the game be, all up on some South shit
Straight west coasting, you can tell by my outfit
Red 'nati fitted, ""Blood in, Blood out"" shit
Empty jelly jars, nigga, bird in the couch shit
The mad rapper, Oscar the Grouch shit
Except when I'm hopping out of cans, I'm pulling out shit
Dippin' the four though, double X 3-D Polo
If hip-hop was the league, I'd be the motherfuckin' logo

Your last shit was so-so, you should sign to Jermaine
I've been hard since I was solo
Niggas they feel my pain, I make it rain without the strippers
Go against the grain, and push your shit back like some clippers
I bang and then I hang out at the Staples like Blake Griffin
You can tell I'm getting money the way that glass house is sitting
I mash out the strip then like Nash when I'm dippin'
Feeling like God's son, the way that it was written

[Chorus]
Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn it down, turn it up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
'Cause I got another ounce up in the stash
Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn it down, turn it up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
'Cause I take two hits, and then I pass

I see the cops in the rear view, 
Why can't a motherfucker chill in the car
Feelin' like Missy, why you all up in my grill
They must know that I got bird stashed all up in my grill
Camouflage by the armor all while it's sparkling off my wheels
And I fuck hoes that prey on Dwight Howard and Shaquille
Not them throwback rats they be on showin' on college hill
For real, I think my first album sold five mil'

And you say to yourself that he is broke 
Well how the hell am I ballin', like Spalding
I did a couple of movies, now agents calling and calling
Can't get to the phone right now because my boss is all in this bitch mouth
When did we start taking these tricks out?
Now she gon' run her big mouth and tell her girlfriend
You had her all up in the wind blowing yo cheese on Louie Vuittons 
And now that bitch is in the wind and after the next draft, 
She gon' start that cycle again
How you claimin' that bitch when she with him, come again 'cause

[Chorus]

Daddy fat sex, my balls are on your chin, 
But can you tell me where my dick's at?
Gat or ghetto, head hunter, head buster through the chit-chat
I skip to the lou, my darling bring the thunder, 
I'm the lightning that strikes twice
Motherfucker, call me master
'Cause I run the plantation and I'm whooping niggas asses
If they disrespect the presentation, below the Mason-Dixon, 
We facin' the basses that were missin' pimpin'

You can embrace it or come face to face with total devastation
My mojo is never fadin', I'm in my Optimus Prime transform
Switch it up, heat it up, speed it up, that means I'm gone
Light years, ahead of your Buzz, Toy Stories and club songs
Black home, the A-T-L-iens are phoning home
But I feel like a librarian,
'Cause style's are being loaned out like books
A castle full of crooks, rape and pillage
They'll do anything for money while misleading the village

[Chorus]

Not from New England, but I pack a patriot
Not from Atlanta, but I got the cater
Not from Chicago, but I'm a bear
I'm a bay area nigga, 49er, Raider
I'm about my bread man, I ain't no sucker
Now these bitch ass niggas soft as table butter
I'm about my riches, magazines, street hustler
You can ask your uncles, daddies, mothers, and your older brothers

But I used to flee through that yellow white, yo right
Sellin' that shit below the retail price
I'm a rare breed like the bike club, get it right
Desperado like Tori Amos, shout out to dynamite
I got my red cup, and some green
What kind of green you smoking pimp? Blue dream
My nigga let me hit that there hemp, do your thing
How many woofers in your trunk? 4 15s

[Verse 1:]
In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
He stepped into the streets and walked up to this girl
He had a cap tooth made of gold
He had an earing in his nose
And her looks, that a night he liked to twirl
And he says:
""I love the way you look at me, I love your smile
Why don't you come and talk to me just for a while?
Give me your love, oohhh give me your love
Why don't you come and talk to me, give me your love?

And now the hours go by fast
And memories come from the past
As he tells the girl the story of his life
You see a long long time ago
He fell in love, but let her go
And if he had the chance again, she'd be his wife
And he sings to her nightly, he says
""Lydia, oh Lydia, I wish I didn't get ridda ya

There's some things I can't forget
Oh hunny why did I dis ya? (you can learn a lot from Lydia)

Now take a cup and walk away
To this secret hideaway
And our lonely man is at a loss for words
She says ""How far do you want to go?""
He says ""How far is to Moreau?""
And when they make love, this is all that can be heard
Silence, and then you hear

Aye aye aye aye aye, give me ecstacy
Aye aye aye aye aye, make sweet love to me

Footsteps, Footsteps, Footsteps, Footsteps,
Why did ya say goodbye to me
And now I'm lonely as could be?
And as I feel a teardrop fall,
I hear your footsteps down the hall
 
Walkin' away from me.
Why did ya say goodbye?
Why did ya make me cry?
Now ev'ry day I wonder 
Why, why, a-why, why, why, why?
 
You're such a haunting memory,
I pray that you'll come back to me?
But as I say my evening pray'rs,
I hear your footsteps on the stairs,
 
Walkin' away from me.
Why did ya say goodbye?
Why did ya make me cry?
Now ev'ry day I wonder 
Why, why, a-why, why, why, why?

Still the one -- that turns my head
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

I looked at your face every day
But I never saw it 'til I went away
When winter came, I just wanted to go (wanted to go)
Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow

You're still the one -- that makes me laugh
Still the one -- that's my better half
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You're still the one -- that makes me strong
Still the one -- I want to take along
We're still having fun, and you're still the one (yes you are)

Changing, our love is going gold
Even though we grow old, it grows new

You're still the one -- that I love to touch
Still the one -- and I can't get enough
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You're still the one -- who can scratch my itch
Still the one -- and I wouldn't switch
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You are still the one -- that makes me shout

Kaare Norge,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
'Relax' said the night man
'We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!",Hotel California,2000

So blöd kann keiner sein

Dann Mach doch deinen Scheiß, wir haben
Genug zu tun
Und keine Zeit für euch, wir werden dich auf deinen
Platz zurückverweisen, wo du hingehörst du Idiot
Wir haben wirklich schon viel gesehen, doch
So blöd kann keiner sein

Ist das zu fassen?
Jede Zeile bricht die Schweigepflicht
Straight aus dem Bauch entweder schrei ich oder schrei ich nicht
Könntest du mir freiwillig den Wagen geben
Sonst muss ich dich schlagen, treten, das ist mir
Schon immer scheißegal gewesen
Überfahr dich, park deine Scheißkarre in Holland
Könnte einfach so am Zollamt vorbeifahren auf'm Roller
Bring das Weed nach hause, erzähl nix von Weedverkaufen du Fisch
Du kannst viel behaupten, doch du existierst überhaupt nicht für mich

Ist das zu fassen?
Ich will wirklich nicht cholerisch sein
Doch wenn ich spitte wirkt sogar Kinski gegen mich pflegeleicht
Ich knebel deinen Eselarsch
Mach wirbel in Amerika
Asien, Europa, den Mond erober ich nächstes Jahr
Wenn du zu frech wirst vergrab ich dich im Rasen, Ficker
Ja ich bin ein psychopatischer Killer, ein Wahnsinniger
Dein Label dehnt deinen Anus, du kommst dir wie 'n großer Star vor
Du hast jetzt Top10 Hits aber dafür hast du so ein Arschloch
Du bist fake, phony und du lügst in deinem Text
Image kann Realität nicht ersetzen wie Cybersex
Dein Produzent bitet Timbaland seinen Sohn
Ganz ehrlich, so ein Arschloch ist verantwortlich für deine Produktion?
Nich dein Ernst, ihr seid sehr behaarte Hinterwäldler
Und im falschen Beruf wie ein pädophiler Kindergärtner
Du machst auf Zuhälter und sagst du hättest 50 Huren
Suchst aber gleichzeitig deinen Penis mit 'ner Wünschelrute

Ist das zu fassen?
Du lachst wenn du große Schwänze in den Arsch kriegst
Doch du bist so bescheuert, dass du dir nichmal über die Konsequenzen klar bist
Dir fehlt die Basis, der Stil und der Flow
Ich und Rap sind wie Friedmann und Koks
Einfach untrennbar, undenkbar wenn es anders wär, gib das Lenkrad her
Du dumme Sau, du wirfst dein bisschen Grips aus dem Fenster
Nein, nicht der Henker, ich bring dich kurz um wie Kiefer und Co
Tu auf cool, doch du kommst nicht an wie 'n Athlet der den Start schwänzt
Und sag, was fürn Feature? Niemals, nein, leck mich doch am Arsch, Mensch!
Ich behandel dich wie im Zuchthaus
Quäl und verhör dich denn du störst mich
Auf dir warn mehr Gays als auf nem Friseurtisch
Und du bist des Wahnsinns, gehst zum Arzt
Weil du nicht mehr normal bist, tust als würd bei dir was gehn
Das is ungeheuerlich, was der mir erzähl
Ich glaubs nich, überhaupt nichts, von dem was er da bringt ist sinnig
Denkt dieser Punk wirklich dass er ein Pimp is? hmm
Was fürn Kerl, dass er nich merkt
Dass seine Bitch gerade mit mir Party macht
Ich hör sein Auto, spuck sie noch einmal an und dann hau ich ab

Dann mach doch deinen Scheiß
Dann Mach doch deinen Scheiß, wir haben
Genug zu tun
Und keine Zeit für euch, wir werden dich auf deinen
Platz zurückverweisen, wo du hingehörst du Idiot
Wir haben wirklich schon viel gesehen, doch
So blöd kann keiner sein

Dann mach doch deinen Scheiß
Dann Mach doch deinen Scheiß, wir haben

Wir haben wirklich schon viel gesehen, doch
So blöd kann keiner sein

Ich mach live on stage die Action, dass die Atzen 'n Gang raufschalten
Doch Fusi kennt den Text nicht, bitte sag nur er soll's Maul halten
Diese Rapfans sehen mich, fackeln nich lang
Und fragen nach Autogrammen, ich bleibe freundlich und sage: Fass mich nich an!
Halt, ich bin eigentlich ja gegen Gewalt, verstehst du?
Doch red jetzt weiter und ich geh dir an Hals, verstehst du?
Homie, komm stör mich wenn ich schreibe
Fick mein Weib bis ich den Text versaue
Der Moment is gekommen, wo ich dir in die Fresse haue
Nix wie weg hier, diesmal schlag ich dir in die Fresse
Homie vertrau mir, guck ich versprech's dir
Dein Jochbein, dein Genick und dein Rückgrat, ich brech's dir
Ihr Affen, was pimpen, rumposen und knete machen, ihr habt nichts zu tun
Doch redet von hustlen, ungeheuerlich

Ist das zu fassen?
Sagt der ungebetene Hochzeitsgast
Nachdem der Pfarrer fragt, ob noch irgendwer was zu sagen hat
Die Gäste und das Brautpaar schauen verstört zu diesem alten Sack
Und er legt richtig los du bist ja nich normal, du Idiot!
Ähm, entschuldigung, wir heiraten hier gerade ?
Ich hab so Sachen jeden Tag
Denn er meint, Liebe hält nicht ewig und dass das Paar da 'n Fehler macht
Doch die zwei nehm sich in den Armen, küssen sich und sagen dann
Liebe lebenslang, wir glauben dran und dieser Mann sagt:

Dann mach doch deinen Scheiß
Dann Mach doch deinen Scheiß, wir haben
Genug zu tun
Und keine Zeit für euch, wir werden dich auf deinen
Platz zurückverweisen, wo du hingehörst du Idiot

Y la bruja su vecina, tarde y noche, un remedio buscará
Porque el fuego no lo calma ni el ventilador

Que todo el mundo teme

Kabah,"Te encuentro
Cuando llegaste a mi vida cambio mi destino
Y sentí
Que juntos
Hemos crecido y creído
En un mismo mundo tu y yo
Es tu voz sin razón
Lo que me enloquece,
Es tu olor, tu calor
Me mantiene fuerte

Como te explico que te necesito,
Para encontrarme vivo y sentirme protegido
Como te explico que te necesito,
No importan las palabras, sabes lo que siento por ti

Recuerdo,
Verte correr por la playa con tantas miradas en ti
De noche,
Siento tu cuerpo en mi cama y a veces no dejas dormir
Compartir, descubrir
Todo en teoría
Entender que al final
Es una ironía

Aunque a veces que no me haces caso
Y me ves la cara de desesperado
Sabes que te gusta ser protagonista
Y tienes la facha de exhibicionista

A donde tu llegas tienes mil amigos,
Y es tu culpa si quieren conmigo
Pero si alguien se me acerca, lo dejas herido

Cuando llego a casa, saltas y me ladras,
Y en este escenario como te extraño",Te Necesito,2000

Como un disco empiezo a girar
Quedate cerca, cerca de tí quiero estar

Subo y esque no quiero bajar
Si amanece ya que más da

Hey, despierta la vida
Hey, tu corazón me contamina

Llenate de amor, llenate de paz
Que la música te ilumina
Tienes que entender que no hay
Nada más, es como es

Que la gente sienta tu felicidad
Abre más los brazos, ilumina
Tienes que entender no hay nada más
Es como es

Tiembla el suelo al oirnos llegar
Nuestra piel ya no puede parar
Muevete cerca, cerca te quiero tocar

Automático el cuerpo se da
Si tu boca en estéreo está
Háblame cerca, cerca te quiero besar

Hey, despierta la vida
Hey, tu corazón me contamina

Llenate de amor, llenate de paz
Que la música te ilumina
Tienes que entender que no hay nada más
Es como es

Que la gente sienta tu felicidad
Abre más los brazos, ilumina
Tienes que entender no hay nada más

Sacame de aqui, me dices porque si
Me vuelvo loca junto a ti, pero te pido mas
Me vuelves a atacar, cuando podras detenerme
Yo no sé que hacer, no consigo entender
Quisiera encontrar la llave especial
Para encerrarte why no dejarte escapar

Un dia si, un dia no
Un dia me rechazas why otro me besas con pasión
Oh, baby, yo te espero como tonta
Siempre aqui me dejas why te vas

Tu atracción fugaz, deja de jugar conmigo
Tengo que aprender a recorrer tu laberinto

One is for your belly
The other's for your mind

Day off on Sunday
When the rent is not behind

Day's in Mississippi
Movin' mighty slow
Like that old blackbird
Standing by the road

Able wind at times get rough
To just pick up and go
Further on down the line

Hey rich man, poor man
Beggar or thief
First one gets you down the road
Next one gets you grief

Last one gets you night and days
Of cotton pickin' peas
On the Captain's farm

She's found another, he says it's the end
To think they once tore down a wall of a door
Now they don't speak anymore

So he walks the streets, the few nights he can stand
Drinking her memory away when he can
Friends once would reach out to them from the shore
Now they don't try anymore

How does it all come to happen
That's not what love is for and if I thought it was
I would leave you in the morning
I'll sooner sleep on the floor

Not what you get in return, but what you give

Now they don't speak anymore

I cannot fly, I cannot fall
Like a tree that cannot bend

Locked inside me all these years
Grow up a band of gold and grow old
They are my greatest fears

I get them ramblin' blues
I get them ramblin' blues

Well the wino has a bottle
A hobo has his rail
A rich man has everything
A poor man has his spells

When he longs to leave his woman
The bills and all the kids
He's got a longing to be free to see
All the things he never did

Get them ramblin' blues
Get them ramblin' blues

Operator, operator, I'm dying to my last dime
Put me through to him
For I do believe I am running out of time
And use that time

It is a circle
Where the circle has no end
So a man should ramble around some long
The ending would begin

Kacey Jones,"Lord, his daddy was an honest man
A redwood Georgia farmer
His mama lived a short life
Having kids and bailing hay

He had fifteen years
And he ached inside to wander
He jumped afraid and weak cross
And wound up in a lake

Oh, the cold nights had no pity
On that way crossed Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry
And then the summer came

He met a girl know on the strip
At San Francisco's Mabel Joy
Destitution's child born of
An LA street called Shane

Growin' up came quietly
In the arms of Mabel Joy
Laughter found in mornings
It brought a meaning to his life

Lord, on the night before she left sleep Kane
And left that way crossed country boy
With dreams of Georgia cotton
And a California wife

Sunday morning found him standing in ease
The red light at her door
A right cross sent him reelin'
Put him face down on the floor

In place of his Mabel Joy he found
A merchant memory
Who ground your Georgia neckies red
But sunny, your still green

He turned twenty one
In a Gray Rock Federal Prison
The old judge had no mercy
On that way crossed Georgia boy

Staring at those four gray walls
In silence he would listen
To that midnight freight
He knew could take him back to Mabel Joy

Sunday morning found him lying in ease
The red light at her door
With a bullet in his side
He cried, abusing Mabel Joy

Stunned and shaken, someone says
Son she's not here no more
She left this house four years today
They say she's lookin' for some Georgia farm boy

Until the neediness was gone
In one another's arms
All through the night

As we were drawn into the flames

Oh, what will I do in the dead of the night?

When he turns out the lights
And he comes to me, he comes to me
What will I do to the need in who subsides?
Simply close my eyes and try to sleep

Oh, there are nights I know
When the lights are red and low
I can almost feel you
Reaching out to me

So I close my eyes and I let my memory fly
To a time and place with you
So long ago, so long ago

And my mama cried
When she realized

I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I try to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

God bless the girls who smile and hug
When they're called out as a runner up on TV
I wish I could, but I just can't
Wear a smile when a smile ain't what I'm feelin'
And who's to say I'm a 9.5
Or a 4.0 if you don't even know me

I ain't pageant material

They won't be handin' me a sash

I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it

I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I don't know what it's all about

And I won't play that good girlfriend you pushed
Around before

I can't do on my own
Not anybody's girl

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

Can't sit in my room
Can't close my eyes
Without thinking of you

Can't smell a rose
Can't look at the moon
Can't take a breath
Without missing you

It's such a beautiful thing
But it doesn't make sense
Without you babe

If I could I would make you love me
If I could I would leave this place
I'm the one who could make you happy
I try so hard but I can't walk away

Why can't you be here?
Why did you leave?
Is it my fault
You don't love me?

Why do I cry?
Why don't you call?
Why does it seem
You don't care at all?

You don't feel a thing
I don't understand
Why I need you, babe

If I could I would make you love me
If I could I would leave this place
I'm the one who could make you happy
I try so hard but I can't walk away

And you're miles away from here
I try to make waves but the ocean's quiet
Can anybody hear my SOS, my SOS?

Closing my eyes to the truth won't persuade you
And letting you hold my heart will only 'cause more pain
Whispering prayers in the wind cannot save me
'Cause I'm still holding on to what's been gone

That'd be nice

Crazy man's preachin' in the street in the mornin'
Sayin' white man's corrupted the world and Jesus ain't comin'
Seagulls are laughin' and I finish my coffee
In a little cafe on the corner of Rose and Dudley

The sand falls from my hand as I, I pick up my guitar
I lay out a blanket, kiss the sun as I sing words from my heart
You make your way to the place where I am and I'm like
""Hey, won't you come listen to me play?""

I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Ca-Ca-Cadillac Hotel
Spend the whole night under the stars singing to you
Until I melt in your lips, taste your sweet kiss of candy caramel
I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Cadillac Hotel with you

The evening sun falls into the ocean over Malibu skies
And I can't help but drown in the blue of your emerald eyes
You smile and say, ""Hey baby, won't you come up to my room?""
But I'm like, ""Just come with me, I know a place with a better view""

I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Ca-Ca-Cadillac Hotel
Spend the whole night under the stars singing to you
Until I melt in your lips, taste your sweet kiss of candy caramel
I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Cadillac Hotel

The moon lights your face in the dark of the night
I pull you in with my sweet lullaby
The city is sleeping, I'm melting inside
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I wanna see the sun rise, taste your lips, taste your lips
I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Ca-Ca-Cadillac Hotel
Spend the whole night under the stars singing to you
Until I melt in your lips, taste your sweet kiss of candy caramel
I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Cadillac Hotel with you
",Cadillac Hotel [Album Version],2006
Kaci Brown,"Dark mascara on my eyes and I've got
My black shirt and my jeans fittin' just right
Val and I gonna kick it tonight like
Dumb dumb dumb - dumb dumb dumb

Leave to house in the car goin' to the club
Slide through the doors give my girl a good luck
Gonna scan the floor to find myself my first stud
Dumb dumb dumb - dumb dumb dumb

[Chorus]
I'm an in I'm an instigator
Is that your boy? Girl we'll see you later!
I'm a try I'm a trouble maker
One boy - two boys - three boys - and I...
I'm an in I'm an instigator
And if he's cute then I'll take the waiter!
I'm a bum I'm a bum bum shaker
One boy - two boys - three boys - and I...

All the girls here seem to have an attitude
But there ain't no stoppin' me - I'm in a party mood
2am and the bass still kicks like
Dumb dumb dumb - dumb dumb dumb
My girl Val's hittin' it with the bad boys
And I'm shake - shakin' it with the shy boys
And we won't leave till we've had all the hot boys
Dumb dumb dumb - dumb dumb dumb

[Chorus]
