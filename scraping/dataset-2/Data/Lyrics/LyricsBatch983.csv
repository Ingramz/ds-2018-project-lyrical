Say Hi,"Apples for the innocent
My, my, do they taste good
They put fire back in your belly
They put notches in the wood

Apples for the innocent
My, my, do they taste good
I dreamt you gave me your key chain
You said, ""Pick one, ok?""

",Apples for the Innocent,2008
Say Hi,"Hey, remember when we could save kittens from trees
Or lunch on skyscrapers, bring the villains to their knees?
Maybe we should move someplace new
And build time machines to go and get us back

Back before we were brittle
Back before we were brittle

Hey, remember when all of time stood still
And really all you'd need was a peck from her?
Maybe we should trade for some physics
Or black market spines to go and get us back

Back before we were brittle
Back before we were brittle

Back before we were brittle
Back before we were brittle

Back before we were brittle
Back before we were brittle

Say Hi,"She'll go head to head if you want to
She got endorsements from Namco
She ain't afraid of no nothing
She ain't afraid of no ghosts

You go for the board, she goes for the points
And everything aches on you in the morning
And she gets so far they don't change to Bluetime
They just turn around

Yeah, okay, she's a pretty good player
Sue's harmless but Blinky's the sneak
She got pretty good first levels
One four six hundred

You go for the board, she goes for the points
And everything aches on you in the morning
And she gets so far they don't change to Bluetime
They just turn around, they just turn around, they just turn around

Say Hi,"Northwestern girls
With their fresh faces
Don't mess it up this time
'Cause they seem so nice

It must be in the air here
It must be in the air here
It must be in the air here
It must be in the air here

Northwestern girls
I'm all grown up this time I swear
At least I lie different
When you seem so nice

It must be in the air here

Say Hi,"And I haven't asked for much since I met her
Some courage and maybe some heart
But Jupiter, please, will you raise your fists
And mend all that keeps us apart?

There's the thing with her father, the thing with me broken
Her new jealous ex and the press
And each of them not much worse than the other
But still pretty bad nonetheless

'Cause there are spiders under my skin when she's not around
And there are spiders creeping 'round next to organs I need
And there are spiders under my skin when she's not next to me
And there are spiders breeding armies

Happily tethered to their funny spouses
With drooling babies on the way
With bright colored sweaters that grow in the dark
Can't you make us be more like them?

There's the thing with her girlfriends
The whole feeling nothing, the geography of it all
And each of them not much worse than the other
But still pretty bad all in all

And there are spiders under my skin when she's not around
And there are spiders creeping 'round next to organs I need
And there are spiders under my skin when she's not next to me
And there are spiders breeding armies

",Spiders,2008
Say Hi,"Just a lock of her and a jar of her breath
It might work this time, yes, oh yes
Hold your horses, your tremors and glee
Alright, alright, alright, alright

She's gonna love me
Oh yes, she will

Mix it in, keep an eye on your broth and your watch
Sometimes the slow simmer turns into a boil
I'm afraid it's the only way this can end
Alright, alright, alright

She's gonna love me
Oh yes, she will

She's gonna love me
Yes, yes, she will

",Toil and Trouble,2008
Say Hi,"So far, we're so far from home, we lost the albatross
It made me think of you, yeah, I need something new
And now the stars are up and so I wish you were with me

Light me up like a hand held something, anything really
'Cause all my pictures have oxidized
And fountain of youth you've failed me for the last time
And now the stars are up and so I

Now the stars are up and so I wish you were with me

",We Lost the Albatross,2008
Say Hi,"This is it, it's the key to it all and besides
I'm so tired being sick all the time
They said don't get a first gen but it's nice, it's so nice

And you can come push the buttons if you like
Just be gentle, I'm still
Making sure all the functions are right, are all right

But this new heart of mine goes from zero to love in no time
This new heart of mine
And this new heart of mine goes from zero to love in no time
This new heart of mine

So the salesman said he got one for himself
A charmed life with some kids
And some stainless steel knives

Paid in full as of 2029
I'll need to scrape all our change and give up all my toys
But really who needs more than this thing?

But this new heart of mine goes from zero to love in no time
This new heart of mine
And this new heart of mine goes from zero to love in no time

Say Hi,"They wake up early and scour the town
For me like us with our heads down
So their dance cards are punched with holes
From now until their covers blown

All the pretty ones
Oh, whoa
All the pretty ones
Oh, whoa

They meet in secret and swap their notes
And talk about who's broken the most
With legs as long as galaxies
Talk to make planets with seas

All the pretty ones
Oh, whoa
All the pretty ones
Oh, whoa

You'd think we'd maybe learn a thing or two by now
But I don't see how, but I don't see how
When hips just make the slightest twitch
We fall down

Say Hi,"When the devil grab my number 
When the devil grab my size 
When the devil got my hair 
When the devil got my eyes 
I've been trying hard to get 
See if he makes it through my heart 
Cause I wanna make it back when the dark dark dark 

It used to be just my house 
It used to be just my tongue 
But the devil got it all,
I wanna make it back from the dark dark dark 

See the devil got my address 
The devil got my car 
And the devil ain't no lie

Say Hi,"Remarkable as it seems
Turns out the night was much shorter
Than you wanted to believe
But we're only in Dakota dots on maps
En route to bigger cities

And the ebbs of traffic patterns recede
And we played our only record front to back
Infinity
When it's dark like this
All that I can see is the whites of her green eyes

When she says,
""Oh, tell me, this is all it's gonna be?""
And I say, ""Oh, I don't know just how it's gonna be""
And she says, ""Oh, tell me, is this all it's gonna be?""
There's a trigger somewhere, let's pull it
There's a trigger somewhere, let's pull it

Thinking back to all the days when we were kids
Playing games and dropping hints
And getting wide-eyed at a glimpse
But now you're about as turned on
As a bottom feeder likes the sun

And the twist is finally gone up with the rest
Like some long extinct creature
That we've never seen in flesh
And you suppose that ever reigning champ
Eventually meets his better

And she says,
""Oh, tell me, this is all it's gonna be?""
And I say, ""Oh, I don't know just how it's gonna be""
And she says, ""Oh, tell me, is this all it's gonna be?""

Pick up the cleaning and hide all the kerosene well
And don't flinch when you make sure your posture's the same

For the sparrows first flight.

And all the good times to come.

She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.

Lovin' her good-timin' man.

The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,

But she does the best that she can.

She loves her good-timin' man.

I'm shaking with the heat of my need again
It starts in my feet, reverbs up to my brain
There's nothing I can do to revert the gain
I'm looking down to the street below
There's nothing in the way, they move to show
They too, know what I know
They too hunger for the beast below
Listening to the radio I feel so out of place
There's a certain something missing that the treble can't erase
I know you can tell just by looking at my face
A word about my weakness

I'm totally addicted to bass
Wow woah ho
Totally addicted to bass
Wow woah ho

There's nothing I can do to be cool
I don't sleep 'til I've had my fuel
It frustrates if I am deprived
A hunger that grates from deep inside
I feel like I'm doing time
Imprisoned by dependence on a rhythm sublime
In my mind I must overcome the need to define
The solitary silence of a faceless crime

Standing by the stereo I'm feeling so alone
My back against a speaker and I'm moving on my own
Surrounded by so many and they're staring at my face
They're picking up my problem

Your bassline has got me feeling fine
It's filling up my mind

Sunrise at my window, I look down on the street
People I see everywhere are tapping their feet
Suddenly I realise in a look that I was wrong
Everybody's groovin' to their own song
Down at the scene below
There's something in the way they move to show
They too, know what I know
They too hunger for the beast below

Rhythm's running over me to wash away my fears
The backbeat of humanity it sweetens my tears
There's something that's connected us down throughout the years
No need to feel so lonely, everyone's addicted to bass
Wow woah ho
Everyone's addicted to bass
Wow woah ho

Nosotros las tenemos
Esta noche viviremos porque ya
No volveremos a vernos mas

En el pasado de mi vida
Tres cosas lleva el alma herida
Amor, pesar, dolor

Hoy vas a entrar en mi pasado
Why hoy nuevas sendas tomaremos
Que grande a sido nuestro amor
Why sin embargo ay, mira lo que quedo

She grows in their minds

She's so fine
She grows in their minds
Into the light she conquers the world
A moment so wonderful
A diamond so precious
A beauty beyond compare

She's so fine
She grows in their minds
They look into her eyes
And feel so surprised
As she crawls under their skin
They're ready to die for
The miracle in July

She's so fine
She grows in their minds
In their minds

She speaks no words
But they know what she says
Just by looking into her eyes
It's just a God given gift
That they instantly get
Just by looking into her eyes
They don't have to wait for her no longer
They don't have to wait for her no more

They don't have to wait for her no longer
They don't have to wait for her no more

Sing when you're near me?

Sing when you're close to me?

They say that I'm a fool

For loving you deeply

Loving you secretly


But I crash in my mind

Whenever you are near

Getting deaf, dumb and blind

Just drowning in despair

I am lost in your flame

It's burning like the sun

And I call out your name

The moment you are gone


Please tell me why can't I

Breathe when you're near me?

Breathe when you're close to me?

I know you know I'm lost

In loving you deeply

Loving you secretly

Secretly


But I crash in my mind

Whenever you are near

Getting deaf, dumb and blind

Just drowning in despair

I am lost in your flame

It's burning like the sun

And I call out your name

The moment you are gone


Tomorrow

I'll tell it all tomorrow

Or the day after tomorrow

I'm sure I'll tell you then


Well I crash in my mind

Getting deaf, dumb and blind

Just drowning in despair

I'm used to being scared, from time to time
Used to redefining, my way of life
'Cause nothing really stays the same
Nothing ever will

But lately I have come, to realize
That voice inside my head, belongs to me
Now everything is pros, and cons
Ignorance is gone

I'm clinging to my timeâ?¦

There's something in the air, I breathe tonight
Everything gets stock, in black and white
Everything is ups, and downs
Every single thing

(Chorus 1)
Back in the days, when we were Gods
And we took everything for granted - for granted
And we were wild, and we were young
We bent the rules, and took our chances - our chances

But I'm not really close, to giving in
I'm fighting every pound, and every inch
Losing every day I live
Every single day

But I don't wanna feel, the way I do
I don't wanna say, the things I do
I just wanna stay right here
Blinded but sincere

(Chorus 2)
These are the days, when we are Gods
And we take everything for granted - for granted
And we are wild, and we are young
We fuck the rules, and take our chances - our chances

There's something in the airâ?¦
There's something in the airâ?¦

As before we went cruising in a high speed lane
I'm still dreaming of open sky open road

The grass is not greener on the other side
I know by now, 'cause I walked the red carped and died
There is so much more to life than what meets the eye

We're running wild on the ocean
Running wild

Brilliant sky all over
There's a brilliant sky all over these days

And I thought I was safe on this one-way crusade
But reality claimed my heart and my friends
Now this is day one in the rest of my life
And I'm feeling all grounded and my spirit is high

And I'm longing for open sky open road

Communication is breaking down
Empathy is nothing but a myth
So tell me who you really are

And our world is no more

From coast to coast
From flag to flag

I try to look the other way
Reflect myself in eyes of those I love
They tell me who I really am

Flash
And our world is no more

From coast to coast
From flag to flag

We're standing close now, to breaking up

About to give in

I surrender myself
Into the arms of a beautiful stranger
I surrender myself to you - to you

Saybia,"
Caught in a well
Between heaven and hell
It's getting lonely out here
Highways and hotels
And headliner shows
It's all just making me sad

Sorry if I ever let you down
I never meant to
Stayed inside the only world I knew
'till I forgot
That nothing is as beautiful as when
I am with you
And life isn't life out there
Without you here

Just when I thought
There was nobody out there
No one who quite understood me
I glanced to the side
And I found you there smiling
Patiently holding my hand
Saying over and over
It's ok love
Easy love
I'm here

So finally I'm ready to reveal
What my heart tells me
Bring out all that's good inside of me
And let it shine
Knowing that I'll never be alone
While I'm with you
And that life isn't life out there
Without you here

Just when I thought
There was nobody out there
No one who could quite understood me
I glanced to the side
And I found you there smiling
Patiently holding my hand
Saying over and over
It's ok love
Easy love
I'm yours

With hidden frailties

Is gone

In a world of loneliness
Thoughtful thoughts
In a world, that's moving on

In a thousand different ways
Got no time
To realize, what's going on
We're leaving home for good
We're leaving home for good

At the point of no return

Scream...

Scream for help
When nobody is around
Who is to blame?
Us? For being partly sane

To a bright, and sunny day

Would always go to work but wouldn't bother to call out

Defeat the king, be it right or wrong, I don't think I'm clean

My attitude mad, young and bad

Walkin' the streets, lightweight thinkin'
Plottin', worryin' my Mama to death

Began to acknowledge my bang ways

These are the last days
Carry no shame, everyday thangs

I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all, it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, ""What you gonna do? What you gonna do?""
I said, ""I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know.""
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me

Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
'Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors.

I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hard times
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they want to ask me,
""Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?""
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain

I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah)

Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battle scars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

Spend my last 5 dollars at burger king
I have no money have no nothing
Which makes it impossible for me
To take care of my dog properly (Domino)
I played in a game of basketball
At the park with some guys named Johnny Zee
At fat older man jumped on my back
And flared up an old high school injury
I'm still tripping off my ex-girlfriend
We broke up three years ago last week
I still write songs about that girl
But she has moved on very nicely
I wrecked my car, I ride my bike
But some asshole came and stole my seat

I give myself these wack haircuts
So its all uneven in the back

So now I only wear a hat
My label president says I'm fat
And I need to lose like forty pounds
And get some style in my wardrobe
And maybe audition for O-town

I can't pretend that it don't affect me

Check me in the darkest pitch of night
Ooh, it keeps me up, I say my goodbye
I can't guess how many
(No, no, no)
Will claim that they knew me so well

Seems like I've been here
Stayed here, right here
But there's no way for me to tell

Thought barrage made my head a psychological garage
And she's out there, I love her to death

Mental exposure, things I said, at 2 am, I know it's over

I know my brother loved his homie Ben
So your turn, man, this I let you flow on one more beat
I make it shine and I'll see you when I live on your street
This is my path now, I had to split town and do it fast now

I passed out and woke up with a whole new rationale
I kept it to myself, you couldn't accept it
So I left it alone and let it roll on my records
These are the airwaves of Evelyn

See, everything ends, it just takes a little longer
Don't forget I'm your friend
And I'll remember everything live, I'm no pretender
I know she's getting every single message that I send her

Who laid while awake,

Make a plan to enter matrimony, then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger, couple of kids, the minivans
Standin' in the stands, like a fan, watch her little man
Run ball, and everytime you see the family they look happy
Got her mama and her daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had a cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride, decide not to divide
Kept the yam and the pie the spouse in the house
Boy, it's cheaper to keep her, you fuck around and take a loss

I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat
That you dealing with now on ATLiens we was killing it
And then my auntie pass she was like my mother I was feeling it

But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and grandaddy on both shoulders steady chilling

It's yo birthday even on your worst day
Live it like the first day I'm Antwan Andre

Should've asked two free mans
I'll be back again

I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too
And you can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga big still hit the stage by himself and still rock
Cause when your faith is in the right place see he ain't gon let you flop
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy stop!!

Before you can say you can't get going
There's no excuse this time don't be afraid to fly
You never know what day the doors will close
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go

I saw just came from my mind

Is what this would be?
Without the decoders called the eyes
Bent into shape as thoughts define what you see
Losing its true form to human misery

Wait, resist the ones who feed upon your sorrow
Those who whisper lies to bring the veil in sight
Fate is not the guilt and failures of tomorrow
Fixed and carved in stone, there s nothing of the kind

You cannot really see me in this earthly dome
So avoid judging me, stay silent
Keep in mind that all is veiled
Only fragments of your mind

And I'm hanging on, hanging on?

This life?s so tough
One broken man has fallen to pieces
I'm feeling crushed

And if I do go on, who will stand with me
Will I ever look You square into Your eyes
Poisoned from this guilt, tell me is Your name
The healing antidote for my vanity

Scared of Chaka,"Back in Lincoln Park where I was mostly raised 
Hanging around town where I got totally crazed 
Surrounded by bitches who wouldn't give it in 
Who thought that getting down was an unnatural sin 
I'd whisper ""Baby baby help me, you really must, 
I need a healthy outlet 
For my teenage lust"" 

So I moved into the city to improve my chances 
I chased them at the bars and I grabbed them at the dances 
They'd huggy snuggle kissy but they'd never go all the way 
They'd cringe like in terror when they hear me say 
""Baby baby help, you really really must 
I need a healthy outlet 
For my teenage lust!"" 

Yes I do now baby, my teenage won't make 
Away much longer 
I really need release 
It means so much to me 
How can a young Midwestern boy 
Live in such misery? 

Then one day I had the perfect plan 
I shake my ass and scream ""Get a rock 'n' roll band!"" 
From now on there'll be no compromising 
Rock 'n' roll music is the best advertising 
""Baby I can help, you know I got the guts 
I'll be the healthy outlet 
For your teenage lust!"" 

Come on darling come on baby 
This teenage lust is driving me crazy 
I gotta have it baby, I can't do without 
When I got the feeling I got to work it out 
I ain't got no time, for messing around 
So come on bitch you've got to get down 
Come on darling come on baby 
This teenage lust is driving me crazy",Teenage Lust,1999
Scared of Chaka,"If you wanna mess around, just stay away from my door 
I've got a leak in my bucket and a great big hole in my floor 
But if you wanna stay around and love me

I've got no money, can't afford no big black car 
My bank account won't see me very far 
But if you wanna stay around and love me 
You know it's all right with me 

I'm sick and tired of being on my own 
But you know, I'll take nobody who's gonna leave me tired and alone 

So you see, I can only offer a man that's poor 
With frost and that trouble at my door

Scareface,"I would, never violate the codes of the streets
And I would never make a promise, that I know I couldn't keep
And I would, never testify, cop out for a plea
Or surrender information on my boys to the police

And I would, never pull it out unless I'm bouts to black
And I could, never forget my homies dyin' for they scratch
Forever pourin' out liquor for 'em, God send me back

Never come short on my issue, I'm on it every time
And I'll, never be past it, you better gimme me mine

And I will, never forget how I felt when I saw Brad

And it could, never be said I went out like a hoe
Never been punked, I'll never let it slide, never let it go
Never ever, never ever ever no
Get on my level hoe, or get a shovel hoe
It's never any question for my manhood I get down
I'll never switch, never snitch, never sit down
I'll never hesitate to squeeze a nigga six rounds
I'll never squat to take a piss, who's the bitch now
I never ran, I never will, I ain't never scared

And that's some of the realest shit that I done ever said
And I can die but through my lyrics, I ain't never dead
I'll never disrespect my momma, never disrespect her momma neither
I'll never turn my back on Jesus
I'll never get caught off in the system, cause I believe a
Man that follows man, ain't no man, and I'm a leader
Never go turncoat my nigga, I could never trade
I'll never cross my homies out, that I ain't how I'm made
And I never had not one regret, on how I was raised
I'm from the ghetto, where I slung and rapped it every day
Never knew no other way, this ain't gon' never change
Never gon' bite my tongue, FUCK what nigga say
100 with myself I swore to God I'd stay the same

I'm up one day, down and out on tomorrow
Right now I'm even more upset
Some shit that happened to me that I don't think I'll ever forget
You think I'll let it die, but I ain't
It ain't because I want to, it's because I can't
I'mma getcha but I ain't goin into it
Cause ain't nothin to it but to do it
See it ain't no sweat to me
Cause in the fo place, you fucked up the minute that you stepped to me
I'm not your average dealer
I'mma born killa

Now I'm livin where I can cause I'm homeless
Can't make point calls cause I'm phoneless
I ain't, I'm starvin duke
I can't go to mommas house cause mommas starvin too
Better grab that 12 gauge
Cause that's the only way a niggaz gonna get paid
I'm on my way to my old bank
They know me real good and they don't think that I'd gank
Had my gun in my trenchcoat
Now getcha ass on the floor
And don't think about pushin that panic switch
I'm gettin paid and you're gettin killed bitch
Take notes to the message I gave ya
Ya dyin ho and can't nothin save ya
I'm doin bad, so I'm goin bad
Huh, and you never expected that from brad
But there's a lotta things pressin me
And ain't the nigga to let the mortredresser dressin me
So I'm comin out winnin
100,000 in the case now I'm comin out grinnin
But the shit didn't flow smooth
The security guard had to run and pulla hoe move
He reached for his pistol
The 12 gauge went ""boom"" shoulda heard that motherfucker whistle
Hit him in his chest
Now which one a you motherfuckers in here wanna die next?
Nobody made a move
And I got away smooth

Scarface,"Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why..
His life was took at such an early age
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna
As he got older, he got even worse
Till a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle
The brother he was squabbling with, had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldn't survive, but hey
I ain't the one to speak up on another's
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldn't raise
And she will never see her father again, cause he's in a grave
I always think about it killer
""My daddy was a dope man, so I'ma be a dope dealer""
How will the family explain it?
""My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!""
He ain't around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid living foul fucks me up
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid, now she's realizing life is hard
A big time dope dealer's all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situation's got me guessing
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die

It was crazy how it happened
Some niggas rolled by in the Riviera capping
All I could see was a pistol spitting rounds
And the boy was just screaming as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled, get an ambulance
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance
You should've seen him, he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head
He just laid there in silence
And all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up
Followed by a law man and then came a firetruck
Put his ass on the stretcher
But if he survives, I'm willing to betcha
He'll be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK-47, M-11 and a pump
Rolled by ? on Scott Street
School was letting out,
""Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?"" ""watch me!""
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun
He shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street
The kids was just staring at each other
J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullard
His brother was just dazed in a shock, ""Why you do it?""
""Why you shot his moms Jay? Shit""
""haha man fuck that bitch""
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack, ""Hey yo J.D. homey""
Hung it up and rolled down Dagger
Heading for the nigga he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of being taken out on that day
Black boy, black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didn't fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired
A whole army came out
Twenty-seven niggas all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the acre
One nigga died in the park in the paper

I steal niggas and kill niggas, I'm the real nigga.
You up against a motherfucker with a quick temper.
I'm a born killer, in case you don't remember.
I got my pistol, but I got a different clip in it.
Click-click, motherfuckers, can you get with it?
You ain't the nigga that you thought you was, fool,
And now I'm after that ass on the cool.
It's all about survival of the fittest,
Nigga, you shouldn'a did this.
And now I got's to handle my business;
I got to get your ass up out the picture.
I ain't the nigga you want to fuck with,
Motherfucker, I wouldn't bullshit ya.
Now look at what you stuck with:
The last nigga in this motherfucking world you shouldn'a fucked with.
I'm leavin' niggas in bodybags.
You shouldn'a fucked with the Brad.
You punk motherfucker, I'm comin' agg...

Mr., Mr. Scarface, for the nine-trey.
Niggas packin' nines, fuck you, bitch, I pack an A.K.
Fully automatic, for you hos who want to jack this.
S.A. fool, and I'ma put you on your back, bitch.
Ain't no half-steppin', I'm comin' at you rough-like.
Shootin' to kill, 'cause back in school I had enough fights,
Whenever I bucked my knuckles up on a nigga's head.
So you can sling 'em all you want, but I be slingin' leg,
Cause like I said before, I'm a motherfucking dreadlock,
Putting fools in headlocks, giving niggas head shots.
And everybody in your motherfucking area
Is trying to scrape up some money, so they can help to bury ya.
But I can give a motherfucker about your family,
Because your family ain't my fuckin' family.
You should of thought before you stepped to tha
Nigga in black, standin' right here, next to ya.
I'm stoppin' motherfuckers from breathin'.
Just gimme a reason, and I'ma be squeezin'
The trigger of this motherfucking glock, pop-pop, until you drop
From these motherfucking gunshots,
And leave your whole fuckin' family sad.
Don't fuck with the Brad, motherfucker,
Cause Brad's comin' agg

Where the cocksuckers at, where the cocksuckers at?
(Where they at?  Where they at?) (There they go,) at my gat.
Cause I'm about to heat up, like a vet.
Chop shit down on your set and then jet,
And smash off in my soap box.
Cause I'm down for the dirt, and motherfucker said it don't stop.
Now, which one of you hos want to fuck?
Make your way to your truck,
I want to see the way that you jump.
Cause by the time you get your keys
I'm letting loose, motherfucker, lay 'em down, nigga, and get these.
It ain't shit for me to watch 'em fly.
So die, motherfuckers, die, motherfuckers, die, die.
I ain't no motherfucking good guy, dog,
And I don't give a good guy damn about none of y'all.
I'm from the state of the motherfucking, gunslingers,
Knockin' dicks in the dirt with just this one finger.
So get your ass caught up in this gangsta shit,
And I'ma try my best to make it stank, you bitch.
Plus you comin' with that fake drag.
You fallin' dead on your ass, you motherfucker.

Gotta keep my drawers up, shit's getting hard now
These motherfucking cops be planting shit on these niggas
Simply because these niggas got bank accounts that's bigger
I just can't get no peace from you motherfucking rollers
Every time I pull my Benz-o out, you pull me over
I'm sick of motherfuckers who be jocking Whitey's coattails
Blacker than a motherfucker, sweat me 'bout my dope-sales
Niggas just take your cut and get your ass up out my face
The only thing you probably get from me is a cock-sucking pistol case
Unless you plan on plantin a lil' something in my shit
Just because you ain't got shit, bitch!
Give em a badge and a trigger and that makes em figure
That they can fuck with a million dollar nigga
They got you mixed up, fixed up at the Segas, shooking Indo
Getting fucked up in the gank-hole
The only way you'll whip that motherfucker is when you whip that motherfucker
And we choke the motherfucker (Man, fuck that motherfucker!)
So when you hear my song and wanna get it on
You better come prepared motherfucker, you dyin with  boots on

Niggas getting caught, doing time, so they snitching
They picking niggas up on a funky ass suspicion
We'll be going down for some questioning we think
And end up getting hit with the fucking kitchen sink
Racketeer and laundering, Kingpin wondering
If they got some unsolved murders, then give him some of them
Just because we're niggas and they figure we're no smarter
We'll sell each other out, and start rattin' on our partners
They start bringing up shit that happened back in '85
And then comes the largest jury, bitch, they fuckin time!
You might as well play the state cause you gon' do day for day
And selling out your homeboys ain't the shit
Cos y'all gonna have to die in this bitch, bitch!

And dying with ya motherfucking boots on

I ain't saying ""M'am, yes M'am"" until you're signing me a check
So you can miss me with that motherfucking bum shit

Cause I'm a nigga these niggas just can't destroy
I'm on the hunt, so keep your shit low
But yo, I'm kinda slacking up, I should of killed you from the get-go
Nigga, but this is it
We could of talked it out like players, but now I'm on some gangsta shit
What possessed this motherfucker to try to punk me?
What possessed this motherfucker to tell me fuck me?
Guess he thinks that I'm a light weight
Hey yo, your shit's fucked up, so let me help you get your life straight
Cause niggas get they ass dunked
For fucking with me, I ain't no motherfucking punk
Punk, I got some good hands, but I prefer my gat
Now where you at, cause I'ma slit your cool-Aid pack
See, niggas got it all wrong
Some niggas fake the gangsta shit, so niggas think we all songs
They come up to a motherfucker joking, man
They want to test a motherfuckers boxing game
That's when they get they ass trunked
Cause when you're fucking with me, I'ma tear this motherfucker up
You're fucking with a dread
You're taking two to your head, I'm coming fed

They shoot, but they don't shoot to kill, so motherfuckers stray back
But I nip it at the bud
Because I'm not down for dying, motherfucker, so I go for blood
And let em know I'm on some real shit
Not with these fake motherfuckers on the team who won't kill shit
I scream it like I mean it
I mean it like I scream it, cause, niggas, I done seen it
Motherfuckers with the false nuts
Come with the static and they get they funky ass shot the fuck up
So I give they ass a big blast
Instead of turning the other cheek, I get dead up in this bitch ass
Cause yo, this shit is real life
I'd rather be piped up in a box than be running from a steel knife
So once I put your ass in the red
I'm going for the head

Ready to put my dick up in this bitch named Charisse cheeks
A dick-sucker's nightmare
I'm wanting some action, so I'm rolling through your hood and I be right there
I blew my horn cause I don't knock
The only thing that's on my mind is fucking this bitch and putting her ass out
But yo, this shit is breaking up
She's telling homie she don't want to fuck, so homie loc is breaking up
It just so happened homie see my low
And now he's madder than a motherfucker, especially when he see me blown
And now he's got some beef, too
But yo, I ain't gon' squab my partner over this freak, do
So I cut the shit quick
And said, ""Yo, we ain't gon' have to come to ? over this freak bitch
If you want her, you can have her
Because I got what I wanted, she sucked my dick, so, money, you can stab her""
But I said this to myself up
If I told homie I fucked his gal, then homie nut the fuck up
So I kept it on the down-low
And just laid back and watched the fuckin reaction of this clown hoe
But this nigga is a real trick
He's talking shit and wanting to jump off into some ill shit
So I told him fuck him
And if he came a little closer, then I would have to buck him
He came a little closer, so I gave him one
And left the motherfucker stunned
And right before I mobbed
I gave him one more for the road, just to finish the fucking job
So off with your head, bitch
Cause I don't fuck around with that 'return from the dead' shit
I'm making sure I get you good
And if you twitching like you still alive, homie loc, I wish you would
Cause that just gives me one more reason
To grab the trigger of this motherfucking pistol and continue squeezing
I don't believe in second ghosts
You only get one chance, and if you slip, then yo ass is smoked
Some niggas say they feeling this

Cause niggaroes ain't killing shit

I got a little problem so I'm writin' you a note 
A letter to the KKK from the black folks 
I'm tryin' to get it on  tryin' to check the grip 
And there goes officer cracker tryin' to sink my fuckin' battleship 
Turnin' on his flashers  callin' up the dogs 
Now my Lexus Coupe is flex surrounded by the hogs 
Snatchin' out my seats, tellin' me I sell dope 
Am I on probation or parole? I tell 'em fuck no! 
Tell me mister officer, what's the problem? 
What's the matter? 
Why you gotta treat us like scum? Is it that a 
Nigga's doin' a tad bit better than you? 
And brutality is all that you crackers can do 
And mark me up for resistin' yo ass 
When in reality officer friendly kicked my ass, damn! 
You over flex your authority too 
Put your foot in my shoe, and let me try on your boot 
So I can run it in reverse 
You can treat me like god, and I can treat you like dirt! 
The 22 years I been here I saw 
Motherfuckers disrespect god before they disrespect the law 
But yo I gots ta diss 'em 
Cause I refuse to be mislead by this ungodly system

I make yo mind doin' rap but I'm black doe, nigga

Just because you wear bags that means you care? 
You have the right to abuse and treat my people like

In the same streets that you killed me and my brothers in.""

Just because I'm young and I'm black I'm a target? 
You say I'm sellin' dope but you fake 
Cause young dope dealers flash cash and make mistakes 
And besides we ain't dealin' no mo' 
Look at my hood, we ain't killin' no mo' so 
Everybody's yellin' peace 
The only war that's goin' on is goin' on with the police 
Cause they ain't stoppin' with the bullshit 
If they could they'd lock us up with some chains and swing a bull whip 
Cause they figure they're the master 
And they can take you to jail or take your life's 
Them sorry bastards 
That makes me wonder why 
The five-o can determine if we live or if a nigga dies 
And to me that shit is bull 
Only god can take life but I still gotta watch the law 
It's bad enough I watch tahe next G 
But even worse I got's ta watch the motherfuckers who protect me 
They fuckin' packing gats yo 
They serve and protect, they don't respect 'cause I'm black hoe

I'm just letting a nigga know
You know

S.A. and 5th Ward forever, fool

Niggas watch your back cause here I come again
Rapping funky shit for the 199-trey
In 1989 I sold dope for a pastime
1991 they called that nigga Scarface
Started on the team when a nigga turned 16
Stacking that green selling dope to the dope fiends
Daddy seen a scheme, thou so it seem
Cause he hooked a nigga up with a nickel-plated triple beam
Had a lotta game with the beam, that's what it came with
Taught a nigga how to get to funk when it jump
If static jumped off, then I was down for the dirt
When putting in work I ain't no motherfucking punk
Down with my partners that a nigga fucked around with
Hunting for some shit to get up into and we found it
If you had a problem with a nigga we was down with
We rolled by your set and shot your whole click down, bitch
Niggas play for keeps in the city that I come from
Niggas talk shit from out of town, but they don't want none
If you think you want some, then go ahead and come
It ain't where you at, you stupid bitch, it's where you from
And coming through my hood is where you finding all the thugs at
Looking for some dope and they gon' show you where the drugs at
Looking for some trouble, well, a nigga's gonna plug that
Niggas keep they pistols up underneath they rug mat
Show your little ass, go ahead and let your ass show
Talking that shit, punk bitch, you better dash, hoe
Once I get it on it ain't no motherfucking holding this
Kinda fucked up that I'm a nigga that be chauvinist
Niggaroe, the heater want this fool to let the trigger go
But bitch, I got's to give you one to let you niggas know
I'm letting you bitches know

Front, back and side to side
I'm letting you bitches know

How a nigga back in the game I used to start shit
Mopping up the hood, making mtherfuckers squab
You fucked with one nigga out of the motherfucker click
You had to fuck around with the whole fucking mob
Cause niggas rolled thick and they didn't take shit
Quick to put that ass up in a muthafucking lynch
Whip it on your ass, then tie it up to a fence
And since we began it's been that way ever since
My niggas used to kick it up around the fucking pikes
Smoking swisher sweets, drinking Miller Lites
Taking turns heating up the motherfucking mic
And maybe beat a buster out his motherfucking bike
Crackerjacks kept a motherfucker on the hustle
Making sure my business stayed stead' trump tight
Hoes sell flippers, gave two for ten
And even gave up shake to keep my clientele tight
Before long I had customers out the ass buying flippers
Bearskin coats, tight ropes and fat slippers
Fresh fade daily, I had my own fucking clipppers
And all kinds of hoes on my cock sucking zipper
Hoes came in handy, but my money came first
Cause bitches get a ghost when they see a nigga's hearse
So if I ain't have shit I had a motherfucking ?
And could pull on my dick if worse came to worst
So if you got a problem with the way I run my business
Let a nigga know, so I can put you in your place
9 times out of 10 you ain't man enough to deal with
The born killing, dope dealing Mr. Scarface
Rougher than a motherfucker, taking no shit from a
Busta motherfucker who be flexing off the bullshit
Got my bull pump on all you bitch-made niggas
So let a nigga know when you bitches want to flip
I'm letting you niggas know

Front, back and side to side

I had to let you know I ain't that nigga you should toy with
So don't come in my face with that motherfucking boy shit
Never coming soft with that 'love, peace and joy' shit
Mr., Mr. Scarface, the real deal McCoy shit
Sending out a shot to all you busta-ass one times
Suck a nigga dick, or make a nigga rich
Cause you don't get props for what you doing for the cops
Except a swift kick and a mouth full of dick
Letting motherfuckers talk ass about your game plan
Just because you got a big gat you'se the same man
That used to get your ass kicked daily back in the neighborhood
Finally got a nigga back pushed like you said you would
Fuck it, I'm a nigga getting down for his cash flow
Down to down a hoe, I'm letting you niggas know
I'm letting you bitches know

Front, back and side to side
I'm letting you niggas know

Scarface,"It's a new day, ya know what I'm sayin'? 

A new day  brings a new problem to a brother 
And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother 
Cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke 
Either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope 
The lord he had a plan for me 
And with his help  my mother made a man of me 
Didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in 
Taught me how to save my little dividends 
So when I graduated I'd have a little school money 
But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy 
And flunked outta school with the flag pole 
And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul 
Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone 
Cause we was alone, and me I bought a death home 
My real pops he broke out with the style 
So I respect my step dad, for raisin' another nigga's child 
So now we livin' comftable 
Taught me the game and how to be responsible 
But back then I couldn't see it 
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin' 
And ended up in a big fight 
And told me not to come home until I got my shit right 
So now I'm livin' in my grandma's home 
My grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own 
And keepin' me ain't no big deal 
But now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels 
Being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no 
Even though my grandfather just had a stroke 
And now the money's low 
And pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go 
Or either try to find a job so I can help out 
I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out 
And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way 
So my family can have a better place to stay 
I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short 
I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope 
And now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong 
She just prayin' for me heavily 
Take care of her grandson 
And the lord must of heard her prayer 
Cause he made me get a grip 
And got me on up outta there 
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya 
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then 
But now I feel ya

I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun 
My baby's mother just had my first son 
May eleven, I never will forget the day 
A star's born, let's name him little Scarface 
My first born and yo I'm a proud father 
I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father 
And selling dope ain't the way that I can get ahead 
But what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed 
I buy him milk, and pampers trying ta do my part 
And he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard 
I buy him clothes, and jewelry not the Tonka toys 
Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy 
And I don't want my son to look at life 
Through a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like 
But yet and still I let my son be a kid 
Just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did 
So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate 
The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate 
And now my son is four years old 
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role 
Because these years he'll remember most 
So it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close 
But I got a bunch of obstacles 
If it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle 
Now everybody's got my baby 
Wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy 
""It's your daughter, don't she look like you?"" 
I just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma do 
Because my mother knows the real deal 
All these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal 
So now we in and outta cope 
Tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support 
Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me 
Now everybody knows, that she was just fakin' G 
Come to find out, the girl never had me 
She's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy 
And biological tests can prove 
You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude 
But now I finally got a real daughter 
No need for the testin' 
I know that I'm the baby's father 
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya 
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then 
But now I feel ya

I feel ya

Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life 
It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife 
And got a bigger stick to fight with 
I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick 
Because we livin' in a concentration set 
And everyday, we face to face with death 
I seen my homies go and come 
And judgment day is just something we can't run from 
So I know my number's comin' up 
So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up 
And even though I hate killin' off my own kind 
I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine 
My brother corners trying to keep the neighborhood at peace 
Don't fight each other, we got's ta stand and fight the beast 
So united we stand but we gonna fall quick 
Because we always trying to take another brother's shit 
And the cops is in the same vote 
Just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope 
They shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods 
They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood 
And now the story's all twisted up 
And if they gave the cop the chair 
I really wouldn't give a fuck 
Because she left my partner's family with memories 
And after hearin' this I know you don't remember me 
But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch 
I see his parents and then I started breakin' up 
Because I know what you did was wrong 
But you won't realize until you dead and gone 
It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning 
You straight up shot him from behind 
But all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back 
You give a gat to a black he don't know how to act 
But you gotta tell your story to the judge 
Not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves 
And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness 
Then in reality you took care of your business 
But regardless I know you want to kill me 
But I ain't going' out like that 
Ya feel me? 

Yeah",Now I Feel Ya,1993
Scarface,"[DMG]
Call me psychotive but I'm bad, nigga yo!
And I'ma do ya bad, black
And when I come, I'm bustin up niggas to hear me, black
Ya should of never let a nigga see
If there was niggas and bitches and bitches and niggas that hated me
Huh, I waited for my date to come-of-age
And now I'm of-age I can't escape the fucking front page
So I guess that nigga D is up to hit again
I kicks the funky shit and coke, and stupid like I'm Gilligan
I'm P, supposed to hit a lick for a jack
The only thing I gained is the pain of niggas coming back
Nigga looking for they shit, aggravated and pissed
Niggas they can't fuck with my clique
I'm here to break em off for chunk
A D-E-A-T-H-L-Y, a motherfucking punk
And I be rolling with the brass
Don't answer with the ziggers in your hood, he break your neck to roll apass, nigga
Don't even stop to say ""What up?"" cause I bust for the fuck
And pay some quick to light a motherfucker up
Next time you stop me on your block, I hope you leave the place
Or be the next to meet the Lord face-to-face
Nigga, I ain't the one to take no bullshit
Cause see a nigga like the D is game to empty out the full clip
So when I come for ya, act like ya know
Sitting motherfucking smooth to the curb but you don't hear do'

It's time to fuck em up, here it comes, blast, nigga!
Thump to your chest and they coming out your ass, nigga

Niggas G to kill but still I see that you don't hear me do'
So I'ma serve it to ya fat, hit the deck, mate
Hit the deck mate, call me Flipper when I checkmate
D-um diverting nine, Tre-9, full Glock, Glock
My Glock making sounds and it don't stop
So nigga pass the swisha quick
And I'ma blaze til the motherfucker burn me off my fingertips
'Cause, see a nigga gotta saty high
I try to smoke til I can't smoke and then I won't smoke
But still I got my fingers on my shit
And click, click, click, ya die, die, die, ya dead, bitch!
You tried to test the wrong nigga, be a tested
Straight from St.Paul but clocking G's down in Texas
Some think I'm talk 'cause I play it cool
But I ain't the average motherfucker, I do the shit that niggas won't do
Huh, like pistol whip a woodie for his bank
Then after that I gate and grab his bitch and do the samething
And I will pain up the asshole
Collecting grips on my drips as I stroll but you don't hear me do'

Ain't no mistaking what I'm bringing, you motherfuckers still ain't had enough
So I'ma continue to break you off for proper ass chunk
May it be 9, may it be a gauge, may it be a shank
Any way you come I'm in your motherfucking shit, mate!
Huh, a nigga busting caps, smoking fires
Quick to bring it to your ass and keep on going til your ass die
And it ain't no running down them backstreets
Cause I got slugs to catch em with Carl Lewis on the track meet
Huh, and still you want to test a nigga so

Push, push, push, push... 

Here it comes... 

It's - it's a girl 



{Big Mike:} 

1971 a young girl gave birth 

Only a child, bringin another child on this earth 

Only 15 years of age 

But comin from the ghetto, it won't make the front page 

See, that's the way shit go 

And to the government she ain't nothin but another hoe 

Thinkin all she want is food stamps 

Give her a check and let her hang with the school tramps 

And mama's gettin mad 

Cause now she gotta watch her little girl grow up fast 

Straight ghetto life, straight ghetto drama 

Wanted a baby doll, now she's somebody's mama 

And life is so confusin to her 

Askin herself why is this happenin to her 

So now she gotta choose 

Between a box of Pampers and a pair of new tennis shoes 

Never had to make that choice before 

Never heard a baby's voice before 

And the daddy ain't nowhere to be found 

Too busy bein a hoe around town 

He just fall into another statistic 

Claimin black men don't do shit 

But that's the way it is 

And little do they know daddy also sheds tears 

Cause he don't know what to do 

Be a father to his child, or run with a crew 

You might say: easy choice, be a father 

But why should he do it when his father didn't bother? 

Just another sample, I guess 

Of black men settin bad examples 

Thinkin deep about the whole thing 

Takes his last bit of money and goes to buy a gold ring 

And askes her to marry her 

Promise to get a job, so he can carry her 

Thinkin that's the way to do it 

But little do they know that there's much more to it 

'cause marriage is demandin 

It takes lots of patience and understandin 

But they go and tie the knot anyway 

And they'll be gettin their own crib anyday 

The first couple of months were alright 

A new crib, adaptin to a new life 

But then came the arguments 

And the constant fightin got em thrown out their apartment 

So now they gotta move in with her moms 

And that just adds to the muthafuckin problems 

Cause now he's feelin like he failed 

And while they asleep he grabs his shit and bails 

Smooth out the do', black 

And never takes another look back 

Now grandma's house is an unhappy home 

Now that daddy's gone 



{Scarface:} 

Daddy broke before I stepped in this muthafucka 

And left the job to be done by my mother's mother 

Raised up by grandmother ??? 

Cause my mark-ass daddy never came around for guidance 

So now I'm forced to stand up on my own two 

Cause mommy dear had to work three jobs, duke 

He didn't even want my friendship 

I guess the mark-ass nigga wasn't down to begin with 

Too lit to come around with his drunk ass 

And beatin up my mom with his punk ass 

And shit got dread 

I guess I shouldn't talk so bad about my dad 

So here it is, brothers 

If you gon' have babies, you need to father them muthafuckas 

Cause if you don't in due time 

Your kids'll speak about daddy exactly like I do mine 

So do yourself a favor 

Take your kids to the park, buy em shit, and they'll pay you later 

But payin's not the issue 

If you'd die right now your little kids wouldn't even miss you 

So put away your caddy 

Call your bitch up and tell her to make room for daddy 

Cause if you don't you'll be alone 

And the only thing they'll say about daddy, is daddy is gone",Daddy's Gone,1994

What, fade me how?

I brought my chopper and my hard hat
The shit's fucked up now show a nigga where the war at
Cause I'm about to clean house
Stick this a.k. up your ass and blow that fucker clean out
Cause you niggas in the wrong
You came up short and now we fin to get it going on
I ain't your average motherfucker
You step out of line and watch a motherfucker bust ya
Cause you done came at me the wrong way
I ain't no Clint Eastwood, nigga, and you done picked the wrong day
So bring your ass to the battleground
Rat-a-tat-tat, like that is how my gat'll sound
Avoid no niggas cause niggas be human
I squeeze the trigger and niggas be moving
Cause I don't point it in the air and pull the trigger (why?)
I'd rather point it at your ass and watch the nigga die
I gives a fuck about your team mates
When it's all said and done you're gonna wish you never seen 'face
You shoulda seen that lil nigga Brad
James through here, seen Dave and, yo that nigga bad

Don't bring your ass to my picnic
Cause I done had it up to here with all you niggas talking that bitch shit
So you better get your shit right
I'm from the state where you rarely see a motherfucking fist fight
It's all about the gun blast
So you can miss me with that bullshit you spitting with your punk ass
It's the diary of a born killer
Don't have to worry about me falling off this thang cause I'm a strong nigga
Doubt my regard of the hard
With niggas behind me from East Oakland to the South Park
I've got the mind of the man right behind ya
You can run, you can hide but I'll still find ya
Like I say there's no getaway
And I'm gon' have it where your family'll have to throw your shit away
It's the return of the real niggas
I'm prejudiced to a certain extent but still I kill niggas
I'll bust that ass on the fucking double
So push on with that ho shit, bitch, cause you don't want trouble
So get your ass up of my shoestrings
And let your shermed nigga do things

Hey, hey, hey where you fin to go, fool?

Come on, man, you want to rap, nigga?

Tell me what you see

Roamin' in my motherfuckin' hood and thangs
Seems to me my motherfuckin' hood done changed
'Cause niggas used to kick it with the rival gangs

And now they lookin' at me crazy
But off-brand niggas can suck a dick, because they can't fade me
And if it came down to the gun, black
I never cracked up on the pressure, 'cause I was trained for combat
So get yo' motherfuckin' boys together
I represent S.A., nigga, and we makin' noise forever
And gettin' paid at the same time
So you respect a muthafucka when a muthafucka claim mine
'Cause if you disrespect, you ass out
And they be rolling through yo' shit in the glasshouse
Actin' bad with the flashers on
Makin' niggas get they asses on
'Cause ain't no mutherfuckin' love for fools
Who come around this muthafucka trying to scrub, you fools
It ain't no haps on it, hops

Hollerin' at my homie at the swisher house
Scope a forty bag, and we hit the spot
Put my shit in park, and got up under the tree
Pull the swishers out and gave the ganja to three
Rapped us up a fattie, and we started to smoke
Eyes gettin' red, 'cause we higher than coke
A nigga chillin', 'cause it's all good
And we ain't trippin' on the bullshit, nigga, because we all hood
But other niggas don't want to see it that way
But all I got to say is: you don't want to see that S.A.
Because we're all upon a mission
Killin' don't make us no different
And dyin' don't make it no different

To kill a nigga who ain't fuckin' with the gang with me

Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
Scoping, hoping for you to fuck up and slip
So we can have a reason for fuckin' up your shit

'Cause we never had a motherfuckin' peace treaty
So I know I got to get 'em with game
And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thing
'Cause it's kill or be killed; never cut slack
And if you cut slack they bust back; fuck that
I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
'Cause if they bust one time, that be the worst one
And that's the one that can close the shop
So you gotta stand and hold the glock
'Cause in my motherfuckin' hood, that's how it be

I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name 
ain't a damn thing changed , ain't no shame in my game

I slowed my rope, cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas 

Now where you headed, she said ""Going to work"" 
Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinink, ""Going to flirt""

I want to sneak you out to play with me, 
You can spend the day with me 
And we can ride and see the sights 
Its going down tonight 

Reminiscing on the bitch that I had back in the day 
Gave the bitch a call and she hung up in my face 
Now that's the pits 
She didn't have to put up a front 
I stuck that ass back in there 
And haven't called her for 3 months 

I guess they send me to be doggin' a chic 
Can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch 
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master 
Let he take a ride with the braster 
It cool, don't front, ooh, no sex 
No sweat-not even on my mind-we just met 

And furthermore, we can get to those 
But for now I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to ho's:

Now cruisin' to the crib with this bitch that I scooped 
Parked my Ferari, now I'm back in the coup, I knocked her boots- 
Your baby's mama put me to work 
I dragged that ass from the back, and knocked her shit in the dirt 

She wanted me badly so I put it inside 
She got the (front and back , side to side) 
Back and forth with the gangster glide 
Started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9 

Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the day 
She was asleep, cause she just had her drawers full of dick 
(now that's sick)And plus she got you staying at home 
With the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on 
So believe me when you down in the brad 
I'm at the pad with your baby mama clowning that ass 
So player hatin' niggas check the bitch you chose 
I'll be mobbing in my 'Benz spitting this to ho's:

He greets his father with his hands out 
Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the man's child 
The world is different since he's seen it last 
Out of jail been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last 
All he had was his mother's worth 
Now she's gone and he's gotta make a change and make it for the beddah 
But he's back so he's got one strike against him 
And he's young plus he came up in the system 
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen 
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean 
So he's calling up his homie who dun came up 
Livin' like this now they dealin' with the same stuff 
And had that attitude that who he was was worth it 
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first mate 
Now it's different, he's in dead dirt 
And realized that the name ain't coming up but it still hurt 
And can't nobody change this 
It's nineteen-ninety-four and we up against the same shit 

I never understand why 
I could never seen a man cry, 'til I seen a man die 
Man cry

Imagine life at it's full peak 
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy 
Imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief 
Imagine grief on this earth when there's no peace 
Everybody's got a different way of endin' it 
And when your number comes for service then they send it in 
Now your time has arrived for the final touch 
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath 
How much longer will it be 'til it's all done? 
Total darkness and ease be in all one 
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate 
You took his life, but your memory he'll never take 
You'll be headin' to another place 
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face 

I still got to wonder why 
I never seen a man cry, 'til I seen a man die 

I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong 
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on 
And you keep on blacking out, and yo pulse is low 
Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go 
Because there's no way you can fight it, though you'll still try 
And you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die 
Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here 
You start your journey into outer space 
You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place 
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light, 
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life 
Make the choice let it go but you can back it up 
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up 
But if you're ready close your eyes and we can set it free

Scarface,"Snuck up behind him, had his hands in his pocket
Too my pistol out, unlocked it
Pulled the hammer back and - cocked it
And left his shit all on the carpet
I seen a (murder, murder) I pin-pointed my target
I'm making my way up out the building
I got the nigga that I came here to get, notify his children
That they old man done fell up out the game
Because I came to this motherfucker
And killed his ass just like Jesse James

Think it's a motherfucking game?
I come around this motherfucker and kill yo ass just like Jesse James

What's my motherfucking name?
There'll be no witnesses to this homicide
No re-enactment on the late night news to be re-dramatized
All you got is a nigga with a dot
In the middle of his motherfucking head he been shot
Dropped in the middle of the floor and he ain't breathing
And the nigga's on the go cause we ain't seeing
He did his dirt and got the fuck up out the picture
The hollow point just hit ya, out of line, so it got with ya
Call the motherfucking helicopter
But ain't no hope, cause the Tina broke that nigga off a hella proper
That oughta hold your monkey ass (motherfucker, you)
That oughta teach your funky ass (motherfucker, you)
I know this motherfucking game is shift
And you done lost the fucking game of life
And that's a motherfucking shame
You let a nigga come around and do yo ass just like Jesse James

And that's a motherfucking shame
You came around this motherfucker and let me do ya like Jesse James

Think it's a motherfucking game?
Wait, this motherfucker got me bent, I gots to, break
Because this nigga done put his hands all up in my, face
He best to chill before I hit him with this, lace
And catch this motherfucking case
Cause once I hit it blind, once I get him blind
Because I'm true to myself, fuck the dumb shit
You ain't no motherfucking gangsta, gee
And when I get up out your ass you gon' realize it just ain't to be
It ain't no studio up in me
And all that bullshit I'm hearing you talk only offends me
And lately I'm under a lot of pressure
It seems to me you can't come clean, so yo, I gots to check ya

And right before he die I (fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck)
I could give a motherfuck about the sentence

Are we on the radio dukes?
Aww yeah, give it to me

Yeah, at night I can't sleep
I'm tossin' and turnin'
I still got the candlesticks burnin'
It ain't changed but it's a different time
And I'm still playin' tricks with my mind
My mothers always stressin' that I'm livin' wrong
But I got my Smith and Wesson so I'm gettin' grown
And their lookin' at your little boys success
And I been thinkin', I'm dealin' with too much stress
So I stay up on my p's and q's
And watch out for the G's and fools
Cause the homies that I thought I had
See me stackin' up a grip
And they just started talkin' bad
So I stay away from outsiders
And when I wrote them, it makes 'em open they mouth wider
I used to think that you was my one and only homie
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me

Yeah

Dear diary I'm havin' a little trouble with my mind state
How many bullets would it take to change my mind? wait
Sometimes I want to end it but I don't though
They tell me see my pastor but I don't go
Cause they all be on this one street
So I take it on myself to thank him one deep
And give my money to the most needy
And never put it in the hands of the most greedy
Cause their puttin' a price tag on a man's word
And it's a fashion show, so the men flirt
The world is endin' so they try to make us switch fast
And they openin' up these churches for some quick cash
And usin' the money fo' they new cribs
While brother Johnson just got kicked out where he lived
I follow no man, cause man be phoney
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't seem to keep my mind on a steady track
I'm all about gettin' mine so I study that
But it seems they want to get me
So I try to keep my nine millimeter wit me
Just in case they want to see a homies head blown
But I got to stay around to see my kids grown
I finally found a woman who could deal wit me
Back then I had a woman who wouldn't real wit me
And now she's back with her old lady
And now I got it goin' on and they sure hate me
Now I'm a gone and she's alone
Her mind was playin' tricks on her

You niggas paper weights
y'all don't want to fuck with the great
Fakin' moves like you wantin' somethin' get it straight
Cause one mistake'll get this motherfucker aired out
You niggas better recognize this is Brad's house
I put the mic down to give you other rappers a chance
But all you niggas want to write about is dance
I tell another nigga 'bout your mama
So I'll be forced to bring you back the raw shit
The hardships of growin' up
Stuck in the hood
Broke as fuck, out to hustle
Facin life struggle
And havin' nightmares about gettin' big scrilla
And that's the type of shit that turn these mama boys to killers
On the realer, it's a nigga comin' back for the streets
Cause this bullshit I been hearin in the rap game is weak
You got these killas on your payroll
I'm doin it out of love
But if you cross me I'm fuckin' you up
I keep a ?
I'm a nigga in destroyer mode
I squeeze it once you blow you out of your soul
Who's the ""boss"" in this rap shit?
I let my opposition judge me

I strike a match and watch a motherfucker burn

Before I shoot this motherfucker in his face

Mayhem unlike a nigga ever seen

I don't know dog
Juss trying to live it one day at a time. 

I hear you man  live it one day at a time

Let me get up outta here man my ride waitin'. 

Aight cat daddy stay true 

Aight man peace 


He greets his father with his hands out 
Rehabilitated slightly  glad to be the man's child 
The world is different since he's seen it last 
Out of jail in seven years and he's happy that he's free at last 
All he had was his mother's worth 
Now she's gone and he's gotta make a change and make it for the beddah 
But he's back so he's got one strike against him 
And he's young plus he came up in the system 
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen 
And this goes to get on top and try to stay clean 
So he's calling up his homie who dun came up 
Livin' like this now they dealin' with the same stuff 
And had that attitude that who he was was worth it 
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first mate 
Now it's different and he's dead as dirt 
And realized that the name ain't coming up but it still hurt 
And can't nobody change this 
It's ninteen-ninety-foe and we up against the same shit 

[Chorus]
I never understand why 
I could never seen a man cry, til I seen that man die 

Imagine life at it's full peak 
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy 
Imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief 
Imagine grief on this earth when there's no peace 
Cause everybody's got a different way of endin' it 
And when your number comes for service then they send it in 
Now your time has arrived for the final touch 
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath 
How much longer will it be til it's all done? 
Total darkness and ease be in all one 
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate 
You took his life, but your memory he'll never take 
You'll be headin' to another place 
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face 

[Chorus]

I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong 
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on 
And you keep on blacking out 'cause yo pulse is low 
Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go 
Because there's no way you can fight it but you'll still try 
And you can try it til you fight it but you'll still die 
Now your spirit leaves your body and your mind clears
The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here 
You start your journey into outer space 
You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place 
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light, 
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life 
Make the choice let it go but you can back it up 
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up 
But if you ready close your eyes and we can set it free 
There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace

I often wish that I can save everyone 
But I'm a dreamer 
Have you ever seen a nigga 
Who was strong in the game? 
Over-looking his tomorrows 
and they finally came 
Look back on childhood memories 
And I'm still feelin' the pain 
Turnin' circles in my 9th grade 
Dealin' Cocaine 
To many hassels in my local lights 
Survivin' the strain 
And a man without a focused life 
could drive him insane 
Stuck inside a getto fantasy 
Hopin' it'd change 
But we're not focused on reality 
We broken in Jane 
Had a dream of livin' wealthy 
Makin' it big 
Over football

What take it 
He did 
And after all my mama's thankin' god 
For blessing her child 
All my mama gotz to do now is collect 
And then smile

Scarface,"In world news today officials agree that rapper Brad Jordan alias Scarface must be stopped 
After being monitored by secret service agents for two years 
Evidence leads Tobacco and Fire Arms officials to believe that his 
literally dope lyrics promote drug usage and distribution 
Degrade women  influence gambling  promote and teach violence and more importantly 
Its influencing our minors and destroying our young community 
Officials say, he's the lord of underground rap and his music must be stopped 

We got this whole motherfucker on a mission 
Now the whole entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision 
They claim we threats to society 
And now they callin on the government to try and make somebody quiet 
For the bullshit they done to me 
Gangsta Nip, Spice 1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me 
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that 
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat 
So why you tryin kick some dust up 
America's been always known for blaiming us niggas for they fuck-ups 
And we were always considered evil 
Now they tryin to bust our only code of communicating with our people 
Lets peep the game from a different angle 
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled 
So why you criticize me 
For the shit that you see on your tv 
That rates worse than PG 
Just bring your ass to where they got me 
So you can feel the hand of the dead body 

[Chorus: x2]
Nigga don't believe that song 
That nigga's wrong 
Gangstas don't live that long 

So now they tryin separation 
And sendin black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation 
Tappin into our conversation 
Saying the message that they give 
Bring forth or premeditation 
So David's got a silver mag 
While listenin to Brad, David gets mad and kills his dad 
David Duke's got a shotgun 
So why you get upset cause I got one 
A tisket a tasket 
A nigga got his ass kicked 
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket 
An open and sgut situation 
Cop gets got, the want to blame it on my occupation 
If you don't dig me, than nigga you can sue me 
Because the shit that I be sayin ain't worse than no western money 
Don't blame me blame your man Gotti 
So you can feel the hand of the dead body 

[Chorus: x2]

You best to free your mine 
Before I free my nine 
And stop fuckin with the void in pop 
Or feel my hot rocks 
Bang, bang, boom boom, ping ping I'm the black 
White boys gat a magazine and don't kow how to act 
I'll attack and make you vomit 
Down with Kahlid Abdul Muhammad 
Do he got a brother, I'm it now 
I'm the illest 
want to kill this house nigga Don Cornelius 
Can you feel this? 
You punk niggas make me sick 
Suckin' on the devil's dick 
Scared of revolution 
Need to start deuchin' 
Houston is the place 
I caught a case 
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face 
But i bust two times to the gut 
To the Reverend Calvin Butts 
Gotta pair of nuts? 
I started this gangsta shit in 86 
Now you dissin' me 
For publicity 
Isn't he a hoe to the third degree 
Who me 
I'm a g who like to scrap-a-lot 
Down with Rap-A-Lot 
And I can't stop, won't stop 
So fuck Bill and Hillary

Listen to my nine millimeter go bang
Out goes your brains, feel the motherfucking terror
And you ain't felt the coming of death like this ever
You paused, and now I got a Colt 45
Semiautomatic exploding between your eyes, surprise
You never thought your yesterdays would come back to haunt you
But believe me, I've come back to haunt you
I'm bout to bring your dog days to you mista
Cause rules in the streets you come off we come get ya
And hit ya', and I done let you slide a few times
But eventually you gots to die in due time

[Chorus: x2]
Sunshine
Everybody needs
Sunshine
My life, my life, my life

His mama must've got the news
The little boy that she gave birth to was on of them niggas they pulled
Out the room
And all my other little homies stood shocked
While they watched my other little homie bleed non-stop
On the other side of sorrow is a father being torn
Apart by the sight of his son's lying in the morgue
He mourned cause now he got to deal with the fact
That his child is gone and tears can't bring him back
Turn on the T.V. and seen the unabomber
I flew to D.C., still they got no karma
And everybody say they think its all gonna change
You paint me pictures, but they all look the same
Its strange, I'm standing in my own frame of thought
Remaining in the street game framing which I was taught
I was taught to always keep my eyes open wide
Cause in these streets you got to ride or you die
I've seen a child born and I've seen a man die
Can't live forever and I understand why
So when your time comes will you crawl or be brave
And in between judgment will you fall or be saved
Sunshine

[Chorus]

Tears rolled town his face as he stared at his potna
With his chest full of holes and his head full of coppa
Broke his ass off something proper he's in the morgue
With his brains in a shit bag and a toe tag on-gone
This motherfucker must've thought he was a cat
And had nine lives but ended up on his back
And then the reaper came and took control of your mind
And you can't think you got a hole in your mind
You dyin' and can't nobody bring you out your coma
When this nigga brought the end and turned the lights out for ya
See ya and I wouldn't want to be in your position
Cause starin' the shaft of a strap and you the mission
Means one thing you let a motherfucker catch you on the sneak tip
And put your ass off in some deep shit, got the deep six
And everybody sad sendin' flowers to your ceremony
They lost their motherfuckin' homey
Damn Audi 5 on some dumb shit
And motherfuckers steady risking their safety behind this dumb shit
But I refuse to give a nigga mine
I give a nigga nine

There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future.
But through whatever you see,
Through all the rain and the pain,
You gotta keep your sense of humor.
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit.
Remember that.
Mmm, yeah.
Keep ya head up.Yeah.
Verse One: 2Pac
Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious
Just smile for me now

[Chorus: Johnny P (2Pac)]
Smile for me , won't you smile (smile for me now)
Just smile (smile), smile for me
(What ya looking all sad for, nigga you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me (nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile (no doubt, smile for me now) just smile
(And the next generation)

[Scarface]
Now as I open up my story
With the blaze a your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly
Up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
But I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
Fuck the world as we ? and witness furious speeds
Of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' 
Inhalin' Sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitentiaries the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga
 
[Scarface]
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outer space 
May the angels help to lead the way
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

Make no mistakes and leave a muthafucka breathin'

With his crew makin' your nightmares come true
Now who gon' be the first to die 'cause I'd extinguished your whole click

Now as fast as I got it, I'ma lose it
See, the cash and narcotics made me ruthless
Damn I know the real, they heard the situation
'bout the drama in the Ville, I'm 3rd generation
Now they wanna put a jacket on my risen hustle
'Cause I couldn't hack it livin' in a struggle

If it's taxable it's cool to smoke, kill or not
And the alcohol is killin' folks? True or not

Has got us tossed up, believing we controlling our motions
Got the answer in space beside the view behind the ocean
And adapting to the everyday struggle's got us stressed
Cause the fact we know we here one day and could die the next
You've insisted to take equipment to the solar system
Trying to ensure your sole existence
Now tell me: do you think that when the bang goes boom
You can pack up all your things and aim for the moon?
It's unlikely, but you might be equipped with with proceeds to save lives
But you die when the King say die
You can race it but you can't shake it, stop trying
Try to hide it, cause you can't face it but you're born dying
God, please forgive us cause we're human not perfect
And the devil try to fronting but it's not working
How can we all sit suspended in space
Just spinning in place and ain't extended in faith
Man, wait -

I gots to get myself up out the frame
Try to maintain the same game flipping 10 and flame Jane
A damn shame, people gots to always check your background
To jack now, come jack now and I'ma leave you flat down
Come back now or back down, homie, this is always all day
(Killer) in these dark and lonely hallways
Cause all they wanna see is all us brothers boxed up in caskets
With plastic bags in every bathroom getting blasted
It's drastic, mama help me calm down cause your son's sick
Don't watch me get gunned down for the dumb shit
Then the gun click and now I see the other side of black space

My last day, sad case, Heaven knows I have faith

[Chorus]

New day brings about change, everybody's searching for the light
The daydream schemes of living life
Has got us tossed up, believing we controlling our motions
Got the answer in space beside the view behind the ocean
And adapting to the everyday struggle's got us stressed
Cause the fact we know we here one day and could die the next
You've insisted to take equipment to the solar system
Trying to ensure your sole existence
Now tell me: do you think that when the bang goes boom
You can pack up all your things and aim for the moon?
It's unlikely, but you might be equipped with with proceeds to save lives
But you die when the King say die
You can race it but you can't shake it, stop trying
Try to hide it, cause you can't face it but you're born dying
God, please forgive us cause we're human not perfect
And the devil try to fronting but it's not working
How can we all sit suspended in space
Just spinning in place and ain't extended in faith
Man, wait 

[Chorus]",Faith,1997
Scarface,"Verse 1:

I got this coffee pot of white soap
Stuck my hanger down the center
When I entered I spent it cause it was like dope
But on the real-a he was jackin' me for scratch
Cause out of 36 ounces this motherfucker brought me 20 back
I'm slanging 20 sacs cause I done lost 16
And these goddamn streets ain't going to bring me back
Now could it be the southside big baller
Bolo rock slanger stones done got slaughtered-damn
I'm going up on my whole thangs
And stepped on don't go runnin my clique cause it's a old game
And all I ever wanted was some hundred stacks
I went from slangin' o-z's to movin' hundred sacks
Gotta make my money back
Cause I done came too far up in these goddamn streets
To get my money snatched
I'm so for real about this motherfuckin skrill
That any obstacle obscuring my paper is gettin' killed
For real

Chorus:
(scratching and mixing)
All I have is this small skrilla

Verse 2:

I know this nigga run this game of life
So motherfuckin sheist that at night he got to sleep with lights
Cause he done come across with shit so shade
That mutha fuckers comin with clips to locate him
Ain't no waitin and once they spot him they gon' sure face him
And once the got him they gon' sure waste him
This ain't no mutha fuckin joke nigga it ain't worth it
And even if your mother gets in it you can't surface
It was all purpose
Just like that bullshit you was serving it was all purpose
We all chipped in nigga and we all hurting
I gots to grind just like in eighty-nine
When a niggas 25 cent pieces look just like baby dimes
I'm on the corner selling whole eights
I don't remember being this fuckin paranoid since I sold weight
I went from 50 sacs to 50 packs
And all because this motherfucker got jipped he wants to jip me back
But when I find him I'm gon finalize him
Just to let a nigga know I'm for real and down to die for mine
And I'm for real about this mutha fuckin skrill
That any obstacle obscuring my paper is gettin killed
For real

Chorus

Verse 3:

Game made to be swift since eighty-six when I started
Seems like niggas with hustle got outsmarted
Cause now they wanna analyze they homies for scratch
Catch them when they sleeping come down and up scrap
And even though I plotted hittin' niggas for ends
I never took out straps and shot gats at friends
It was all about being for real where I was from
Where very few niggas came real but I was one
I dedicate this to my homies stuck in battle
Living life being caught up in this mutha fuckin' gamble
The game made to be changed but the niggas still started
Cocaine seems to be blamed for the niggas gettin slaughtered
How many times you had your homie shot
By the same mutha fucker whose game came from your homies block
Niggas get caught up in the paper chase
And lose respect for the game
That was honored before the cake was made

Hang with my homies smoke weed drink brew
Ride down Belford one deep and ? crew

Stack me up some papers these days one night

Winds start blowing I'm paid trump tight
Got to have papers these days in my life
I got to have paper these days of my life

Money makes the world go round

Without a doubt
They all want to see about a clout
They don't know
Don't want to know or see what its about
We faced with danger do any thing for the paper
Scarred for life of the street mentality done made us
Watch out for the snakes and fakes
Out to take what's yours so prepare and beware
Money makes the world go round for some niggas
Money makes the world kill all niggas quicker
Its reala, the haps
The cheese, the scraps
The cheddar, whatever you call it its all ?

Money makes the world go round

Some people gots to have it
Some really need it
A lot might even sacrifice their life to retrieve it
I see that money's good for me
Money's good to me
Money can't buy me love
But it can rent me some pussy
You get your hands on a little bit of it and before you know it
You go crazy without, do strange things for it
Although its made of paper, it don't grow on trees
Unless you coming up blowing weed, while you smoke on tweeds
You see money makes the world go round
Makes the price of living go up
Chances of living go down
You see money makes the world go round
If you ain't got it you nothing
But when you come up than they hound you

Money makes the world go round

I take me a shit and try to gather my thoughts
But where the southwest be, that's why I sip on a quart
You see my mind is on a whole lot more than just rap
You see you got to be something, until this rap shit happen
Its been a long time since I got my hand on some cheese
Its been addictive, my daughter can't get what she needs
Shit is fucked up, you wonder why we rob and sell dope
I go days without eating, it ain't because I snort coke
Fool I'm broke, what's a good way to get paid these days
Flip burgers, or lay your ass down and get sprayed
Hey man I got to reason with ya
No, fuck trying to reason
I'm tired of struggling so now its hunting season
I hope you understand by now what I'm thinking
Get a bag of that dank, of the hemp and I'm steady drinking
Contemplating on what should I do

It's been a long time comin
But now I'm back up in this bitch to hit these niggas with this gangsta shit
I keep the strong rhymes runnin
My shit don't switch, I'm 10 years in, and ain't changed one bit
It's all about the real, nigga
I keeps it real, nigga
And won't sell out for ? ? ? with tommy hilfiger
Fucker, I figure niggas wanna see
The side of society they don't see on tv
So when I bring the shit, I bring the shit like I seen it
And when I scream the shit, I sing the shit like I mean it
No secret, these muthafuckas figure I'm a threat
Cause I ain't fallin short to the traps the demon set
Now sweat, cause now I got my head in your books
And when I think 'cracker', my definition read 'crook'
Now look, we're livin under laws that they set
Back then we were treated like dogs and wasn't shit
And slowly but surely the shit changed
>from they fault, but if you black, then you get blamed
A damn shame, that means this muthafucka's one-sided
And blacks, we get lost in the sauce, because we unguided
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
Get what they can get and rip they assholes apart
They smart

[ chorus: devin / (tony 'scarface' montana) ]
They smart, man

You niggas better watch yo ass
(..they're the bad guys)
Them bastards they smart, man

(..they're the bad guys) (2x)

[ verse 2: scarface ]
I declare an all-out attack
Let's take our minds behind enemy lines, so we can see how the demon acts
And how he set us up for failure in the first place
And why the fuck did we just settle for a birthday
You see, I'm hip to the games that you run
Like the games you run unfair, we can get no fair one
Cause we was dealt the bad hand from the jump
And we can't deal, so we jack and get drunk
And might end up locked down or six feet
But in these streets a muthafucka gots to eat
You can't sleep, cause if you're caught sleep, you gots to pay
And just like everyone left you got your day
And these days were meant for all to keep tryin
But we can't relate, so we fall and keep dyin
Open your muthafuckin eyes who your enemy
The muthafuckas dyin or the muthafuckas killin you?

[ chorus ]

[ verse 3: scarface ]
You put your crack on my table
I turn my axe on my neighbor
And my back to my savior
You had me thinkin you were almighty
But to the almighty you're just a man that's really all tiny
The maker will open up our minds to see
That heaven ain't a place here on earth, you gots to leave
And once we leave, we stand between eternal peace and eternal pain
And you the beast shall meet eternal flame
So let it rain, wash away up all my bad things
And put some laughter in our hearts again
Now black men, stand up, let's come together as a whole race
And don't be fed up by the old days
They try to do us like the indians, killin us like wild beast
And show more love for the chinese
And kept us trapped up in a small room
And made decisions on our life we accepted that left us all doomed
They sabotaged and they camouflaged
But if these niggas came to crank up some shit, then I be down to ride
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
The only way to beat em is to think, cause they smart

(scarface)
Ghetto niggaz remain violent all the killers remain silent
Niggaz strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all rome'
The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggaz do their struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons dinin'
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makin' music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause it's deep
Some niggaz make it out the neighborhood and won't circle
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
Who done came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintian me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggaz

This is for my homies and my thug niggaz (uuuuugh)

'face, imagine us working at mcdonald's
And me and you selling fucking tapes in the bahamas
Gold slug, a car full of thug niggaz
Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
Real ghetto niggaz can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little j down at rap-a-lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake it's for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggaz off from new orleans to california
Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh)
Independent, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine
You used to see c.e.o.'s in a suit and tie
But we young niggaz in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair

It's alive, and I'mma be tha muhfuckin' one
Make these niggas want some
Here I come
Da last don

Tatted on my wrist since 86
What tha fuck?
I'm sitting in my cell block stuck
Listening to this shit my radio did
Shit, gotta change the situation
Write a letta to the warden mothafuck all this time wasting
Chasin' niggas wit my occupation
Clean across the nation
Lookin' for two-facin
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope-dealer all in one
Now past me my muthafuckin' gun
Niggaz feelin' they invinsible
Til' they dealin' wit tha muthafuckin' principle

Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out

And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under naighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumpin
So now he's sittin on the sidewalk bleedin
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin in the world ain't goin to bring him back
his brother, sittin at the wake wipin tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin the price

Had to dodge a bullet 

And the nigga that tried to pull it 

The streets is throwed 

If I don't get lean and blowed everyday 

I feel just like I'ma explode on overload and overdrive 

All my life this drive I tried 

I seen a lot of good niggas die 

Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched 

Or somebody's a bitch 

I wish I could change the past 

But I gots to live in the present and pray 

that tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast 

Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me 

But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself 

I found out she had to told me 

Just to show me just how good I had it 

I guess I couldn't see it 

Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it 

But that was just the way we used to G it 

One of the wrongest niggas I see 

Or one of the strongest niggas I know 

Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know 

So I put weed in the bong and I blow 

Stay cool calm and collected a neglected 

Child that grew into a man that's widely respected 

Too real 



(Chorus) 

I feel no pain 

I can't complain 

Stuck in the game 

Tryin to maintain 

Cause I'm so real 



(Pimp C) 

We blow big everyday 

But that don't stop our pain 

Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game 

Got niggas doin 40 

When you 25 that's life 

I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price 

These bitch ass niggas shife 

Niggas might snitch out they momma 

That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama 

Cause we ain't promised tomorrow 

But nigga you promised to die 

Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry 

At night I talk to God and try to understand 

How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man 

I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back 

So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks 

I still love my piece of change, wood grain and big head ones 

But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun 

I guess that's true for some 

But them hoes will never win 

Out here just hustlin and grindin 

Tryin to change from niggas to men 



Chorus 



(3-2) 

My nigga you a ho to me 

Boy you done went off on me 

Runnin round with the fakin and hatin 

I'ma blast if you run up on me 

I'ma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch 

This matter coulda been resolved 

if you woulda came clean and paid my shit 

See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last 

Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass 

And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up 

No respect for your family that's dead 

don't write yo peoples locked up 

Damn I miss my dog he was hog to this game 

Unlike bustas these days that talk down on your name 

You boys is funny 

I'm bout my money 

And oh so true 

Mr. 3-2 when I never trusted you 

I'm too real

Scarface,"(Devin) Walk up in da session wit my dick in my hand
Fat sweet in my mouth,a 24 ounce can
Got no time for all that yesterday, he say, she say
Pull out da beat tape
Give it to da DJ
My eyes are tight and shinin'cause I'm smokin' some kill
Don't look at me, go buy some drinks, call up some hoes if you will
I see it nothin' but a party ya'll, I guess I'm the host
Ain't nobody got no mo weed, it time to smoke it
Keep that beat rollin', you see everybodys holdin' their own
You know I gotta bust atleast two or three before I'm gone
But there's always one in da crowd, rappin' loud
I'm in the nigga's mouth after all them bitches and cowards
With the East coast flow, West coast body language
Don't know nothin' bout da South and tryin' to find someone to hang wit
Man when ya finish flowin' or whatever da fuck you doin'
Holla at me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n


(music)


(Devin) Had to get away, needed some time to chill
So I bought a 59 and got behind da wheel
Scooped up a fat sack of kill 'cause I'll be drivin' a while
Takin' two or three pulls every five or six miles
I can't wait to see my roaddogg, you how we do it
Just like a case of beer, piece of cock, we run right through it
And all da bitches know me, I hit quite a few
They be glad to see me, niggaz don't give'em dick like I do
I bust bout two, then they tell they friends, and then I'm in
Wit my French tickler, makin' they pussy lips grin
But there's always one in da crowd, talkin' loud
Found out I fucked her cousin, now she runnin' her mouth
Leavin' notes on my windshield, I'm a bitch, I'm a hoe
Early in da mornin' bitches knockin' at my mama doe
Mama please, when you finish whatever that you doin'
Who ever that is, tell'em I'm in da bathroom boo boo'n


(music)


(Devin) I gotta visit from a old friend, fresh outta county
He said came up on a lick and he was glad that he foind me
He had some niggaz wit him, full of drink and lookin' sweaty
Cockin' gats back talkin' bout ""c'mon Dee man you ready?""
Its a house down da street, about two does down
They sell weed and they least got two whole pound
Man all we gots to do is hit this ride, we cool
Lets fuck his wife and take his weed and bust on that fool
We can all come up, whatever we get, we split
Ain't nobody sayin' nothin', ain't nobody seen shit
So lets pile up five deep in ya lac
He'll know that it is you Dee and won't think its da jack
Man you must be smokin' crack, you don't know who dat is
That nigga work for HBD been sellin' weed round here for years
So when you finish plottin and schemin' whatever you doin'
Wait fo' me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n

F-a-see-e-M-o-be screamin 'cause I mean it
Till these muthafuckas bury me
37-40 pull dat pistol packin
Gun slangin, bangin southside
Heat bringer, heat slanger

Head banger, thought re-aranger
The bitch strangler, a total stranger
In your face with this thing aimed at ya
Your facin danger, 16 with one up in the chamber
I'm bout to stain ya, with this muthafuckin handgun

And fuck dem laws, dey got my brother already
Dey can suck my balls, average nigga have no luck at all
But because I be in my 'Lac chillin
They stereotype me, thinkin I'm into crack sellin

Man I'm windy city 2-20, anybody chin checker
3rd floor lake grove, 35th in leather gloves
With the snub nose, complex born and raised
And under siege every day

The definition, of a gaurilla
He is a killa, robbin for scrilla
Not your average every-day nigga
The laws at me, better off dead 'cause I ain't happy
Kill or be killed, Id rather go to war before they catch me

Arrest me, I told you before I wears vest's
A born legend by the way of .357
I'm an automatic with static its tragic Mr A-l-K-a-p-o-n-e
The last man standing

Rollin, ridin, slowly slidin
Creepin up in da corners where you hoes be hidin
Takin you over in ways you never even thought of
The city's under siege nigga don't get caught up

I'm a 4th ave lake street ridin ass nigga
Still a ? superior executioner
Da bomb M-I-d-w-e-s-t mirage
Da killa wit ?
(A city under siege)

Ghetto birds hover over southside Chicago
Ellis park killin fields, gang war rival
Bigger than the sears tower, I was a pain in the smoke
They found his body floatin the lake shore

8 holes filled up his body full of hot ones
Shot one, two, three, four, down like dominoes
Cop killin columbian 'nect ?
Split, grown snitch, its over with

I said a hip-hop, pour a cup of coffee
And then I sip and stop
Because we gettin watched by some new group
New brood mc's walkin round like you and me
But all they do is listen shit only a fool'd believe

275, big fat and nasty, fuck bein classy
I'm straight ghetto, chuckin beer bottles out da window
Nigga I been broke so I say fuck poppin some Don P
I'm drinkin MD 20-20

Devin's got some shit wouldn't give a fuck if you dissed
Because shit to each's own and each owns voice
You can be stealing killing or chillin whatever your choice
Smoke some weed smoke ya pipe fuck it 
Life if how you live it
I grab the mic while tha DJ groove it (turntable scratch noise)
Explicit lyrics is what um known to kick
Trying to make money so I can make honeys blow on mah dick
I go on a quick mission to find some kil'
Ain't no big deal, just hop in the Seville
Mah homey put me down quarter pound for a bill
Wake up in the morning and I have weed still and I chill
With the brothers sipping coffee
Too old to be listenin' into what you say so hoe get off me 
You're born in this world by ya self and you die alone
So as long as ya grown ya might as well gone and just

[Chorus]
Do what the fuck you want to do (Go ahead and just)
Say what the fuck you want to say

What did it all mean?
Say what you want hoe ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you 
So do what tha fuck you want to do

Now everybody's got elders and you should respect um
They been through similar shit but then again you can't let um
Put they hands on ya life like a remote control
Have you traveling down the same bumpy tore up road
Now close friends and relatives they should be constantly by ya side
And understand you gotta let ya conscience be your guide
There'll finally come a time for ya self you must decide
Cause you only get a ticket might as well enjoy tha ride and just

And there's a couple of fucked up man made rules that we should follow
But you gotta realize you just might not wake up tomorrow
And the dollar you earn is the doller you spend
Go get something for ya kids or buy a bottle of gin 
Is it a sin? I don't (don't) know
What X and O's in this game
Trying to survive, trying to get high, trying to get by and stay alive
So (Do it till ya satisfied) Not just a lil bit 
But wait until ya eighty and start saying what you could of did

Scarface,"Man I met this chick so fine
So bad She made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in the galleria shopping, buying
Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, its me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces

[Chorus]
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

[Too $hort]
I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch

[Devin]
Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this
Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my
Piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
Nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces

[Chorus]

[Tela]
I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through
Damn hoe I must admit, that's whit it hit me
So I dips into the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex Chases

Or do you try to tell it to the dumdums

Help a homie get on his feet, and we'll all riding

And turn of your ring and you can catch me on banewick
Looking sick in a six
And some schweiz on my wrist

You got to blow, cause to many niggas out for Mr. Jackson's dope
Y'all niggas got to go, to the ghetto

Ghetto,
Ghetto.
I can't get out of here

Ghetto 
I can't get out of here

Deathwall is the site
When the mic be light
As twice as ship advice to my homies who write me in te pine
Now the sale is hell but kids keep sending me mail
With their liberty bell, so I can tell you about the half
And who got cow for riches, and sending bithces, 
I'm making bitches
I remember when I just to get beat with extension cars
And we slanged by to see were my house was
Started stealing out of my mama's perce
Now that she's gone
She lives thrue my songs
And it sure hurts
I couldn't have treated her worse then in the ghetto
And turn our women's into widows
Sick to see my homie that I ain't with, trade with, payed with, laughed with
Dead in a casket.
To my pumps we can reach the top
But you got a chance to get of the pop
If you see your chance baby take it
I was the last mothafucka in the world who thought I would make it
But look at me now, a six on the beach in greeze
Check from the motherfucker streets of the ghetto

We laced it motherfuckers in their body and face, uh
Growing thicker, liquor made me daddy and nigga

Them niggas don't wanna see me when I got weed in my system
Catch another victim, capture bodies
Bring a shottie to the fucking party, yeah
I party all night
I do this shit cause it's wrong but we were born right
And to the niggas in my zone we do it long ways
Till these bitches understand nigga my song pay; cause I'm the man
Now these are my homeboys, we outlaws till the day we die
Keep this shit rough and raw my 45
Make sure that I survive to another day
To bust rhymes which from I get paid

Keeps me watchin' on toes out my back window
Creep slow by the ghetto, we never go without the .44

Hit your block, increase props as we dismantle
Channel my vengeance through this sentence, I'm relentless

With elegant bitches, plottin' riches
On quick-to-get-rich niggas full of liquor
see'll shine one time livin' bigger

We gon' have to take the heat to the streets
Kna mean? They tryin' to stop dreams and block creams
It seems like what? They hate to see us havin' lavish things
Pictures in magazines, nice cars and diamond rings

I hang with these thugs.
Whut?

And till I die I gon' remain with these niggas.

The M-P-L-S, I hear you callin'.
I put it down, yes.
Now, Chris Rock, where you at?
I heard you say some shit about some blacks,
Nigga, this been your ass back.
Come see the real deal.
Stay in the fields, nigga.
These niggas will kill.
This ain't no cap-gun shots, nigga.
This a glock, pah, pah.
It's death on your block,
Knock, knock.
Whut's up nigga?

It's me and Yuk with the L-G in the makin'.
It's stinkin', freakin',
Bowlin' on the weekend.
Creepin, seekin'
Me, till the currency
Gimme stacks up on mo' stacks.

And I bring the B-O-M-B,

And fuckin' wit' these thugs, nigga.

You wonder why us niggas be hustlers,
And out there slingin' drugs, nigga?
That's in my blood.
That drug money, stuff that shit up under the rug,
And make that nigga bug, nigga.
It's in my blood.
Niggas like me, turn niggas like you into hustlers.
Fucking with us, fucking wit us!

It's in my veins,
Like a chain-reaction.
How it all happened.
Paps is slangin' crack in the mid eighties,
Back in the day, when shit was crackin'.
Niggas pay thirty-eight for a package.
Tightly rappin',
For shippin' and handelin', taxes was added.
That's where the A-rap's headin'.
Even when I sleep, they in cavage,
Lavage shit.
Do automatics, with scopes, under my mattress,
With the dope and the drugmoney.
Stuffin' that shit up under the rug money.
Thug hungry.
Takin' drugs only 'cause we love money.
I'm a nigga, he's a nigga.
Would you like to be a nigga too?
Makin' big scrilla, like these niggas do.
You probably be a drugdealer too.
Scan and tuned, into the boys in blue.
Listen for clues.
In the kitchen, bakin' up Peruvian flake.
It takes twenty-eight grams,
Multiplied by thirty-six zips to make
A triple beam brake, a triple beam shake.
A hundred grams on the triple beam flake.
Two point two pounds, to be straight.
My niggas just flew in from G-A,
Ready to buy 4 kilos,
Then drive slow back to Youngstown, Ohio.
So fuck these rhymes.
Let me stick my dick in your ear,
And fuck with your mind,
Nigga.

[Chorus]

Niggas portray themselves as low key.
Broken down and fabricated,
Easily ejaculated, table with, and halfway faded.
Ain't no wars, 'cause they made it.
That type of bullshit is outdated.
But I played it like I laid it.
My partners have always said that.
It was set me up 
For life.
Money, clothes and hos, but road I chose was
Nothin' nice.
Niggas know just what it's like to be hustlers.
Governors from strugglers.
Bitches lovin' us.
Blindly chasin' that life we lust.
I blush.
Bottles, havin' thoughts and iring dreams.
Goin' down and roll fast.
Tryin' to get what my eyes have seen.
Fried of me, huh.
Nigga for a hand that got me through these eyes right to see.
But part not I was blind to the point,
Not even I could see, or that I could be,
Obviously.
I wasn't meant for me this type of trickery.
Hit me with the type of mystery.
Lay it down like history.
With the intent of me, myself, and I.
Street desire, easily.
Piece of mind, I was least to find.
Some sassiness.
Hossisiless, it gets to shit and praise to the farmer innercist.
Nobody was meant for it, it was deadly,
And I was discontent
With the shit that life once sent.
Government depend, now most of my time is spent
Escapin' what I love.
It's in my blood.

Got a whole army, so bring it on muthafuckas
You gets no ends, fuckin with interface, nigga
Your facin death, cause it's a whole clique of killas
And cap peelas, niggas that don't give a fuck about they damn self
You'll get your ass heated up, beat a nigga blue
And now we wanna get his crew, I take his whole crew
And I go through em like the flu
I finish niggas
Got more clan than menace niggas
I pull triggas, bring the pain to bitch niggas
And terrorize, and I could see it in they eyes
I capitalize, when it's down to krunch time, it's krunch time

Schemein and plottin, and then they asses smell rotten
Lost and forgotten, they shoulda known there ain't no stoppin
Niggas be floppin, releasin shit when I be droppin
Some try to copy, bullshit be sounding sloppy
But they can't get me, them niggas suck like a hickey
The rhyme sender, drop your shit and surrender

In the fuckin rumble, you'll see the biggest nigga crumble
Tryin to tumble, I make the widest nigga humble

Your ass die quick

I'm so drastic, pullin the trigger back like elastic
And blasted your whole area, hoe I bury ya
For layin your mouth ahead of ya

So muthafucka make my day

Had to control the fight
Had to make sure my dough was right
Had to make sure my boys was tight
Noise and lights, stalking from the end of my ? gonna spook ya

Stressed out, had me feeling left out
Stuck and I gotta get my self out

Stepped out with grams and plans to be an overnight achiever

But do or die and snipers , represent chi-town
Took a life and get lit up quick

Used to be on some sell ass shit
Or mail that bitch back home in a box
And leave no trail of this
Now won't witness this and this is
How's it's gonna fall
All of y'all gonna battle
Leave this life, all shells goin' drop tonight
You say that you want a spot
Better they hit like the shit from rap-a-lot
So pack that glock or AK stops your clock, my straps get hot
Even though it's hot it ain't hot enough to stop this entourage
Rain, do or die, pick a piece snypaz, one big mob
Better stop that heart

So flex that shit cause down in Texas, everybody talks

If them popo's come and get me
Let me out, I'm doin' again
We low, kilo, everything I worked fo'
Have my girl workin' that corner
Don't come up in this short, hoe
Never seen, you know what I mean
All about that crispy green
Have it sewed up from H-town back to New Orleans
Murder murder if you play me short
Takin' heads clean off this bitch and bustin' hard
Fiends have my block on fire and have me workin' it
And my boys on the corner out there twirkin' it
They twirkin' it

She was a Betty, I done knew back in the day
Little scary lil' bitch from around the way
Plus she sucked and fucked all day
With a little bit of Alize, Alize, Alize

I put it down for these young hoes
Get the pussy like I'm married
And send her home with the cock swoll, did her pops know?
Little girl that he tryna protect was in the crib doin' porno

Fo' sho' baby, I know these hoes
Step up too 'em and show these hoes
I never wonder to myself, ""Would she?""
I get deep in her mind and her pussy

Who dat? She was the world's greatest dick sucker
Play the note with the tongue while finger fuck her
I hit it in the back of the donk, in the back of the Benz
Got my dick in her ass, front of one of her friends

Face down, ass up
Bitch be still while I bust this nut
I rock hard while I'm in these guts
Wipe my dick and then that's enough

She wanna kiss me after she lick me
Slap the drunk, you know the ho got Tinesi
Daz, this punk bitch wanna get with me
'cause the ho lookin' for a P I M P

You know the ho don't know no better
I would rough ride ya ass but the magnum's better
I know a lot of niggas done paid ya bitch
Remember one thing, I got a major bitch

Pull up on the stroll, in the fo' door Caddy
Slapped the bitch, she hollered, ?No, no daddy?

I once knew a bitch named Erica
Way back in the day, she had a geri curl
I made her suck my dick on the ferris wheel
Been pimpin' all my life, big player for real

It's makin' me nut but feel our fantasy
Come on, come on, baby, won't you get the best of me

And one dose of the dick, she be doublin' back
See me, I've been known to shit on hoes
Cuff her cold, straight spit on hoes

Put a thumb in your ass, while I slap your clit
But ain't no way that I'ma lick yo' shit

Scarface,"In world news today officials agree that rapper Brad Jordan alias Scarface must be stopped 
After being monitored by secret service agents for two years 
Evidence leads Tobacco and Fire Arms officials to believe that his 
literally dope lyrics promote drug usage and distribution 
Degrade women  influence gambling  promote and teach violence and more importantly 
Its influencing our minors and destroying our young community 
Officials say, he's the lord of underground rap and his music must be stopped 

We got this whole motherfucker on a mission 
Now the whole entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision 
They claim we threats to society 
And now they callin on the government to try and make somebody quiet 
For the bullshit they done to me 
Gangsta Nip, Spice 1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me 
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that 
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat 
So why you tryin kick some dust up 
America's been always known for blaiming us niggas for they fuck-ups 
And we were always considered evil 
Now they tryin to bust our only code of communicating with our people 
Lets peep the game from a different angle 
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled 
So why you criticize me 
For the shit that you see on your tv 
That rates worse than PG 
Just bring your ass to where they got me 
So you can feel the hand of the dead body 

[Chorus: x2]
Nigga don't believe that song 
That nigga's wrong 
Gangstas don't live that long 

So now they tryin separation 
And sendin black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation 
Tappin into our conversation 
Saying the message that they give 
Bring forth or premeditation 
So David's got a silver mag 
While listenin to Brad, David gets mad and kills his dad 
David Duke's got a shotgun 
So why you get upset cause I got one 
A tisket a tasket 
A nigga got his ass kicked 
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket 
An open and sgut situation 
Cop gets got, the want to blame it on my occupation 
If you don't dig me, than nigga you can sue me 
Because the shit that I be sayin ain't worse than no western money 
Don't blame me blame your man Gotti 
So you can feel the hand of the dead body 

[Chorus: x2]

You best to free your mine 
Before I free my nine 
And stop fuckin with the void in pop 
Or feel my hot rocks 
Bang, bang, boom boom, ping ping I'm the black 
White boys gat a magazine and don't kow how to act 
I'll attack and make you vomit 
Down with Kahlid Abdul Muhammad 
Do he got a brother, I'm it now 
I'm the illest 
want to kill this house nigga Don Cornelius 
Can you feel this? 
You punk niggas make me sick 
Suckin' on the devil's dick 
Scared of revolution 
Need to start deuchin' 
Houston is the place 
I caught a case 
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face 
But i bust two times to the gut 
To the Reverend Calvin Butts 
Gotta pair of nuts? 
I started this gangsta shit in 86 
Now you dissin' me 
For publicity 
Isn't he a hoe to the third degree 
Who me 
I'm a g who like to scrap-a-lot 
Down with Rap-A-Lot 
And I can't stop, won't stop 
So fuck Bill and Hillary 
Ice Cube their ain't no killin' me 
Ice Cube, Scarface 
Droppin' on these sellin' out niggas, doing it like this

Longevity

Fake niggas

And you can tell em I said it
I said motherfuckers is takin' the credit
Been in the game for 20 minutes, and they thinkin' they legends
All on their videos showin' off, frontin' for the camera
One-hit wonders is playin' games, fakin' stamina
I damage ya, throwin' blows to your egos
Flossin' new leather, think you the shit wearin' these clothes
And supposed to flash and have the finer things
But can't seem to keep your money, cause you're buyin' rings
What is you gettin', 7 or 6, new record contract?
Bustin' your bomb raps, but you ain't gettin' your funds back
Fuck that, I been around since '86
Way before my motherfuckin' mind played tricks
And when Too $hort told me this bitch, it wasn't givin'
Cause I'm sick and tired of niggas fantasizin' they livin'
All on the tell-lie-vision tryina' front like that's your car
With a fat-ass cigar, you ain't no motherfuckin' star
What you are is a nigga lost, dazed and confused
Back in the day that you stepped in it is the day that you do
But on the  cool, some niggas been around since the '70s
Steadily preachin' to us all longevity

[Chorus]
You don't get shit for free
Your own destiny
Longevity
Longevity

10 years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
But back then I said: fuck rhymin', I was tryina get laid
But now it's '98, I'm all about gettin' paid
Fuck that bullshit you niggas be on in your videos
Drive the shit your C.E.O. own
In their home, at their parties, you niggas dummies
Motherfucker, fuck the fame, it's all about the money
And then the power (money and the power)
Slingin' tapes like powder
Everything I own is mine, don't understand 'ours'
This's a serious business 
My nigga, take care of your business
Especially you niggas with gimmicks, your ass is finished
In the nick of time, fuck havin' the tightest rhymes
You better grind, it's plenty fools dope without a dime
So I'm tight with mines, and I prove that every time
Just to let you niggas know I'm out to get mine
That's longevity

[Chorus]

Who got the freshman flop or the sophomore jinx
Rappers blow up, fall off, and think
Been there, done that, about to make a comeback
I'm on some new shit, not like my young raps
I know what you sold, first album went gold
Then you changed the style, shoulda stuck with the old
Flows, and the old clothes, cause now you fake
You ain't got no hoes committin' foul play
Hatin' on me, but you're waitin' to see
Old school Too $hort in the place to be
I ain't backstage chasin' young girlies
I'm chasin' money, I'm in my early 30s
Still sellin' records, and I'm still a real player
Can't understand how you still could be a hater
Said I don't stop rappin' from the start
If you don't believe me, go check the charts

Gangsta shit, fo' sho'

Check it out
It's on, and once again I bring niggas the rough
Fucking with us, that get you motherfuckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the super sports Rally
Beating up the block, leaving these motherfuckers shot
They ain't ready for the Nakamici
I flip this shit like I'm Kamaneze
Now dey a motherfucking see me
They try to breeze me, but I got niggaz in New York
Coming kama-kize, sparking this shit that keep me off the heezee
Jay-Hovah, he with my man came over
To scoop me, blowing dukey, in the black Range Rover
Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for
Tell these niggas why we here

[Nas]
Nothing but the New York to Texas connection
Nothing but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreaming, think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, Houston niggas, come through for niggas
Scarface get a call and we shooting niggas
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business
Trying to make future figures, we two of the illest, what?

You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor) [Repeat: x3]
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it

[Scarface]
You say you got a problem? Then tell a nigga where he at
So I can study his motions and peel his motherfucking cap
Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information
Bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back
Cause when it come down to the come down;
I'ma pull the motherfucking plug on him
Walk up to his face and then gone
Set a example, send these hoes a little message:
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it
Leaded, I pull these capers all the time
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfucking mind
Him and whoever standing by, I'll tell these niggas, ""Let's go""
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die
He fin' to die, throwing up his own blood
With a slug in his motherfuckig mug
I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here
Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor

[Nas]
A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose
To his wake we send a wreath that explodes
Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five Mercedes
Attack em like Freddie, then we toasting over spaghetti
I share with ya drama, you share with mine
That's how we killing two birds at the same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleeding
Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa

It was once said by your man who wouldn't quit
Stop bullshittin' and make another hit
I looked him in his eyes and told him that ain't shit
Gimme 30 minutes and I'mma wreck this bitch
So I wrote this rhyme I'mma bout to say
To tell him how it went down back in the day
See most niggas give they props to Run DMC
But dem' niggas in the south gotta give it to me
You see I was wrecking shit when they was doin' the worm
Parachute pants coming through with the perm
I ain't never been a pussy I was all day rough
Bitches try to rap like they was always tough
But that's bullshit cause niggas know my name ring bells
From M.C. J.H. ?????????
Got much love for most cities but I'mma S.A. fool
7th Graders shouldn't bring the scraps to school
So when you say you only listen to the real M.C.'s
Let me spell it out for you, for real M- E its the same Mista Scarface from
The 1980's
You bitches tried to bring out'cha best but cha' can't fade me
Cause I was rockin' shit when ????? was still living
And you niggas was hangin' on the corner bullshittin'
Now you want to jump in the game on both feet
Sell a few tapes and forget that you know me
But remember the one you got the idea from
See I'mma real artist so my ideas come
But you sounded like I sounded on The World is Mine
I catch you style-stealin' time after time
Now you on the mission trying to sound like Puff
Get cho' own shit and stop riding the jock
The realest nigga down south? I gotta say that's J
Why'all muthafuckas don't deserve that name
And let me break it down to you one more time
Think about it before you start out your rhyme
I'm one of the coldest M.C. to ever touch the mic
So I apply the pressure til' I bust the pipe
And niggas always ask why I keep changing my style (why)
Cause I keep hearing muthafuckas claiming my style
And then they got the nerves to say they colder than me
Then why the fuck you niggas can't go gold before me
I see you on your videos on B.E.T.
It makes me want to kick a hole in my T.V.
Cause I hate an individual who is fake as that
I gotta dropped Bentley with a Ranch to match
Nigga I finish with my shoot, my shit it can't go back
You back in yo' chevette ?????????
I started making records at the age 15
Affiliated with the game at age 16
An honorary member of the whole???????
Cut dem' blocks in half and continued to flip
{In droning voice}
{And now I got you figured that I'm not to old
Never will I fall off cause I'm wasn't too old}
??? to the seminar and shit went cool
Started talking bout they bitches and the boys got booed

I want you to witness your motherfucking murder, nigga
And since you wants to kill, then your ass has got to fry
But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slept I guess you sleep
You sho nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
Cause where I come from, yo, everybody's got a gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy, then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end
I'm rolling through your hood, now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house and now your sister's life in danger

And if you outside the click, then you die, bitch
It ain't no love in this motherfucker
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother
Because we real with this shit, so we stay true
And since we bang, we do what O.G.'s say do

I've got my pistol pon cock
Ready to lick shots non-stop
Until I see your monkey-ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit 
you motherfuckers know who run it
So when you put this motherfucker to the test
You gotta realize something, nigga, (you fucking with the very best)
I've got this killer up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother, so I talk to my diary
I'm going off on the deep end
I find myself face to face with myself while I'm sleeping
I see your picture in my head and my hand shake
You can run, you can hide, but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this motherfucker before he gets to me
So in your own blood you'll bathe

If it's taxable it's cool to smoke, kill or not
And the alcohol is killin' folks? True or not
Other people try to make you bad, but I know you not
When my situation's lookin' sad I know I got
A true friend in my time of need? All I need
Your natural you come from seeds? I decree
Makes me happy when I'm feelin' pain
Once again makes me happy just to hear your name

Rat tat tat tat to your ass is the motherfucking flo'
Here comes the White Sheet.

[Verse 1:]
Rat tat tat tat to your ass is the mutha fucking flow
Now what is you fuckin' wit a nigga fo?
Apparently you haven't heard of me?
It's going to take more motherfuckers than in the compound to murder me
I fucks a vision like a sand shower
You going up against a stacked deck nigga, now where your man power
Bring your motherfucking backup
And blow the bugle when I step off this bitch and load this gat up
Cause still a nigga's friend will bust you
Dead in your head from the front and knock the back up off that mother fucker
Now listen to the gunshot
I got that ass with that double barrel one shot
Now I don't hear your heart beatin'
Now I don't see your boy breathin', rat tat tat tat.

[Chorus: x4]

[Hospital Scene:]
Whats up boy? Ah, ah, wassup Face 1?/where that nigga at? Ah, he back
There in that emergency room, he dead? I, I don't know man fun to bust
This bitch again.

I see your mama in the waiting room standing crying
I see your ass in the doctors arms slowly dying
Now talk that shit that you was talking to your homie
Bitch you should have shot me when you pulled your fucking pistol on me
So now I'm forced to pop the clip in
S to the mutha fucking A, nigga set tripping
It ain't no love when my finger's on the trigger
It ain't no love for you off balance ass niggas
So keep your ass in the neutral spot
Cause if you rolling through my hood when we're feuding then you
Getting got.

[Chorus: x4]

I ain't your motherfucking homeboy
You out of pocket when you fucking with me, so now it's on boy
I ain't but in to get my shit like these other busters
When you see me around this bitch I got that motherfucker 
So I ain't fucking with the club life
I'm like Pac, I'm making mail but I still live the thug life
My rap name's getting bigger
But ain't nothing changed I still got the game to handle all you bitch niggas
So a nigga's always strapped
Nuts been big since a kid you motherfucker so it ain't rap
Toe to toe, back to back, gat for gat,
It's like that motherfucker, rat tat tat tat.

Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit, I kept arms 
38 longs inside my mom's buick
At any given moment shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs, arms through it, or stuffed with embalmin fluid
Shit, I'm going through it, mom dukes too
Tears streamin down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is gettin too wild
I need to bring some sort kinda calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming ""don't do it!""
It's like '93, '94, bout the year 
That big and mag dropped; and ""illmatic"" rocked 
Outta every rag drop, and the west had it locked
Everybody doing 'em, I'm still scratchin on the block
Like ""damn, I'ma be a failure""
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug, paraphernalia
Cops courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Tryin figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you sellin
So they can send shots straight to your melon wait!

But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib

Complications detected in my early months of balling
Around my sonogram you could see the evil was swarming
The hassle, was it what the world was seeking in a child?
The doctors wanted me out, my mama's in denial
Then I kicked her and gently rubbed my hands across her stomach
Told her: ""Keep em off me, mama, I'm coming, I'm comin""

Now I guess I must of been the reason mama couldn't sleep
Interrupted her peace, but it was time for me to eat
And since carrying me caused all that swimming in your feet
Just know that I'm thankful, I'll let you feel it with my heartbeat
All the doctor visits and physicians moving me around
You could sense my discomfort in every other ultrasound
And I'm running out of room in here, steady sliding down

They mommas won't admit that they can't make it but bad,
Low on the child support - always been bad boo, tryna make me out to be
The bad guy that I really ain't, bitch so quick to hassle me

Sit back and capitalize off mistakes you made
Beat yo ass into submission, and make you pay
I got battlescars from fuckin with this, I gotta have it
What's my reason for quotin this shit? I gotta have it
Like the Roy Jones - you see this money get me hungry like a wolf
And when a nigga hungry I'm a wolf
That's when I start my rage, and attack from the neck up
Catch you being careless, make these hoes respect us
Survival here, that's the name of the game
It's the jungle in this bitch and ain't a damn thing changed
Watch ya step

Let's get it on y'all, to the beat y'all
Fuck a bitch y'all, I'm from the streets dawg
So what it is huh? What it look like?
I'm a G fool, you the bitch type
You got yo strap dawg, I got a strap too
I'm from the Southside, we act a damn fool
You ain't the real hoe, youse a real hoe
I keeps it real hoe, for real though

Listen close to the story I'm about to tell
Niggaz is sellin they soul for an ounce of yell'
And a few leave, but this is a house of jail
Twenty-five year bids, without the bail
I know some niggaz in the tank, stuck, lost and thowed
Still boss turnin ya status from false to hope
Only a few niggaz stand up strong and don't whine
When the time get passed around huh?
I'm tellin you dawg, that even if you gettin released
How the fuck is you gon' live on these streets?
You got that jacket on ya back
You a rat and you done spilled ya guts
You a bitch and now you live to fuck
And you a nigga I ain't even gotsta feel to touch
I got some niggaz on the inside to stick and seal you up
It's all good for you out here, gettin yo mail
But the minute you get popped you gonna snitch in jail
Watch ya step

Let's get it on y'all, to the beat y'all
Fuck a bitch y'all, I'm from the streets dawg
So what it is huh? What it look like?
I'm a G fool, you the bitch type
You got yo strap dawg, I got a strap too
I'm from the Southside, we act a damn fool
You ain't the real hoe, youse a real hoe
I keeps it real hoe, for real though

They say that music is a therapy to ease the mind
But see therapy to me, is to squeeze a nine
Right between ya eyes, while I squeeze ya throat
Chuck you off the side of my boat and watch you float
The animal they sent here to seal ya fate
Tie ya hands behind ya back and feel ya face
Ain't no hope for ya partner Joe, he broke the rules
In the jungle if ya weak, we gotta smoke ya fool
Ain't no love for motherfuckers who done crossed the line
Cocked dice don't pay nigga, now roll ya five
You wanna play the gun game with me, then pull ya shit
I know you'd love to try to punk me if you could ya bitch
But I'm a diehard nigga, I was sworn to silence
And if I got to go, then I (?)
So fuck you, and them niggaz that you run with fool
I'll do the same shit to them, that I did to you
Watch ya step

Let's get it on y'all, to the beat y'all
Fuck a bitch y'all, I'm from the streets dawg
So what it is huh? What it look like?
I'm a G fool, you the bitch type

On the outside the ghetto just another mind state
And import more minorities to help the crime rate
I ain't looking for a job, fuck working the part-time

It's a war going on right here, where we at
I can't complain about what I can't change, so why adapt?
Dropped outta high school in tenth grade so I rapped

Scarface,"The conspiracy theory...

[Scarface]
I knew this nigga who sittin, on the dock on the bay
Had plans of gettin rich so he was plottin with Jay
This motherfucker had the street game locked
Had the blocks all sold up,
And always saw the cops when they showed up
He had the rep of being murderous too
The type of nigga, with the mind of a God-damn fool
But he knew, to get off in this crew, he had to change
So when James went to church this nigga did the same
So he's steppin back away from the cut
But his vengeance of livin, had his braincells start to fuck up
Steady callin his shots, but steady leavin a trail
So sit back peep my game, I got a story to tell

I came from a gang with niggaz who do crime
They didn't rat they niggaz out when they came to do time
No snitchin nobody out when ya facin a life sentence
For death, you do it by yo God-damn self

[Scarface]
He gettin clean, so we gave him a job
Had the whole entire city on they knees, recognizin the mob
Took the cash that he was makin, in this seat
And compared it, to the cash off in these God-damn streets
As luck gon' be, the scales didn't break even
So now he's out to go an get the cash that he needin
Some wise man once told me
(?) but I didn't believe him, so he showed me
Gave an example; the piece of a pie
Said if you eat to much it's gone at the blink of an eye
This for these niggaz out here hearin me
Hypothetical conversation, the rest of that shit, is a conspiracy
I got the word and heard he back on the grind
Ran across and met a nice spot, runnin his mob
I love the nigga, so I gave him some dap
He said he loved my work efforts,
And he said he liked the way that I rapped
Wanted to show me what he was rollin outside, but
Little did I know, he was the FBI
I heard a rumor that this nigga got knocked...
A few months past and he was back on the lot
And shift the plot, I'll teach you niggaz conspiracy theories
I spit this shit in code, but I pray that you hear me
'cause see he know him and, he meets you
They get popped and, you do to
Illegal taps and undercover surveillance
Tapin conversations, tryna duck the years that he facin

[short phone conversation]

Better yet gonna get me facin, 'cause we know he's the back-
Bone - if ya crush the bone, ya alter the mind
And thought process is vital at this time
And I heard, you was out to get the niggaz that's rich
But I'ma tell you motherfuckers like this

I came from a gang with niggaz who do crime
They didn't rat they niggaz out when they came to do time
No snitchin nobody out when ya facin a life sentence
For death, you do it by yo God-damn self
[repeat]

[Scarface]
How the fuck is you gon' stop a train
You set your fires on your forest to burn it but then it rains
It's like Babyface and them Jay
We all got lies and RAM, you motherfuckers own they grave
We need current situations, in due time
Train 'em to do the business in 20 years down the line
So I stand firm on ""We can't be stopped""
Reconcile our disagreements, and I'm still down with Rap-A-Lot
Murder ya boxers tryna break apart what God made
And regardless to what you boys say
Seek and destroy, fuck the opposition
When you for real it's in yo bloodline, not in yo motherfuckin mind
So feel it like the holy spirit, and remember
When ya face to face with the demons, you can't fear it
You fight until the battle finished
No matter what the end is, when you attack you strike with vengeance
And always judge a man by his deeds
And never buy jealousy 'cause it breathes...

Scarface,"C'mon, yeah, Face Mob, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh
His name is Jigga, yeah, what's happenin' baby?
Wsup, wsup witcha? Tryin' to get this loot
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'? No doubt

So what's it gon' be? Women, whiskey, weed
Dope, coke or all the guns you need, nigga
You could get them thangs for a lesser fee
Yeah, and with the right amount of pressure, them thangs look free

I'm on my way now, desperate need of a lick indeed
Believe I got a vick if it's a brick you need
My nigga for sheez
Right back at you, holla after you land we get it before you leave
Is you for sure? Them niggas out there still got cheese
'cause my niggas in the drop bounced back to slangin OZ's

Man them niggas rapin' the town without breakin 'em down
Them bastards makin' a killin', slangin' half of buldings
For real man, I'm on my last nine thousand
Ain't got no money, I'm fightin' cases with this ho money

And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house

I caught a northwest flight to NY, on the buddy pass
Sittin' at the exit row, by the do'
I got a hoopty from this doofy nigga around the way
I had the fo'fo' under the rug, weekend ago

Three hours, I landed in the city of dreams
With tall buildings, flooded with cabs and limousines
Where the fuck is Jay-Z
Goddamn traffic is gettin on my nerve
I see your face by the curb

Goddamn dog I been sittin' here thirty minutes
You know these motherfucking cab drivers
Like they own this motherfucker
Open the trunk

And then I'm thinkin', Jigga let's get this motherfucking cash nigga
Well if it's a money thing let's get this motherfucking money man
And then I said to Jigga, let's get this motherfucking cash nigga
I got a dope house scoped out

An escape route?
No doubt, let's hit the highway, load up, lock
Let's do this shit
Hold up, cops

Trippin', it's eight million stories in this naked motherfucker
Yeah, and ten million undercovers
We gon' get this raw, we gon' kick in the door
They got guns in the couch, they got shit in the floor

Niggas is gon' shit they drawers
They got a bitch at the door
Bullshit, heard that stupid shit before

And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house

I hit the buzzer, Mita, Manny
Let me up it's Joey motherfucker
Takin' the steps up with only one thing on our mind
Wipe this motherfucker clean, everybody gotta die

Up the steps, got closer
The voices got louder, you hear it?
Death's approaching we comin' for that powder
Then I knocked four times, I hit the hoe wit clear polish
Well, she couldn't see shit, now what's it gonna be bitch?
",Get Out,2000
Scarface,"(Scarface)
Hotel, motel, deep up in a hoe's tail
Pussy smellin sweeter than a half a key a dope smell
Knock that top back, told her I'd be right back
Nigga where your wife at, y'all niggas don't like that
I bring a bitch the rough shit, you be on some love shit
Kiss and hold and hug shit, she be wantin thug dick
You winin, and dinin, puttin all ya time in
I be into windin, knockin out the linen
Silk pink panties, but she can't understand me
I be buyin condoms, you be buyin candy
She love you, lust me, gansta shit, it must be
All the while you spoilin that bitch, so thinkin 'fuck me'
Hard for you to see that, 'cause you be on that weak rap
""Ay, can I get some roses please?"", nigga where your 'G' at
A gentleman, fuck that, wearin suits, what's that?
You hit the hoe she lay there, I hit the bitch she fuck back
Makin voices, noises, voices and noises (moaning)
But when she do, I send her home to you
Pussy hole swole up, everytime she roll up

(Hook - Devin)
(Nasty) I'm slippin in and out ya girl 
(Nasty) Pussy all around the world
(Nasty) Stickin my dick up in and out ya girl
(So nasty) Pussy all around the world

(Devin)
Now I admit, I didn't put my prick up ya gal
She saves her pussy for you, she's just my dick sucking pal
She tells me her problem, I like to listen and learn
And I don't mind because she's always got a Swisher to burn
And a six-pack, I sit back, chill while she drives
With her skirt pulled down and her panties to the side
Wanna smoke, what's up, open up the glove compartment
Grab the Swisher, kiss her, get my lighter and spark it
Don't know how she do it nigga but when she be drivin
She be slobbin and bobbin while she's givin me noggin
And I've been, tryin to tell myself to chill
But I find myself just takin the wheel

(Hook) 2x

(Too $hort)
She followed me to the bathroom, and I ain't have to pee
I'm at the club tryin to do this little nasty freak
I met last week, you know the panties drop quick
She suck dick with two hands and a whole lotta spit
Average niggas get nervous around the bitch
Lick between her legs and run circles 'round her clit
Fall in love, she'll make your mind a wreck
When she lay on her back, and put her legs behind her neck
Sperm drinker, come in her mouth, she keeps suckin it
It's too sensitive, have a nigga sayin 
'fuck this shit, bitch, can I have my dick back'
You don't wanna hit that, you don't wanna be inside that kit-cat
She's too nasty, but I like that
Pussy have you right back, fuck where your wife's at
It's hard for you to fight that
Long throat, nut-gobblin bitch with a tight cat
Gettin head in a white 'Lac, bitch

",In & Out,2000
Scarface,"It was a cold morning, gloomy, sun barely shining
Figured it was goin' rain today, so I'm in
Sit around the house until the thunder storms slacks off
Look at my nightstand, and pick the paper back up
Nostradamus, I'm reading chapter, after chapter
Predictions of the end of world, and after
Life, wit no beginning, as the world stops spinning
? a journey that's never ending
I glance at my baby boy, I can see this in his eyes
The little nigga glad to be alive
And as the days go by, I thank god for watching mines
Praying that I remained in fire
The same man that I was, which starts from the other mind phrase
Was it the cash I think my time came
For me to venture off into different dimensions
The beginning, the ending, of my time

[Chorus]
What we fail to realize
Is that we running outta time
Do we ever be born again
In my time of dying
It's like I'm running outta time
Will I ever be born again

In my time, I try to stay true steps on the game
And if you niggas thinking like me, do the same
Which is one minute ya smiling, the next ya start crying
Cause we can't accept we born to die
And I, ease my edge, and be a nigga to the end
But it's more to life then me and my Benz
When my mama told to speak to my friends
I kinda took that shit to heart
So don't fuck up your life, 'fore it starts
Some niggas want to be like Mike
I'd rather be like Christ (like Christ)
So at the end, I'll see bright lights(bright lights)
I save a prayer for the fallen soldier's
Too many niggas died young, for trying to to hang
On the slaim's of our slums
And outcome, as mommy neals, sitting on the front row
Hoping god will accept your soul
The new millennium, and as I sit watch the distance
Ships walk the horizon, I'll stare into space while I'm driving
And pray for me, all the ends of my sins
The beginning, the end, of my time, till I'm born again

[Chorus]

In my time, I've seen life born, and I been blessed
Enough to see life lost, it's just the price life cost
And shortly, explain my born, I know I'm born to do it wrong
So when I'm gone, life goes on
Tell my mother, when she on the front row, hold her head up
Shed no tears, and dred those years
Smile, and even though my whole life's been a po'ball
You did yours, and it's not your fault
Tell my grandmother those words too
She knows I'm headed to a better place
That'll put a smile on my wife's face
God's graced the evil spirit that surrounded me
And pass me, and anytime it could of had me
But when it all went wrong, sung the same ol' song
Now it's peace after the storm blew on
And ? it's the better life, security for yours and mines
What the evil lies, and not so guide
In my time, it's been times, I would've stopped and called the quits
But I might as well sit until it's over wit
Earth to earth, and ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It's the lord I trust
The territory where I come from, so I guess it'll be when I return
No sorrow, it was just my turn
And in those, last trumpet sounds, put me down in the ground
But I'll probably be at home by now
And it's help will change(these helps will be changed)
Blinking of a eye, but I don't think I'll get to see that
In my time, till I'm born again

It's changed, when we born
And how we born from woman
We born, from the spirit, of life
And all our flesh remains
And not, by the flesh of man
And not by the flesh of man
Do not believe that

And I'll be in the vocal booth, supplyin' the heat

Do you think I'm cra-zy??? (AAAAAGHHH!! Just bein me) 
Sometimes I wanna die, maybe I'll be free 
Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin me 
(I can feel it in my head) I see when I'm asleep
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep 
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and past around like weed 
Look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes) 
And tell me what you see (and tell me what you see)
Can you see my future, and what lies down the line? 
Is it just my test, or is it just my time? 
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did 
I forgot to be picked off, when I was just a kid 
A poison in my mind, tryin to find relief 
But I can't get no peace, cause Shoemaukers been chasin me 
Tryin' to set me up, bustin down my streets 
Blockin' up my door, to see if he can catch me 
But I don't sell no dope, so fuck what niggas say 
Fuck Ronnie Carbone(?), and fuck the D.E.A. 
And fuck these undercovers, that lock me up for weed
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese

You just wanna destroy me, just like you did my guy 
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth 
Listen up my niggaz: ""The F.B.I. been watchin' you"" 
Especially if you black, and tryin to leave the streets 
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin me
Runnin in my crib, makin niggaz lie
Nigga get a scapegoat and take this 25
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule 
I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school 
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed
But not enough to run a dope house, so why you fuck with me?

Look me in my eyes! 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see what I see?(My eyes!) 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee?

Look me in my eyes, I've told all I could tell you 
And now you know too much, if you leak a word I'll kill you 
You think that I'm insane, partially deranged? 
You've had your chance to pick my brain, now explain 
What's up with all these nightmares, this long rewinding road
That leads me to the same place I started from;
Right before I left home

Diagnosed my symptons, I give you time to think 
OK your time is up, now analyze my life 
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes
(Look me in my eyes, my eyes) 
You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa 
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over 
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks 
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back 
He spoke the book of Matthew then he spoke the book of Luke
But he stopped at Revelations, when he just spoke the truth
And told me all my answers, I would find in his book
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked 
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find 
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes 
Looked me in my eyes 

[Chorus](2x)

Way back, see a nigga now and they say that I changed
Put another notch in the game
You watchin' the range, I'm floatin'
And ain't no stoppin' the rain
Cock and I aim, I see you bitches jockin' the name
Boppin' to fame, a crooked nigga droppin' in pain

Rockin' a cain, back up bitch, you blockin' my lane
Tryna foul on a nigga 'cause you hot in the flame
Fuck you, and them ho ass nigga's you run wit'
Fuck your whole street, you ain't no motherfuckin' O.G.
'Cause O.G. means, means you a original gangsta
Understand pure motherfuckin' man
Ain't no police or judges, just nigga's holdin' grudges

You mark ass bitches is low budget
Straight traitor's, so fuck you and the glass that you puff on
Don't smile in my face, when you see me get the fuck on
Dope fiend ass nigga, tryna to get a free check
Talkin' that shit, but you's a motherfuckin' bitch
So when you see a nigga on the flip duke
I'll flip you, you must be smokin' dip fool
Nothin' but a bitch fool

Call baretta's on my dog, nigga's get sweated for they shit
If all a law enforcement, nigga's get deaded for that shit
Thought you was a street nigga, pulled a heat nigga at that
Come to find out was a cunt that got slapped and didn't scrap
'cause you know what motherfuckers like you do wit' nigga's on the set
Finish fuckin' face and leave ya clean cut shirt wet, and jet
'cause I'll smack the shit outta ya bitch ass you wanna run to the one's
Tell 'em about the cash and the stash, and were I got my guns

And you know I'm the bird man 'cause I sold so much coco
Beware of the crack pipe, that's by far in ya life
I got heroin by the balloons, kabooms and mushrooms
And my 38. specialist puttin' banker's in they tomb's
I'm one, shot, killed, and these bullets all go
And you takin' finger print's, and mugshots photo's
I use to beat bitch nigga's till they face turned blue
But they get weak in dice water, and pedal you in the sue
And it's true

On my side of the world it's lo-lo's and jheri curls
Smokin water by the pearl, runnin' the street wit' double earl's
I did it all 'fore I can see, walk, and crawl
Made it out the ghetto, bustin' a male, so I can wet y'all
Took a while 'fore I ball
Wanted for eight or nine murder's and spoke came
For cocaine, raw game, another die for what he claim
And where I'm from they know my name, I 'cause lot's of static
Automatic's and canic's, and nigga's start to panic

Ain't no ruler's or leader's runnin' the set
Outta respect we G's, YG'S, and O.G.'s connect
Fifteen, sixteen in a chevy we roll
Get you full of hole's, god dog, you scream echo's in fo-fo's
Who dare to mack wit' the tarantula and scorpion
Brought you in the depth's of danger when I tortured it
I love it when the bustaz squealin'
And they chrome start spillin'
Then ya start the grinnin', and said that nigga Daz did it

Watch ya step... watch ya step...
Watch ya step... watch ya step...
Watch ya step... watch ya step...
Watch ya step... you better watch ya step...

[Verse 1]
And ya don't stop, so I guess it's on once again
The Natural Born Killaz in a zone again
I'm different type of special men not known to man
I refuse to loose, I was born to win
A street nigga, the stand up type, never to fall
I've been programmed to run in and get it, take it all
Sit back and capitalize off mistakes you made
Beat yo ass into submission, and make you pay
I got battlescars from fuckin with this, I gotta have it
What's my reason for quotin this shit? I gotta have it
Like the Roy Jones - you see this money get me hungry like a wolf
And when a nigga hungry I'm a wolf
That's when I start my rage, and attack from the neck up
Catch you being careless, make these hoes respect us
Survival here, that's the name of the game
It's the jungle in this bitch and ain't a damn thing changed
Watch ya step

[Hook]
Let's get it on y'all, to the beat y'all
Fuck a bitch y'all, I'm from the streets dawg
So what it is huh? What it look like?
I'm a G fool, you the bitch type
You got yo strap dawg, I got a strap too
I'm from the Southside, we act a damn fool
You ain't the real hoe, youse a real hoe
I keeps it real hoe, for real though

[Verse 2]
Listen close to the story I'm about to tell
Niggaz is sellin they soul for an ounce of yell'
And a few leave, but this is a house of jail
Twenty-five year bids, without the bail
I know some niggaz in the tank, stuck, lost and thowed
Still boss turnin ya status from false to hope
Only a few niggaz stand up strong and don't whine
When the time get passed around huh?
I'm tellin you dawg, that even if you gettin released
How the fuck is you gon' live on these streets?
You got that jacket on ya back
You a rat and you done spilled ya guts
You a bitch and now you live to fuck
And you a nigga I ain't even gotsta feel to touch
I got some niggaz on the inside to stick and seal you up
It's all good for you out here, gettin yo mail
But the minute you get popped you gonna snitch in jail
Watch ya step

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They say that music is a therapy to ease the mind
But see therapy to me, is to squeeze a nine
Right between ya eyes, while I squeeze ya throat
Chuck you off the side of my boat and watch you float
The animal they sent here to seal ya fate
Tie ya hands behind ya back and feel ya face
Ain't no hope for ya partner Joe, he broke the rules
In the jungle if ya weak, we gotta smoke ya fool
Ain't no love for motherfuckers who done crossed the line
Cocked dice don't pay nigga, now roll ya five
You wanna play the gun game with me, then pull ya shit
I know you'd love to try to punk me if you could ya bitch
But I'm a diehard nigga, I was sworn to silence
And if I got to go, then I (?)
So fuck you, and them niggaz that you run with fool
I'll do the same shit to them, that I did to you
Watch ya step

I got trouble rhymes to a death the troubled times
A double nine incase niggas get out of line
And heaven knows that I tried to change
But in the mist of trying to be a better man
Trouble is all I can seem to see
And the fact I know tomorrow isn`t promised to me
So from this day forth I`ll be all I can be
My brother turned his back on me
Got to be my own man
Regardless of what the stakes is I`ma play my own hand
And I`m tired of being let down by my so-called friends
Regardless to the blood shed ? no tears in the end
Father please forgive for I have sinned ? forgive us all
But I ain`t to blame ? the lunatics wearing my heart
And I think I gotta build another wall
Cause I don`t want the world to see me
Cause maybe these demons will try to end me
I`m exhausted and my body`s sleepy
Never the less it`s hard to rest ? I`m a nervous wreck
I walk with the stress
I use to walk around with a vest
But now a days I be like ""fuck it dog
You fuck with me I gots to fuck with ya`ll""
And ""make ends"" is just another word for ""pay back""
Paying you back today for this grudge that I had way back
You niggas I grew up with wouldn`t play with that
I send you bitches to the morgue with holes in your head
No remorse ? why you think my niggas taught me to ball?
Cause I be walking around in designer suits?

Yeah  what I'ma do right here is take my time  
and dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace

See you when I get there  you know what I'm saying? (really doe) 
So drip with me as I go down memory lane. 
Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener  
(1 8 7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor). 
I've seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up, 
some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed. 
But it's a East Side thang, a hoo ride thang, 
('cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang). 
I bring you the motherfucking .38, 
(just get the MC and the homie Nate). 
So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide, 
as I take you on a trip nigga ride (East Side). 
Nate (Daz): 
Do you remember back on the East Side? 
Where all us niggas used to love to ride. 
We didn't care what we did, 
time was nothing to us we were just kids. 
Times are different now, but you still get stuck, 
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck. 
So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me, 
keep this in mind: I'm a motherfucking O.G. 
Snoop: 
Lets speed the clock up and pass some time, 
June 17th, 1979. 
That's my first time being arrested, 
I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit. 
I learned than from the G's, 
a G is an overseer, the overseer sees. 
More than you do 'cause he gets experienced, 
and besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent. 
So I was gone, and I'm on my way home, 
my momma's going to get me, and I flee with (???). 
She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb, 
We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones. 
She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done, 
she said: ""playing football should be your only fun son"". 
I'm like ""allright"" so we enter the house, 
come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth. 
I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch, 
I looked at my momma and said: ""damn, why you snitch?"" 
They put me on punishment but that didn't work, 
now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a T-shirt. 
And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides, 
I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time. 
Nate: 
My homie told me one day he had a jack move, 
he said: ""come on Nate Dogg, it'll be smooth"". 
I agreed and said ""come on, let's go and jack them fools"", 
next day we were draped in the county blues. 
I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years), 
saying to myself ""I'll never fuck with that nigga again"". 
'fore I'm locked down I learned to be 
what I am now and that's a motherfucking O.G. 
Original gangsta 
Daz: 
I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials, 
never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile. 
You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an O.G., 
beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some Hillfigers. 
The man behind the trigger, committing robberies, 
with the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me. 
Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me, 
because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more. 
Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door, 
to let you know we can't take no more. 
Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends, 
and let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost. 
Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair, 
and ask myself: ""who the fuck should I really fear?"". 
I ran around with the best killers, 
thug criminals and drug dealers. 
Blasting niggas if they come near us, 
(???) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could. 
Knock on wood for good luck, 
serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck. 
Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack, 
a grown child laying niggas the fuck down. 
Nate (Daz): 
Original gangsta (original gangsta), 
coming from Long Beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me). 
Coming from the East Side... 
You're fucking with The Pound, oh nigga please, 
see-O-B.'s can't see the D-O-double G's, [O.G.'s... repeat 5 times] 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. D-A-Z, 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. Warren G, 
shout outs to my nigga S-N-double O-P, 
shout outs to my niggas see, Style and me. 
Snoop (Nate): 
Yeah, straight up, based on a true story. 
you know what I'm saying? It's a G thang baby (original gangsta) 
You trick ass bitch!

Yeah, now, now is you motherfuckers ready for this, c'mon
Do you really think you ready for this, c'mon
Do you know that you ready for this, huh
We gonna see if you ready for this

I be the street sweeper, nigga
Quick to leave your whole block shook an' shot at
From fuckin' round with the Midack
Eleven, twenty-four, act 47

Fuck who's standin' around them get close up and down an'
I done came here to get brains
Shoot you twice in your stomach
Then leave your boxin' shorts full of shit stains

You're, bitch maid, you ain't a gangsta, you a sucker ass
These niggaz, scared of your bark, but bitch I touch ass
And bust back, what's that, it's face mob in effect
With Icarus, Reggie, Jamal and Treach

I told you that talkin' wasn't shit to me
So bitch be more specific when you spit for me
It ain't shit to me, you a hoe in fifth degree, a discharge from a dick
Disease, you lil' maggot, part time thug for a faggot
Plastic ass chump, you don't want no static

Real niggaz, louder, real niggaz, louder, louder
Real niggaz, yo, real niggaz

Yo, yo, yo, it's Funk Doc, I thought you knew
P P P in the back an' they parkin' to, jump
Thorough borough, bricks, ashy elbow kid
I fuck chicks off Elmo Flicks

My tape is off safety, tongue the gun
Mouth to barrel, I spit, it numbs the front
So what cha, what cha wanna, yo, my boys is beastie
We grew up untamed, unemployed an' eatin'

You sharks in the water, avoid the deep end
We only fuck chicks that enjoys the beatings
Young Ike Turners, disco inferners
Concentration camp, nobody turn up

I roll up a X that came with kits
Leave you with nightmares, Dana Dane was with
I can train yo' bitch, with a chain an' whip
It blow the block down while I change the clip

Yo, don't approach me wrong, little kids call me 'Smokey-mon'
'Cause the blunts that I light set off smoke alarms
And I stand on the corner 'til my coke is gone
Niggaz, wanna get they ice picks, poke the don

But they know I got a gun big as Oprah's arm
And I know a old lady, that'll choke their moms
A attitude, that's what I don't walk without
Nigga, I'ma time for it, you just talk about

Ic is the man, and I never been to Japan
Got a Japanese bitch, with my dick in her hand
This is the plan, I'm about to get in the van
Go and get rid of the man, I done did it again

Skunk I blow, then off to the trunk I go
Pull the pump out slow, dump out foe
I'm the nigga, that the streets raised
I'm the nigga, that'll make 3-ways outta nigga PJ's

The nigga, that'll smack the shit out the DJ
If he don't give Icarus shit a replay
Poker flush, y'all niggaz joke too much
And my gun got cancer, it smoke too much, we

Real niggaz, louder, real niggaz, louder, louder
Real niggaz, yo, real niggaz

First of all, you gotta have balls unlike some who act hard
I was real ever since I shot out my pops black balls
I'm real, I can sense danger and tap calls
I'm real, I feel when haters wanna clap mal

I look a nigga, eye to eye when I speak
I'm transparent, I can see if you a killer or a freak
Or a bitch that'll do anythin' to get rich
Or a snitch that'll drop dime on the click

Or a fake, that'll rather see me at my wake
Or a Jake tryin' to infilitrate, give me a case
I'm real like, bitch, get the fuck out my face
I'm real like let me stick my dick in ya mouth, give you a taste

I'm a real nigga, if I don't get no bigger
I'm five five, still knockin' out tall, niggaz
We real niggaz plottin' on dummies with tall figures
Real niggaz. hands on forty caliber triggers
Bullets hummin', real like Redman's fifth comin'

Trigger Treach
Bastards blunts, Buddhas bullets, black gats is the lingo
Fuck a jolly jingle, old bitches break for Bingo
Christmas time I crack Yak, an' Kris with Kringle
Gettin' funk from Nymphos an' scratch my nuts witcho' single

Who's the game scratcher minus the rap masters
Name is Hey, with the Gay-G after
My thugs on the street with the heat, listen to me
See them diamond D.M. medallions, snatch, you give 'em to me

Mally G's a part of me, Icky slips his ownself Mickies
In crowded armories, fuck with Redman
You're a dead man at the robbery
You'll be, Adebisi greasy, put him on to me, fuck that

I'm a throwin' flames Fanatic, bashin' brains come at it
Beat you with the shit that they used to frame the attic

[LL Cool J]
Uhh, uhh.. yeah
See I know how to get down, word up

It's so hot it's, LL's version of the East coast chronic
Smoke 'til your lungs collapse
You supposed to be the nigga, where all the drama at?
So ironic, L came back
Flooded the market - got your mens on the wall
holdin his blunt, too fucked up to spark it
Show me a nigga who can do like I do
Then gas your mans up so I can rip that nigga too
Braggin you goin platinum like that shit brand new
I was platinum in eighty-five, what THE FUCK wrong with you, huh?
Come (?) L - what you call rocks to me is minerals
Tried to throw salt on my name, shit's political
The baddest man on the planet
So ill when I'm spittin niggaz take it for granted
Cram to understand it, I'll switch and write it lefthanded
Heat my pinky ring up and leave your bitch branded
Got a voice like a cannon - nigga shoot
I don't think she really hot, your career is a fluke
I'm the best MC to ever touch the pen
Take a look at what I'm doin it will not be done again
As sure I am the descendant of former slaves
I'ma resurrect brothers from they mental graves
Make 'em confess - LL's the most rugged
God, and no man's above it, gotta love it

Uhh, E Dub on the microphone
Droppin bombs - spots get blown
So why would you assume my style wouldn't bloom
When I rap, wack MC's vacate the room
Cause they suck, and that's how I feel
I'ma smack down the A&R who signed the deal
Then wrap 'round his neck yo' reel to reel
So next time he know, how the real feel
Get loose and wrap hand 'round the steel
Leave you in the truck, wrapped 'round ya wheel
(I ain't playin) But why'all front like I ain't it
And every rapper why'all like, sample my shit
(Name one) I'm nice, and there's no mistakin
I threw a bomb rhyme in the hands of Troy Aikman
My track record is out there, gone
E.T. like maybe I should phone home (hello?)
I'm known for the dome bangers
Drop any song of mine right now in the club and it's DANGER

You a trash-ass nigga, slash garbage-ass rhymer
You switched from the raw to a chart climber
And now your shit is blowin out the stores
and uh, next month you fin' to go out on the tour but
Count - (two, three, and, four)
Your records ain't sellin no more
And damn - you done spent your money galore
Buyin all the stupid shit that your money can't afford (uh-oh)
Tryin to keep up with the trendy
Got your bitch minked out in all Fendi
Bought your homeboy a brand new Bentley
And the well that wouldn't run dry is now empty
It's simply, cause you wasn't focused on the next day
and your next tape you can't give it away, but hey
I send these to these niggaz tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Everything you see me I owns it
I've been quietly sellin tapes for thirteen years
So let's get, that, clear
You might have sold a few more tapes, but
realistically, are you that great? (nah)

In your shit for the nine deuce 
And check this out 
My nigga Scarface is in the motherfuckin house 
And we bout to drop some gangsta shit 

I guess its true what they say  
When your too far gone ain't no turning back. 
And coming from the Compton mack that's a fuckin fact. 
Livin' in the city where bitches won't 
Give up the pussy for free so a nigga don't. 
So here's my story. Another story about a nigga 
Who lives his life by the fuckin trigga. 
Gotta get my serve on, nigga you don't hear me though 
Throw up the hood, might blast on 5-0. 
First I hit the Ides and get pumped up. 
Now I'm rollin in the car kinda slumped up. 
I pop the glove box, Then I reach the block, 
Then I plug your ass in the chest with the glock. 
And that's how the shits get done, 
I guess I'm a mutherfuckin nigga on the run. 
But I won't let them take me alive, so I don't sleep 
'Cause, geah, I'm in too deep. 

In too deep, ain't no turnin back. 
Cock up your mutherfuckin gauge.

Mista-Mista Scarface for the nine-deuce, 
Niggas pack a nine, fuck you bitch I pack a nine too. 
Millimeter Ruger for you hoes who try to flex nuts, 
You point your shit, I pull my shit, come nigga now lets check nuts. 
Born a hustla, raised a hustla, never gonna stop trick. 
Buck a hustla, mutherfucker boy, you better die bitch. 
Found myself a busta, had the boy front me an Oz. 
Fucked him out his money, worked my way up to a whole key. 
Now he's got some niggas trying to ball 'Face 
Time to go to work, need some back' better call Eiht. 
Call my nigga up, Kicked the fundementals. 
2 way ticket 3 o'clock, continental. 
Eiht rolled in with the mutherfuckin task force, 
Bucked them hoes off, dropped him off at the airport 
Niggas don't ever fuck with me 'cause I'm a nigga who plays the game for 
Keeps, 
Drop you on your ass with the quickness, 'cause I'm in too deep. 

Geeah, the criminals is in the mutherfuckin house.. 

Now they got us on the run, but we tired of runnin 
Got the glocks all cocked, let the fools keep coming. 
Scarface got the mutherfuckin pump under the seat. 
So niggas better duck or your ass is fucked. geah. 
The mad man with nuthin to lose. 
So you better bring your strap or catch the blues. 
And um, or get served like a damn clucker, 
Sucker, or in the end be a short mutherfucker. 
Now them one times is all on my back and 
Heard that Scarface and Eiht peeled the cap and 
They want to gaffle us up. But its a shame. 
Can't fade the best from Compton and the mid-west. 
So watch your back when the niggas step. 
'Cause the scene that is left is your whole families death. 
And fool don't sleep, 
'Cause sorry mutherfucker, we in too deep.

Baby, baby I love you, baby, baby I love you.

Who indeed took over my soul, (understand)
I couldn't breathe if he ever said (he would leave),
Get on my knees till they bloody red, (baby please)
See I don't know if you get it yet, (just don't know)

Ya name, got me sayin' baby, baby, baby,

See, I could never feel alone with you (in my life),
I gave up everything I own for you (won't
Think twice), almost a shame how I'm mesmerized (such a shame),
I loose my thought looking in your eyes (I know why)
Because your kisses make my lips quiver and (that's real) and when you
Touch me my whole body shivers. (I can feel) now,
I can see how another life(nother life)could
Have the power to take over mine cause your my.

God's green earth, you don't know what
You've done to me, (done to me) I never thought
I'd need you desperately,(desperately) it's kind
Of sick how I'm stuck on you(stuck on you)
But I don't care cause I'm needing you (I'm needing you)
And how I feel will remain the same (remains the same)
'Cause you're my baby, (cause your my baby)
Listen and when the world starts to stress me out,
(Where I run) it's to you boy without
A doubt (you're the one) who keeps me sane and I can't complain
(Can't complain) you're like a
Drug you relieve my pain (may seem strange)
You're like the blood flowing through my vain, (oooo)
Keeps me alive and feeding my brain,
(oooo) now this is how another human life (nother life) could
Have the power to take over mine cause your my

Southside, the south, southside (8X)

[Scarface]

Now what you niggas know about the dirty South
Nigga you spit the wrong shit you gettin' spurred in the mouth
Southside, let the spotlight shine, heat 'em up
Introduce 'em to the glock 1-9, beat 'em up
Who in the muthafuckin' house y'all, the Gulf Coast
Sippin' blurbs, we perb on, serve and get a smoke
Eyes bleedin' from the brown shit
The porch thick as you could ever fuck around wit
And shut you down, bitch
I represent from all angles of the south
From S.A. to M-I-A, we in the house
Knockin' busta muthafuckas out
So what you sayin'
If you for real about this Goddamn game
You'd say you playin'
So what you claimin'
Peep the game that's bein' spit
Tell dem niggas who ain't listenin'
That Southside's the shit
I'm screamin' ""Dirty South""
While I'm chuckin' up my deuce
Dedicated to my down ass niggas
The South trues, the Southside

Southside, nigga what, nigga southside
Bitches come a dime from outta town
With they mouth wide open
Scopin' out the popped trunks, trippin'
Off the candy paint, drippin'
Elbows and vogues slippin'
Lookin' for sumtin' to happen
And thinkin' that these streets are cool
And I'm the fool to show 'em 'round
'cause I be rappin'
That's when I let 'em know
Hoe, there's no southern hospitality
'cause when dey get here
Then the southern fatality
I ball
Wit a group of niggas when it's time to do a job
Fuck these groupie bitches smokin' drankin' with the squad
Because it gets crazy after dark
They keep they hands on they gun
From 5th ward to South Park
The Southside

[Tela]

Bitches and hoes, jewelry and clothes
Money to fold, afterparties and shows
That's how it goes in this dirty hole
Southside muthafuckas need to let 'em know that uhh

Even our bitches be bouncin' in bubble Lexus
In the 'llac, in the back, wit yack
That's our thang
Niggas got game and you slang like main
I been around the world and I-I-I-I
Love my Southside niggas

I keep my forty cal cocked cause these niggas on my block bang
Right up the street from where the cops hang
And in my head I hear Pac sang
And then them rushin' memories make me cry till I can't stop man
Tell my mama I'm a killer if I happen to die
That's how I lived, ain't no sense in me lyin'
My whole life's filled with danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My neighborhood's full of gangstas and drive-bys
And niggas fightin' for position

All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up
Remember Lil' Eddie man how he light mean up

Then they wonder why we light green up

Thinking bout the block and all the mothers and kids
That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed'em
For the rest of their life fucking wings fried
Vegetable rice(gotta be kidding)

No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night
Our kids eating lunch at night
In their beds all bunched in tight
No less than three or four(you know how it go)

Two by the foot two by the headboard
Man I'm getting scared for them (Yeah I know)

My own homeboy was robbin' me, and that's 3 cold
I said '3', It's all intentional, cause 2 don't count
When your own blood is bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is schemin?
And every other corner, you're passin' a different demon
And now the clouds is open, I'm rememberin' this
Your families your backbone, your friends ain't shit

When our homeboys left, she the only ones stayed
For that very reason, I'm a try and give her the world

Listen to different scriptures, they teach on God
And if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God

I'm hearin' niggas makin' up scriptions, and playin' along
Probably sayin' I'm the hypocrit, for judgin' these folks
But you can tell he ain't a Christian, by the way that he spoke
I pray for everbody, hopin' that they hear that voice
The one that paralyzes you from head down, boy
When you're aware of your surroundings, yet you still can't move
Water shootin' outta your eyes you hear this dude
And the voice is much louder, than the voice that you
Thought was the voice of the holy spirit
Who changed your life, when you hear it?
And the next morn', you wake up and the world look lighter
The grass greener, and the sun brighter
I know the feelin' first hand, I witnessed the sights
When I allowed the Lord to come in my life
And it was like (heaven, heaven)
But I'm a man, I ain't perfect
That's a poor excuse, that ain't workin'
I asked him for forgiveness, for every sin I commit
Hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list

How do you expectin' our seeds gonna grow?
When you trap us in the ghetto

Then again, me sheddin' tears don't help
Wanna call up to the President, and see if he know help

But until it's time for me to bring it home
I'll be out in these streets, hanging in the hood
Even gangsters need to pray, cause when I pray it's understood
That I got flaws about myself, I can't make it by myself
I need the heaven's help, I want to follow in your foot steps
Done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
And given all his glory to god cause god towers

As sad as it sounds, but that's the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth, will taketh away (will taketh away)
I live and I learn, I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash, it remindes me of the now and the past
I say a little prayer, cause eventually I'll stand in the path
Of the souls and dark rows that lead to rest

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears (someone like you and me)
Take away their fears

And then a child is born
Bloody naked, clingin' to life
Unaware of his surroundin's or breathin' is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams (baby's alive)
At the same time, another mother, murders her kids
And the unbarable thought of this here just brings me to tears
It's hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith, and killin' your pearls
And sometimes, I sit it down, and wonder myself
But then again, I ain't Jesus, and I can't help
All I can do, is hope I never live with the fact
That I hurt one of my seeds ‘cause dealin’ with that
Would be the hardest thing, I’d ever have to do in my time
I'd have to take my own life too, and I couldn't climb
The stairway that you hear me singin' bout it in my rhyme
And a parent hurtin' his kid ain't decidin' the time
I know it's truth, the next day, we just livin' to die
But I believe if you livin' right, you'll live in the sky
Lookin' down on the good and the bad, the world as a whole
And hopefully you did what you did, before you had to go

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
(Someone to dry their tears) Take away their fears
Can I make it, better? (I want to make it better)
Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through? (they're through)
What can I do?
What can I do?

I say goodbye to you cruel world, I see peace in the red sky
I see the beast when the dead die, relief when my head’s high
Hear the streets up ahead cry, when the heat from the lead fly
Felt the grief when I said bye, before the sheets on my bed dried
The turn of the table, the tale of this tape
The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
The long list of the John doe’s that accompany the spirit
As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it
The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room
Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb, but I’m cool, I’m cool

Do you hear me?
I'm cryin'

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
(Someone to dry their tears)
Take away their fears (take away their fears)
Can I make it, better? (gonna make it better)
Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through?
(Everything they're goin' through) What can I do?

Unless it's my Mac-10
I'm the king of the ghetto, Z-Ro the crooked in the flesh
Looking for head shots, 'cause snitch fellas get the bullet-proof vests
What you scared for?
What happened to all the tough ass talk
The way you was bumpin', I thought you had a taste for asphalt
Look at momma's baby out here starvin' for an ass-
Whippin', beefin', with a magician then drippin' now his ass missin
I'll be damned if I pull a rabbit out a hat
Well pull my 40 out of holster, and put a snitch fella on his back
WHOA!, look how I handled this .44
My conscience be screaming Z-Ro Murder Mo!, Murder Mo!
And these snitch fellas on ""How I'm Living"" try snitchin' on ""BET""
But got a restraining order against ""Murder I-N-see""

Fin' to snitch, trapping niggaz up in they downfalls
Taping motherfuckers phone calls
Ay, I've been in this shit for two deep
From moving ki's, pushing weight was too sweet
An 8-ball will cost you 75 (Dirt cheap)
Back in the game that shit was live
And all you had to do to survive was get a whole click

Puttin niggaz up forever, cause you did the crime hop
Turned fed, and know they got indictments for real
Runnin in niggaz houses, niggaz fighting appeals
Offering 50 years to innocent motherfuckers
All because of the game, niggaz run outta hustle
Feds be showin pictures, you got to give 'em somethin
Time make a nigga forget it and start bumping
And saying shit, jeopardizing the whole thang
Niggaz run out of freedom, niggaz start to sang (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Avoid they conversation, them niggaz the dudes, fool

",Dirty Money,2003
Scarface,"Is this how you made it, or is this sickness out of control
Is the beginning of the end right now? Let me know
Do the saved souls travel the road of the souls lost?
How come the dead can't talk?
Through horrified eyes I can picture the other side
And though my heart shed tears outside I couldn't cry
Watched my homeboy die, day by day body tired
Remember, I finally accounted before he expired
They tell me there's a peaceful place, I want to see it
They say I gotta leave it to see it, so it be it
And though I appreciate being alive
Sometimes I want to see how it feels to just die
Come back and tell my story to the ones who really know me
Converse with the angels and elders that went before me
And satisfy the hunger for those who want to know
If there's life after death, and if so, where we go
I often find myself involved in deep thought
I want to see is heavens a place like we thought
And Christian science seems to think it's just a mind state
But before I put my trust in a man I'll just wait
Or better yet, I take the journey for myself
Put a bullet in my own head, it's my death
So when twelve o'clock jump on eve of 11/9
Suicide
Just as I thought, a bright light
Greeted by friends and family, so life-like
Black and in between screams and then peace
Lookin' in the eyes of the grieved and deceased
Father please, send me back, I don't want to die
I'm not as strong as I was and I can't lie
And during all the mayhem somehow I remained calm
And I woke up singing this song

I been a pawn and I been a king
And I've been down since the beckoning
I try to look beyond the sight of sound
And the lights come from the underground
Rarely got questions but I found myself somewhat astound
And through my quest for the answers, know what I found?
I found that regardless to what people say
The shooters gotta do it day for day
So make your peace

Open your books to the first chapter, verse four, page eight
And link to my thoughts as my intents are to initiate
And enter the minds of the ones who are blind
And shed light to all the mankind written in rhyme
I preach to each to get off your ass, stand on your feet
'Cause everyday it's niggas lying dead in the street
We stuck in our ways, it's different now than back in the days
Fuck what they say, 'cause ain't no coming back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talking about
I had a dream and seen a double sun, a different world was in the making
The ruler of this new world was Satan
The sky turned blood-red, the silent trumpet started playing
Then I woke up, my imagination
Running wild but then again the coming of Christ
Could be the moment of any minute, now or tonight
So make your peace, 'cause triple six is the mark of the beast
It's dark in these streets
And some might see it hard to believe but God is in me
And yea, though I walk through the valley of the wickedness
I know I'm protected 'cause I'm convicted
Anybody believing in the Big Bang Theory
And thinking that thyself is the God, you need to hear me
How do you explain
The skies, the moon, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea
The Earth without form facing the deep
Darkness and challenging the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seeds
Didn't make up the trees, so why we turn our backs on the truth?
This heaven and hell part we seem to hide from the youth
I'm telling what few tongues of the evil will despise
My intention's to revitalize, still I revive
And I've read the Books, and I heard the lessons
And I'm on my knees steady stressing
You make your peace

I been a pawn and I been a king
And I been down since the beckoning
I try to look beyond the sight of sound
And the lights come from the underground
Rarely got questions but I found myself somewhat astound
And through my quest for the answers, know what I found?
I found that regardless to what people say

You're a rich nigga's worst mistake
You're just a trophy, and what make matters worse you're fake
A mall broad tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Whatever they wear in the videos, you want it
You tryin to find the nigga with the biggest contract
To get you pregnant, so you can ride around and get fat
And collect big money, with the baby all sharing
Got a 18-year career from child bearing
And only God knows what this kid'll go through
Got mixed feelings about his dad cause of you
The dollar signs popped up, that's what did it
And dude, he was just as fucked up cause he hit it
And now you out there buyin champagne for the club
To me that's kinda fucked up

I guess fuckin with me just wouldn't keep your rep up

Of fuckin you without a rubber, fillin your pussy with cream
But when I wake and see you again, it be the same old shit
I finally realized you just a plain old bitch
Started gettin my shit tight rockin shows every night
Gettin my dick sucked, fuckin hoes left and right
Workin hard to blow up, now you wanna show up
With your stretch mark titties and pussy lips all towed up
I heard you got married, that was it you thought
Until he kicked your ass and took back all the shit that he bought
Now you're lookin for a shoulder to lean on
Bitch, I sho' hate it, cause my shit is dis-located
You was the only one I was thinkin of
But now you got a face only your mother could love

Everybody in the North gotta love us down South 'cause we blindin'
And we don't trip the big diamonds
We mainly focus on the old schools with big blocks lying

And I been around the world in one day
Chucking up the deuce for S.A.

With good cat, something beautiful to look at, fa sho'

I kick it for my niggaz in the ghetto
And all my homies in the federal

The closure after the greatest hit the sofa
When I still ride for Prince like a soldier

The two-thousand millennium comes
Since I'm the son of the father, that makes me the Don
The next up to bat, the Jordan, Larry, cousy yo of rap
And I ain't gotta walk around strapped

J don't tolerate the mack dirties
You in our motherfucking way, we tryin' to stack 30s
Now back it up, for he send something back to you, ain't plan to defend

And on and on, and on and on and on and on

Knock they dicks in the dirt, now you the bitch that's in the skirt
I'm passed the motherfucka out here paying his dues
Not the average nigga out here rapping claiming he true

Get my daily dose of game from James and take it and ride

This time I'm aiming at the neck dog

It ain't no ducking when I'm bustin'

Ain't nothing like the Sunnyside sunshine (sunshine)
Hitting corners ducking one-time
In my platinum color four dog
Tinted out roll rolls (yea I roll, roll)
I hit the beach and I say tops down
Girls with they tops down (whistle)
They got bikinis and they thongs on
Dancing to the thong song (thong song)

I see that lately that my loves on
Stop at Papa Joes and get my grub on
I ran into my old fling Tasha
Still looking cute but she was knocked up (knocked up)
I'm like ay how you been girl
I see you finna have a kid girl
The funny thing about Tasha (what's that)
Is that she was destined to be knocked up (knocked up)
She twenty-nine and still a cold freak
But she got a baby in the car seat
She wanted to be seen in all the funk spots
Still getting crunk staying drunk huh (drunk huh)
The Friday nights are still the same things
Looking for diamonds and the chrome things (bling, bling)
I'm sitting in my Benz in a nice spot
I bet you want to be my wife huh

And I been lonely for a long time
That's why I'm glad the baby ain't mine
Ran up to the door but left my car keys
I went back in the store and I saw Daffany
Lookin like she did back in eighth grade (eighth grade)
Just like she did back in eighth grade
We used to skip school and do the wild thang
And I'm like Daffany was up man
I just got out law school
She said attorney for the criminals
I'm making six figures every six months
She said she had everything a bitch want
And been lookin for a nigga for her whole life (whole life)
Don't you want to make me your wife? (Uh, uh)

These niggas is fuckin with a dangerous game

Hey Joe, what's up baby?

Yeah, I like the beat

Hahaha...
Hey, when you drop drums I'ma drop rhymes, aight?
(Drop rhymes)
Nah, I don't need no count-off
Just drop the beat and I'm on it, aight?
(2-3-4)

[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
I took my chances when I did my dirt
And my advice to any nigga if you crimin, you do it worse
Just get enough and step the fuck back
Cause in this game when you get fame
You gotta start dumpin these agents off your nutsack
I'm just a nigga out the hood tryin to have things
But when I got up on my feet you're screamin ""Brad changed!""
And your excuse was that the money came
But my excuse was that you missed the plane, simple and plain
I got to show my homies love, though
I just don't fuck around with niggas that I don't know
And you can take that how you wanna take it
I'm from these muthafuckin streets
And the same rules apply in this game, don't ever break it
Ain't my muthafuckin luck I'm all alone at the crack
And you niggas don't wanna try to attack
We steady dyin over dumb shit, and me, I'm steady losin my sleep
Cause niggas ain't familiar with the rules of the streets
You're stuck

Stuck at a standstill

On the beat one time, come on

It don't stop

Give it to em

[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]
And to my niggas on the streets crimin (watch for haters)
Stop sittin on the sidelines and (get your paper)
Too many niggas complainin pointin fingers at the problems
""That's why I hate my baby mama""
I'm just a nigga from the very bottom
Skippin classes, goin 8 balls or the white powder
Tryin to get it while the muthafuckin gettin good
The possibilities of movin out my neighborhood
Don't get me wrong, I had them dreams too
But the only thing you do is get your cream, fool
Get your muthafuckin green, fool
Niggas ain't knowin 'bout the ins and the outs
First get in, then you get out
Don't be stuck at a standstill

(You know...
To the 2, ah 2-1
(...I was thinkin)
Rock the mob shit for niggas, come on y'all
(...need to, I don't know, maybe findin new hustles
Like niggas is runnin out of hustles, you know?)

[ VERSE 3: Scarface ]
When it's over don't nobody cry
Just enjoy it while you live life cause everybody gotta die
So when you see me I'll be hella high
Bendin corners with my top down checkin out the changes in the sky
Shootin paper clips at Jupiter
The mo' I learn it's like I'm gettin stupider, and stupider
Tryin to make the best out of a fucked up decision
I'm just a nigga with a vision, which is
Gettin up, gettin out, gettin my profits
Tryin to stay away from these bitches that jock dick
Movin up to move on, gotta stay true to it
That's just the way you gotta do it
And these niggas here is renegades, don't give a fuck
But if you're real, then you like it rough, nigga what?
You know it, you know what I'm sayin is real
Now step the fuck off all those standstills
Cause you're stuck

Stuck at a standstill

Stuck

To the beat one time

She said, ""Banner, you need to harmonize (harmonize) and hide""
Yeah, okay
But I asked her I was like, ""How can a nigga be a fucking snitch?!""
Fucking snitch, bitch-ass
You don't even snitch on yo' fucking enemies, you coward-ass nigga
Kill those niggaz (I'm really, really high)
Ain't no respect to the game no mo' (more)
Niggaz is bitches (niggaz is bitches)

Shit'll never be the same
I'll never lose my love for the streets (the streets)
The streets got love for me
Might of lost my love for the game (game)
Niggaz don't even act the same
I'll never lose my love for the streets
Cause the streets got love for me (me)


[Verse 1: David Banner]
I hit the block before it's sunrise
I want to know where you bitch niggaz went and hide (yeh)
Went to sleep, open my eyes then I realize (yeh!)
Time to serve em weak, clock her ass and mash out
Get ya cash out, why ya motherfuckers sleep and ya passed out?
I'm in the hood tryin' to make a G before nine (9:00)
Five thirty (5:30) took a break, and I'm back on the grind
Four ten (4:10)
Put some dro in the wind then
Let it go cause ya know that a nigga gone
Tell she if a nigga get busted
Niggaz can't be trusted in the game cause shit ain't the same
Motherfuckers want me to blow out they brain (I done lost)
Shit cocked and blast
Put some lead in a motherfucker fast
Never play wit a gun, if ya can't stop that (stop that)
Or get that in ya motherfucking ass

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Took a chance when I came in
Did my time if I got caught
If I lost, it was my fault
Took the blame for the whole thing
And it was the work, it was my walk
To do or double wit the plot then
Let a nigga fellin' boxed in
I was slangin' in my socks then
On the corner flippin' 20's
Tryin' to turn em into 50's
On the ten speed right in front of walk in
It's no hood where I came from
Where a nigga got his game from
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm the same one
To pull a strap out my backpack
Cock the hammer back (clack!)
Duck and get ya brains hung
And shake the cop up when the block clear
Cause the drama doesn't stop here
Gotta watch for ya own peers
Nigga damn near ain't knowin' who the fuck I am
And you ain't knowin' how I got here
See we don't speak and we don't do nothin'
It's on you if you slang things
Get your money, homie, maintain
Keep yo' motherfucking mouth shut, dawg
Or you'll get offset and this a cold game
And snitch-niggaz never last long
So snitch-niggaz get yo' ass on
A snitch-nigga get yo' mask on
Took the pledge on my own hand
Then killed a rose motherfucker in my last song

",The Game,2003
Scarface,"Ghetto niggas remain violent while the killers remain silent
Niggas strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all warrin'
The lake we build houses but its the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggas do their struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons dinin'
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makes music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause its deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and won't surface
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
He came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintain me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggas

[Chorus: x6]
This is for my homies and my thug niggas

Face, picture us working at McDonald's
And me and you selling fucking toasted up
Gold slug, a car full of thug niggas
Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
We ghetto niggas can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little j down at rap-a-lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake its for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you want to
Cause I be dumping niggas off from New Orleans to California
Rowdy like a hurricane
Independent, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine
You used to see see in a suit and tie
But we young niggas in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair

[Chorus: x6]

What do you get from boosting?
Niggas coming out from California to represent them niggas from Houston
And now we rocking keep this shit popping
And all my niggas across the bay know l.a. keep the shit hot
I keep my glock inside my pants , don't give niggas a chance
To put me inside a casket you dirty bastards
Until the day I die you catch a nigga high off weed the police can't
Find me
My shit will drop and I'll sell five million
While all the niggas enter the game get caught up in drug dealing
How can I fall? how can I ball, how can I catch my enemies and murder
Them all?
My word of flame burn niggas inside their brain
Niggas can't hang with me, and like it changes, uh
Scarface got me on this shit
We laced it motherfuckers in their body and face, uh
Growing thicker, liquor made me daddy and nigga
Niggas don't want to see me world wide mob figure
M.o.b. and the leaf keep me weeded
Them niggas don't want to see me when I got weed in my system
Catch another victim, capture bodies
Bring a shottie to the fucking party, yeah
I party all night
I do this shit cause its wrong but we were born right
And to the niggas in my zone we do it long ways
Till these bitches understand nigga my song pay, cause I'm the man
Now these are my homeboys, we outlaws till the day we die
Keep this shit rough and raw my 45
Make sure that I survive to another day
To bust rhymes which from I get paid
Now that's the end of my freestyle but it was left for dead
But the shit away you can hear it playing, west side

Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin' me 
(I can't feel it in my head) I see when I'm asleep 
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep 
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and past around like weed 
Look me in my eyes(Look me in my eyes), 
and tell me what you see(and tell me what you see) 
Do you see my future, and what lies down the line? 
Is it just my test, or is it just my time? 
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did 
I forgot to be picked off, when I was just a kid 
A poison in my mind, tryin' to find relief 
But I can't get no peace, cause Shoemaukers been chasin' me 
Tryin' to set me up, bustin' down my streets 
Blockin' up my door, seekin' into catchin' me 
But I don't sell no dope, so fuck what nigga's say 
Fuck runnin' ???, and fuck da D.E.A. 
And fuck these undercover's, that lock me up for weeks 
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese 
And I ain't finna snitch, cause I don't know a thang 
Don't ask me shit bout Steve, don't ask me shit bout Jane 
I know you crackas pissed off, I can see it in your eyes 
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until the day that I die(Until the day that I die) 
So fuck you in ya asses, you know it's all a lie 
You just want to destroy me, just like you did my guy 
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth 
Listen up my niggaz: ""The F.B.I. been watchin' you"" 
Especially if you black, and tryin' to leave the streets 
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin' me 
Runnin' in my crib, makin' niggaz lie 
Nigga get escaped opened, take this 25 
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule 
I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school 
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed 
but not enough to run a dope house, so why you fuck with me? 

[Chorus] 
Look me in my eyes! 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see what I see?(My eyes!) 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee? 

Look me in my eyes, I've told 'em all I could tell you 
And now you know too much, if you lead a word I'll kill you 
You think that I'm insane, partially deranged? 
You've had your chance to pick my brain, now explain 
Whatsup with all these nightmares, there's more rewind the road 
It leads me to the same place where I started from 
right before I left home(Look me in my eyes!) 
I thought you was a shrink 
Diagnosed my symptons, I give you time to think 
OK your time is up, now analyze my life 
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes
(Look me in my eyes, my eyes) 
You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa 
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over 
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks 
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back 
? 
But he stopped the reverberations, and then he spoke the truth 
And told me all my answers, I was findin' in his book 
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked 
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find 
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes 
Looked me in my eyes

I got it like dat, cause I got
Money and the power

[scarface]
There goes 21, and still stackin 30's
Brought my brother warren lee down from new jersey
He helped me for a minute then he started screwin up
Said fuck gettin paid, I guess my brother'd rather fuck
Bitches ran his life, and they're still runnin lee
I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesn't matter, cause ac'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers, to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggaz stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggaz up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'ma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will
Come to find out, they wasn't fuckin with my boys
Busted a nigga who said he paid em, talkin noise
Hehehehehe.. I guess the juices are sour
But I ain't fallin short cause I got money and the power yup!

Chorus: scarface

Money and the power, money and the power
Sold a million records I got
Money and the power
Yup!
Money and the power, money and the power
Best to come clean, cause I got
Money and the power
Money and the power, money and the power
Money and the pow-the-pow-the-pow-the-pow-the-power!

Scarface,"Hold on now, don't die now, be strong now
He said, I was born a crack baby
In a plastic bag in the alley
Raised in a foster home
With no mother to love and I never knew my papi
Back in the days of Bobby McFerrin
Used to sing don't worry, be happy
Lord how can I be happy
When I don't even know my own family tree Lord

We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try

Gang poppin' things, doing drive-by's and angers
Kids going to school putting fears in their teacher
The teacher let them know that it ain't all good
'Cause the gang was created to protect the neighborhood, now
All you red now, all you blue now
All you yellow now, follow me now
To that place of righteousness
Where the only thing that matters is your consciousness, he said

We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try

In my father's kingdom there are many mansions
All the rooms are free, there is no tax collection
I can see Biggie, Tupac, Moses and Abraham
Jason, the one and two's, jamming with the sun of man

I've been kicked, I've been stabbed
I've been shot, I've been ? by a
Person that I thought I trusted, where I live
It's a war at the cribs, walk with a strap
Myself 'cause I don't want nobody's son on my back
My mind playing tricks ?, to really ?
Me out in five unless I take another hit
I done seen the sun set on the other side of town
Now I'm drifting in the darkness, Heaven hold me down
? but I know I'm born dying
Feel the tears of the angels looking down on me crying
For a lying ass but yo forgive us in a while
And I'm sorry, never let me forget that I'm your child
While I'm locked up in this basement staring eye to eye with Satan
In this cold dark world with no patience
We get plotted on by agents with talks of replacing
The Africans, Jamaicans and the Haitians in this next generation

We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try

Whoa, we the next generation, look at what we facing
The kids raise themselves, all kind of temptation
Flowers and candles decorating all the pavements
No, the perpetrator ain't seeing no arrangements
Nobody cares about the feelings of the poor
Man they suffer while we spending eighty billion on a war, uh
Cutting school budgets, US stockmarket plummets
Condition's only worse and I wonder what become it
Metal detectors replace music classes
Angry little kids want to beat their teacher's asses
The red and blue's, somebody gotta lose
Reality TV be reality for who
I don't question what the Lord found in me
I just pass it on to folks with no boundaries
Got a long road ahead of us, AIDS already gettin' us
Now we got stars, how many will there be left of us

We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die
The only thing I fear is the after life

Scarface,"[Intro: Scarface]
Don't see Kay in these muthafuckin' streets dog
Nigga walkin' around in this muthafucka lookin' shocked and stupid, baby
We runnin' these muthafuckin' streets for real
Kay Slay, holla at God damn baby
Kay Slay, they don't want me out here
They don't want you out here, dog
This is muthafuckin' Face Mob, Kayslay, New York City
Holla at ya God damn baby, we don't rock no muthafuckin' ice, baby
We rock this real shit, dog
And if you think a nigga bullshittin', come fuck wit it
It's goin' down...

[Scarface]
Let's put an ending to chitter, nigga, see me in gloves
I'm the proof in the booth, bitch, read me in blood
It's Face at you, freezin' muthafuckas like a statue
I got a loaded Kay Slay pointed at you
The end of your beginning, before you even get it started
You fucked up, now you in the presence of a heartless
Nigga, from out the gutter, spit it and don't stutter
I'm a gangsta, raise around the dope fiends and hustlers
But silence is golden, and the streets don't talk
Don't let sheets slide, 'cause beef don't walk
We attack hoes, fuck a nigga with wack flows
I'm the last of a dying, bitch, act like you don't know
I'm the reason you niggas walk around thug
Just remember I'm the one made, you can get touched
So what you gonna put a record out, you a muthafuckin' sellout
Slay told me to knock your ass out

[Chorus 2X: Scarface]
And you was right, I never liked ya muthafuckin' ass
To start with, you know it's better get your self regardless
And Kay, bitch, you picked the right nigga to play with
Now you got a leaky' T-shirt from the kay spit

[Raekwon]
Snow white five glendin', the elevator with the crib
Blend with it kid, I feel one of them Bill Clinton's
Mills is spent, still don, still rentin'
Still yacht flyin', still killin' fish, still killin' clicks
The fifth out, don't even breathe out
And ganna with the ill thieves, slick hammers, we all fam
What, pull out the four, pop the truck, see the luxury morgue
The casket leather, the python seeks your dog
Flashback, he and them Benz's lenses
Actin' like he did ten sentences, son ain't real
He got excited, parked the truck, just leaned the lighter
Twist the blunt, sat back, son beepin', we drove off
It's money on it, until them young niggas don on it
Devour the snitches, you get on, you born with it
Make a toast for hours, for all the money and power
The right division, don't never let corns get it, drama

[Chorus 2X]

[Fat Joe]
Pass the rock, you niggas gassed a lot
I never liked ya ass, but then again, you can't be shocked
Most feared in this rap game, and ain't for frontin'
Best believe when shit pop off, I'm blazin' somethin'
It's the J to the Izzo, you know the rest
Nigga can't get a Twiz-o, but flow the best
I've been doin' this for years, ruinin' careers
Niggas never wanna listen til the toolies in the air
It's the kid that don't be givin' a fuck, I hold a shit outta grudge
The type of nigga that'll spit at the judge
Niggas gettin' gelled, they say I'm livin' it up
'cause I'm at Hollywood with Denzel, flickin' it up
I play the corner when the shit is hot, summer time in the X
Kay Slay got the shit on lock
That's where you go to find the God body
Second to none, unless you compare him to John Gotti, God...

[Chorus 2X]

Stankin' the speculation, you want it, you got it, baby
I'm at you a lifetime, the nigga washin' your window shorten your lifeline
You're fuckin' wit white wine, I'm fuckin' wit nitrate
I'm emotionless when I get 'em, a nigga wit ice veins
Ain't impressed wit status or jewelry, I'm on some street shit
Don't believe in sit in front of a jewelry, that's weak shit

I remember bustin' out the house from police duckin' the vans
Wit them taped-up broken revolvers stuck to my pants
That was '88, around the time of Slick Rick era
Day to day, rolled chains wit them thick knit sweaters
Who gives a fuck what the D.A. say, they want to see me pay
Motherfucker this is G.F.K.!
I settle crimes wit metal 9s and I ain't gonna stop
'Til your brains all over the street like ?
Marshmellow dimes, brick be the size of cobblestones
Acknowledge the throne, it's Pretty Tone
I'm legendary and compared to my work on the strip, why'all secondary
I'm hittin' these fiends lovely, my shit be extra heavy
Like construction workers in Timbs, and plus they two box
Two glocks incase I gotta bump a few cops off
You know how we do in Staten Island, this is Gaten Island, nigga
Not a non-violence sticker

(Chorus)
[Scarface]
I gave you a chance to eat, but you chose to bite the hand that fed
You took your shit, nigga, lay in your bed
Who'd ever thought this nigga that we sat down at our table and fed
Would roll on the street and on wit the feds
I used to love this nigga
Now I roll around wit a mask and a strap and a grudge for that nigga
Fuckin' wit me, this adds the fuel to the fire
And I'm about to snap that wire!

[Ghostface Killah]
We want them new 20s and 100s, Ziplock money
why'all gon' fund it, we gon' eat big like Big Pun did
And we goin' all out like Hussein's sons did
We stickin' niggaz like New York cops wit plungers
So take some advice, there's three bears
Cashmere down wit 12 gauges under the table
Slay got the shotty, ain't that your label
And them other two bears, yo, theys the one that paid you buddy!

Scarface,"[Talking]
That's a set back, you know I'm saying man
Lil' Red, way back in the motherfucking cut man
Nigga was like shit nigga, I was like what come on man

[Scarface]
Street lights are glowing, everyday's another struggle
And moving slowly in silence, steady making sho' my hustle
Is air tight, these city streets is hectic gotta get it here
Tomorrow ain't a promise to me, so I don't live in fear
I work until I touch it, stack it until I need it
I spend it on what I want, re-up and that's when I bleed it
The soldier could never see me, as being some'ing that's lesser
A nigga straight out the gutter, murdered without a question
Product of my surroundings, click it clack it and and down him
All they know is he missing, but niggaz ain't never found him
I'm sorry but still in yet, I don't live it on regrets
I'm a motherfucking killer, for realer this ain't a threat
I'm as gangsta as it gets, and my advice to you is live your life
And never when niggaz might, hit you under city lights
So get it right (never know)
You never know when niggaz might, hit you under city lights get it right

[Hook - 2x]
Lord forgive me, cause I know I ain't living right
Still I gotta make some'ing happen, under them street lights
But pay attention, let me show you what my life like
You can get your days cut short, under them street lights

[Yung Redd]
Them folks got me under the scope, cause I ain't living right
Still I ain't the one to provoke, dog you get it right
20 inch shoes when I cruise, under them city lights
Careful with the road I choose, cause you can lose your life
I'm praying and hoping, I never get caught in the moment
Shot from a glock, that's smoking from not scoping
When a nigga told me, you don't work you don't eat
So I'm slanging thangs for cheap, where the streets lights meet
And my pop, was a rolling stone
15 I was grown, 16 I was holding my own
Is it wrong to sell you a dream, or sell you a zone
A long way from home, on this road I roam
Still I'm po'ing the liquor, for niggaz who ain't with us
Ery'body ain't a gangsta, every nigga ain't a killa
Naw but them laws, couldn't tell ya the difference
So pay attention, or find yourself locked in prison this ain't living man

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil Ron]
Years have passed, and shit in the hood getting drastic
Two days ago, my homegirl got blasted
That's tragic, happened right on my block
I'm feeling paranoid, laws might run in my spot
So I'm living low key, and them folks don't know me
Slowly I ride through the city, stack mo' cheese
Then I slide out, to the hideout and smoke on
Haters watching, my chest is froze like a snow-cone
But hold on, trash talking ain't my game
Rather pimp me a dame, or switch lanes in a Range
Peep this it ain't a secret, them laws ain't right
They like to catch a late night, living the life
That's why I'm on top of my game, always thinking twice
Don't get it twisted, I still got a mean right
But most of the time, my nigga I'm on chill
It's real in the field, it's easy to get killed

[Hook - 2x]
",Street Lights,2005
Scarface,"I spent my years isolated
Couldn't live with myself
I was trouble as a young kid
My tears didn't help
Very depressing and it was evident
I'd fade to the deep
All alone like these four walls came at me
Barricaded cause my mind state
I just wanted to die
Never happiness
Just sad time living a lie
Rater leave me
I was suicidal
Slittin' my wrist
Mamma thinking I was crazy
Like use some sense
And on them days I was feeling
I was paining inside
It wasn't me
It was my inner feeling coming alive
I remember waking up like I was going to school
Left me standing in the hospital
Locked in this room
Put away
I was a troubled kid losing my mind
Fallin' short
Of what they expected from me every time
So don't fault me if you meet me
And I look to be strange
I'm just mad that the sunshine dies in the rain

[Chorus]
Sunshine to the rain
When it comes it goes again
Even when the story ends
Just turn the page and begin again
Sunshine on cloudy days
Don't hate me I'll never change
Thankful I was made this way
Your sunshine for cloudy days

Now I was raised in a neighborhood
With half of a dime
If you was real it was understood
It showed in your eyes
Every corner had a different hustle
Sprawled on your face
Drug wars
Growin' up raw cause violence the case
Had to move along
Quiet it's kept
Spoken words got you dealt with
So ride with yourself
I'm a juvenile
They telling me get down for they wealth
No getting high
Cause when you gettin' high
You needing some help
As far as help
Mine was middle though
You know how that go
Psychologically
I deal with demons talkin' in codes
Hopefully, I'll get to meet Jesus
Somewhere on this road
Sick of hearing people screaming in my head saying no
Better of if I was dead
Cause they killing me slow
All in all it's just a part of my life
Watching the show
Ain't nothing never came to niggaz sleep
Except for a dream
It's like a movie with the ending credits etched in the screen

[Chorus]

I prayed my last days of sunshine
Just die in the rain
Kinda selfish
But I know that dying
Eases the pain
Heartfelt words
Spoken hurt
Provided the frame
For the picture I done painted for the master to explain
So I leave behind my testimony
Witness to give
Far from holy
But this matrimony provided the script
To live on
And live by
Grow up and grow on
Get on and get by
So forth and so on
And this here's the last days
I can hear the horns singin'
I can see the red sky
I can hear the drum beating
I seen the dead die
How long will they mourn Jesus
At least I'm saved by my scriptural warn readings
And while leaving you here
Believe what you believe in
But you don't want to not believe
Believe in seeing
Don't take this here too personal
Cause I'm just speaking
This is my family on my mind

My life is real baby, you peeping me take a picture
You peeping me take a picture, (you should take a photograph) - [2x]

Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback

Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph)

[Chamillionaire]
Introducing the truest voice of the South, it's who else but me fool
Don't let all that foolishness they feed you, on T.V. mislead you
Don't let all the magazines, and them papers out there deceive you
The cups that be used to sip, but Caucasian kinda like my tee do
You see that hand be glistening, you see the Sedans we flipping
The hundreds of grands we getting, these units of scans we shipping
You see that Caddy tipping, them thangs on that Caddy twisting
That paint and that candy dripping, that drank and that can is missing
That ain't a Cola, though dry and you feeling sober
Boys trying to switch it over, apply it up in a soda
Home of the Houston hustlers, who grinding and hit the quota
Who fire and hit the doja, you high when you sniff the odor
Told ya you gotta have, a foreign or buy your slab
Afford it then buy it that's, important without it now
You ain't gotta take college class, to see that we bout our cash
You not if you gotta ask, let's take a pic by the slab hol' up

You see my slab, you see my candy slab
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph

Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph

Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph

[Chamillionaire]
When I'm tipping they'll probably watch me, the cops'll be paparazzi
And try to patrol my posse, we shining and glowing glossy
The jealous will try to top me, we keep it too real to copy
What I'm listening to ain't a floppy, that disc gon be Screwed and Chop-pied
All the ballers will ride to this, deposit deposit slips
Buy the car and apply the fifth, raise the trunk an entire lift
Use to go to that Kappa, but Kappa ain't been as crunk
So I'm popping up at Daytona, on chrome and I'm popping trunk
Jamming that ""Ridin' Dirty"", while riding beside the laws
And they staring over at me, trying to scare me like I'ma pause
Tell 'em naw they know I'ma crawl, all day in the robber cause
I'm trying to go wash the ride, till them tires have whiter walls
You peeping him take a picture, that chrome and that paint official
You smoking then take a swisha, there's plenty just take 'em wit ya
You chilling you ain't a sipper, then I'ma be hanging wit ya
Take a hold of the grain and grip a, handful and smile for the pictures nigga

[Bun B]
You see the bling up on my bracelet, and the shine on my chest
Syrup in my styrofoam, it's sweet with doja no cess
You done put it down with the rest, time to roll with the best
Cause when you ride with the original, you ain't gotta guess
I'm the connection that you need, when they say it's a drought
Cause it's not really a drought, them other niggaz just out
And I'm the plug you gotta have, when they say the river's dry
Cause it's not really dry, they just ran out of supply
I'm too fly for the clouds, too down for the green grass
Better wear tinted lenses, if you look at my clean ass
Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback
Candy still dripping, 4's is still tipping
Wood grain grass, steering wheel I'm still gripping
Repping for P.A.T., the West and the East
And I'm repping for Pimp C, till he get back on the streets it never cease

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
My life is real baby, ain't just a song (ain't just a song)
Gripping that wood wheel baby, and riding chrome (I'm riding chrome)
This is for the real playas, that get that do' (that get that do')
Tell me how it feel baby, to see I'm-I'm riding candy and chrome

Know I'm saying, gripping wood
Riding through the hood, and feeling good

You need to go on, do yourself a favor playa
And take a motherfucking picture

",Picture Perfect,2005
Scarface,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

Are raining in on your bright, sunny day

should be a celebration of life.",Rain,2005

See all that listening to them hoes in your ear gotta quit 
I see they smile when I'm around when I leave

Popping tags brand new clothes you cant tell by the tag 
I don't mean to boast and brag but them hoes around you hating 
They just waiting on you to slip so I could leave yo ass with nathan 
Then when I do that they gon' back door and try to holla 
Hoping I'm a do them like you and drop them off some dollas 
But I ain't cause I can't afford to go back down that road 
Id rather stay on my J-O and stack a bank roll 
But I ain't cause I cant afford to go back down that road 
Id rather stay on my J-O and stack a bank roll 
But if you real and you down and in public you don't clown holla at me ill be around

Nigga from off the mound nigga we ducking them clowns
Nigga taking they crown nigga and shoving the town 
Nigga rocks off the ground got the cush by the pounds
Nigga ankle blingin' baby wrist on freeze got 
The pinky on the ice love a bitch wit gold teeth nigga hot
Girl nigga loving the G keep the work under the seat 
She do it for me take a trip to port her off to the beach 
Tell her homie hold it down cause we hustle to eat 
And got me feeling like I lost my Jones I done lost my horns 
So H town is on and nothing change 
Cause the palms got chrome nigga do this in the early 
Cause we getting it on and baby girl you could shop alone 
And fly the four to France and take a hundred bones

[Verse 1]
You gotta war on drugs
Well every other day a nigga dies
You showed yours, now let me show you mine
Bring the six o'clock news
And let me walk 'em in my shoes
Through what you call the inner city
And what I call the blues
I'm broke here, and I ain't wainting on a call
From a resturaunt to bust tables
When Petie's got a job
Making 35 a week and all he do is run the streets
This nigga always caked up
Chromed out and draped up
Constantly telling me we need to get this paper
I'm getting skinny and it's he who get my weight up
Straight up
And plus I'm tired of missing meals
So I paid the man a visit...

[Petie] ""What's the goddamn deal?
It's good to see you dog
I thought you might've choked up
Respect and money, well I can get you both of 'em""

[Face] ...I went inside, watching him break it down
When he was finished he handed a nigga nine
A nine milimeter, nine zips
Said if I sold each one for nine, I'd have grip
I hesitated, I ain't never sold a stone
I done seen it fuck the hood up
Plus all my niggaz gone
And they ain't never coming out
So with that in consideration
I took the package and bounced
I'm headed home, dazing out in a zone
Eyes on my luggage, I'm abouts to get it on
Get to the house, spread it all on the couch
Getting this bank what it's about

[Hook]
That's how a nigga made
They got a nigga paid
I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave

Get money everyday
It ain't no other way
That's how it is until they put me in a grave

[Verse 2]
I'm in the living room looking at the news
Got a razor and some zipper baggies
About to do the fool
Cutting hundred dollar slabs
Wholesaling niggaz halves
Getting money like a muthafucka
Serivng niggaz bags
Got the blocks all blowed up
The whole hood smoking
Got a pistol I ain't shot yet
So dude's wide open for it
I'm just a youngster, I ain't done it, but I will
'cause I was taught you got to get it
So I get it how I live
Finna get my ma a crib, she ain't working
So I'm forced to win the bread for the household
'cause dad was no support
Often in and out of court, caught a case out of town
Got a body on his conscience, but nobody made a sound
He was going through the motions
He gonna probably beat the case
Still I get down on my knees
And beg the Lord to let him raise
Get up and get my workers out
Supply 'em with the goods
Give instructions to the goons
To come up out the hood
I ain't gotta pay the fronters
So I'm finally finna raise
'cause the bottom line is this homie
You gotta get paid

[Hook]
That's how a nigga made
They got a nigga paid
I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave

Get money everyday
It ain't no other way
That's how it is until they put me in a grave
I never learned a trade
I fuck with chess and spades
The only other game a nigga learned to play was
Working hopping yay
'cause kissing ass was gay
I'm on my business, I want money like I'm jade

[Verse 3]
I'm the nigga in the hood
These little homies wanna be like
I got when shit was good
But now-a-days off in this street life
These niggaz switch it on you
Quick to put you in the crosses
Now he standing in your crib
And got a pistol in your mouth
That's your muthafuckin' boy
He popped you and popped your broad
Now he headed to the closet
And he about to take it all
So watch your muthafuckin' friends
'cause them the ones that sell you out
Ain't no future in being loyal
When niggaz see you want the top
Jealous hearted muthafuckas
Always quick to say you hating
I don't want another homie dog
He swallowed that and chased it
You can make it like I made it
I think it's best you do it dolo (solo)
That way niggaz can't say shit about you
When talking to the po-po
Oh yo, you know that dude that fronted me my come up
I caught him coming out the neighborhood
And had him done up
That's why I'm skeptic
When it comes to different faces
'cause I know I got it coming
But 'til then, I'll get my bank, shit

...""more food for thought""...

[Verse 2 - Z-Ro]
Go on and let a nigga peak, go on and let a nigga poke
Give me some assistance as I manuver my long stroke
I hope you don't think I'm payin'for it that's the wrong hope
'Cause I know you wanna be Z'Rollin over chrome spokes
Bitch I know you wanna tell ya girlfriends how it was
To get hit from the back, in the back of the 'Lac by a thug
And to get ran through until you get carpet burns off the rug
And to get nutted on by nine niggaz with diamond grills and guns
And how you got on my microphone and sung a sixteen
Ya performance deserves a grammy check out my big screen
Most bitches don't know but you know what suckin a dick mean
Yeah the head was fed but what up with that in them jeans
I can see the pussy (?)lookin like a big bee
Make ya cycle start early my shovel be diggin deep
I don't wanna relationship, I just want me some relations
Go on and let a nigga poke hoe, and stop shuckin with my patience

[Chorus - Bun be sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 3 - Pimp C]
Bitch get down on me at the drop of a dime
Fuck all that are & be singin shit I ain't got the time
I'd rather bust yo'ass up with some screwed and chopped
Let me test ya jaws and let me stretch out ya cotton
I'm still Pimp see bitch, the name ain't changed
Puttin stick up in these hoes don't remember they name
'cause we tired of playin games with them booty lickers
'cause we jumped up in ya life, cause I'm a true dirt digger
So go on hit the streets, break them lame tricks
Then bring it back to daddy that's how you can get this dick
I need the cash first - and the ass last
And we can blow dro in the Benz while I smash on the gas
So let a nigga pimp, and let a nigga mack
And later on tonight you can get hit up in ya back...and get ya money back
But when I make ya pussy skeet bitch you gon'buy me a 'Lac

[Chorus - Bun be sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 4 - Juvenile]
I ain't tryna talk a hole in yo head
But I can tell you didn't excel what them hoes done said
Starrin at my neck and my wrist 'cause my shit is frozen red
And I look like a easy hustler so go ahead
Ya leavin the same way ya met me
You gon'be grievin if you sex me, while I'm schemin on the next piece
I'll poke ya cookie I don't give a fuck who know this
Who up in the area that aknowledge what a hoe is
All my warriors is lovin my rep
How I took it to the world from the project steps
Playin touch with my broad like my children
And it ain't like back in the days when we ducked behind buildings
I be a threat to tell a broad what I'm feeling
Especially if she poor and she need to be gettin no bullshittin
She ever fix her mouth for some money it's good with me
I ain't the one what you need is a stool pigeon

[Chorus - Bun be sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 5 - Petey Pablo]
If you think I'm a treat a bitch with high price drawls
Any differance then the way I treat the grandma's on
How many ways is there to say that you terribly wrong
Would you understand me better if I just said ""naw""
Fuck what another motherfucker told y'all
That's tipical talk when they dick hard
They just wanna little pussy mama that's all
It's like fourth down, two yards fuck it they goin for it
How am I payin'for it?, and how much you charge for it?
It ain't about being a whore that's what it's made for
Get ya paper baby fuck what the world say
Get ya bills paid....okay!

Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke

Scarface,"[Talking]
That's a set back, you know I'm saying man
Lil' Red, way back in the motherfucking cut man
Nigga was like shit nigga, I was like what come on man

[Scarface]
Street lights are glowing, everyday's another struggle
And moving slowly in silence, steady making sho' my hustle
Is air tight, these city streets is hectic gotta get it here
Tomorrow ain't a promise to me, so I don't live in fear
I work until I touch it, stack it until I need it
I spend it on what I want, re-up and that's when I bleed it
The soldier could never see me, as being some'ing that's lesser
A nigga straight out the gutter, murdered without a question
Product of my surroundings, click it clack it and and down him
All they know is he missing, but niggaz ain't never found him
I'm sorry but still in yet, I don't live it on regrets
I'm a motherfucking killer, for realer this ain't a threat
I'm as gangsta as it gets, and my advice to you is live your life
And never when niggaz might, hit you under city lights
So get it right (never know)
You never know when niggaz might, hit you under city lights get it right

[Hook - 2x]
Lord forgive me, cause I know I ain't living right
Still I gotta make some'ing happen, under them street lights
But pay attention, let me show you what my life like
You can get your days cut short, under them street lights

[Yung Redd]
Them folks got me under the scope, cause I ain't living right
Still I ain't the one to provoke, dog you get it right
20 inch shoes when I cruise, under them city lights
Careful with the road I choose, cause you can lose your life
I'm praying and hoping, I never get caught in the moment
Shot from a glock, that's smoking from not scoping
When a nigga told me, you don't work you don't eat
So I'm slanging thangs for cheap, where the streets lights meet
And my pop, was a rolling stone
15 I was grown, 16 I was holding my own
Is it wrong to sell you a dream, or sell you a zone
A long way from home, on this road I roam
Still I'm po'ing the liquor, for niggaz who ain't with us
Ery'body ain't a gangsta, every nigga ain't a killa
Naw but them laws, couldn't tell ya the difference
So pay attention, or find yourself locked in prison this ain't living man

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil Ron]
Years have passed, and shit in the hood getting drastic
Two days ago, my homegirl got blasted
That's tragic, happened right on my block
I'm feeling paranoid, laws might run in my spot
So I'm living low key, and them folks don't know me
Slowly I ride through the city, stack mo' cheese
Then I slide out, to the hideout and smoke on
Haters watching, my chest is froze like a snow-cone
But hold on, trash talking ain't my game
Rather pimp me a dame, or switch lanes in a Range
Peep this it ain't a secret, them laws ain't right
They like to catch a late night, living the life
That's why I'm on top of my game, always thinking twice
Don't get it twisted, I still got a mean right
But most of the time, my nigga I'm on chill
It's real in the field, it's easy to get killed

Scarface,"Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and profiles

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill

My name is Banks, but you can call me Igloo
There's white rocks on my neck and my wrist's blue
So don't trip 'cause you know I got my pistol
You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

Yeah, Louie introduced me to jewelry, now I'm lovin' it
Tell Jacob the shinin's so good, them h*** love the s***
Diamond after diamond and I climbed up out the bottom
So holla if it's a problem, I got 'em just like you got 'em

I'm stylin', they grillin' 'cause my whip can buy a skyscraper
Roll down the windows stick my hand out, ""Hi hater""
I'm on my way to L.A., I'll see you guys later
You'll be here when I get back, ain't got no time to drink that

Now all I do is sit back, hop on the plane and sip 'gnac
Hop in the Range and whip that, came in the game with this crap
You say my name you get smacked, right on your brain with the gat
Know who you playin' with Black, then holla back

Don't give a f***, b**** you ain't gotta like me
I pop my trunk and have you runnin' in your Nike's

Look what I just bought, this white mink I got it in New York
And this bright link I put it on and walk right out the store
Where's my car keys? What am I gon' drive?
My Phantom got the steering wheel on the wrong side

Pocket full of cash, Ferrari with the drive-out tags
Them h*** followin' us, let me stop and get some gas
Liberace, the cops watch me
I'm ice skatin' like a n**** playin' hockey, holla back

So don't trip 'cause you know I got my pistol
You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

Canary yellow princess cut, rocks when I smile
Fat boy kept it gritty since I was a chubby child
Look at me now, hat cocked up, wristwatch rocked up
When I put my hand up to my mouth and hit that sticky stuff

The light, hit the ice, on my eight-ways piece
In the streets, I'm a G, on the mic, I'm a beast
Keep a b**** on her knees, n**** please, I'm a pimp
Purge first, ask last, I'm a shark, you a shrimp

Check a deuce, Chevrolet, rims taller than my son
Gun, on the seat with a extra clip 'cause I ain't fin' to run
In my brand new, shell toe, three stripe, all white
In other words, come my way with that s*** you gon' lose your life

What the f*** are they yellin'?
Dope man, anybody killa in the hood, f*** the homeboy sellin'
I've got a problem with him, if I can't touch it
Then he can't slang it and these streets get dangerous

Corny n****z pull up in cargo vans
Palms sweaty, icky's out with they masks all mad
I gave 'em the order and that's all bad
Born into flossin' flashin' got his mark-a**, smashed

The Iceman is in the buildin' chillin', big game huntin'
And this lame's, stuntin', got an addiction
That's deeper than a prescription, he's sleepin'

And he in love too, and still be fucking all of them
Can you imagine you in lock with one breeze for life?
Waking up in the morning and laying down the night
With the same face looking at you all the time
Realizing now that happiness was hard to find
You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face
Plus she's always mad, and her sex ain't great
And she don't suck dick like she used to do
Force a nigga into trying to find him something new

You been ran through, and I know for a fact you got history
But since we met, I've been hearing your name in certain circles
Pussy got a snap like a turtle
And you can catch a nigga on the late night
Coming out the club, half drunk off Remy and Sprite
You make a man out of your clit, that's how you handle the dick
It's unlike no other, she a bad motherfucker
But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercover
Make me look fucked up, because unlike those others
I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan
So you can't get mad because I am not your man
Your under-standing was bad, it was not my plan
For you to fall in love with me, girl it's not like that

[Chorus]

[Scarface Verse 3]
For me to say that, ""I do, "" would be a lie because I don't
Believe no woman is right for me so I won't
Try to talk myself into thinking she is
And if she leaves me for this, that's just one less bitch
And trust me, I tried to be a one woman man
But for every one woman, there's a man, home man
Saying, ""Damn, I done spent six years in this shit
The first two was cool and then the bitch just flipped""
And then that's it, had to make some new plans
'Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man
And you're hurt all along, steady hitting her phone
But a bigger dick and longer bank roll, she gone
And if I ever say, ""Maybe, "" and you thought that I might
You consider, just imagine what my wife was like
And if you ain't love my kids like you loved your own
And me unconditionally when I was wrong, I was gone

[Chorus]",Girl You Know,2007
Scarface,"Man, take another hit breathe out
In a zone blowing smoke out a glass teapot
I?m chillin at home on some solo shit
I love piece and when its quiet, I don?t want no bitch
I don?t want to look at lifetime, I?m fine with fuse
Fuck entertainment weekly bitch, find some news
I like Keyshia but I need some blues
Steady hollering about some time
Bitch I need some Room
Don?t get me wrong ya?ll I love females
That come around but after while, I need some self
I know I?m selfish at times but bottom line, move around if that ain?t how you get down
Plus my album coming out real soon, I?m in the studio daily tryna write these tunes
And for you to stress a nigga like I?m running these hoes is outta line
Goodbye to your life, pack up your clothes and go

[Hook sung by Nina]
All I ever wanted was for him to see
Was that I was all the woman he would ever need
I?ve given all of me so unselfishly
And now he?s at the door telling me to leave
Now where do I Go

I?m about to hit some spots with my guys from outta town
And there you go making those mean old eyes
Feel like I?m in prison sometimes
Like my freedom is gone like I?ve committed a crime and that?s some bullshit
You watch a nigga like I?m 6 years old, how the fuck you think this shit gon? grow
I?ma tell you how this shit gon? go
I?ma hop off in this clean ass triple silver Porsche Turbo and hit the road and Go
You run a nigga blood pressure up from that spite shit 
And normally I don?t fuck with that type bitch
But she got a nigga feeling her though
Text messaging my phone I feel like killing this ho
But before I let her get on my row
I?ma hand the bitch her walking papers letting her go and hit the door
But yo, I ain?t never seen a UFO 
And I ain?t never seen a ho that?s more important that dough 
So Go

[Hook sung by Nina]
All I ever wanted was for him to see
Was that I was all the woman he would ever need
I?ve given all of me so unselfishly
And now he?s at the door telling me to leave
Now where do I Go

I?m rolling late night with my buzz on
Leaving out a strip club and wanting my fuck on
I?m strolling through a list of my missed calls
And right up out the blue man this bitch calls
You coming over here (woman?s voice)
I?m like shit naw
So to question that decision she eats up a dick raw
But man, I?d rather go to bed with a hard dick 
Than to have to spend the whole night fucking and arguing
This bitch a lunatic, fuck a nigga high off
I wish it was I way I could hit and just drive off
But that?s not happening
So I?ma lay my ass down, watching girl?s gone wild penis in my hand
Hardest times and I don?t wanna sell out
Still I?m putting on my flip-flops to bail out
I grab my keys off the table and coat
It?s an open invitation for a nigga to score, so I go!

[Hook sung by Nina]
All I ever wanted was for him to see
Was that I was all the woman he would ever need
I?ve given all of me so unselfishly
And now he?s at the door telling me to leave

Scarface,"I would, never violate the codes of the streets
And I would never make a promise, that I know I couldn't keep
And I would, never testify, cop out for a plea
Or surrender information on my boys to the police
And you could, never catch me on the block without a strap
And I would, never pull it out unless I'm bouts to black
And I could, never forget my homies dyin' for they scratch
Forever pourin' out liquor for 'em, God send me back
And I'll, never shed tears, my heart is like a stone now
Never thought I'd live to see 21 look I'm grown now
Never say never they tell me all the time
Cause never means it's forever, but it's never crossed my mine
And I'll, never go broke, I promise I'm a shine
Never come short on my issue, I'm on it every time
And I'll, never be past it, you better gimme me mine
It's my money, and I want it, every motherfuckin' dime
No I, never forgot all my struggles in the past
And I could, never forget how to hustle for my cash
And I will, never forget how I felt when I saw Brad
Take that first breath and from then, I knew I had to mash
And it could, never be said I went out like a hoe
Never been punked, I'll never let it slide, never let it go
Never ever, never ever ever no
Get on my level hoe, or get a shovel hoe
It's never any question for my manhood I get down
I'll never switch, never snitch, never sit down
I'll never hesitate to squeeze a nigga six rounds
I'll never squat to take a piss, who's the bitch now
I never ran, I never will, I ain't never scared
It's in my bloodline, the realest nigga ever bred
And that's some of the realest shit that I done ever said
And I can die but through my lyrics, I ain't never dead
I'll never disrespect my momma, never disrespect her momma neither
I'll never turn my back on Jesus
I'll never get caught off in the system, cause I believe a
Man that follows man, ain't no man, and I'm a leader
Never go turncoat my nigga, I could never trade
I'll never cross my homies out, that I ain't how I'm made
And I never had not one regret, on how I was raised
I'm from the ghetto, where I slung and rapped it every day
Never knew no other way, this ain't gon' never change
Never gon' bite my tongue, FUCK what nigga say
100 with myself I swore to God I'd stay the same
And when I finally got my paper, I was on my game
I'll never talk a nigga down, do yo' thang dawg!
Never hate a dude for tryin, that's insane dawg
Get yo' motherfuckin' money, that's the thang dawg

Scarface,"[VERSE 1: Scarface]
You was playin when you was sayin you was ready,
I'm knowin' you ain't mean it when you told me you was tired of life
And just wanted to leave it you were drinkin,
So I ain't really pay it no attention,
Took you back to your crib and dropped you off
With the intention of gettin with this Asian chick
I've been offerin (this chick) somethin exquisite,
I had to spit that game 'cause she was vicious,
I'm hoppin back on 6-10 punchin the drop
On my way out to her house I started noticing cops,
Somethin tellin me to turn around and follow these dudes,
Normally I wouldn't consider but out of the blue I'm bustin a you
I get off where they get off at
Well-familiar with these streets, this where I came up at
Roadblocks, yellow tape, ""a crime scene"" they say,
What the fuck just happened? I just left this place...
I get out and started walkin askin Frog, ""What's up?""
Lookin at me dazed like, ""Face, it's all fucked up...""
I move a little closer tryin to see who it is
And I saw his baby mama in tears holdin his kids...

[CHORUS]
[incomprehensible]

[VERSE 2]
And it was then it finally hit me
I'm standing here nervous as I can be
It was nothing that can prepare me for what I'm finna see
I'm praying this is a dream and I'm bout to awake
But the closer I got the more I realize fate
Wasn't fair to change for me
And why would I think so
My homie had a date with death
He had to make though
I'm feelin eerie, I'm liftin up the yellow tape
By the time I get to the scene
They rollin this away
I wonder what's under this sheet, my knees get weak
To the point I had to take me a seat
This shits deep
When they put a nigga down that you was raised around
What was once a minor statement's turnin' major now
Never woulda thought in years that my homie was suicidal
Had it all money and kids and a wife that read the bible
They say its life and death in the slum
He had his reasons I shoulda believed him
Anotha soul no longer breathin'
Hate to say it but this one been heavy on my conscience
My nonchalantness just took a life over some nonsense

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
And everybody thinkin' its murder, but homicide sayin self-inflicted
By the way the body was sitting, brains in the kitchen
Who coulda predicted
But the detectives who was fishin'
Fucked up that the family had to see dad in his position
All I remember was us doin what we did
To survive in these streets where we lived
We was kids growin up in this environment
Nothing but trouble
You either struggled or you hustled
Folded the bubble
Grade school til we dropped out, we had a plan
We was either finna be rich or die like a man
We did it all for the love of the hood, every journey
Imagine seein' your dawg lifeless across a gurney
I wonder what was goin on
You shoulda said that you was feelin' mad
I coulda talked you outta that
But never will I see you again
Nor will your kids
Nor will your family or your friends
Its the end
Not even words I write in this song
Can right that wrong
My nigga is gone and life goes on

[CHORUS]
",The Suicide Note,2007
Scarface,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

Are raining in on your bright, sunny day

should be a celebration of life.",Rain (Bridge),2007

Boys and girls

Scarface:
I remember in the 80's me and pops would rock
In a 7 0 chevy with the drops in slot
Use to pass me pepsi cola while he drunk him a pint
Tippin' to the southside runnin' a light
Use to have me up in 3rd ward checkin' his traps
Collectin' his scratch protection' his snap
Use to always tell a nigga keep your mind on paper
Bitches in your head you keep your eyes on paper
Cause a niggas definition is a killa for scratch
You kill a motherfucker you kill him for that
You got caught up in this shit that means you fucked it up
Old man spittin' game so I sucked it up
Old enough to do my own thang got me again
Flip my second paycheck to cop me a lid
Went and seen my homie short dawg that slided me a track
Went to mase's pawn shop and got me a gat
Didn't know this crack shit I got my uncle to cook
With my eyes on my paper I just fubbled and looked
Impatiently waitin' for the pot to boil
Man I can't wait to see your rock from ?
Put my work upon the table and it's startin' tonight
Time for me to bring brad jordan to life
Sat my ass upon the corner till it started to bounce
Glock scratchin' reach that and started her out
It wasn't long before I was goin' for nine
I'm seventeen around millionaires goin' for mine
And if you got off in my way while I was headed for that
You found your ass misplaces with your head in your lap
And niggas is gettin' shiffer with time
That's why you never see me with a partner in crime
I'm down and dirty nigga fuck the world
And that's what separated geto boys from girls you know?

Bushwick bill:
5th ward is the spot where niggas get shot
Hoes sell cock and every block is hot
Niggas start shit but they don't start it with bill
Cause them motherfuckers know they're blood gonna spill
Ever since I was a kid growin' up in the bottom
I beat a niggas ass and if I didn't I shot him
Never gave a fuck about his family cryin'
Bottom line, better his than mine
You come around me with that live shit I kill it fast
I throw a search party for your fuckin' stankin' ass nigga
Cause it's a motherfuckin' rep thang
You got a set of nuts you better let them motherfuckers hang
Even if you're facin' 20 years you never rat
You do your time and you come on back
And if he a homie he really take care of your people while you're gone
And bless you when you come back home
Do your time and don't whine is the motherfuckin' anthem
That's the type of shit most niggas can't phantom
Them bitches tongues come unfurled
But that's what separated the ghetto boys from girls c'mon

Scarface:
I bet you often wonder how niggas survive in the trail
You got jacked and took six and died in your house
And motherfuckers sat and grieved your death
One of them motherfuckers counted up the keys then left
Kind of strange the game it took a change for the worse
Split the brain get the cain get back to your dirt
And keep the jack you did up under your hat
Cause if the word got out you killed him then they killin' you back
I never thought that '86 would bring me trouble again
You'd think but these niggas on some up shit like double your pay
And gives a fuck about respect and joy
So how the fuck you figure niggas got respect for a hoe
But then again niggas always put their trust in a bitch
But in the end it's another nigga bustin' yo shit
Fucked around and had to flee the world
Cause you couldn't separate the geto boys and girls

Willie d:
Geto boys is the motherfuckin' shit never forget
Them southern niggas made your mind play tricks
Never the less I left the group in '91
Niggas was mad, I had my gun
They had they guns too I wasn't snoozin'
Cause I knew that if it came down to it they would use 'em
If it was goin' down right then I didn't give a fuck
We was gonna tear this whole motherfuckin' city up
And nigga that's real comin' from the south
You wack ass rappers watch your motherfuckin' mouth
Preachin' that positive bullshit you can save
Cause your positivity ain't gettin' motherfuckers paid
It's g.b. and willie d reunited
Sendin' niggas back to the studio to get they shit tighter
And niggas thought it wouldn't happen again
But we sat down and settled our differences like men
And put the bullshit behind us
Cause fuckin' off money ain't a plus it's a minus
We did what other niggas to big to do when they twirl
And separating geto boys from girls c'mon

Man on phone:
A.j. you know I spent 23 years in the prison. you know I'm still in prison
You know they they uh uh reannounced us, blacks, we represent 37% of the
Prison system throughout the country. 37%. but we don't represent but but
12% of the country. now that's diproportionate and ain't no joke you know.
It's it's now by coincidence or by ? it's by design. by the year...2015.
They gonna have 70% of our community locked up. I'm talking about black
Gonna be locked up within they community. it's gonna be like it war

She don't want to be with me no mo'
Ain't her fault she just tired of this dumb shit that she don't know
Whether to, throw in the towel or if he gon' grow
And if he do, where is he gon' go?
Got a letter from an old friend, I read it and cried
When he told me that his girl just died
Right out of the blue, breast cancer, wasn't nothin to do
Now I'm sittin here and thinkin of you
Tryin to come to amends, cause really I done wanted you in
You the only one I trust as a friend
I know I'm on my last leg limpin with this bullshit written
But I still gotta bring it to light
Spent half of a lifetime missin cause I would not listen
Confused about my wrong and my rights
They tellin me that time heals wounds though
This wound gon' need some stitches; I got testimony for niggaz
You doin what you do but when the shoe gets flipped
Standin on the other foot got your boots and shit
When you back up and analyze, fix shit and finalize
Before you leave the shit alone just try
Maybe there's somethin you can do to rectify what's did
And plus you gotta think of the kids
That's kinda just the way life is, you either gotta live or you die
At least that I can say that I tried

[Chorus: Scarface]
Cause I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good... enough
Cause when it's over, said shit done
You sittin by yourself mixed up
But I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good... enough
Cause when it's over, said shit done
You sittin by yourself mixed up, but I tried

[Willie D]
Faster than a crackhead, can pawn yo' shit
Willie D'll put a foot in you bitch
I sold dope, robbed folks, had to make ends meet
Since 5th grade, I been up in these streets, tryin to get it
Raised by a single mother, two sisters two brothers
I used to think she didn't love us
Cause she beat us so much, plus she came home drunk
But every now and then she'd knock on wood, and say
I tried to do the best that I could - and I believe her
Cause she was treated evil out the box
You can't get what you ain't got
Momma I was young, hittin licks, started helpin you out
'Bout the closest that you came to a man of the house
I was talkin back, walkin through the do' gettin smacked
You used to brag to your friends on how, well I rapped
We never really got along but when you took sick
I was at your side 'til you died
I wasn't the best son but I tried

[Chorus]

[Bushwick Bill]
I've always been crook, never given up
But the past few years has been really rough
Felt like givin up a couple of times
Take a jump or plant a slug deep, up in my mind
Fuck it I'm dyin, done wit strugglin for mine
Sleepin on fans, knowin there ain't no use to me lyin
Change my name for anonymity's sake
But a four feet dwarf that be on television's hard to miss
I get pissed over little shit, little shit drive me crazy
Then I start thinkin 'bout my babies
I cain't go to jail, I cain't die
Who better to teach 'em 'bout this cruel world than I?
Their mommas won't let me see 'em, I still pay my support
Cause once you give life, life is bigger than yours
Maybe I'm not all you expect me to be
But when it's done and said ultimately, daddy tried

Didn't worry about no static I had a motherfuckin pump

I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesn't matter, cause ac'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers, to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggaz stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggaz up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'ma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will

Dyin' over dumb shit,
Fast money for your soul,
Now your done with.
You hear the gun click. 
Blood stains on the walls and carpet,
Pain and the hardships
Of a father identifyin' his child
From a photo of the plan,
With his brains blown out now.
Lets rewind to where it all took place,
Started off in math class early that day.
Hey! it's high school,
And everybody's tryin' to earn a rep
And he gone gun shot a homie to death.

Children are left to make decisions.

Remembering where I've been.

Drowning in my tears.

Somebody got shot
Oh,
But I'm still here.

In the dope house,
Ass pocket full of money,
Chillin' gettin' smoked out.
Two shots hit him in his
Face when he blast it,

And it's closed casket.

I see death on every block I turn,
It's just not my turn.

Cash money to burn.

Knowin' is next.
Rep to take it,
Be the last left,
Humble yourself.

'Cause she ain't knowin' what I'm fin' to be facin'

What they said about Hussein was a goddamn lie
Raised a war against a religion for oil, don't lie

Gasoline five dollars, how the fuck we gon' drive?
Can't afford to fill our prescriptions so we all gon' die
CVS is slangin' dope on every block worldwide

Since, spies up and had the dope game on fine
Then it's only right for one nigga to go get mine
If they injured then how they gon' survive?
If they stuck at the bottom how the fuck they gon' ride?

I'm tryin' Lord, I just can't get right
Paid my bills on Monday, even went to church on Sunday
But I, but I, but I just can't get right

Ain't life a muthafucker, first you think you got it
Then it all falls apart in front your eyes, try to stop it
But it's part of the plan that was written by the man
Got me down on my knees and my hands prayin'

Forgive me Lord, thank the Lord I'm alive
'Cause I'm knowin' deep down I coulda died
I shed so many tears, lost so many peers
In the grave or the penitentiary facin' twenty years

Pourin' beers on the corner 'cause Frankie told me look a killer
Told me I was high, livin' blind to the fact that they sold us out
America the beautiful, there's a funeral on every day of the month
Tryin' to get our knees broken, huh

It's another chance under these circumstances
My people ain't advancin' but if we pray
Maybe we'll get to live our life in the sun
Instead of livin' on the blocks dyin' young, here I come

You can spend it with your man y?all can walk them malls
Tear that motherfucker down I just want your draws
That?s why I?m laughing everytime you call

And while that nigga takin? pictures of you behind your clothes
Sendin? roses to your office while he?s crying and soars
Stuck wonder while you leavin mouth in the cloth

[Verse 2:]
Deal with it, don?t talk he be about it, cause he a G about it.
I got a problem with a nigga, I go squeeze him out.
What the fuck I am going to talk to the police about.
I am from the streets doing the type of shit you read about.
I cooped the Chrome 45 under pressure.
And then address ya, now ya froze on the streture.
You wanted trouble, and I wouldn?t settle lesser.
I am the devil in the flesh, my pistol is my protector.
See my reflection as it fades in the black,
When I reappear on a nigga. It?s a ragging attack yeah.
And soloulome swear, any problem I here.
I just empty the clip, for him calling me to dis square.
That?s on my life, that causes me to represent the Mob.
Since you niggas want that heat I am about to turn up the knob.
To High Powered!

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Bitch nigga you catch a dead man walking.
One foot is inside of a grave.
The other one is in a closed top coffin.
You still talking, like you the old G,
When you was locked down thou you was low key.
The niggas told me they had you in Sig, in the Locust.
You were working with those boys and them,
And even had the nerve to try and talk to the streets.
Thinking that they bring some mark ass police.
And then he tried to sue a nigga,
But it got back to a nigga.
And when I see him, I am do the nigga.
So skip that funky ass deposition fools.
If you want it, crank it up.
That?s what I am about to do, to High Powered

Scarface,"I'm too hard to kill, I refuse to die
Sweat tears and blood, paid dues alive
In these streets I roam, I've been blessed to live
Could've easily got caught up in my yesteryears
But I'm here~! My story remains the same
I ain't changed a bit, I speak words of pain
From a frozen heart, lost what's left to lose
I'm alone and what I promise is death to you
And it's true my only fear is I have none
My conscience makes me keep me to myself cause I blast one
And I can fall asleep right next to a dead man
I'm cold, I put bullet holes all off in your headband
So, bring me death cause I've been itchin to see
If it's an afterlife, aim it at me, cock it and squeeze

Please... back to back to back to back to back to back, nigga
From my first fuckin album nigga
And I still can't be fucked with, trust me

I'm the truth in here, I give up what's real
Not afraid to die, not afraid to kill
But afraid to lie, and too scared to steal
Cause what's mine is mine, and what's his is his
In these streets it's clear, punishment's severe
If that line is crossed that's when them guys appear
It's like nothin you've seen, so fuck what you've heard
It ain't what you believe, cause it's deeper than words
If that silence is broke then somebody's comin to blow
Holes in yo' upper body, leavin a bloody coat
To be viewed by these dues who feel like this
When it's enough said it's bloodshed, believe that shit nigga
Cause we that sick nigga, you see that bitch - get her!
Cause he that snitch nigga, so squeeze that's it figure
That you watch what you say, you say it and die
What you cherish is close to me so don't testify

Straight up hood nigga, made it rappin
Yeah, caught a break huh
My life put down in words homey
That's some real shit, yo

A rapper - you hated to love, respected and feared
What I'm capable of there's nothin they say in our ears
I'm a soldier for fortune, I've got murderous plots
Plus I'm suicidal, walkin this parking lot
With my dangerous thoughts, I'm a dangerous dude
When I up it and cock the hammer I'm aimin dude
I came in to do, I'm a killing machine
And with life comes a price so I triple the fee
When it's trippin with me, either you win or you lose
In the end he who wins is he who finishes fools
I'm sentencin you, to a home in the sea
With the lint in your pockets, you rolled with weed
Exposin the weak, you hoes fin' to sleep
With the fishes bitches and y'all should know the demeanor

Yeah, everything that I say I am nigga I am
Know the rest of you motherfuckers wish you could be that real
I tell you what my nigga, be real with your motherfuckin self
I am Facemob nigga~! I am the best nigga
I am the back to back to back to back nigga

Where I'm from?
Killers go dumb
Usually deatch is the outcome
Welcome to the jungle
Where kidnappers hunt you
The streets they really want you
Serious
No smile on this block gives answers gets per curious
Good times disappears quickly back into a mist
Shoot I hardly ever miss
That means I'm accurate
Crack the pitch
Then pretty soon I have to switch
Scratching the itch with paper cuts on my index
The real riders shoot up blocks and screams ""who next?""
Like my nigga 2-Tech he totes 2-techs.
It been a beef before in Houston they called it ""plex""
They got to know the protocol 
I'm warning y'all
It gets deep
So deep the prison guards will put you to sleep
Rest eternally
No coming back
You OD'd
Overdose
This neighborhood got me comatose
Back up against the wall another statistic I know

[Chorus Z-Ro]
The streets always been my daddy
And mommy is the colleges
I'm a soldier and I'm about my mail
If I get busted I'm not about to tell
Because I'm a gangster
The streets always been my daddy
And mommy is the colleges
I'm a solider and I'm about my mail
I ain't trying to do right because I'm already living in hell
Because I'm a gangster

[Will Hen]
The gas prices are too high
Pay raises too low
I'm better off in the game flippin kicks like Judo
Or out somewhere pimpin getting money by the two hoes
That's why I'm in the lab with The Product spittin new flows
Feds watchin my hood entirely too much gunplay
Neighborhood basketball star slained last Monday
Raided the neighborhood kingpin last Tuesday
If this was going on in your neighborhood what would you say?
Given the opportunity to tell it to the masses
Low and middles class still carrying bus passes
Young girls giving birth before they hit the 9th grade
About to be a mom and can't even make cool-Aid
Who made this crack anyway?
Told this about this herron 
Sold us to alcohol and the guns that we care-on

[Chorus Z-Ro]

[Scarface]
It's like the ghetto got a heart and a soul
A mind of it's own
A hunger for a young cat die before he grown
A lust for a young girl sliding down the pole
She's always falling short on her goals
The street life is cold
It's either when you lose or you fold
Money is the root of all evil is what I was told
And everything that you thought you would leave there is a hoax
You put your faith in front of those demons and when the smoke clear
The truth appear
The fight for your life
The struggles of the wrong versuses right
And wrong won
The song sung
In the keys of reality 
When death crosses your path bloodshed tragically
So automatically you come to a close
And realize no matter what the key to the codes
I seen the hood swallow motherfuckers whole
Then shit them out in the system ain't never make it home
I know

Scarface,"Verse 1 (Scarface)

Up early in the morning,
Waken by the sound of my cell phone,
Donny hathaway singing on the ringtone.
Was a homie that I went to school with,
Tellin me life wasn't shit to fool with.
These young niggas steady dyin' over dumb shit,
Fast money for your soul,
Now your done with.
You hear the gun click.
(gunshot).
Blood stains on the walls and carpet,
Pain and the hardships
Of a father identifyin' his child
From a photo of the plan,
With his brains blown out now.
Lets rewind to where it all took place,
Started off in math class early that day.
Hey! Its high school,
And everybodys tryin to earn a rep
And he gone gun shot a homie to death.
The impossible is happenin,
Children are left to make decisions.
Do ya let 'em die or kill them urself?

Choruse (Shateish)

As I look at my life..
Remembering where I've been.
I may not have been here.
Cuda been in the gutter,
Drowning in my tears.

I remember how hard it is on the block. (Yeahhhh)
Everytime you turn around somebody got shot..

Oooooh,
But I'm still here.
I'm still here.

Verse 2:

Another homie got murdered in the dope house,
Ass pocket full of money, 
Chillin' gettin' smoked out.
Two shots hit him in his face when he blast it,
Frame pictured,
And its closed casket.
This is so tragic.
I see death on every block I turn,
Its just not my turn.
Live the same lifestyle,
Cash money to burn.
Weed blowin' steady slippin' in the darkest term.
When it feels like real life,
Knowin' is next.
Rep to take it, 
Be the last left,
Humble yourself.
In slow-mo you see your wholse life flashin'
That second from the beginning,
Back to the end and that lesson
Is nothin short of what a nigga expect.
Livin' life like this,
This is duly respect.
And I refuse to give debt.

Yeah I remember,
We tatted are names on our arms for fun.
Writin rest in piece for the dead and gone.
That's just me, 
And I ain't the one to stunt,
But seems like I'm losing somebody every other month.
That's why I walk through the hood
Tryin' talk to the hood,
But some niggas is lost in the hood. 
And we blind to that fact,
That we actin' like they wanted us to act.
White man versus black.
Reason I ain't vote for my iraqs 'cause I love 'em.
They gonna want him hanged after that.

",Unexpected,2008
Scarface,"I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Oh that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Four walls just staring at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleeping with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't living right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweating and blood starts coming out my nose
It's somebody watching the Ak'
But I don't know who it is so I'm watching my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say take a chill, B
But fuck that shit, there's a nigga trying to kill me
I'm popping in the clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peeping out my window
Investigating the joint for traps
Checking my telephone for taps
I'm staring at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playing tricks on ya

I make big money
I drive big cars
Everybody know me
It's like I'm a movie star
But late at night something ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had caine but it was Gold Medal flour
Reach under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lying
I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's going down let's get this shit over with
Here they come just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfucking trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start giggling
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep looking over my shoulder and peeping around corners
My mind is playing tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Praying for forgiveness
And trying to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift while I drive
Having fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feeling lonely
My mind is playing tricks on me

This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treating
Robbing little kids for bags
Till a old man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was going down we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I'd be seeing in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Dropping them motherfucking B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody, from punching on the concrete
God damn homey

Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back

No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales

Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures

Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve

And you can picture thoughts slowly
Up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
But I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over a foot-large, undercooked, raw, taking a dick
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile

Just smile for me

Fuck the world as we elope And witness furious speeds
Of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' 
Inhalin' Sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitentiaries the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga

""And as you journey into outer space 
May the angels help to lead the way
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life

Everyday it's been the same old thang on my block

Ya had to hustle, 'cause that's how we was raised on my block
And ya stayed on ya hop until ya made you a knot
On my block, to hangout was the thang back then
And even when ya left out, ya came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Belford, to Scotts

And once ya mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, the set yo' ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets shell-shocked
Who never quite got right, now they inhale rocks

We ride 4's and vogues, with a mouth full of golds
Country niggas and hoes, down here is how we roll
When something's tight it's thoed, when we shine we hold
You got cash cars and clothes, you balling out of control
Switching lanes on swinging thangs, that's called swang and bang
The club packed from front to back, that club off the chain
You got candy rims and beat, then you got you a slab
You cooking chickens in the kitchen, boy you off in the lab
Boys that hustle they grind, and if your diamonds shine you blind
You making money looking good, then you showing your behind
You blow endo that's do-do, screwed up means slow mo
You ride big body Benz, you riding big body fo' do'
Fa sho though you know, how that Texas talk
I'm trying to stack my green, I mean fill up my vault

[Chorus: x2]

Down here playboy, the gumbo's hot and spicy
Twinkies twist and crawfish, my wrist all icy
Better watch your wifey, down here we off the hook
You was smart that, better back-back take a look
I'm from the city where crooks, wear Cardiers and Rolleys
In Texas we partnas, in Louisiana they whodies
But it's the same thing, on this side of the Mississippi
Two hundred dollas a bottle, ain't talking bout Crissy
Talking bout codeine, baby fill up my cup
2002 Escalade, Billy grill on my truck
Now hold up man, top down in the Bentley
With a bad chick, in my tape Monica Lewinsky
Made a mill independent, can't touch me kids
Split your wig then hire Cochran, like Puffy did
(fiesta) fiesta, like my name R. Kelly
I'm the boss see the cross, hanging off of our bellys

[Chorus: x2]

I can tell that you boys, got the wrong idea
We some slab riding gangstas, get a car every year
(Down here) we like to ball, play above the rim
E.S.G., the young Don and a thug named Slim
(down here) we tolerate no type of disrespect
Have a bitch acting bad, on that do' and that X
(Down here) we push 26 sitting low to the flo'
And double deuces on a truck, when I crawl by slow
(This year) I'm gonna switch it to the platinum frame
Do shows with plenty hoes, that be screaming my name
(Down here) it ain't no telling when you talking bout us
Got rocks in both ears, 'cause that shit is a must
(Down here) we break hearts and leave punks for dead
We don't claim the blue or red, 'cause our city is FED
(Down here) I'm better known as Lil' Keke the Don
Getting rich and going hard, to get it all for my son

You know I'm thugged out, cause that's the way I gotta survive
You know I'm dubbed out, on every ride that I drive
Let me take a moment, to introduce myself
Cause baby girl I see you want it, and I could tell you on it
It's the millennium, I'm trying to light up the stage
And I be taking it to the max, because I want to stay paid
You know the album is hot, I'm in the spots you not
And if I pull a gun to shoot, then best believe you shot
Cause I'm a soldier a vet, with no time to sweat
From the store to the deck, and checking on internet
I be going off, girl you ain't heard about Lil' Keke
From the Dirty South, he got a bad mouth
It ain't no thang mayn, a bunch of haters in the world
Say it's a damn shame, but I just maintain no game
Get your cash and mash, on your plan
Cause the G in my life, stands for gangsta my man

I'm a G, it ain't no telling what you cats might see
You know the ladies shake it up, and it's for free
And I be getting my money first, cause that's me
Nigga, and that's me nigga

[Lil' Keke]
Bringing down the rap draft, cause I'm a first round pick
And from the booth to the stage, man I love that shit
You know the Northside, they say they love it the most
You know the Southside, quick to represent for they folk
You know the Eastside, they putting it down for the cheddar
And the Westside, you know they down for whatever
This another chapter, of the life after
Selling dope on the block, but now a paid rapper
I'm not a high capper, but I do get plex
Am I living like a baller, then the answer is yes
Listen up nigga, I ain't tripping when I tell you I'm about my scrilla
And I ain't tripping, when I tell you I'm a mad killa, but I'm a O.G
And when I'm gunning niggaz running, cause they know me
You better show me, cause all that chatter don't just matter
Nigga homie, cause you gon owe me
Cause this the damn song, you playing games with my family
You get stepped on, so nigga get gone

Or the fact you smoke weed and pack a gun, I see the bitch in you
I ain't just {?} shells, be sparkin the marks
I put a clip in you like it's a walk in the park
You can try to make bond, but I'ma stick to the script
Hit you with the pistol grip and make your L-dog flip
Youse a punk, youse a bitch, I'll say it to your face
Youse a punk youse a bitch that testified for the state
All them cowards watchin your back, just don't matter

Talkin greasy like you runnin somethin, squeezin your dick
What is you itchy, what's really nigga? Call from the block
Loud talkin like you scared niggaz, boy youse a mark
You know real niggaz move quiet and quick to do dirt
Put this pistol up against your jersey, squeeze it and skirt
Murder be dirty {?} but that's in the plan
And here's somethin that you can't understand
How I can just up and five-finger kill me a man
This game right here for real, you niggaz playin, but

Niggaz always tell me how real I sound when I flow
That's cause the shit I talk about, I done done it befo'
Other rappers mouth off, that's just protection talk
I done robbed, sold dope, squeezed and left 'em in chalk
Yeah, them hard styles ain't about nuttin cocksucker
Lookin mean ain't never killed a motherfucker
So what you been to the pen and they call you a killer
I still draw this Desert E and spit at you nigga
My mind is made up, just balls and my word
Any bastard that fucked with mine gon' get scurred
Keep thinkin I'm playin, keep thinkin I'm kiddin
I'll bust yo' motherfuckin head wide open like a watermelon
Homeboy 'bout to get his ass whupped blue
And he gon' probably sue, cause that's what pussies do
Some say it ain't worth it but fuck that shit
I'd rather die like a soldier than to live like a bitch

Scarface,"The streets lights are glowing, everyday's another struggle
I'm moving slowly and silent staring make it so my hustle is airtight
The city streets is hectic, gotta get it
Here tomorrow ain't a promise to me
So I don't live in fear, working til' I touch it, stack it until I need it
I spend it on what I want, reup and that's when I read
It's over you never see me, it's being salt as it's lesser
The niggas straight out the gutta, murder without a question
Product of my surroundings, click clack from downing
All they know is he missing when niggas ain't never found him
Assaulting and stealing yet, I don't live it on regrets
I'm a muthafuckin' killer foreal with the same threat
I'm as gangsta as it gets and my advice for you is live your life
Ya never know when niggas might hit you on the city lights
Get it right, ya never know when niggas might hit you on the city lights
Get it right (get it right)

Born and raised on the north blocks, home of the hard knocks
Wanna get rich, find a spot to pump that heart out
Might get robbed or shot if niggas don't think you worthy
In my hood, I saw a lot of gangstas die early
Mama heart broke, and brother feel like he gotta fix it
So he loading up from straps, 'bout to hit it where they kick it
Got a first class ticket to the pen
Seventeen years old but up in there they all men
It's just another day, one come out, another go in
It's hard out here, you can't even trust yo friends
They'll have a nigga set up, whatever by the curb
It's every man for self, oh you ain't heard?
I'm a muthafuckin' hog, survive through it all

Been in plenty fights but ain't been drop

I'm a G you gotta pray for me, it is what it is
Why these niggas out here playing, mayne this really my fear
What'chu know about them late nights, no lights and no food?
No diapers for the baby's, the house smell like booboo
Think of what'chu would do, what I tell ya what I does
Walk straight up off the porch, now the game has begun
My big brother on lock, so I stole his gun
He ain't gon' need it where he at, I'm finna go and stuff some crack and that
Big homie knew I had it on my mind
He ain't like it but it's right that run it through my bloodline
He knew if he decline it wasn't goin' to be hard for me to find
So he choose to put me down, and I got up on my grind

Scarface,"Verse 1:
(scarface)
Ghetto niggaz remain violent all the killers remain silent
Niggaz strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all rome'
The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggaz do their struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons dinin'
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makin' music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause it's deep
Some niggaz make it out the neighborhood and won't circle
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
Who done came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintian me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggaz

(chorus x6)

This is for my homies and my thug niggaz (uuuuugh)

Verse 2
(master p)
'face, imagine us working at mcdonald's
And me and you selling fucking tapes in the bahamas
Gold slug, a car full of thug niggaz
Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
Real ghetto niggaz can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little j down at rap-a-lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake it's for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggaz off from new orleans to california
Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh)
Independent, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine
You used to see c.e.o.'s in a suit and tie
But we young niggaz in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair

Chorus x6

Verse 3:
(doracell)
It's alive, and I'mma be tha muhfuckin' one
Make these niggas want some
Here I come
Da last don
Niggaz steady claiming this
Tatted on my wrist since 86
What tha fuck?
I'm sitting in my cell block stuck
Listening to this shit my radio did
Shit, gotta change the situation
Write a letta to the warden mothafuck all this time wasting
Chasin' niggas wit my occupation
Clean across the nation
Lookin' for two-facin
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope-dealer all in one
Now past me my muthafuckin' gun
Niggaz feelin' they invinsible
Til' they dealin' wit tha muthafuckin' principle

Flip a bird split it up
Antenna stickin' up
For crooked cop patrollin' 
If the red dog rollin' 
All the dough I'm throwin'
Fuck a jail I ain't going tonight
Quick to pull a four four in a fight
Under the street lights
Rollin' the dice
We was so enticed
By niggas like slick money and ice
We figure prison it should come with the light
Along with losin' your life
And there were no way we thought
We'd go to jail for any case we caught
For all the yay we bought
Not a dime did we say we borrowed

Since our sacks was the largest
Didn't take us long to corner the market
I remember everyday was a party
Fifteen sixteen with dreams of being cocaine bosses
In pursuit of that 
We made so many terrible choices
Like the time we made away with that Millennium
From the dealership
Before our day when we killin' 'em
Late nights
Gun fights
High speed chases
So close to the good life we taste it
Damn the consequences pimp
If it's a chance we take it
First case a month in juvenile and get probation

I was dealing sacks, you looking at niggas that drove to hell and back. 
Charismatic I was raised by a addict with money in the attic. 
Got goons while you at it at 
This present time I'm out of my mind and that's a habit,

One, two that's a ho check
Now for real, nigga this a whole check
Just bossin' around, polo sweats

Woke up in a bigger house, come on
Commas in my bank account
So much money I had to let the banker count

And all he ever wanted was a bank roll
But he died too young 'cause the game's cold

Once you get in you gotta leave but you can't though
Does freedom make a motherfucker evil

Let's take that needle, fill it with poison
Inject the ghetto with the drug, paranoia
Got you lookin' at your homeboy sideways
Ain't no honor among thieves is there nowadays
They tell me crime pays, but I don't think so

And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories she right there
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind so I can't sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now the only way I see the broad is online
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to heal you
I built my whole life around ya
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel, I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the sweets, I
Realize some things never change
Once in love and it's gone you don't look at it the same, nigga
Fuck love cause she don't live here
I'm soaked in blood but I'm still here
Hip Hop heartbreaks
Straight-laced, deep bass, 808s plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feeling like I up and let ya
Get away now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the college's professors
Now I regret the day I met ya

She ain't the one you want to play with

And a host of those who passed away
Today I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you want to rap, to this bitch you must commit
Then you're a slave to your grave, you won't get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her vibe covers keep you warm
But the source to her heart is love, word up, right on
You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her world star
Kissing on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings, made some friends resent me
For writing about my life, they thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would have never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I'll ever be the same, hallowed be thy name
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry
But I tried her used to ride her, for dollars not the fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second then I screamed
""She's dead!"" and everybody took it out on Nasty

Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours

I've got my gun on me

From the depths of the sea, back to the block
With a bitch on my dick and a bottle of Ciroc
Tick tock, non-stop, blocker, blocker, blood clot
Don't test the lion
'Cause you'll get dropped on the spot
Lick shot, drip drop on soil
Pot's hot until it boils
To this Crip shit, I'm loyal
Dip with us, ride with us,
Slide with us, slip with us
Sit with us, slick with us,
This bad little bitch wanna get with us
Say she likes the French tip nails that I wear
And how I'm so pimped out
With dreads in my hair, yeah
You got truth, now the truth is to dare
Blue bandana, it's me and Montana
At the Tropicana with Tanehsa,
Alisha, Lakesha, Savannah
Nicknames for my blammer

I got my gun on me,
I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me,
Death row Jamaicans murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight,
Fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight,
I've got my gun on me

The smell of blood in the bathroom
Body laid out stiff full of stab wounds
I told this nigga I was coming back
Pussy must not have heard me when I told him that
Nigga, it's eye for an eye
A life for a life, a body for a price
I want to smell his last breath took
And look him in his eyes and make for sure he knows how death looks
Because I'm him, it's in the air, I can feel it
Shot him four times with the gun I was concealing
Over killing, it ain't no coming back from it
Then walked away with a demeanour
Like I just done it
Something evil this way's coming
For big face hundreds this bitch gets punished

I got my gun on me,
I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me,
Death row Jamaicans murder your family

Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh
There's a story in me

Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
Where I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do

'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cold), a cold cold world

Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you

Money never changed how I felt, would I risk my
Life for a dollar, homie? Nah, I don't think so
Greed breeds jealousy, nigga, out here when getting fo's
Catch a nigga slipping, put a bullet in his temple
Homie, it's the same rules, money talks, simple
My kinfolk, call it what I'm living like the high life
Only if he knew what I had to do to keep my mind right
I tell you I got 20/20 hindsight
See it in the distance, hieroglyphics keep the rhymes tight
My mind like, game recognize that
Real recognize real, still .45 strapped
Underneath the white tee, Zimmerman get shot down
Hero, it ain't nothing but a sandwich, call the cops now
Fuck the police, stop running
White boys terrorize nigga' neighborhoods, gunning
Down the innocent, and then the beginning ends
You was doing 50 in the 35, the ending is
You fit the description of the subject in this incident
We gon' have to take you downtown for some questionin'
Damn, a blessin in disguise if you ask me
I was just about to hit the highway with my last key
Could it be that maybe God is intervenes
With my life like he did so many times in between
A half a block away from the crime scene
A minute earlier and that was me, think
I've been knowing Ross since he was Teflon
Same nigga now it was back then, nothing stepped on
Dopeman, dopeman yelling
Cook it 'til it's rock hard, bag it up, sell it
Aroma so loud, so loud that you can smell it
Death to them niggas getting caught go and tell it

Every time I turn around, y'all got something to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around the guilty be pointing fingers at me
Homie, I'm just trying to be all I can be
But not for free, that's why the fuck we roll, I need that

Can't even believe this day here, my nigga
I remember us sitting in the parking lot talking about getting money

Cracks in the wall, standing in the puddle
Sunny south Florida, a cold motherfucker
Ready for a war, barely wanna talk
Ballys on, my nigga, as they walking back and forth
Makes you wanna hustle, take care of my brothers
Raymond passed away, here's something for his mother
It never is enough, trying to show her that I love him
We were fishing buddies, breed the dog, split the puppies
Pictures on the wall, bitches we done raw
Niggas getting robbed, the only shit that we can solve
We all wanna get it, ball for a minute
Accept collect calls, tell our dawgs that we did it
Plenty money orders, that what uncle Kenny taught us
Keep your face clean when you're out here bending corners
Always keep in mind, you fall in love a thousand times
Regardless what we went through, I'm still right here by your side
Artificial homies, worse than the ages
When you parking all your cars, they wanna know the payments
Rose petals dripping on the casket
Baby boy done grew into a bastard
On that lean, you know I fuck her fantastic
Work white as Rita Ora in that plastic
Took shots, shed tears, that's war
Bust bottles on yachts, stand tall
Catch a case, don't talk, that's raw
Scarface, Rick Ross, big boys
Big boys, Scarface, Rozay, we big boys

Every time I turn around, y'all got something to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around the guilty be pointing fingers at me

Curse over blessing, pray it be heaven sent
Forgive me, my dirty deeds was desperate
Fuck the government, I got my own deficit
Death to me the only thing that's definite
Money rule the world, but when you dead that shit's irrelevant
Fingers numb from coka selling, no vote, but out for presidents
Granny found my dope, I told her I would stop for selling it
Nigga please -- she knew I was lying before I even spoke it
Empty promises left them all broken
She said Jamel, I can tell your perspective out of focus
You too obsessed with the liquor, bitches and weed smoking
A young nigga that's been thugging since the old days
Promise I've done seen everything but old age
Pray my demons never catch up from my old ways
Keep the heat cause I was going through a cold phase
Uh yeah
Keep the heat cause I was going through a cold phase
Promise I've done seen everything but old age

Surviving off cold cuts and cold Spam
Can't see eye to eye with my old man
Hiding my insecurities with this gang flag
We both despise the police, but he wore the same badge
And as I child I admired that, now I wonder how
He was a pig, but you was barely making 20 thou
I guess that's why you put me on that lick for 20 pounds
A life of crime is all we ever shared from then to now
And I'm a crook and you crooked, that's all we got in common
He chunked the deuce to my mama, so much for family bonding
But how could something so destined to be just get demolished?
Running through groupies and whoppers, I guess I got it honest
And honestly I know I'm out here fucking up
Seven grams of rock, I stuff 'em in my nuts
And seven bucks an hour wasn't good enough
Cause seven days a week I'm living in a rush
Seven days a week I'm living in a rush
Seven grams of rock, I stuff 'em in my nuts

And the money was the root to what the evil is
It's mandatory for me to live
I hustle harder than the next dude
Remember, everybody is out to get you
Niggas don't respect to live and let live
So I pack a .40 caliber cause that's how shit is
Out here, no fear, fuck feelings
Trigger man rule, that's the art of drug dealing
I'm trying to stack my money to the ceiling
No new friends, don't wanna talk about old business
Sex on the beach, sipping Guinness
With a bitch so thick she can't take no dick
Imagine working grave-yard shifts
Lost friends steady talking that shit
A million a day is for minimum wage
Work a nigga like a slave 'til he put him in his grave

Can't let my Momma see I ain't listening to The Word

And OG's spitting game on you motherfuckers
You should be ashamed like a motherfucker
The streets packed with all these lame lil motherfuckers
Everybody wanna be a hard stopper
You won't find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper

These youngsters think that I'm so cool
They wanna learn the game from an old school
I give em strategies to sleep on
So when they put me in the grave they could keep on
Now first on your check list
Be your own man cos your friends ain't shit
They only come around when they need to
Use that home boy shit to deceive you
Remember you don't owe nobody, niggas
Niggas put the bite to the hand that feeds, that’s your body
And they forgetting how they got there
This is life, it's a game, but it's not fair
It's hard enough trynna get by
Day to day struggling with shit so you get high
And staying drunk on the regular
Talking dope talk on your cellular
But in this game that's a no-no
The streets ain't the only ones watching, taking photos
And life ain't bitches and money
This life's bout getting this money

I fuck around and your life getting took
And last but not least, when you make that money
Keep it low-pro, don't say shit, dummy
And don't say shit to your girlfriend
Pillow talk will send your ass to the state pen
Take notes to the game I'm providing
Stop using momma names trynna hide shit
Nigga them feds ain't stupid
You ain't the only nigga trynna do this
Riding round the hood in a four-door
Flying spur ol' rims, trynna show off
You drawing too much attention
And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence

Flashbacks, I'm a known threat
God fearing yet I'm evil though
I think deep, I believe in ghosts
Ever felt the hand of a dead body?
Then you know why I took my gun and head-shot him
War started over dope cuts
I put what I live by on both nuts
It's either him or me so I say fuck dude
I look him in his eyes and say FUCK YOU!

The power that you gain gets addictive
The money being made gets you bitches

He ain't fooling me, my nigga, he is just a nerd

Scarface,"If I had to play God for a day
I would open up the gates let the world see my face
Remove all doubt from the ones without the faith
And put them on the path of the straight
A safe place, for the young to come outside they want to play
I let their mommas know that they ok
And when y'all pray, I'll respond so you can all see a sign
And answer every pray one at a time
If I'm God huh
All the stabbings all the war would come to cease
My whole entire hood would be at peace
No more beef
And you could sleep without the fears of being woke
By the sounds of sirens, screams of people being smoked
No more dope you don't need it
You'll be cured of all diseases
Your whole entire life would be deleted
Please forgive me I've been dreaming
And rudely interrupted by the demons
Laughed at the picture I was seeing on the ceiling

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has a face

Just imagine if the devil had a day
And God had took a break and walked away
Would you feel safe?
If everything you loved turned into hate
Will the dark angel's evil show you grace
Only to be eaten by a snake
One life one mistake
Be careful of the choices that you make
'Cause one day you'll be standing on your feet and then the next
You're underneath the sheet greeting death
I wonder when I sleep is he there sitting on my chest, stealing breath
Shortening my days even less
Lost souls never rest
A killer walks the streets seeking flesh
A adolescent hangs she depressed
A priest who confessed
A judged typing a nigga in a text
Your honor what the fuck did you expect
A father kills his son look at life it's a mess
Just imagine what would happen if the lord up and left

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has a face

When all that you believed in was a lie
Are you willing to accept it when you find out
Or try to reason with yourself that's what it is when it's not
And all the whole while it's been a plot
To poison our minds and leave us blind to the fact
That they keep us in the dark know they act
We react all surprised and not realize that
This shit a trap
Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasn't that
The church and these politics they all full of crap
It's a shame but that's how were blaming it's for the scratch
So I don't knock I'm tryna to put a black card in my wallet
But some dollars in my pocket ain't the topic
Y'all need to stop it
This is just crazy these little babies ticking time bombs
Walking around the lunchroom pulling guns
If momma and daddy took the time to raise their son
Then the sister wouldn't be the mom before she twenty-one huh

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close

Talkin' to a nigga like it's date time
Askin' where I'm from, I'm from H-town
Niggas askin' me what I'm in for
Nosy motherfuckers want some info

Bare-butt, naked in my tennis shoes

They push us out like livestock

I wonder what you see in me
I love weed and Hennessy
You barely doing happy hour, I ain't never seen you drink
And now that's leaving me to think, how I got so close to you? 
This was just a hit and split, that's what I supposed to do
One thing let up to the next, I'm addicted to your sex
You addicted to this dick, every cause has its effect
That's what I get I guess, I can't commit that's killing this

Think before you answer that, it's hard enough we breaking up

I'm sure you know who's fucking me, cause I know who's been fucking you

Wondering where the fuck I stay, who else I fuck like that

And let us not forget, it's her with whom I made my woman
I know our days are numbered, enjoying moments after
Plus in lust we fell in love, the pains are more than laughter
Living our separate lives, are husbands reckless why? 
Beneath the questions lie, why was she left to cry? 
Should have left shit quiet, but you was out of line
Better step aside, gotta tell me why?

About a brother like me from the jump, they’d rather see me slump

Who me? I demand reparation
Fuck a cowboy, I’m a native robbed of my nation
I’m an African, Black man, fucked out my language
Got me praying to a white boy God, that’s insane
And if you ask me, why they steadily harass me
I reply with that “These muthafuckas nasty”
And I’m a god yet they calling me a nigga
They scared of me, so they try to hide behind the trigger
Acting bad ass, fuck a honkey with the badge
I’m a nigga with an attitude, you can kiss my black ass
Ain’t no sense in niggas being diplomatic
Televise the revolution, let these muthafuckas have it

Just wanna pack up my bags, and get out of this hole
Can't believe they treat me so bad
Can't believe they actin' so cold
I just wanna leave this room
I'm still sitting on this concrete couch
Just waiting for the judge to say, that I'm gon' be free today, yeah

Fingerprinted, gettin' booked in
They fed a nigga Johnny, so I took ten
'Cause I'm knowing that I'll be sittin' here the whole night
Empty drunk tank, it's finna be a cold flight
I finally come up on some housin'
Old celly, so I'm battin' me a thousand
And plus I got a bottom bunk pass
Boss came in with his punk ass
Talkin' to a nigga like it's date time
Askin' where I'm from, I'm from H-town
Niggas askin' me what I'm in for
Nosy motherfuckers want some info
I tell him, ""Dog, I ain't done shit
You know these redneck crackers think they run shit""
It's lights out, I tie my mat down
Chuck it on the rack and stretch my ass out

Can't believe they actin' so cold
I just wanna leave this room
I'm still sitting on this concrete couch
Just waiting for the judge to say, that I'm gon' be free today, yeah

It's court call in the halls
Strip a nigga down to his balls
Bare-butt naked in my tennis shoes
The nighttime sergeant want an interview
They push us out like livestock
""Ain't no talkin' while I'm talkin', this is my block""
I finally get to see me a judge
I'm a Black man, so she got a grudge
Old bitch full of race hate
And a nigga quick to represent the gray state
I ain't got a lawyer, I don't need one
Give me thirty days, you get three-one
I ain't tryna piss in a jug, bitch
Just because I'm Black, I get fucked with
I bet if I had been a white dude
I'd have never been arrested, look at Michael
And even if I swam like a fish, though
They still would've threw me in the Crisco
And fried a nigga's ass in some hot grease
I'm just tryna get my ass out the hot seat

Baby on them mollywhops, blinded by the weed smoke
We come from them streets, ho, I stay on that ign'ant shit
Ain't nothin' 'bout weak, ho, always game to stomp a bitch
And stomp a bitch, and stomp a bitch

Scarface,"If this is love I don't see it
Can't make me believe it
You a nice girl, and I'm a hood nigga on some street shit
And yeah, you know my weakness
Sucker for some love type
I come from them slums, girl, you come from a good life
I wonder what you see in me
I love weed and Hennessy
You barely doing happy hour, I ain't never seen you drink
And now that's leaving me to think, how I got so close to you
This was just a hit and split, that's what I supposed to do
But one thing let up to the next, I'm addicted to your sex
You addicted to this dick, every cause has its effect
That's what I get I guess, I can't commit, that's killing this
You gave me an ultimatum, I'm numb, I ain't feeling shit
Must not know who she dealing with, puddles on her pillow case
Tears, runny eyeline, lipstick smeared (Hey, are you OK?)
Disobey, you pay for that
Well, the love is gone, and she ain't made it back
Pray for that

I'm just sayin', a relationship should be 100-100
It can't be 50-50, right?
Right
Oh, you gon' think about it?
Yes, I'm gon' think about it
Look, do you want me here or not?
Oh, shit

Think before you answer that, it's hard enough we breaking up
But after this, no turning back, brought this on myself, uh-huh
Mistakes, I'm forced to live with that, I'm knowing more mistakes to come
I'm human, that's my best excuse, in fact my only one
Tears fall, my kids call, 'This ain't me, it's his fault'
Ah shit nah, we did this
A partnership with no room for forgiveness
I take the blame, take your aim
Shoot that shot, can't wait to claim
All of this, in Jesus name
Pray at church that we can change
I feel your pain
Songs sung in the key of life, with no meaning, right?
Hopefully that one day come I see the light
Can't sleep at night
And I'm wondering who's fooling who?
I'm sure you know who's fucking me, 'cause I know who's been fucking you
We used to be inseparable, never thought that that day would come
Where I'd take that shit so serious, and you get so good at playing dumb
You got away with one

You had me I'll admit that, fell into the trap you set
Lookin' me in my eyes, lyin', killing me with that soaking wet
Willingly let me choke her neck, scratching me all across my face
Telling me that she loves the way it feels when I'm in it all the way
60 calls a day, wondering where the fuck I'm at
Asking me where the fuck I stay, who else I fuck like that
Now let's be honest, you got him with whom you made your promise
And let us not forget, it's her with whom I made my woman
I know our days are numbered, enjoy the moments after
And plus in lust we fell in love, the pains are more than laughter
Living our separate lives, a husband's reckless wife
Beneath the questions lie, why was she left to cry?
Should have left shit quiet, but you was out of line
Better step aside, gotta tell me why
I was everything, you was all I had
Now this is change, and then this change is bad
Make a note of that",Gone [Keep It Movin Alternate Version] [Version],2017
Scarface,"Dope sold on the cut make our hands bleed
Fuck broke, it ain't an option, penitentiary
Or the grave is the only way we fall back
Do our time A.T.W then crawl back
To them streets where we come from, taught life
Look alive, little niggas better walk right
Real with it, quick trigger finger, gun play
I only know how to deal with these niggas one way
And someday I swear to God I'ma change that
But I can't 'cause them evil demons came back
And when I'm high y'all I can't explain
What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
'Cause mayne I've been a loyal dude, and you can trust that
But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
I need to talk but there ain't no one to listen
Lost inside a mental exorcism, and wishing...

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast, living life against the grain
Just one time, I wanna clear my mind, the silence seems so loud
If I could, I would fly away and live my life beyond the gray clouds

I woke up from a dream feeling all good
Prayed for better days ahead but what was y'all doing?
Lost, stuck in a standstill waiting for a handout
Hustling for tennis shoe paper, never panned out
My sister trippin', got my grandmother stressing
'Cause she's only 17 and she's already pregnant
Another segment of them ghetto soap operas
B.G.'s is trippin', ain't nothing left to stop them
Uncle in jail, daddy dead and their mamas
Can't teach them how to be men; grow up being followers
The streets swallow them then life overpower them
Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
Crash tested, a dummy high volume
Only God can judge but y'all niggas is comical
90 percent of our future's off in prison
Prescription for my mental exorcism, and listen...

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast, living life against the grain
Just one time, I wanna clear my mind, the silence seems so loud
If I could, I would fly away and live my life beyond the gray clouds

Another kid killed in cold blood, a mother's heart broke
Family crying on the first pew, my heart spoke
Hurtful words I would never dare speak
In the house of the Lord, still I'm in the devil's reach
I don't wanna hear the preacher preach, that shit a lie
Plus he knowing how that evil be, but who am I
To judge a man when I see him try
FOX News tried to justify
It ain't no way that you can clarify
In cold blood our lil homies dying
Another sign of the times but it's terrifying
That you could kill us off have us outlined in chalk
Get arrested go to jail go to court and get the fuck off
That shit is fucked off, we worried about the money lost
While the Klan's about to light another cross
I ain't denying it, I speak from intuition
It's also from my mental exorcism, with wisdom

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast, living life against the grain

Had to dodge a bullet

We are the breeding mammals with bad backs
Our messiah on the cover of magazines has a black lung an i.v. of nicotine
A.m. rendezvous
With strung out ambulance driver's caffeine blues
Feeling the needles the medics used
To stab their veins with double doses by the twos
This is the life of the living dead
This is the revolver blowing off my head
These are the sedatives that keep me fed
All the lies and piss
Has it come down to this

Hopped up on Valium and in cardiac arrest.
Hold me closer when this world ends.

To become prosthetic and disinfect our friends.
We could share our endorphins.
We could sleep with loaded shotguns and trigger happy trends.

The human pets neurotic and hopeless.
We're all hopeless tonight.

For the panic attacked and the socially phobic.
I don't need your therapy.
I don't want you telling me.

The moon is over the rise
Think of me as a train goes by

Clear the thistles
And brambles
Whistle 'Didn't He Ramble'
Now there's a bubble of me
And it's floating in thee

Stand in the shade of me

The weather vane will say
It smells like rain today

And he tossed 'em
Can't tell the birds
From the blossoms
You'll never be free of me
He'll make a tree from me

So could you please tell this court what you saw happened 

Yeah he killed Tyrone 
I saw everything, the argument, how son drawed, hose and everything 
The worst shit I saw in my life 
I want to testify I swear before God it was Kirk Jones, no lie 

Did you see that man in court today?
Do you think that you could point him out?

Yes that's him right there 

Are you sure?

Yeah without a doubt 
Same nigga that took my Pumas but I ain't hold no grudge 
Remembered his foul ass when I saw the blood 

You stated you had a run in with Kirk Jones before 
In your opinion is he the type that would rob a jewelry store?

Your honor, objection!
His opinion should be stricken from the record!

Objection sustained, prosecution next question 

I'd like to call my next eyewitness Mr. Paul Dejour 
Paul could tell us what happened inside the store?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah, it was about 20 past, I saw the S class 
Pull up in the reflection in the mirror in the store glass 
And quicker that you could say, nigga kiss my ass 
He hopped out of the passenger side wit a black ski mask 
I saw somebody run up in the store and order us on the floor 
Yo I swore I was a goner for sure 
He tried to snatch Tyrone's bracelet 
It just appraised to the twenty grand and Tyrone wouldn't let him take it 

Is that the moment when he shot him?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah man that's when he popped him 
I was so scared I laid there, played possum 
He started to blast this way, 'til the gat was empty 
He took the gun handle and broke the glass display 
He emptied all of the trays and ran out the store
And I watched Tyrone bleed to death on the floor 
I can't remember no more, that's all that... 

Okay, okay calm down 
I have no further questions your honor 

Court is now in session, now gettin' back to business 
Pat Haley for defense please call your first witness 

Yeah aight your honor, I call up Henry Lace
He's the witness that I'm cross examinin' for the case 

Yeah I testify your honor, it was death by dishonor 
It was a crime committed, I swear to you I know who did it 
It happened so fast, I didn't see a lot of it 
But I know for a fact he stuck a gun to his esophagus 

Wait, wait, wait objection your honor, his statement's preposterous 
There was no weapons found, no sign of no hostages 
Remember Mr. Henry Lace you under oath [yeah I know]
You lyin' in the stand to get him fryin' in the pan 
Now where was you the night you claim he shot Tyrone 
You and holmes had beef before Kirk got home 
Was you mad because he came home bangin' your chick [what you talkin' 'bout?]
Got your boys out the hood now they slangin' and shit 
I know you mad that's why you in court, turnin' on him 
Kirk cold blooded killer wit no burner on him 
Come on you don't believe he murdered Tyrone 
I believe you wasn't there you just heard it by phone 

Man you crazy man I was right there... (Yeah right... I read your rapsheet...
calm down, calm down, chill, chill, Kirk, Kirk...) 

No he wasn't! He's lyin! Fuck you you liar!
Man fuck that he's lyin he wasn't even there man!
(He killed Tyrone man! Fuck that!) No I didn't! 
Man he's lyin' man! He's lyin' 

Order in the court now I'm warning you defense 
Tell your client take it down, matter fact 'proach the bench 
Counsel in my chambers so that we can situate 
Let the jury be excused so they can go deliberate...

Yo man, Mr. Haley what kind of defense is this man!
What you doin' man?! She gon' fuckin' hang me man!
No! Sh-she's got it in for me I'm tellin' you man!
You promised you'd get me off man!

In the case of the State vs. Kirk Jones you heard it 
Both sides testified and the jury reached a verdict 
Guilty! All counts from theft to murder one 
(Huh? Wha-wha-what?! Guilty?!] 
By the time you gettin' out you gon' have a grandson 

Fuck you bitch I'll see you in hell bitch!
Fuck that!! Fuck that!! Fuck, get off me! Fuck you Pat Haley!!
(What?! Get him out of my courtroom!!)
Fuck the judge, fuck everybody!! 
(Baliff, baliff remove him from my courtroom...)
Fuck this shit!! I hope you all burn in hell!!!
You're gonna die bitch!! Fuck you!!!

You will spend the rest of your life in jail for this!
You will be held for contempt of court, and anything else I can find that....",State Vs Kirk Jones,2000

Whoring down your whoring street
Killing you while you're killing me.

Is there anybody here who hears me 
Crying? I'm dying

Everyday I need an ounce and a half
S.P.; the only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)
You got beef with Styles P, I come to splatter the hood

Aiyyo I smoke like a chim-in-ney 
Matter fact I, smoke like a gun, when a killer see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did; add to that
That I smoke like the hippies did, back in the 70's
Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the, M-5 pedal, when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

I'mma smoke 'til my lungs collapse; I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious, and I, know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta, ride for a livin'
With my, real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die (anybody)
This is S.P., dump it in you bitch, I get high

Some of these girls they think they own ya
Using they sassy ways ta put it on ya
Then when you don't call them back soon enough yeah they phone ya

Ok sometimes it seems you see my presence in your dreams
But lately you've been acting so uncertain and displeased
Constantly expecting me to honor and obey this
Lifetime of dealing with the women that you play, stop it
I'll make it simple don't ask me for my name
I'll keep my cleavage covered you keep your sorry game
Fame has made you wicked and you'll always be searching for humanity
I hope that while you live you rest in peace.

I like those freestyles, I hold on to what I have
Like a mean child, Stingey because that's all I have
In the meanwhile, you hardly know half of my story
But surely your eyes despise and judge me as one of those guys

While you disrespect every last lady in your presence
I've got confidence I leave you in the past tense

It was never yours to begin with
Face it, it happens to the best of us
A reality check,huh, makes a mess of us
Then left looking like the rest of us do now
I mean those who steal scour like a child acting all juvenile in denial
I wish that itch turns into a burn when you can't scratch what you want
Don't it
Now we can pretend it never happened but it will always be different won't it
Just don't let it happen again and were cool, Don't trip
Scarub's literary were never in the grips of yours to begin with
Youse were born and were in with it
That's only till the end of it
Everyone has their own philosophy on how love ought to be
And some are better then others
While others see others as monstrosities
Your dream is my nightmare
How did you figure you'd be the boss of me
Trying to make me move at the velocity that you choose
Order me to move expeditionary an hour freeze, froze
Now I've never been the one to be like these hoes
But these hoes expecting to brown nose
Not all women just those who suppose that the world revolves around them
And until they wake up I will forever clown them
If you can't compromise I can't corroborate
If you spit lies I won't walk away
Never was one to operate like that
I'm as stubborn as you are bitchey
You can't get through my abuse me up until I'm all gone
Then ditch me and glide to the next
But I see what you mistook me for
See how you figured you could break me into your advantage
And order me to the door until it's outworn then get torn to shreds
Keep your seductive jargon, I can't hear you, how dare you
Chuckling to myself will I wait by through my rearview
Your such a shadow girl
Such a shadow girl, such a shadow girl
Such a shadow girl, such a shadow girl

Said he'd seen me in his fantasies constantly
Won't you write your number on this napkin
I'll pick you up at seven
His girlfriend was in frisco for the weekend (What?)
While he was speaking I kept thinking all prejudges story cause you bore me
Keisha, Pam and Cory told me bout your fame and glory
Girls before me babies mamas skimpy loose pajamas in your dirty hamper
Open condoms scattered on your dresser
Who you trying to fool
I can smell the silencing from what your calling poetry
Your eyes are manly focused on anatomy
Instead of me experiencing several different immature Peter pan
Never growing up you'll be a free man
Hours pass my prince is yet to reach the surface
And what would be the purpose
My tears are not commercial in this cycle of relationships is constantly a battle
I look beyond the shadows for a shadow

Scarub,"It's wishful thinking
It's always wishful thinking, uh huh
It's wishful thinking
It's always wishful thinking, and uh

CHORUS

I used to know this girl as fly as Saturdays
And every time she smiled my way like honey to me
I would hold my heart as well as my hopes back
For fear of how she would have reacted
If I was to express how I was attracted
To her spectacular bosoms and vacular(?) amenities
And every time I would see her ever-so-beautiful figure walking the earth
It would just confuse me
Making me woozy
But I kept my mouth shut
I figured putting myself in such a position of vulnerability
Would just give her the power to either lose me or abuse me
So in the dark I stood
Skylarking I would ponder on what if
But the what-ifs would have been solved
If I wasn't so chicken-shit to get involved
In these matters of the heart
But that's all in the past and
She's gone leaving me gasping while asking
I wonder if I'll ever have another chance
Wonder if I'll have another dance
A change in my circumstance
To romance from wishful thinking

It was a day like this when we met in 1993
She came up to me whispering something like sunshine
While I was in line
At the festival which couldn't compare
To the festivities of her beauty
I moved our conversation from
Name into hobby
Hobby into visions
Visions to envisioning the two of us meeting up again
If she would just pick the time and place
The way our eyes embraced
Sublime troubles bits and based in an ideal song
I looked into her face and saw my future was less than perfect placement
Our worries were kept in the basement
Either that or the attic
There would be no static
In our living room
My mind mapped out the blueprints
Consuming each other's thoughts in the dining room
Romance would be placed in the bedroom
Illuminated with joy and perfume
Tribulations would be hung in the kid's room
Furnished with laughter after our lives were situated
And financially elevated
Our house would be decorated in colours and feelings I've only seen in
dreams
But was never able to describe
I felt all of this
But didn't know how to subscribe
To her interests
You know how first impressions are
Catalogues that come with no index, appendix, or bibliographies
Just a table of contents for us to guess at
Choose a chapter and hopefully it works for you
We agreed that our time shared was pleasurable
And that we should rendez-vous
I attached the idea of exchanging numbers
So again I could see her
She smiled, sunbeam so warm
I was blinded by her glare
Meanwhile mesmerized by the magnificent mana she seemed to bear
Then said she would be back at the festival tomorrow
And to meet right here
(Like, right here in this particular spot?)

CHORUS

Now I had expected a no-show
Kept on checking the time on my wrist-match
Then felt a elbow nudge me from the back
When I turned around and she was top-notch
Smelling like butterscoth
When trying to speak
I was too shocked
All blocked up in my voice-box
I just stood there and smiled
She took my hand, manoeuvred me through the crowd
I hung on like a child
That's a security blanket for dear life
We rounded the bin where
She took me into her booth
She was a vendor, visual artist, a poet
Who loved to work with the youth
Said what attracted her to me was my aura
Seemed to bear truthfulness
In a world full of filthiness
And hearts swallowed up into emptiness
Not in the exact words but I said the same
We sat there all day in the shade talking
Boredom never came
I told her about my music
I said I wanted to use it to touch
Use it to travel around the world sharing my views on such and such
And finally to clutch a point in time where I could say that I was happy
Own a business, have a wife and some children to call me pappy
Nodding her head she smirked and said she knew our ideas would work and
again
Not in the exact words but I said the same
Evening quickly arrived and I had to go
It was the last day of the festival
Smiling she said she was glad I came
A pen was pulled
I supplied the paper
Numbers were exchanged
We both stood up and showed love in the form of a hug
And went our separate ways
I remember them vividly in my memory
Those yesterdays

CHORUS

She held delightful conversations over the phone
With a mouthful of words that
When were said made you feel like you were
Worth something more than just flesh and bone
Taking up space and time
Our discussions raced the mind
Forever building, healing, exchanging ideas
Drilling to the core of what we were here for
How to communicate with ancestors and
Why we as people deserved more
From equal rights, revolutionary fights to spiritual insight
She even shot over to the house and gave me a cooking lesson one night
It was nothing fancy
Rice and beans seasoned with a side order of plantainels
The table was lit with candles
We sat juxtaposed and stood out the windows
To gaze at the stars
I said let's make a wish on that reddish one
She was like ""Fool, that's Mars!""
Then mapped out all the celestial bodies from the little dipper up to the
quasars
And finally picked one
We closed our eyes and made a wish
But I substituted my wish for hope
And it still wasn't enough to anchor us down
You see hope holds just a little bit more weight than a wish
And my wish turned hope then swish
And my time was too short on the rebound
The clock countdown was to my disadvantage
And I'm not the type to come with full-court pressure
So my game's ?
In her eyes I was tucked away and forgotten
And all my plottin' to win this girl
Too small to be measured
And so now all I have to treasure is my wishful thinking",Wishful Thinking,2001
Scarub,"Ayo Kane found Logan lamping at Deluca's
Sitting with a little black boy, she called him Lucas, he knew it
Found himself the daughter of a kingpin
The ex of Tony Starks, it's a win-win
His seed, the grief filled up in his eyes
He kidnapped them both, for a scheme of revenge
Pillow cases over their heads, tossed in the Benz
No friends, no foes, only evil to expose
Let's make a video
Tell Lu I got his grandson and daughter
And I ain't lookin for no ransom
I want revenge, I want blood, I want his head on a rug!
I want him to watch me strangle his daughter
Butcher his babies, attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies!
M-80s stuffed in his ass cause bodily harm
This is just the fuckin tip of the storm!
Tell him to come! Tell him we need to speak man to mush!
As soon as he step in the building
AMBUSH!

At day break, the Delucas made their way through the main gate
Quietest cougars chasing wild gang prey
They cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps
They raided the Kane gang [?]
The look on Kane's face when he realized what was taken place
He was anticipating a payday, but he was faced with a melee
He sprained to his feet but his legs wouldn't stay straight
Afraid, he reached for his piece, Bang Bang! Bang Bang!
But wait, as if on cue, the Deluca crew called out, ""Lucas!""
And began shooting unison, maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of Kane
Blew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench 
of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings!
Finally it was over
The Delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters
They shifted through the dead remains
The bedrooms, and the entry way
WHERE THE HELL IS LESTER KANE?!

Now what is this that stands before me?
Underneath this wack off coughing
It's Logan and her half beat offspring
I got the nod from Kane that I'll be enforcing

Kane's gang had no imply the Delucas had staked out the vacated building for eight days
They knew about his way in, the way out, the makeshift escape route
The hidden staircase, the way down to the basement in the safe house
Where to find Logan and her afraid child
In a dark corner where they were being held
They were blindfolded with taped mouths
No light or water, arms and legs bound

But there's a double cross of course, I'm hearing guns letting off from somewhere else
I'm ready to get involved with the revolving [?] warehouse all by myself
I dive underground finding rounds

There's war on the streets like Vietnam
Bodies is flung, enemies hung, capos is killed
Kidnap your family and wives with no guilt

Robbing safes in safe houses, no leaving traces
Destruction, Black mafiosos and militants
It's all for the king of New York and they killing it

Crime wave, rioting, streets flooded with blood
Bullet holes through tuxedos, wet suit skirts up
Big Kahuna with the cajones, come through with your homies
Shoot the Ruger where your dome is, while you in your chones
Then regroup up with my homies, less they can't run a crew

Follow these streets scholarly, all would I do for this loot

Where's the cane man? How many nights I live by this dupe?
Names change like slang, still be aiming to shoot
Call it pop-pop poacher and note the .45 will rise up

Message worth it's weight in gold, he a beast

Crushing De Lucas, they tryna dismember cane, silly game
Watch his downfall, put an end to it

It will take you, take you by surprise
So take advantage, take it all
Take it all before the moment dies

It come without saying
It's already known, it's written all over you
It comes without saying
Don't let it go, keep it inside of you
It comes without saying

Now that you've got it
And it's slipping through your fingertips
Well, you gave and let go
Now it's missing from your life again

So now you're tearing up the walls
Make a mess trying to dig it up
But now it's all too late
You'll never find it and the moment's dead
The moment's dead

It goes without saying
It's already gone, it's written all over you
It goes without saying
You let it go, there's nothing inside of you
Well, it goes without saying

You know you want it
What are you waiting for?
Take it all when the moment dies

It goes without saying
It goes without saying
It's written all over you

It goes without saying
It goes without saying
Just keep it inside of you

It goes without saying
It goes without saying
It's written all over you

It goes without saying
It goes without saying
There's nothing inside of you
It goes without saying",Goes Without Saying,2007

Just trying to find your way anywhere
But you've come to find you're alone
It's getting dark and you've lost your way
I haven't let you go as long as you know that

I'm losing what's left of my dignity
But I'll fight till the end for her heart
I'll never give up for what's possibly
For better or worse this love must be cursed

You just try to keep your head down
But you come to find that trust has come and gone
Everyone out there is listening
But you don't care at all and you're probably glad to know

I'm losing what's left of my dignity
But I'll fight till the end for her heart
I'll never give up for what's possibly
For better or worse this love must be cursed

You already let it pass through your lips
You can't take it back now
(It's already out)
You already let it pass through your lips
Can't take it back
(It's already out)

You already let it pass through your lips
You can't take it back now
(It's already out)
You already let it pass through your lips
You can't take it back now

I'm losing what's left of my dignity
But I'll fight till the end for her heart
I'll never give up for what's possibly
For better or worse this love must be cursed

I'm holding on to her
(This love must be cursed)
I'm holding on to her
(This love must be cursed)
I'm holding on

I'm afraid to say she never made it home
Couldn't keep her head on
She was so close
I'm afraid to say she never made it home

I'm afraid to say she never made it home
I'm afraid to say she never made it home
I'm afraid to say she never made it home
(Couldn't keep her head on)
Afraid to say she never made it home",Holding On,2007
