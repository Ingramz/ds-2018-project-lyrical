Harry Carney,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo,2001
Harry Carney,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2001
Harry Carney,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001
Harry Carney,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you",Why Was I Born?,2002
Harry Carney,"I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
And I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, cant you see, I'm in love

Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I've got that string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on the rainbow
I've got that string around my finger
Oh, what a world, what a life, I'm in love

Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a crazy so-and-so
If I should ever let you go, oh yeah

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
What a world, what life, I'm in love
Oh yeah, I'm in love
Oh, I'm in love
Oh yeah, I'm in love
(He's in love, he's in love)",I've Got the World On a String,2012
Harry Chapin,"Turning on my pillow, thinking kind of strange.
The color is of midnight in this room.
The cars outside are coughing and it's kind of hard to sleep
and there's neon out the window, not the moon.

And it was just an any old kind of day,
The kind that comes and slips away,
The kind that fills up easy my life's time.
The night brought any old kind of dark,
I heard the ticking of my heart.
Then why'm I thinking somethings left behind?

I whistled round today and I skipped off a footloose jig
to the hurdy gurdy music of the street.
I looked past those rooftops and I saw the cloudless sky,
But I keep on asking why my life is passing by,
And I'm left up high and dry,
But it ain't no good to cry,
So I shrug my useless sigh,
And I trust to things that other days will meet.

And it was just an any old kind of day,
The kind that comes and slips away,
The kind that fills up easy my life's time.
The night brought any old kind of dark,
I heard the ticking of my heart.
Then why'm I thinking somethings left behind?

The night has had it's laughing,
when the street lights blind the stars,
So now it's shedding rain to sing it's sorrow,
It's time for me to sleep and to rest these thoughts away,
There's gonna be another day, hey!
when things will go my way,
And there's other things to say,
And there's other songs to play,
And there'll be time enough for thinking come tomorrow.

And it was just an any old kind of day,
The kind that comes and slips away,
The kind that fills up easy my life's time.
The night brought any old kind of dark,
I heard the ticking of my heart.
Then why'm I thinking somethings left behind?",Any Old Kind of Day,1972
Harry Chapin,"Could you put your light on please
It's kind of dark tonight
And I feel a little lonely
Yes, I need a little light

Could you put your light on please
Let me hear a friendly sound
I could make it through 'til morning
If you could let your light shine down

She moved so well
'Cause she was a dancer
She went sliding through my questions
Gliding 'round the answer

Whatever it was, she knew it was holy
And each time I tried to hold her
Her smile came sad and slowly
She said, ""No one knows me""

Could you put your light on please
It's kind of dark tonight
And I feel a little lonely
Yes, I need a little light

Could you put your light on please
Let me hear a friendly sound
I could make it through 'til morning
If you could let your light shine down

She had a dream
I had my typewriter
While I was hacking out such a heavy world
She was weaving one much lighter

But I'll never know
Just how much it cost her
But each time I slept beside her something turned and tossed her
And it did till I lost her

Bright times were brighter
Than they'd ever been before, I tell you
Night times were lighter
But they'll never, never be no more

Could you put your light on please
It's kind of dark tonight
And I feel a little lonely
Yes, I need a little light

Could you put your light on please
Let me hear a friendly sound
I could make it through 'til morning
If you could let your light shine down

Could you put your light on please
It's kind of dark tonight
And I feel a little lonely
Yes, I need a little light

Could you put your light on please
Let me hear a friendly sound
I could make it through 'til morning
If you could let your light shine down

","Could You Put Your Light on, Please",1972
Harry Chapin,"Up in Massachusetts There's a little spit of land.
The men who make the maps, yes, they call the place Cape Ann.
The men who do the fishing call it Gloucester Harbor Sound,
But the women left behind, they call the place Dogtown.

The men go out for whaling, past the breakers and the fogs.
The women stay home waiting they're protected by the dogs.
A tough old whaler woman who had seen three husbands drown,
Polled the population and she named the place Dogtown.

There's all these grey faced women in their black widow's gowns,
Living in this grave yard granite town.
Yeah, you soon learn there's many more than one way to drown;
That's while going to the dogs here in Dogtown.

And she speaks: My father was a merchant all in the Boston fief.
When my husband came and asked him for my hand.
But little did I know then that a Gloucester whaler's wife
Marries but the sea salt and the sand.

He took me up to Dogtown the day I was a bride.
We had ten days together before he left my side.
He's the first mate of a whaling ship,
The keeper of the log.
He said, ""Farewell, my darling, I'm going to leave you with my dog.""

And I have seen the splintered timbers of a hundred shattered hulls,
Known the silence of the granite and the screeching of the gulls,
I've heard that crazy widow Cather walk the harbor as she raves
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves.

Sitting by the fireside, the embers slowly die.
Is it a sign of weakness when a woman wants to cry?
The dog is closely watching the fire glints in his eye.
No use to go to sleep this early, no use to even try.

My blood beats like a woman's,
I've got a woman's breast and thighs.
But where am I to offer them
To the ocean or the skies?

Living with this silent dog
All the moments of my life,
He has been my only husband;
Am I a widow, or his wife?

Yes, it's a Dogtown and it's a fog town,
And there's nothing around 'cept the sea pounding granite ground
And this black midnight horror of a hound.

I'm standing on this craggy cliff,
My eyes fixed on the sea.
Six months past, when his ship was due,
I'm a widow to be.
For liking this half living with the lonely and the fog,
You need the bastard of the mating of a woman and a dog.

And I have seen the splintered timbers of a hundred shattered hulls,
Known the silence of the granite and the screeching of the gulls,
I've heard that crazy widow Cather walk the harbor as she raves
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves.
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves.
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves.",Dogtown,1972
Harry Chapin,"Empty closet, empty heart.
Empty morning, day won't start.
Well, I got no place to go now,
I really do not know how
To like my life, now that you're gone.

Empty mailbox, empty head.
Empty promise, empty bed.
I really can't believe in the thought of you just leaving.
But no one's here, You must be gone.

I guess I took you for granted,
I thought of us as one.
But now the laugh's on me 'cause your half of me
Just took off with the sun.

Empty pocket, empty day.
Empty feeling won't go away.
Well, I never meant to use you,
And I never thought I'd lose you.
But no one's here and you are gone.

Empty closet, empty heart.
Empty morning, day won't start.
Well, I got no place to go now,
I really do not know how
To like my life, now that you're gone.

I got an empty icebox, I got an empty head.
And it's an empty morning in my empty bed.
There's nothing in the mailbox there's nothing in my heart.
And I'm feeling kind of lonely 'cause the day won't start.",Empty,1972
Harry Chapin,"All I got is time, Nothing else is mine.
All I want is you and one more tomorrow.
Nothing lasts to long, When I leave it's gone.
So I send my mind ahead and hope to follow.

Yes, I know I have a lifetime coming,
But I've got it all figured out,
Everybody's lonely, Everybody's lonely,
Everybody's lonely, That's what it's all about.

I've had my share of heartaches, misfortune and mistakes.
Occasionally this life has left me battered.
But I can't blame no one else, 'cause what I've done to myself
Is the only kind of history that matters.

Yes, I know I have a lifetime coming,
But I've got it all figured out,
Everybody's lonely, Everybody's lonely,
Everybody's lonely, That's what it's all about.

Now, maybe you'll come with me, and maybe you will stay,
And maybe you'll just watch awhile then wander.
It seems like all the good things in my life just drift away,
But maybe you will stay this time, I wonder.

Yes, I know I have a lifetime coming,
But I've got it all figured out,
Everybody's lonely, Everybody's lonely,
Everybody's lonely, That's what it's all about.",Everybody's Lonely,1972
Harry Chapin,"It's midnight at the depot
And I drag my bags in line.
Travelin' light, I got to go
But the bus won't be on time.
Everybody's looking half alive.
Later on the bus arrives.

They punch my ticket
I find a seat
And we move out past the lights.
Come on Driver, where's the heat?
It's cold out in the night.
I keep telling to myself that I don't care.
Come tomorrow, I'll be there.

Take the Greyhound.
It's a dog of a way to get around.
Take the Greyhound.
It's a dog gone easy way to get you down.

Tired of watching this night go by
So I look across the aisle.
The window's frosted, I can't sleep
But the girl returns my smile.
She reminds me of someone I knew back home.
So I doze. So it goes.

I'm wrinkled on my stool at the rest stop.
The waitress being cozy with the highway cop.
My coffee's tasting tired.
My eyes roll over dead.
Got to go outside and get the gas out of my head.
Oh, to be in bed.
You got me driving.
I'm on your Greyhound bus and you're driving.

But there's nothing new about Greyhounds.
Nothing new about feeling down.
Nothing new about putting off
Or putting myself on.

Looking to tomorrow is the way the loser hides
I should have realized by now that all my life's a ride.
It's time to find some happy times and make myself some friends
I know there ain't no rainbows waiting when this journey ends.

Stepping off this dirty bus first time I understood
It's got to be the going not the getting there that's good
That's a thought for keeping if I could.
It's got to be the going not the getting there that's good.",Greyhound,1972
Harry Chapin,"They just told me take a pause
Here between the takes at the studio
And you came into my mind

It's kind of funny, for you were the cause
Of me being here on the radio
And though that's another time

I'm still wanting you
I've been hunting for you
I'm still wanting you
I need to find you

I'm just the same sad singer
Of the lonely songs
You long since left behind you

Since you've gone I've gone along
Been writing the music I've always wanted to
And they just picked up on me

I'm putting myself here inside each song
And finding my music is still so full of you
I dreamed of being here but I never dreamed that you
Would be so long time gone from me

Oh, I'm still wanting you
I've been hunting for you
I'm still wanting you
I need to find you

I'm just the same sad singer
Of the lonely songs
You long since left behind you

Oh, me finding music's why I lost you
Now, it's the only chance I've got
They're bringing in the strings
To melt your heart somehow
You couldn't hear me then
But maybe you can hear me now

Oh, I'm still wanting you
I've been hunting for you
I'm still wanting you
I need to find you

I'm just the same sad singer
Of the lonely songs
You long since left behind you
When I'm still I'm still wanting you

",Same Sad Singer,1972
Harry Chapin,"Well, I've sung out one more evening,
And I'm wrung out, feeling beat.
I walk on out the door once more
To an empty city street.
A Good guitar will serve you well
When you're living in the lights
But it's never going to warm you
In the middle of the night.
And so I come and go with her in whispers.
Each and every time she says she dies.
When she is reborn again
I kiss her.
And the baby never cries.
She works in the daytime,
She leave her baby with a friend.
I sing every evening,
I only see her now and then.
I come to her at midnight,
When 'bout half the world's asleep,
And she puts me back together,
In the hours before I leave.
Her apartment is down on Perry Street,
There's a tree in her backyard.
Her old man had left her,
He just took off for the coast,
And I caught her on the rebound
When I needed her the most.",And the Baby Never Cries,1972
Harry Chapin,"She was crazy (she was beautiful),
I guess she had to be.
I was angry (you were blind),
Because I could not see.
I saw only what her cigarettes had done to her skin.
I should have known the outside world
Would reveal what was within.
She was burning herself,
And her hair was filled with ashes.
She was burning herself,
And her life becomes a flame.
She was burning herself,
And the flame became her passion.
She was burning herself,
And her passion,
Her passion was her pain.
She was trusting (you could have saved her too),
All hope had passed for her.
I was lusting (and she gave to you),
That's all I asked for her.
The marks upon her body
And the marks upon her mind.
I could have erased them
If I'd only taken the time.
I never saw her do it,
I only saw the scars.
I never could imagine
What would make her go that far.
I wondered,
Was she driven by desperate need to feel,
To find out she was living,
To discover life was real.
Or was it that the pain
Slicing through her like a knife
Was easier to take
Than the emptiness of life?
Had a strange sense of drama
Caught her in a role,
Or was she trying to cauterize
The chancres on her sole?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know",Burning Herself,1972
Harry Chapin,"Dripping streetlights
Darkened buildings
Wandering
Head hung down low.
Where will she go?

Woman child, your eyes are wild.
The rain runs down your hair.
Woman child, mercy mild.
What will you tell your teddy bear?

I turned you on my solid body
My electric Gibson guitar.
My clever fingers searched
And found exactly where you are.
You went too far.

I was an early morning phone call.
What news have I received.
A halting voice is telling me,
What we have both conceived,
Asking how the dilemma,
How can it be relieved?

""I will give you money, Honey.
I will set up a time.
But you got to go there on your own babe,
'cause I don't know that it's mine.""

Oh woman child
Mama's little angel's been defiled.
Took a taxi to the clinic
Where they do the modern thing.
The white coat doctor
Laid her out said

""You won't feel a thing.
You get the sweet salvation
That little old knife can bring.
You don't have to worry 'bout no offspring.
That's that.
Go Home and take a nap.
It's just a two hundred dollar mishap.
It don't mean a thing.
It's all over now
You can tell your singer to sing.""",Woman Child,1972
Harry Chapin,"I was cramped into a coffee house pew
Two dollar Coke in my hand
Listening to the music run
Through and out of a drowning man.
Ten years ago I first heard him singing
To a screaming crazy crowd
Now there's thirteen loyal people
Trying to sound that loud.
And I wonder as I watch him now
Why his songs don't turn me on.
He got me into music
Where has the fragile magic gone?
And all the changes
Keep on changing
And the good old days
They say they're gone.
Only wise men
And some new born fools
Say they know what's going on.
But I sometimes think the difference is
Just in how I think and see
And the only changes going on
Are going on in me.
There was you and Fifth avenue
Before there were lies
And all my hot blood schemes
And teenage dreams
Flashed before my eyes.
I did not think I had a chance
You had to prove me wrong
It took a year and a half
Of tears and laughs
Before you moved along.
And now these long years later
When I see you once again
I wonder what you saw in me
When you loved me way back then.
There I was in you Air Force
Uncle Sam, you owned my brain.
I tried to see myself as a sex mad savior
Sailing on a silver plane.
I started out to do my duty
Ended up just doing time.
What is it about you
My mother of a country
That makes so many change our minds.
You had me on your honor roll
For your dream I would die
Now I would not even cross the street
To help you live a lie.",Changes,1974

Your tears are sweet rain in my empty life.
Mail Order Annie, can't you see I'm trying
To tell you that I'm glad you're here,
You are the woman who's come to be my wife.
You know you're not as pretty as I dreamed you'd be,
But then I'm not no handsome fancy Dan.
And out here looks are really not important.
It's what's inside a woman when she's up against the land.

Your tears are sweet rain in my empty life.
Mail Order Annie, can't you see I'm trying
To tell you that I'm glad you're here,
You are the woman who's come to be my wife.
You know it's not no easy life you're entering.
The winter wind comes whistling through the cracks there in the sod.
You know you'll never have too many neighbors.
There's you Girl, and there's me, and there's God.
You know I'm just a dirty man from the North Dakota plains.
You're one girl from the city who's been thrown out on her own.

Harry Chapin,"Of course I picked a rainy night
To try to find our past
The street lights all were flickering
The leaves were falling fast

I walked down the winding road
Looked up through the trees
And I saw the corner window 
That you once shared with me

It was Old College Avenue
And in the time of having you
I remember it as if it were today
The tiny room and the single bed

Though the tangled trails of time 
Have led us far astray
The membrance seems to stay
And through all the roads

That led me on 
And through all the years
That you've been gone
I have found that it would never go away

It was Old College Avenue
And in the time of having you
I remember it as if it were today
That fall turned into winter

The winter into spring
And all the while, you led me through
The sweet awakening
But summer never came that year

It's what you went to find
And you took my future with you
And you left your past behind
It was Old College Avenue

And in the time of having you
I remember it as if it were today
The tiny room and the single bed
Though the tangled trails of time

Have led us far astray

I been a newborn child

There's me and you, babe, that's alright
There's a lot of lonely people tonight

I guess we share the same old dream
Or maybe it's the same old lie
There's only one thing I'm sure of, now
And that's our time keeps rolling by

And far too many days run out
And nights begin this way
With my half of our hopeful couple
Trying to hold the dark at bay

There's a lot of lonely people tonight
Trying to make it through 'til the morning light
There's me and you, babe, that's alright
There's a lot of lonely people tonight

You can meet me on a city street
Or meet me by a country stream
You can meet me on a mountain top, babe
But don't you meet me in my dreams

You can meet me tomorrow morning
Baby, maybe you met me back when
You can meet me now inside this song
Cause I don't wanna sleep alone again

There's a lot of lonely people tonight
Trying to make it through 'til the morning light
There's me and you, babe, that's alright
Cause there's a lot of lonely people

So many lonely people
There's a lot of lonely people all over the world
We even lay with children and beautiful girls
Yes, there's me and you, babe, but that's alright
Cause there's a lot of lonely people tonight",There's a Lot of Lonely People Tonight,1974
Harry Chapin,"It was just another night
And I was out on a limb
Looking for someone
To help me back in.
A couple of hours of cruising around
Brought me into a bar
And I sat me down
Nothing much to be found.
So I got in to talking to the old bar man
He said:
""You got a problem I can understand
And I know a little lady
Who is all alone.
If you find her she will take you home.
She don't like to spend her nights alone!""
They call her Easy.
They say it's not a way for a body to be.
They call her Easy.
She is giving out her love for free.
I found her on the street
Like the bartender said.
She was not great looking
But not that bad.
Walked on up to her
And didn't say a word
But my eyes were talking
And I think she heard.
Yes, she heard me.
We walked down the road
To a rundown farm.
She lit a couple of candles
And she held out her arms.
Lord, she was gentle as a windblown sigh
In the morning while dressing I could hear her cry.
She was crying and I went flying out of there.
The next day found me walking in ton.
Saw the old bartender and I flagged him down.
I thanked him for the girl
And told him that she pleased me
And laughed a little bit
About how she was easy.
But the old man stopped me
With the look in his eye.
He said,
""You know I had hoped
You weren't that kind of guy.
Dream of the kind of world it could be
If we were with our loves like Easy""
It's a hard world we must learn to be easy.
In a cold world I must love the ones who please me

There's no tick tock on your electric clock
But still your life runs down.

I'm halfway to heaven and my home in Forest Hills
It's half past eleven and I've got some time to kill.
I missed my bus connection my train got in too late
And I'm forced into reflection by this half hour wait.

Now I have been a straight man and I've played it by the rules
I been a good man, a good husband, a good old fashioned fool.
I have a fine wife and two children just like everybody's got
But after fifteen years of marriage the fires don't burn too hot.

Ahh someone played a trick on me.
They set me up so perfectly
They Gave me their morality
And then changed the rules they set for me.
Someone must be laughing now,
Though it don't seem funny somehow,
How the world's accepting now
What they once would not allow
Back in my younger days.
The world has changed in so many ways.

My mother once said to me so many years ago now
Don't you touch those bad girls, so I never had girls
Until I had my Mary when we married.
My Mary then had my two sons
My life as a lover was already done
It was over before it had really begun.

Ahh someone played a trick on me.
They sent this little girl to me,
She is my new secretary
And she's something to see.
yeah She's a nice girl, but it's a young world
And she lives her life so free, and she sure gets through to me

She brings her pad into my office, she wears a sweater and a skirt
And somewhere deep inside of me something starts to hurt.
She's wearing nothing underneath, and I can see what's there to see
She smiles and says, ""You wanted me?"" I'd have to agree.

You know how much I want her,
And I know that I could have her.
I know I could, I know she would
Make love to me, so wonderfully.
God damn, I'm one crazy mixed up mixture of a man.

In my head all my life I've been a sinner,
And in my bed with just my wife I'm still a beginner,
But tomorrow night I'm taking that little girl out to dinner!

But still your life runs down.",Halfway to Heaven,1974
Harry Chapin,"I was thrown on the cobblestones, tossed at her feet
My fool's mouth was filled with the dust from the street
An out of work court jester with nowhere to go
And no need to speak, for she seemed to know

She sings the songs without words
Songs that sailors, and blind men, and beggars have heard
She knows more of love than the poets can say
And her eyes are for something that won't go away

This mad mocking town, and its dishonored guest
Disappeared in the colors that danced on her dress
She led me to safety in a forest of green
And showed my stale eyes some sights never seen

She sings the songs without words
Songs that sailors, and blind men, and beggars have heard
She knows more of love than the poets can say
And her eyes are for something that won't go away

She spins magic and moonlight in her meadows and streams
And seeks deep inside me and touches my dreams
The morning comes smiling and I laugh with no sound
And snuggle in silence and the sweet peace I've found

And she sings the songs without words
Songs that sailors, and blind men, and beggars have heard
She knows more of love than the poets can say
And her eyes are for something that won't go away

No they won't go away
Go away",She Sings Songs Without Words,1974
Harry Chapin,"He was crazy of course 
From the first she must have known it 
But still she went on with him 

And she never once had shown it 
And she took him off the street 
And she dried his tears of grieving 

She listened to his visions 
She believed in his believe-ins 

Oh, he was the sun burning bright and brittle 
And she was the moon shining back his light a little 
He was a shooting star 
She was softer and more slowly 

He could not make things possible 
But, she could make them holy 
He was dancing to some music 
No one else had ever heard 

He'd speak in unknown languages 
She would translate every word 
And then when the world was laughing 
At his castles in the sky 

She'd hold him in her body 
Till he once again could fly 
Oh, he was the sun burning bright and brittle 
And she was the moon shining back his light a little 

He was a shooting star 
She was softer and more slowly 
He could not make things possible 
But, she could make them holy 

Well, she gave him a daughter 
And she gave him a son 
She was a mother, and a wife, 
And a lover when the day was done 

He was too far gone for giving love 
What he offered in its stead 
Was the knowledge she was the only thing 
That was not in his head 

He took off East one morning 
Towards the rising sun's red glow 
She knew he was going nowhere 
But of course she let him go 

And as she stood and watched him dwindle 
Much too empty to be sad 
He reappeared beside her saying, 
""You're all I've ever had"" 

Oh, he was the sun burning bright and brittle

Harry Chapin,"The very day I purchased it
I christened my guitar
As my monophonic symphony
Six string orchestra
In my room I'd practice late
They'd leave me alone
My mother said, ""You're nothing yet
To make the folks write home""

I'd play at all the talent nights
I'd finish, they'd applaud
Some called it muffled laughter
I just figured they were odd
So I went up for an encore
But they screamed they'd had enough
Or maybe I just need a group
To help me do my stuff

And so I'd dream a bass will join me
And fill the bottom in
And maybe now some lead guitar
So it would not sound so thin
I need some drums to set the beat
And help me keep in time
And way back in the distance
Some strings would sound so fine

And we would play together
Like fine musicians should
And it would sound like music
And the music would sound good
But in real life I'm stuck with
That same old formula
Me and my monophonic symphony
Six string orchestra

Oh, I write love songs for my favorite girl
And sing them soft and slow
But before I get to finish
She says she has to go
She's nice and says ""Excuse me
I've got to find a bar
I think I need refreshment
For I hear you play guitar""

Oh I sent a demo tape I made
To the record companies
Two came back address unknown
One came back C.O.D
Of course I got form letters
All saying pleasant things
Like suggesting I should find a trade
Where I would not have to sing

And so I'd dream a bass will join me
And fill the bottom in
And maybe now some lead guitar
So it would not sound so thin
I need some drums to set the beat

I've been taking guitar lessons
But my teacher just took leave
It was something about a break down
Or needing a reprieve
I know I found my future
So I will persevere
And hold onto my dream of
Making music to their ears

And so I'd dream a bass will join me
And fill the bottom in
And maybe now some lead guitar
So it would not sound so thin

Harry Chapin,"Mrs. Smith and Mr. Jones have come to pass the night
They pulled off of the highway when they saw my light
It's a vacancy I offer them, what they offer me
Is fullness for a lifetime that's bare as can be

There's a vacancy, won't you come to me
And fill my empty spaces 
I'm a motel man in a promised land
That's filled with empty faces
So won't you bring your sorrows bring your dreams, 
It's a place for you to be
There's no more tomorrow or that's how it seems
Won't you come to me? I've got a vacancy

Another stage, another chance, for gentleness or violence
Another birth, another dance, another death in silence

Harry Chapin,"When I rearrange the pieces of the puzzle of my past
I sigh at the heartaches, relive the laughs
And I think about the moments that have left their mark
And the too few faces that shine a little light in the dark

If you don't mind I'm gonna tell you a story
And I think that it won't bore you
For it's a tale that I've never told
To anyone before you 'cause it's for you

The sun of sixteen summers had put halos in your hair
If anything was in my head, twelve winters put it there
A dollar an hour is what Mama paid you to come and mind her kids
But no one could really pay you enough for what you really did

Many happy things keep happening
On my journey through this world
And in many ways, that I will never understand
I was much too late
To be the first to make you a woman
But you were the one
Who made my mother's son a man

You know I used to read myself to sleep when I went to bed
I guess I was a dreamer then who lived inside my head
But the nights that you came you talked of things, I found I had a friend
You brought my fears of people to a sure and gentle end

On my journey through this world
And in many ways, that I will never understand

Do you remember the night when you turned out the light
And said to me: ""Please hold me""
I did not know which way to go
So I did just what you told me ""Please hold me""

When I think about you now it's not that my memory fails
There's just no need for graphic telling of all the details
Let's just say you taught me something that brought me from my shell
You gave to me that first sweet taste of the heaven here in this hell

Many happy things keep happening

Harry Chapin,"His mama was a midnight woman
His daddy was a drifter drummer
One night they put it together
Nine months later came the little black bummer

He was a laid back lump in the cradle
Chewing the paint chips that fell from the ceiling
Whenever he cried he got a fist in his face
So he learned not to show his feelings

He was a pig-tail puller in grammer school
Left back twice by the seventh grade
Sniffing glue in Junior High
And the first one in school to get laid

He was a weed-speed pusher at fifteen
He was mainlining skag a year later
He'd started pimping when they put him away
In jail he changed from a junkie to a hater

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head.""

They threw him back on the street, he robbed an A & P
He didn't blink at the buddy that he shafted
And just about the time they would have caught him too
He had the damn good fortune to get drafted

He was A-One bait for Vietnam, you see they needed more bodies in a hurry
He was a cinch to train cause all they had to do
Was to figure how to funnel his fury

They put him in a tank near the D M Z
To catch the gooks slipping over the border
They said his mission was to Search and Destroy
And for once he followed and order

One sweat-soaked day in the Yung-Po Valley
With the ground still steaming from the rain
There was a bloody little battle that didn't mean nothing
Except to the few that remained

You see a couple hundred slants had trapped the other five tanks
And had started to pick off the crews
When he came on the scene and it really did seem
This is why he'd paid those dues

It was something like a butcher going berserk
Or a sane man acting like a fool
Or the bravest thing that a man had ever done
Or a madman blowing his cool

Well he came on through like a knife through butter
Or a scythe sweeping through the grass
Or to say it like the man would have said it himself:
""Just a big black bastard kicking ass!""

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head.""

When it was over and the smoke had cleared
There were a lot of VC bodies in the mud
And when the rescue men came over for the very first time
They found him smiling as he lay in his blood

They picked up the pieces and they stitched him back together
He pulled through though they thought he was a goner
And he forced them to give him what they said they would
Six purple hearts and the Medal of Honor

Of course he slouched as the chief white honkey said:
""Service beyond the call of duty""
But the first soft thought was passing through his mind
""My medal is a Mother of a beauty!""

He got a couple of jobs with the ribbon on his chest
And though he tried he really couldn't do 'em
There was only a couple of things that he was really trained for
And he found himself drifting back to 'em
Just about the time he was ready to break
The V A stopped sending him his checks
Just a matter of time 'cause there wasn't no doubt
About what he was gonna to do next

It ended up one night in a grocery store
Gun in hand and nine cops at the door
And when his last battle was over
He lay crumpled and broken on the floor

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head.""

Well he'd breathed his last, but ten minutes past
Before they dared to enter the place
And when they flipped his riddled body over they found
His second smile frozen on his face

They found his gun where he'd thrown it
There was something else clenched in his fist
And when they pried his fingers open they found the Medal of Honor
And the Sergeant said: ""Where in the hell he get this?""

There was a stew about burying him in Arlington
So they shipped him in box to Fayette
And they stashed him in a grave in a county plot
The kind we remember to forget

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head.""",Bummer,1975

He could find his only lind of release

As she was cleaning up his stains from the rug
She'd play all day with their children
And try to meet him with a welcome and hug
As he came shuffling through the house with a shrug

And hate gets under the skin

She hurried all the children out the door.
And she let the bills and the marketing go.
And she went and almost bought out an art supply store.

It just so happened that day he got to thinking.
Of the grease that always covered up his skin.
So he left the garage a little early
He got a shave and a manicure and trim
Came out clean as a plaster maniquin.

He came home in a hurry
But he almost didn't recognize the place.
It looked like it'd been hit by a hurricane.
There was canvas filling every open space.
And she had paint all over her face.

I tell you dirt gets under the fingernails
And hate gets under the skin
But a dream got a way of getting down to the bone
And the heart of a body that it's in.

They both stood stunned into silence
Then their laughter exploded like a shout
And he went out to make some magic in the kitchen
The clean man learning what cooking was about.
And the dirty girl painting her messy heart out.

Well nothing ever came of that, the world still whirls around

The ground began to rumble the rock trembled on the edge
""The rock is gonna fall on us! Run or you'll all be crushed!""
And indeed the rock was moving, crumbling all to dust

He ran under it with one last hope that he could add a prop
And as he disappeared the rock came to a stop
The people ran into the street but by then all was still
The rock seemed where it always was or where it always will be

When someone asked where he had gone they said: ""Oh he was daft.

But I can't remember anywhere I've been

Was I looking for a star or something else behind it?
Whatever I was looking for, I surely dod not find it
And for all my sky high journeys the only thing I know
Is that you almost always lose yourself when you let yourself go

So the startripper's coming on back home now
It's a crazy blind man's journey he's been on
The startripper's lost and all alone now
And it's your face he'd like to look upon
Yes, he's praying that you won't be long gone",Star Tripper,1975

Harry Chapin,"I'm a tangled up puppet,
Spinning round in knots,
And the more I see what I used to be,
The less of you I've got.

There was a time that you curled up in my lap; like a child
You'd cling to me smiling, yours eyes wide and wild
Now you slip through my arms, wave a passing hello
Twist away and toss a kiss, laughing as you go

You used to say ""Read me a story and sing me songs of love""
For you were Princess Paradise like your wings of a dove
Now I chase you and tease you trying to remake you my own
But you just turn away and say ""please leave me alone.""

And I'm a tangled up puppet
All hanging in your strings
I'm a butterfly in a spider's web
Fluttering my wings

And the more that I keep dancing
And spinning round in knots
The more I see what I used to be
And the less of you I've got

You are a drawer full of makeup and rinses and things
You keep changing your moods like your earrings and rings
But tonight while we played tag for five minutes in the yard
Just for a moment I caught you off guard
But now you write your secret poems
In a room just for your dreams
You don't find time to talk to me
About the things you mean
And what I mean is

I have watched you take shape from a jumble of parts
And find the grace and form of a fine work of art
Hey, you, my brand new woman, newly come into your own
Don't you know that you don't need to grow up all alone",Tangled up Puppet,1975
Harry Chapin,"It was just after dark when the truck started down
The hill that leads into Scranton Pennsylvania.
Carrying thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Carrying thirty thousand pounds (hit it Big John) of bananas.

He was a young driver,
Just out on his second job.
And he was carrying the next day's pasty fruits
For everyone in that coal-scarred city
Where children play without despair
In backyard slag-piles and folks manage to eat each day
Just about thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes, just about thirty thousand pounds (scream it again, John) .

He passed a sign that he should have seen,
Saying ""shift to low gear, a fifty dollar fine my friend.""
He was thinking perhaps about the warm-breathed woman
Who was waiting at the journey's end.
He started down the two mile drop,
The curving road that wound from the top of the hill.
He was pushing on through the shortening miles that ran down to the depot.
Just a few more miles to go,
Then he'd go home and have her ease his long, cramped day away.
And the smell of thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes the smell of thirty thousand pounds of bananas.

He was picking speed as the city spread its twinkling lights below him.
But he paid no heed as the shivering thoughts of the nights
Delights went through him.
His foot nudged the brakes to slow him down.
But the pedal floored easy without a sound.
He said ""Christ!""
It was funny how he had named the only man who could save him now.
He was trapped inside a dead-end hellslide,
Riding on his fear-hunched back
Was every one of those yellow green
I'm telling you thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes, there were thirty thousand pounds of bananas.

He barely made the sweeping curve that led into the steepest grade.
And he missed the thankful passing bus at ninety miles an hour.
And he said ""God, make it a dream!""
As he rode his last ride down.
And he said ""God, make it a dream!""
As he rode his last ride down.
And he sideswiped nineteen neat parked cars,
Clipped off thirteen telephone poles,
Hit two houses, bruised eight trees,
And Blue-Crossed seven people.
It was then he lost his head,
Not to mention an arm or two before he stopped.
And he slid for four hundred yards
Along the hill that leads into Scranton, Pennsylvania.
All those thirty thousand pounds of bananas.

You know the man who told me about it on the bus,
As it went up the hill out of Scranton, Pennsylvania,
He shrugged his shoulders, he shook his head,
And he said (and this is exactly what he said)
""Boy that sure must've been something.
Just imagine thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes, there were thirty thousand pounds of mashed bananas.
Of bananas. Just bananas. Thirty thousand pounds.
Of Bananas. not no driver now. Just bananas!""

From Greatest Stories Live: Ending number one

Yes, we have no bananas,
We have no bananas today
(Spoken: And if that wasn't enough)
Yes, we have no bananas,
Bananas in Scranton, P A

From Greatest Stories Live: Ending #2:

A woman walks into her room where her child lies sleeping,
And when she sees his eyes are closed,
She sits there, silently weeping,
And though she lives in Scranton, Pennsylvania
She never ever eats ... Bananas
Not one of thirty thousand pounds .... of bananas","30,000 Pounds of Bananas",1976
Harry Chapin,"It was an early morning bar room,
And the place just opened up.
And the little man come in so fast and
Started at his cup.
And the broad who served the whiskey
She was a big old friendly girl.
And she tried to fight her empty nights
By smilin' at the world.

And she said ""Hey Bub, It's been awhile
Since you been around.
Where the hell you been hidin'?
And why you look so down ?""

But the little man just sat there like he'd never heard a sound.

The waitress she gave out with a cough,
And acting not the least put off,
She spoke once again.

She said, ""I don't want to bother you,
Consider it's understood.
I know I'm not no beauty queen,
But I sure can listen good.""

And the little man took his drink in his hand
And he raised it to his lips.
He took a couple of sips.
And he told the waitress this story.

""I am the midnight watchman down at Miller's Tool and Die.
And I watch the metal rusting, and I watch the time go by.
A week ago at the diner I stopped to get a bite.
And this here lovely lady she sat two seats from my right.
And Lord, Lord, Lord she was alright.

""Well, she was so damned beautiful she could warm a winter's frost.
But she was long past lonely, and well nigh kinda lost.
Now I'm not much of a mover, or a pick-em-up easy guy,
But I decided to glide on over, and give her one good try.
And Lord, Lord, Lord she was worth a try.

""I was Tongued-tied like a school boy, and I stammered out some words.
But it did not seem to matter much, 'cause I don't think she heard.
She just looked clear on through me to a space back in my head.
And it shamed me into silence, as quietly she said,
'If you want me to come with you, then that's all right with me.
Cause I know I'm going nowhere, and anywhere's a better place to be.
Anywhere's a better place to be.'

""I drove her to my boarding house, and I took her up to my room.
And I went to turn on the only light to brighten up the gloom.
But she said, 'Please leave the light off, Oh I don't mind the dark.'
And as her clothes all tumbled 'round her, I could hear my heart.
The moonlight shown upon her as she lay back in my bed.
It was the kind of scene I only had imagined in my head.
I just could not believe it, to think that she was real.
And as I tried to tell her she said 'Shhh.. I know just how you feel.
And if you want to come here with me, then that's all right with me.
'Cause I've been oh so lonely, lovin' someone is a better way to be.
Anywhere's a better way to be.'

""The morning came so swiftly as I held her in my arms.
But she slept like a baby, snug and safe from harm.
I did not want to share her or dare to break the mood,
So before she woke I went out to buy us both some food.

""I came back with my paper bag, to find that she was gone.
She'd left a six word letter saying 'It's time that I moved on.'""

The waitress took her bar rag, and she wiped it across her eyes.
And as she spoke her voice came out as something like a sigh.
She said ""I wish that I was beautiful, or that you were halfway blind.
And I wish I weren't so god-damned fat, I wish that you were mine.
And I wish that you'd come with me, when I leave for home.
For we both know all about loneliness, and livin' all alone.""

And the little man,
Looked at the empty glass in his hand.
And he smiled a crooked grin,
He said, "" I guess I'm out of gin.
And know we both have been so lonely.
And if you want me to come with you, then that's all right with me.
'Cause I know I'm goin' nowhere and anywhere's a better place to be.""",A Better Place to Be,1976
Harry Chapin,"All my life's a circle;
Sunrise and sundown;
Moon rolls through the nighttime;
'Til the daybreak comes around.

All my life's a circle;
But I can't tell you why;
Season's spinning round again;
The years keep rollin' by.

It seems like I've been here before;
I can't remember when;
But I have this funny feeling;
That we'll all be together again.
No straight lines make up my life;
And all my roads have bends;
There's no clear-cut beginnings;
And so far no dead-ends.

[Chorus]
I found you a thousand times;
I guess you done the same;
But then we lose each other;
It's like a children's game;

As I find you here again;
A thought runs through my mind;
Our love is like a circle;
Let's go 'round one more time.

[Chorus]",Circle,1976
Harry Chapin,"There you stand in your dungarees
Looking all grown up and so very pleased
When you write your poems they have so much to say
When you speak your dreams it takes my breath away

You know I want to be a ball player
A regular slugging fool
But I guess our dreams must wait awhile
Until we finish school

And so you and I
We watch our years go by
We watch our sweet dreams fly
Far away, but maybe someday

I don't know when
But we will dream again
And we'll be happy then
'Til our time just drifts away

There you stand in your wedding dress
You're so beautiful that I must confess
I'm so proud you have chosen me
When a doctor is what you want to be

You know I want to be a painter, girl
A real artistic snob
But I guess we'll have our children first
You'll find a home, I'll get a job

Listen to the seasons passing
Listen to the wind blow
Listen to the children laughing
Where do broken dreams go?

There you stand in your tailored suit
So many years gone by, but you're still so cute
You take the car to go and meet the bus
When our grandchildren come to visit us

You say you should have been a ballerina, babe
There are songs I should have sung
But I guess our dreams have come and gone
You're 'sposed dream when you are young

And so you and I
We'll watch our years go by
We'll watch our sweet dreams fly
Far away, but maybe someday

I don't know when
But we will dream again
And we'll be happy then
'Til our time just drifts away",Dreams Go By,1976
Harry Chapin,"I come fresh from the street
Fast on my feet, kinda lean and lazy
Not much meat on my bones, and a whole lot alone
And more than a little bit crazy
The old six string was all I had
To keep my belly still
And for each full-hour lesson I gave
I got a crisp ten dollar bill

She was married for seven years
To a concrete castle king
She said she wanted to learn to play the guitar
And to hear her children sing
So I'd show up about once a week
In my faded tight-legged jeans
With a backlog full of hobo stories
And dilapidated dreams

[Chorus]
She said, ""I want to learn a love song full of happy things.""
She said, ""I want to learn a love song; won't you let me hear you sing?""
She said, ""I want to learn a love song, I want to hear you play.""
She said, ""I want to learn a love song before you go away.""

So I tried to teach her a couple of chords
And an easy melody
But it always turned out she'd rather listen
To my guitar and me
I could hear her old man laughing in the den
Playing stud poker with the boys
While I sang so soft in the living room
Too scared to make much noise
I came one week and the den was dark
And she met me at the door
And we sat on the couch and we sang and talked
Till I could not sing no more
The silence kept on building
Her eyes grew much too wide
And I could hear both of our heartbeats
But there was no place to hide

[Chorus]

Well, I guess you know what happened
God, I never been so clean
Yes, I feel like I'm working in a Hollywood movie
Or living out a good bad dream
And all them pinup girls in that tinsel world
Never touched me like she can
It took another man's wife in the real world life
To make this boy a man

[Chorus]

I guess you know I stayed",I Wanna Learn a Love Song,1976
Harry Chapin,"Mister Tanner was a cleaner from a town in the Midwest.
And of all the cleaning shops around he'd made his the best.
But he also was a baritone who sang while hanging clothes.
He practiced scales while pressing tails and sang at local shows.
His friends and neighbors praised the voice that poured out from his throat.
They said that he should use his gift instead of cleaning coats.

But music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.

His friends kept working on him to try music out full time.
A big debut and rave reviews, a great career to climb.
Finally they got to him, he would take the fling.
A concert agent in New York agreed to have him sing.
And there were plane tickets, phone calls, money spent to rent the hall.
It took most of his savings but he gladly used them all.

But music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.

The evening came, he took the stage, his face set in a smile.
And in the half filled hall the critics sat watching on the aisle.
But the concert was a blur to him, spatters of applause.
He did not know how well he sang, he only heard the flaws.
But the critics were concise, it only took four lines.
But no one could accuse them of being over kind.

Mr. Martin Tanner, Baritone, of Dayton, Ohio made his
Town Hall debut last night. He came well prepared, but unfortunately
His presentation was not up to contemporary professional standards.
His voice lacks the range of tonal color necessary to make it
Consistently interesting.

Full time consideration of another endeavor might be in order.
He came home to Dayton and was questioned by his friends.
Then he smiled and just said nothing and he never sang again,
Excepting very late at night when the shop was dark and closed.
He sang softly to himself as he sorted through the clothes.

Music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.",Mr. Tanner,1976
Harry Chapin,"I am born today
The Sun burns a promise
In my eye

Mama strikes me
And I draw a breath and cry
Above me a cloud
Slowly tumbles through the sky
I am glad, to be alive

It is my seventh day
I taste the hunger
And I cry

My Brother and sister
Cling to Mama's side
She squeezes her breast
But it has nothing to provide
Someone weeps, I fall asleep

It is twenty days today
Mama does not hold me
Anymore

But I am to weak to cry

Now to do but die?",The Shortest Story,1976
Harry Chapin,"Hello Honey, it's me
What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said ""That's the place to be""
And how I got the job as an FM Jock the day you married me?
It was two kids and I was was into AM rock
But I just had to run around
It's been ages since I left you babe
Let me tell you 'bout what's gone down

[Chorus]
I am the morning DJ at W*O*L*D
Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen

The drinking I did on my last big gig, it made my voice go low
They said that they liked the young sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way down home again, here to Boise, Idaho
That's how this business goes

[Chorus]

I been making extra money doing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, just begging for a new toupee
And a tire around my gut from sitting on my butt
But it's never gonna go away

Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just take off in my car
But you can travel on ten thousand miles and still stay where you are
I've been thinking that I should stop disk jockeying
And start that record store
Maybe I could settle down if you'd take me back once more

OK Honey, I see
I guess he's better than me
Sure, Girl, I understand
You don't have to worry; I'm such a happy man

Comes from the rain
Glistening and shivering
She laughs as she shakes off the weather
Caroline
Whispers her words
Saying she'll always love me
At least when we are together

Starts closing in
Surrounding the spot
Where watching in wonder I stand
Caroline
She's shedding her rings
Her bracelets and stockings
And placing her skin still moist in the palm of my hand

You're pressing she smiles
It's too soon to ask
For me to cast off my cover
You assume that I'm caught
Up there in your head
So now I must go to my lover.

Her world is such a sudden place
A minute flashed before my face
To fly to feel to fall from grace

This bubble that I choose to chase
Keeps breaking on the brink of space

Afraid of the march of the seasons

Too old to be lying
Too wise not to see all the reasons

Hangs her cape and her jeans
And surrenders her tears
To christen my pillow with sorrow

To explain what she means, she speaks of today
More than she dreams of tomorrow

To let go of the night and believe
She collects all her things
While she's still of a mind
So soft it's like breathing she leaves.",Caroline,1976
Harry Chapin,"Old John Joseph was a man with two first names
They left him in the railroad yard when they took away the trains
Only one run a week comes on roaring down that line
So all he's got to worry 'bout is time.

I come by in the evening to hear 'bout where he's been
He says come on sit down Kid, where shall I begin?
He starts telling me the stories of the glories of his past
But he always saves the story of his Corey for the last.

And he says my Corey's coming. No more sad stories coming
My midnight-moonlight-morning-glory's coming aren't you girl?
And like I told you, when she holds you
She enfolds you in her world.

I was quite surprised to find out all the places that he knew
And so I asked the townfolk if his stories were true
They said old John was born here, he's lived here all his life
He's never had a woman, let alone a wife.

And very soon you'll find out as you check around
That no one named Corey's ever lived in this town
So I chided the old man 'bout the truth that I had heard
He smiled and said reality is only just a word.

I came by one evening but he did not hear my shout
I looked in the window and saw the fire was out
When he would not wake up I forced in the door
And found that Old John Joseph would tell stories no more.

The scene at the graveyard, three of us were there
Me and the gravedigger heard the parson's prayer
He said - We need not grieve for this man,
For we know that God cares!

They put the cold dirt over him and left me on my own
And when at last I looked up I saw I was not alone
So I said if you're a relative, he had a peaceful end.
She said my name is Corey you can say I'm just a friend.

Corey's coming, no more sad stories coming
My midnight-moonlight-morning-glory's coming aren't you girl?
And like I told you, when she holds you
She enfolds you in her world.

So that's the old man's story, I'm glad you came tonight
A busted down old railroad yard sure makes a lonely sight
You may wonder why a young man would work out here alone
Well the job pays enough to keep some flesh on my bones.

And I confess I get to missing the old man a bit
And there's one other reason I guess I should admit 

Can't you see my Corey's coming, no more sad stories coming
My midnight-moonlight-morning-glory's coming aren't you girl?
And like he told me, when she holds me
She enfolds me in her world.",Corey's Coming,1976

And my Mary's not here
Once again
Be the friend
That you've been
And take me in.

Please take me in.",If My Mary Were Here,1976
Harry Chapin,"Did you ever hear the one about...
Oh, God I love myself
When I've got it on
I know I'll live forever babe
All my fears are gone

Then suddenly I'm dying
They turned the laugh track off
I'm drowning in the silence
Crucified by coughs

Oh, I am the laugh man
Half clown and half man
Half out and half in, oh mister can't you see?
I'm s'posed to leave you laughing, so why don't you laugh at me?

I started out my starvin'
Desperate for money
My belly crackin' dirty jokes
That did not come out funny
My neck stuck out so far
Like a gawky giraffe
Screamin' on a guillotine
""Come on, sucker, laugh!""

I am the guy who always catches the pie
I specialize in pratfalls
I am the goon who flashes the moon
A mouse in a house of catcalls

I'm your jester your juggler
Your joker your friend
I'm nothing more or less
Than a horse's nether end!

My ego is a bubble 
That I realize just broke
And alone without a microphone
My real life's a joke

Did you ever hear the one about...",Laugh Man,1976
Harry Chapin,"In the little town of Candor in the last year of my youth
I learned the final lesson of the levels to the truth
My father was a farmer he'd go tilling in the ground
My mother was a neighbor she'd go visiting around.

But I didn't care.
For I had found the answer to a plow boy's lonely prayer.
She was the daughter of the Mayor.

The Mayor fought my courtship for he'd made other plans
He saw her married to a better man than a boy with farmer's hands.
I said -- I hate your father, it's so hard not to strike him.
She said --You know I love you because you're so much like him.

And so I'd go sneaking in the evening
And there she'd stand a crying in the dawn as I was leaving

But the Mayor of Candor lied
When he offered me his only daughter
The Mayor of Candor tried 
To take her across the water
What a thing to do to a young man in love
What a thing to do to your daughter.

One day with father on his tractor and mother off again
I go to find the mayor and work out what I can
But he is not at his office, he is not at his home
When I find him in the countryside he is not alone

He is holding a woman and imagine my surprise
As she jumps back from his arms I look into my mother's eyes

All my thoughts of outrage, embarrassment and pain
Were washed away by what came roaring through my brain
The Mayor's at my mercy and I hear my own voice say --
Your run for re-election is just one month away.

And the world will never know of what I've seen here sir
But I'll be with your daughter is my meaning clear?

My mother looks in horror at the compromise we made
But the Mayor's rueful smile says the piper must be paid
I had a month of joy in heaven from this deal I'd made in hell
What was to happen then my friend a prophet could not tell

The day after his re-election and the victory celebration
The Mayor takes his family on a month long foreign vacation

Oh Coleen -- you know how much I love you
There is no one I'd ever place above you
Oh Coleen -- you don't even know me
To have you there's nothing that's below me.

But time always passes after all
And as the summer follows spring so does the winter follow fall

The day that they return I stand waiting on the road
I watch the car drive up I watch the passengers unload
Of course she isn't there of course I should have known
The Mayor says that she has stayed the decision was her own.

I spit out my hatred and my fury at his lies
When he says you tried to blackmail me you're just as bad as I
He says go and do your damnedest, throw your mother to the streets
You know it's been too many years I had to be discreet

And as he stands there saying we're just two of a kind
It hits me like a thunderbolt exploding in my mind

As I look into his leering aged wrinkled mirror of my own face
He laughs and sneers and says of course dear son  
Where do you think you came from in the first place?

The Mayor of Candor lied 
When he offered me his only daughter
The Mayor of Candor tried 
To take her across the water
What a thing to do to a young man in love
What a thing to do to your daughter.",The Mayor of Candor Lied,1976

And the Wise Man says, ""Me too!""
And the Guru says, ""Wazoo!""
So do what you do!

The priests stand in their pulpits
The Pope sits on his throne
The parishes are empty
And the choirboys on their own
Until the second coming
Yes, they're leaving us alone
And God in His heaven
Has decided to keep mum

'Cause He's just another traveler
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He's just another one

Pity Mr. President
He can't do a thing
He says everywhere he went
We tried to make him sing
Our lonely White House resident
Says we should have made him King
Maybe then he could have saved us
From the truth we were hiding from

But he is just another traveler
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He was just another one

The General's in his game room
But his Soldier won't salute
Ever since he was promoted
He can't pop his chute
His shrink says he is paranoid
'Bout communistic roots
So unfurl the flag boys
Start beating his drum

Yes we've got to get another straggler
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He was just another one
He's another one

And the Smoke Witch says, ""Wahoo!""
And the Wise Man says, ""Me too!""
And the Guru says, ""Wazoo!""
So do what you do!

Wow! The lead singers raucous
As he screams out the truth
Then the band hold a caucus
And decides to sell their youth

Our Manager he'll hawk us
As along as we're uncouth
And we'll call it revolution
But we'll crank out Bubble Gum
'Cause there's the margin doom for travelers
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He's just another one

Grampa swung into the orgy
It was his last hope
He was dressed to the nines
In deodorant and scope
And they found him a woman
She brought vaseline and soap
Well it started out exciting
But it ended up ho hum
She said, ""I thought that you could take me
All the way to Kingdom Come""
When all is said and done
He's just another one grampa

So Billy sells hot sermons
And cold wars through the mails
While Mr. Big is selling out
His business never fails
And King Kennedy like Chaucer's
Chasing Canterbury Tales
And though my brain is still a virgin
The rest of me is well done
Don't you know we're all just travelers
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And just a, just a, just another one
When all is said and done
Yeah just another one

And the Smoke Witch says, ""Wahoo!""
And the Wise Man says, ""Me too!""
And the Guru says, ""Wazoo!""
So do what you do!

Do what you do!
Do what you do!
Do what you do!

",On the Road to Kingdom Come,1976
Harry Chapin,"I got the news today
That you refused to play
'Cause you never made number one
But it's not just the words

It's the deeds that are heard
When all is said and done
Kings take their crowns
They melt them all down

Trying to get the gold out
You went to hell and
Even when you weren't selling
You never ever sold out

You weren't no leader
You were more like a bleeder
Who was trying to cry for us all
You weren't no sage

But your sense of outrage
Sounded like a trumpet call
Fifteen years ago
In the old folky show

You were just one voice in the crowd
But now with so few singing
Your voice would have been ringing
Out 'bout twice as loud

There but for fortune
Say a small circle of friends
Some may see the changes
So, few see the ends

The pleasures of the harbor
Have come to you at last
You may not be marching anymore
But the parade's still going past

I'm not taking the blame
That we killed you
You know you did that to yourself
But it was kind of a shame

That you played that game
'Cause you were better than anyone else
One shot of your bottle
Got you full throttle

It was the friend that was always there
But your greatest gift
And the curse you lived with
Was that you could always care
",The Parade's Still Passing By,1976
Harry Chapin,"You keep looking out my window at the driftwood floating by
Like a flock of birds in fall time you're just itching to fly
I know I cannot hold you 'cause you live life to the hilt
So go on get out of here girl I don't want your guilt

Go on and roll down your river babe
I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar that you brought with you baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn
What goes down that river don't return

What goes down don't return
What goes down don't return

Yes I remember when you washed up on my doorstep
You had a dirty face, a damp dress and a dream
But now you're just a fish out of the water baby
It's time to throw you back into the stream

So go on and roll down your river babe
I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar that you brought with you baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn
What goes down that river don't return

What goes down don't return
What goes down don't return

Now don't you bleed on me about all our good times
Don't tell me that you'll never be the same
And don't tell me anything but goodbye baby
More than that would be just another game

So go on and roll down your river babe
I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar that you brought with you baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn
What goes down that river don't return

You leave me with a month of your sweet madness
You leave me with your music in my head
You leave me with the mystery of the river rolling
You leave me with a desert for my bed

So go on and roll down your river babe
I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar that you brought with you baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn
What goes down that river don't return

What goes down don't return
What goes down don't return
What goes down don't return

",Roll Down the River,1976
Harry Chapin,"The kid heard the word up in Brooklyn.
It was his second year of medical school.
He went and stashed some jeans into his guitar case,
His father said, ""You're a fool"".

But the boy jumped on board a Greyhound bus,
It took him two days to get to Mobile,
And though it took two weeks to track the old man down,
He never doubted that the rumor was real.

But there the old man stood by the store front,
With his white cane hanging from his belt.
And he was bending the steel of his guitar strings
So it seemed like the metal had to melt.

He was the last of the street corner singers
Paying his final years of dues
The voice in his throat was like a bullfrog croak
Yes it's he who invented the blues.

""To play the blues, boy, you got to live 'em
Got your dues, boy, you know you got to give 'em
Got to start sweet like a slow blues rhythm
Like a heartbeat you'll always be with 'em

When you're married to the blues, boy,
Your guitar is your wife.
It's like that fine old woman
Who you're faithful to for life.""

Well the kid walked up as the blind man finished 
And was bent to put his guitar away.
The old man heard him and said, ""Who are you?""
""I'm the kid you're gonna teach to play.""

The old man laughed but the kid kept talking 'bout
How he'd help him get around
That's when the old man said, 
""I don't need no fool to get me where in the hell I'm bound""

The kid nods his head with a great big grin and says,
""When do we begin?""
That's when the old man said,
""If You're staying with me

This is how it's got to be...""
""To play the blues, boy, you got to live 'em
Got your dues, boy, you know you got to give 'em
Got to start sweet like a slow blues rhythm

Like a heartbeat you'll always be with 'em
When you're married to the blues, boy,
Your guitar is your wife.
It's like that fine old woman

Who you're faithful to for life.""
""You know I ain't no guru, 
I'm just a blind black preacher man.
My guitar is my gospel, boy,

And I preach with my picking hand
And I preach with my picking hand
I ain't gonna be your wet nurse,
Or black father to an albino son.""

""That's O.K.,"" the kid up and say,
""I just want to pick like a son of a gun!""
""Whoa, boy, that ain't no damn typewriter you're playing, now.
You've got to caress it like a woman, slow and easy""

""Like this, old man?""
""No! A fool plays the blues like Machine Gun Kelly,
Five hundred notes to the bar,
And if you're going to stick with me

You've got to learn what the blues really are
You learn to pick with me and you can stick with me
But it's time to blow this town.
We gots a gig to preach in a gaming house

We're Alabama bound""
So the kid took the hand of the old blues man
To lead him all around the south
Now it's the old man's turn to make the white boy learn

""You don't play guitar with your mouth""
To play the blues, boy, you got to live 'em
Got your dues, boy, you know you got to give 'em.
Got to start sweet like a slow blues rhythm

Like a heartbeat you'll always be with 'em.
When you're married to the blues, boy,
Your guitar is your wife.
It's like that fine old woman

Who you're faithful to for life.
All right, son, let's hear some guitar.
I want you to play it funky like your uncle's carbuncle.
That's right, son, play it sassy like your sweet mama's pajamas.

That sounds pretty good for a New York boy!
Oh, son that sounds so sweet.",Bluesman,1977
Harry Chapin,"This phone's growing into my ear
I made three hundred calls today,
Though yours is the only voice that I want to hear
I got to make me a living someway.

I know you hate me doing this
You say I'm selling out,
But how in the hell is a mad s'posed to live?
Selling's what it's all about.

Hello, Sir, I'm the Pocano Land
Development Company,
And I'm calling you with an offer of some land
That you'll just have to see.
A quarter-acre plot, that's what I've got for you
Nineteen ninety-five, four hundred dollars down
And just ten bucks a week
It's two short hours from New York City,
A Pocano Land Site green and pretty.
There's lakes there, and trout streams,
Mountain views, Country Dreams,
Contry Dreams.

We dreamed our dreams in college, girl
Back then we thought we should,
And we promised that we would save the world
Way back then we thought we could.

I know you love your teaching now, but I wish you'd understand,
There aren't that many jobs around, I'm doing the best I can.

Hello, Sir

I'm here with forty other guys
Crowded in a room,
Making a living selling the moon
And rustic dreams in June.
I used to hate the city now I'm dwelling in it,
Used to love the country now I'm selling it.
I'm doing well at it,
That's the hell of it!

I said that we would find a farm
And live out on the land,
It's strange how dreams come back at us
In ways that we had never planned.
Here I'm selling real estate
And laughing at myself,
If I can't have my country dream
I'm gonna sell it out to somebody else!

Darling, don't get mad at me
I'm doing this for you,
It's really not so sad to see we had
Growing up to do.
Please don't push me anymore
It's gonna work out fine,
I know I said I'd quit before
But just give me a little more time.",Country Dreams,1977

There was a trombone and a saxophone
The bass and drums were cookin' up the bandstand
And I was strummin' in the middle with this dude on the fiddle
And we were three days out from land

And now the foghorn's jammed and moanin'
Hear it groanin' through the misty night

""But still everything's all right""

In the banquet they were throwin' in first class
And we were blowin' waltzes in the barroom
When the universe went CRASH!

""There's no way that this could happen""
I could hear the old captain curse
He ordered lifeboats away, that's when I heard the chaplain say
""Women and children and chaplains first""

Well, they soon used up all of the lifeboats
But there were a lot of us left on board
I heard the drummer sayin' ""Boys, just keep playin'""
""Now we're doin' this gig for the Lord""

He's the last remaining guest
He was tappin' in a Morse code frenzy

Harry Chapin,"I first heard you sing in the Empire Room
Your husky hum engulfed the gloom
And whatever mission that brought me there
Disappeared in the mist of your amber hair

You laughed and surrendered your gifts by degrees
But I was convinced that you spoke only to me
And my life turned on its hinge in that smoky club
As I ground out my past with my cigarette stub

Oh, I do it for you, Jane I love you so
My kingdom is new but it's going to grow
Our castles will shimmer with silver and gold
My lady is lovely she'll never grow old
And I offer this promise this one thing I know
I do it for you, Jane, for I love you so

I left that town and went out on my own
I made my own kind of music as I juggled the phones
And all the while I worked I was reaching towards a time
When I'd return to find you and finally make you mine

It took most of two years to do what must be done
Collect the pieces of the puzzle, you're the final one
I was shaking as I asked you and you know by now I guess
You made me happy ever after when you said yes

Yes, I do it for you, Jane I love you so
My kingdom is flourishing, and still it will grow
Our castle it shimmers with silver and gold
My lady is lovely you'll never grow old
And I shout from the heavens, hello there down below
I do it for you, Jane, for I love you so

If life could only stay the same but I guess it never does
But God I still remember how excited I was
Feelings of power I'd never known before
But winning whets the appetite, I had to have more

Homes in New York and London on the beach at Malibu
I bought one for each facet of woman in you
By then you had retired from singing to bring our baby home
And I was winging around the country and you found you were alone

Still, I do it for you, Jane I love you so
Our kingdom is flourishing and still it will grow
Our castles all shimmer with silver and gold
But my lady is lonely your smile is growing cold
As I search through the mists on the roads I must go
Where are you now, Jane? For I love you so

And you're the lady with the past
I admit I'm insecure about
How long we will last

I sort through in my mind
The little that I know
But the only things I find
From where my musings go

Is that kind of confusion
That just makes more questions come
About the wild and shady world
That you must have wondered from

You see, I have no real complaints
Of how you've left your past behind
I guess what gets me worried
Is you've erased him from your mind

I wonder what happened to him
Your past is a canyon
I'm a stranger on the rim
Looking down below

To where it's misty and dim
But, where there's still shining
A faint glow from a light
It makes me wonder where he is tonight

That drawer of your old photographs
Sits there like detective's leads
With the packets full of letters
That I do not dare to read

And then there is that negligee
That is made for candlelight
You know, I've never seen you wear it
Was it used on other nights?

You see, dream lover of a lady
What shakes me to the core
Is the thought as you caress me
You've done this all before

I think about the future
With me out and others in
Will I, too, have disappeared
Like I've never ever been?

In my loose and lusty youth
I was feeling well self-satisfied
Deliciously uncouth
When she slipped out from my covers
With a smile
Saying, ""You've got a lot to learn, dear boy
It's going to take a while.""

She said--

Get someone else, beside yourself

You know a real man would
Do much more than you could
You know he'd wonder if he

I said, ""I see, let's start again.""
She said, ""You know you never can.""

She put her clothes back on
She straightened up my bed
She hit me with a line

So I stood there in my shorts
Feeling naked just the same
With her last few words
I knew I was brand new at the game
She gave her gentle smile
She slipped out through the door
Saying, ""You're my first and only love

Harry Chapin,"It's a slow motion night
In the hot city lights
Past time when the good folks
Are snoring in bed

On a loose-jointed cruise
To recolor your blues
With illegal notions alive,
Alive in your head

You are back from some war
That you've been fighting for
Some old blue blood bastard 
In a dark pinstripe suit

and the word from your loins
Has your mind in your groin
And your back pocket burning with blood
Blood money loot

So, you walk past the glow
Of the flicker-picture shows
Where the raincoat men wait
For a child to come by

And the women in doorways
Who have nothing to say
'Cause your money is talking 
To the ones that you would try

She owns the block
With the dead pawnshop clock
She's the answer to dreams 
That you pay to come true

She's got no heart of gold
But that's not what she's sold
She just sees herself doing what she
What she has to do

And she's all that you're hoping
As her coat falls open
Give her bread she leads you
To a bed on the floor

Where for ten million years
And through ten billion tears
The armies of bootmen have marched
Back from their wars

She's in that state of grace
Before time finds her face
With a mind of old wisdoms
And a body still young

And she tastes as sweet
As a child's chocolate
Before the butts and the whiskey
Had wasted the taste of your tongue

Play the music again
Of the grey-stubble men
That groaning blue symphony
Moans evermore

And you watch as she fakes it
And of course you just take it
She's better than others
You never paid money for

You've used up your booty
The girl's done her duty
The turnstile has turned 
And you learn you are done

You're back on the street
Joining fresh marching feet
You see more soldiers coming
And your girl chooses one

And the medic has brought
Shots for what you have caught
Your leave is all over
You're back on the line

And the joke in the trenches
Of the hot blooded wenches
And the next thing that you'll do
When they next give you the tim.

And you're back in your army
Back shedding red blood
And you dream of the girl
As you sleep in the mud

And you know you'd swap with her
If the deal could be made
'Cause you'd rather be working at love
Love as your trade",Mercenaries,1977
Harry Chapin,"At first you seemed just like my dream
Of a finer better life
Much more than I could ask for
In a lover or a wife
Though I work with my body
And my work makes my hands rough
There are gentle things inside me
That are anything but tough

There are lessons you could teach me
Things I do not know
Things I've never done, girl
And places we could go
But you only wear your tailored suits
For me to rip and tear
Ah, can't I hold you quietly
And smell your perfumed hair?

I saw you as the answer
That I never dared to dream
I saw you as the window 
Into a world I'd never seen
I saw you as the vision
Come to raise me from the mud
But you came to use my sweat to cool
The fever in your blood

I'm not Marlon Brando 
On his motorcycle bike
When you call me your animal
It's a name I do not like
Please do not tear my back
Yes, of course I bleed
The violence you thirst for
Is not what I need

Your silken skin is armor
That begs for brutal hands
But why can't I be gentle
And tell you of my plans?
I know that you're using me
Not I just using you
And you're not so scared 
Of losing me as I losing you

Harry Chapin,"She wore an S.E.G. when she came back home
Like the cat that ate the canary
And I stood befuddled, a chauvanist stud
With his mistress quite contrary
I was smack up against the moment
I was afraid i would face someday
But the truth is a wall that you can't blow down
And it won't be laughed away

You see, my old lady went and took herself 
A young man last night
It got me crazy when she said, 
""Baby, don't you get uptight,
I think maybe it's the time for you to see the light,""
She said, ""It's alright now, boy, I'm yours tonight.""

Now I admit my imagination's been 
The sweetest sinner of all
Yes it lives like a snake in Eden
And it forgives each time I fall
So I've been Casanova
I've double-dated with Don Juan
And though I've been doing almost everything
I never dreamed she'd be carrying on!

She says that she still loves me
She says that last night was no big deal
She says, ""Why can't a woman play the same damn game
And act out what she feels?""
She says she's going to take a bath
I hear her singing in the tub upstairs
While I'm sitting here spitting out chunks of my heart
Forced into being fair,
While she's splashing rround up there,
I'm supposed to act like I don't care,
I hear the devil laughing somewhere!

Harry Chapin,"Well, I hear you are a painter now
Though you're almost halfway through
You pulled a pallet knife, you cut away a wife
And you started something new

But it was not the strife of married life
That ordained what you would do
A quick look back through your history
Shows the same things goading you

It's just like you to try painting
Because you're color blind
Each time you conquer something
That's the time you change you're mind

And now your new preoccupations
Give you your handicap to start
Yes you're happiest when you're chasing clouds
With a halfway broken heart

Paint a picture of yourself
Let the images flash past
Don't weep on watercolors, Michael
Make this moment last
Paint the kid with restless eyes
Yeah, the way you looked back then
'Cause the man keeps getting frightened
When the boy's not born again

I remember how you led us
Back when we all were kids
And that fact that you were older
Made us copy what you did

The day you bought that cheap guitar
We all fell into line
We got hooked on music
But you drifted off in time

So, I can see you at your easel
Splay legged there you stand
And your eyes are darting back and forth
Brush flashing in your hand
You're reaching always for that dream 
You need to make you real
Leaning in a heavy wind
That no one else can feel",Paint a Picture of Yourself (Michael),1977
Harry Chapin,"There's a kid out on my corner, hear him strumming like a fool
Shivering in his dungerees, but still he's going to school
His cheeks are made of peach fuzz -- his hopes may be the same 
But he's signed up as a soldier out to play the music game 

There are fake patches on his jacket -- he's used bleach to fade his jeans 
With a brand new stay pressed shirt -- and some creased and wrinkled dreams 
His face a blemish garden -- but his eyes are virgin clear 
His voice is Chicken Little's -- But he's hearing Paul Revere 

When he catches himself giggling -- he forces up a sneer 
Though he'd rather have a milk shake -- he keeps forcing down the beer 
Just another folkie -- late in coming down the pike 
Riding his guitar -- he left Kid brother with his bike 

And he's got Guthrie running in his bones 
He's the hobo kid who's left his home 
And his Beatles records and the Rolling Stones 
This boy is staying acoustic 

There's Seeger singing in his heart 
He hopes his songs will somehow start 
To heal the cracks that split apart 
America gone plastic 

And now there's Dylan dripping from his mouth 
He's hitching himself way down south 
To learn a little black and blues 
From old street men who paid their dues 

'Cause they knew they had nothing to lose 
They knew it 
So they just got to it 
With cracked old Gibsons and red clay shoes 

Playing 1-4-5 chords like good news 
And cursed with skin that calls for blood 
They put their face and feet in mud 
But oh they learned the music from way down there 

The real ones learn it somewhere 
Strum your guitar -- sing it kid 
Just write about your feelings -- not the things you never did 
Inexperience -- it once had cursed me 

But your youth is no handicap -- it's what makes you thirsty 
Hey, kid you know you can hear your footsteps as you're kicking up the dust 
And the rustling in the shadows tells you secrets you can trust 
The capturing of whispers is the way to write a song 

It's when you get to microphones the music can go wrong 
You can't see the audience with spotlights in your eyes 
Your feet can't feel the highway from where the Lear jet flies 
When you glide in silent splendor in your padded limousines 

Only you are crying there behind the silver screen 
Now you battle dragons -- but they'll all turn into frogs 
When you grab the wheel of fortune -- you get caught up in the cogs 
First your art turns into craft -- then the yahoos start to laugh 

Then you'll hear the jackals howl 'cause they love to watch the fall 
They're the lost ones out there feeding on the wounded and the bleeding 
They always are the first to see the cracks upon the walls 
When I started this song I was still thirty-three 

The age that Mozart died and sweet Jesus was set free 
Keats and Shelley too soon finished, Charley Parker would be 
And I fantasized some tragedy'd be soon curtailing me 
Well just today I had my birthday -- I made it thirty-four 

Mere mortal, not immortal, not star-crossed anymore 
I've got this problem with my aging I no longer can ignore 
A tame and toothless tabby can't produce a lion's roar 
And I can't help being frightened on these midnight afternoons 

When I ask the loaded questions -- Why does winter come so soon? 
And where are all the golden girls that I was singing for 
The daybreak chorus of my dreams serenades no more 
Yeah the minute man is going soft -- the mirror's on the shelf 

Only when the truth's up there -- can you fool yourself 
I am the aged jester -- who won't gracefully retire 
A clumsy clown without a net caught staggering on the high wire 
Yesterday's a collar that has settled round my waist 

Today keeps slipping by me, it leaves no aftertaste 
Tomorrow is a daydream, the future's never true 
Am I just a fading fire or a breeze passing through? 
Hello my Country 

I once came to tell everyone your story 
Your passion was my poetry 
And your past my most potent glory 
Your promise was my prayer 

Your hypocrisy my nightmare 
And your problems fill my present 
Are we both going somewhere? 
Step right up young lady -- Your two hundred birthdays make you old if not

Senile 
And we see the symptoms there in your rigor mortis smile 
With your old folks eating dog food and your children eating paint 
While the pirates own the flag and sell us sermons on restraint 

And while blood's the only language that your deaf old ears can hear 
And still you will not answer with that message coming clear 
Does it mean there's no more ripples in your tired old glory stream 
And the buzzards own the carcass of your dream? 

B*U*Y Centennial 
Sell 'em pre-canned laughter 
American Perennial 
Sing happy ever after 

There's a Dance Band on the Titanic 
Singing Nearer My God to Thee 
And the iceberg's on the starboard bow 
Won't you dance with me 

Yes I read it in the New York Times 
That was on the stands today 
It said that dreams were out of fashion 
We'll hear no more empty promises 

There'll be no more wasted passions 
To clutter up our play 
It really was a good sign 
The words went on to say 

It shows that we are growing up 
In oh so many healthy ways 
And I told myself this is 
Exactly where I'm at 

But I don't much like thinking about that 
Harry -- are you really so naive 
You can honestly believe 
That the country's getting better 

When all you do is let her alone 
Harry -- Can you really be surprised 
When it's there before your eyes 
When you hold the knife that carves her 

You live the life that starves her to the bone 
Good dreams don't come cheap 
You've got to pay for them 
If you just dream when you're asleep 

There is no way for them 
To come alive 
To survive 
It's not enough to listen -- it's not enough to see 

When the hurricane is coming on it's not enough to flee 
It's not enough to be in love -- we hide behind that word 
It's not enough to be alive when your future's been deferred 
What I've run through my body, what I've run through my mind 

My breath's the only rhythm -- and the tempo is my time 
My enemy is hopelessness -- my ally honest doubt 
The answer is a question that I never will find out 
Is music propaganda -- should I boogie, Rock and Roll 

Or just an early warning system hitched up to my soul 
Am I observer or participant or huckster of belief 
Making too much of a life so mercifully brief? 
So I stride down sunny streets and the band plays back my song 

They're applauding at my shadow long after I am gone 
Should I hold this wistful notion that the journey is worthwhile 
Or tiptoe cross the chasm with a song and a smile 
Well I got up this morning -- I don't need to know no more 

It evaporated nightmares that had boiled the night before 
With every new day's dawning my kid climbs in my bed 
And tells the cynics of the board room your language is dead 
And as I wander with my music through the jungles of despair 

My kid will learn guitar and find his street corner somewhere 
There he'll make the silence listen to the dream behind the voice 
And show his minstrel Hamlet daddy that there only was one choice 
Strum your guitar -- sing it kid 

Just write about your feelings -- not the things you never did 
Inexperience -- it once had cursed me 
But your youth is no handicap -- it's what makes you thirsty, hey kid
Strum your guitar -- sing it kid 

Just write about your feelings -- not the things you never did

Harry Chapin,"We got married early
And just a little bit late
Baby came too early
But some things just can't wait
We were just beginning
But it was very clear
We grew up a little bit that year

I caught on as a meter man
You were caught at home
When I started night school
You ended up alone
But you had another baby
While I had my career
And we grew up a little bit
We grew up a little bit
We grew up a little bit that year

They put me in a office job
A young man on the move
We bought a house in Shaker Heights
You supervised the move
We were cashing checks, you were changing children
While I played engineer
And we were growing ever faster
Every year

I got bored of kilowatts
You were tired of kids
I started staying out at night
And soon that's what you did
At parties we'd go separately 
You'd wiggle and I'd leer
And we were growing faster
We were growing ever faster
We were growing ever faster every year

You learned to live in silence
I learned to live in lies
And we both igored the empty spaces
Growing in our eyes
Your breath became a gin and tonic
Mine became a beer
And we grew up a little more last year

Today at work they passed me by
And promoted John instead
I came home to find you'd wrecked the car
I guess I lost my head
Well, I can't believe I hit you
But the rage came on so strong
Ah, where did we go wrong?

As you sit there crying
I wonder who you are
The partner-stranger-friend and foe
Who's come with me this far
We stand here in the ashes
And I guess it is quite clear
We did not really grow too much
Each year

So you say we're going nowhere
Well I know that's where we've been
Still I can't help wondering
Can we begin again?
I feel so full of questions
Curiosity and fear
But could we grow a little bit
Could we grow a little bit
Can we grow a little bit this year?",We Grew up a Little Bit,1977
Harry Chapin,"You were chasing him down Braodway on that white-hot July,
'Cause he thought he'd got a message from some holy man on high.
He said his chance had finally come; he'd done it on his own,
He had to leave his past behind; the first thing that had to go--was home.

You put him in an aeroplane and packed your life and clothes,
You learned all the lessons that the suitcase lady knows.
He said, ""Something still drags me back from where I'm heading to,""
You didn't really understand, 'til the next thing that had to go--was you.

Some things are sacrificed and some things remain,
Some things bring pleasure and some things bring pain.
Some things must pass away, and some things are regained,
When the whole world is changing, why should people stay the same?

You saw his picture in the paper, that disarming boyish smile,
You sometimes had to swallow hard as you saw him on the dial.
You heard him on a talk show, he was hearing no one else,
Then suddenly you knew too well, the last thing he'd left behind--was himself.

Some things are sacrificed and some things remain,
Some things bring pleasure and some things bring pain.
Some things must pass away, and some things are regained,
When the whole world is changing, why should people stay the same?

So you pulled yourself together, friends and family said you should,
You discovered you were doing things you never knew you could.
And someday when he calls you, which you know of course he'll do,
You'll just send him away again, 'cause the last thing you finally
found--was you.",Why Should People Stay the Same,1977
Harry Chapin,"The little boy went first day of school
He got some crayons and started to draw
He put colors all over the paper
For colors was what he saw
And the teacher said.. What you doin' young man
I'm paintin' flowers he said
She said,
It's not the time for art young man
And anyway flowers are green and red
There's a time for everything young man
And a way it should be done
You've got to show concern for everyone else
For you're not the only one

And she said
Flowers are red young man
Green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen

But the little boy said
There are so many colors in the rainbow
So many colors in the morning sun
So many colors in the flower and I see every one

Well the teacher said
You're sassy
There's ways that things should be
And you'll paint flowers the way they are
So repeat after me

And she said
Flowers are red young man
Green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen

But the little boy said
There are so many colors in the rainbow
So many colors in the morning sun
So many colors in the flower and I see every one

The teacher put him in a corner
She said
It's for your own good
And you won't come out 'til you get it right
And all responding like you should
Well finally he got lonely
Frightened thoughts filled his head
And he went up to the teacher
And this is what he said, and he said

Flowers are red, green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen

Time went by like it always does
And they moved to another town
And the little boy went to another school
And this is what he found
The teacher there was smilin'
She said
Painting should be fun
And there are so many colors in a flower
So let's use every one

But that little boy painted flowers
In neat rows of green and red
And when the teacher asked him why
This is what he said
And he said

Flowers are red, green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen.",Flowers Are Red,1978

There's muggers and there's jugglers and we are led by clowns

And if our future lies on the final line
Are we brave enough
To see the signals and the signs
I wonder what would happen to this world?

Do we join the parade
Or do we try and turn around

Can they be last ones with a semblance of a dream?

And I know you're frightened by my laughter
But you're not afraid to hold my pain

You never treat me like you treat a gentle man
You only hit me when you know it hurts
But then why bother reaching down to where I'm battered
You got to raise me up from the dirt

But you're not afraid to hold my pain

Yes you get me crazy
'Cause you never even wear my presents babe
You wear flowers tucked into your hair
But when I'm cursin' in the night in my frustration
That's when suddenly you are there

Once again that's when you let me

If you ever do that again
Ten bucks a week protection don't mean I can't knock you down
You've got to treat me like a living saint Lou, whenever my son's around

Yeah the kid wants to be a policeman just like me
You know he'll be a good one the way I started out to be
And he just might end up police chief, now wouldn't that be something to see?
'Cause then the kid would kick right off of the force all the two-bit grifters like me

[Chorus]

I guess it was when my old lady left me and she took off with a salesman guy
I started to see things so differently, cut your own slice out of the pie
Yeah I grew up and it came clear to me all the smart cops on the make
You get a silver badge not an old tin star when you're on the take
It's pimps and whores, punk gang wars, robberies and homicides
When you walk the beat with the creeps on the street, well there ain't no way to hide
I spent half my life without no wife ridin' herd on the scum of the earth
I learned the tricks of the trade from the gutter parade and then I prayed for all I'm worth
Don't you know I appreciate the money Lou, 'cause it all goes into the bank
And when I send my kid to college someday I'll have guys like you to thank
Yeah ten bucks a week on your grocery store means you don't have to worry 'bout crime But hold your money when the kid's with me you can pay me double next time

[Chorus]

It seems like two months
'Though I met her tonight
Something just told me
It would work out alright
So I asked her to act out
What was there in our heads
No need for games, babe,
Let's hop into bed
(audience reacts, Harry says, ""I figured that'd get ya."")
That's when I said

""Oh, get on with it
Let's get it done
Life is made up of moments
Let's not miss this one
Oh, get on with it
Before it's too late
We know where we're going
There's no, no, no, no need to wait.""

But that's when she says
""Let's take it slowly
You don't really know me
If we make it holy
Maybe it will last
What is your hurry
You don't need to worry
The one thing we know
Is that time, time, time goes too fast.""

Soon it's working so well
I got her moving in
All the permanent thoughts
Already begin
You see she is the woman
That I want for my wife
I say, ""Let's set a date, babe,
And get on with our life.""
And that's when I said again

""Oh, get on with it
Let's get it done
Life is made up of moments
Let's not miss this one
Oh, get on with it
Before it's too late
We know where we're going
There's no, no, no, no need to wait.""

But once again she says
""Let's take it slowly
Still you don't know me
If we make it holy
Maybe it will last
What is your hurry
You don't need to worry
The one thing we know
Is that time, time, time goes too fast.""

I don't know what happened
As we moved along
But all of a sudden
It came out all wrong
She said, ""It's all over
Let's not drag out the end
If we split up now
Then at least we'll stay friends.""
And that's when she said

""Get on with it
You know it's all done
We had our moments
Don't dwell on this one
Oh, get on with it
You know it's too late
Oh, yes, it's all over
There's no, no, no, no need to wait.""

But that's when I say
""Let's take it slowly
You know how you know me
And once it was holy
Don't give up so fast
What is your hurry
You don't need to worry
The one thing we know
Is that time, time, time goes too fast.""",Get on with It,1979
Harry Chapin,"We are the lovers
We are bound to one another
By a bond that is invisible
Yet stronger still than time

And we're locked into the motion
That moves beneath the ocean
Rolling toward the future
That makes pain the only crime

Now I know you are the answer
You're the damsel and the dancer
The angel with the devil eyes
That knows about the beat

You remove the masks and faces
And you see the shadowed places
That only witches look for
In the cradle of the heat

Have you heard of the
Legend of the Lost and Found?
It tells of a world turnin' upside down
When all the kings have become the clowns

The beggars are crowned
The Legend of the Lost and Found

So I become the reacher
More the pilgrim than the preacher
The savage's been ravaged
By the visions of the smoke

As I'm peeling back the layers
To the passions of my prayers
I have seen the ramparts
Where the molten waters broke

Your heart's a sacred kingdom
That has colonized my soul
My past's the shattered fragment
That somehow you made whole

Today's your gift to fondle
Your offering to feel
Tomorrow is the promise
That somehow you've made real

Have you heard of the
Legend of the Lost and Found?
It tells of a world turnin' upside down
When all the kings have become the clowns

The beggars are crowned
The Legend of the Lost and Found

So l'll sing you every silly, sad
And happy song I know
And you'll open every part of you
That you've got left to show

And I'll pour myself around you
Like the sunshine drowns the field
And in the golden softness we will yield
And in the golden softness we will yield

One day this dude drives in the station
And I slide out to the pump
And he says, "" I need some odd jobs done
Can you get off from this dump?""

Well, I can always use some extra bread
So I nod and take the job
When he says, ""Clean up before you come
I do not hire slobs ""

Now you can see I'm not no fancy pants
But everyone has pride
And especially since this lovely lady's
Sittin' by his side

Still something keeps my trap shut
And I nod again, "" Alright ""
And he gooses his Mercedes
And he squeals off in the night

So I do what I can

Well, I find his place next morning
It's more a palace than a pad
And it kind of makes my pick-up truck
Start looking pretty bad

But the same lady swings the door back
And before one word is said
She leads me to his trophy room
Where he sits with his stuffed heads

He's got this list of jobs for me to do
While he's out of town
And he says, ""I'm too damn busy boy
The way I move around""

Well, I start to figure prices when he says
""It's time you learned

You get just what you earn""

And I'm fixin' up some stairs
When I feel that someone's watching me
And I see she's standing there

And she says, ""I like to watch you work
You have such supple hands""
She says, ""Can I help you?""
And I say, ""Baby you can""

Well, she looks me in the eyes, boys
I admit I looked a little lower
That's when she starts breathing faster
And I start working slower

You see when you have a helper
With her attitude and grace
You start puttin' lots of extra hours
Workin' 'round the place

I give part time help
I'm the odd job man
I can't do what I want
So I do what I can

And I'll tell you now
So that you will understand
You get just what you pay for
From the odd job man

Well, a month had too soon come and gone
With my odd jobs all done
When who should pull up to the pump
But the long-lost prodigal son

And he says, ""Here's a hundred dollars, boy""
Pulls the bill off from his wad
And he starts to hand it over
Like a gift come straight from God

I say, ""That's just a buck an hour sir""
He says, ""That's what I pay for jerks""
Now I admit that almost blew my cool
But I staggered back to work

You see most times when it's said and done
There's justice to this life
'Cause what that man had done to me
I'd done to his wife

And watch them all twist pretzels by hand, by hand
And if only we all lived in Pretzel Land

She will fill his coffee cup

In the seventh pew they perch
They listen to his sermon and they believe
They're grateful for the food they ate

So they put their money in a plate

Harry Chapin,"It was my first night in that rooming house
In the last room down the hall
I heard a hoarse voice and an old guitar
Coming through the paper thin walls

A crazy nonsense nursery rhyme
That did not mean a thing
But for the first of what was to be a thousand times
This is what I hear him sing

Hold that D chord on the old guitar
'Til I found the G
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around to D

I had to lay there listening
It seemed he was in the room
This stranger with his melody
Singing there in the gloom

And he repeated it over and over again
Such a soft and sinkin' sound
It was kind of like a music box
That was slowly winding down

You see, he sang it, he hummed it
Whistled it, and he strummed it
He laughed it and he cried it
He did everything but hide it

And he sang
Hold that D chord on the old guitar
'Til I found the G
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around for me

So I lay there in that lumpy bed
Countin' choruses instead of sheep
'Til I banged on the wall and out I called
""Hey bub, I need some sleep""

The sudden void of silence
Then I heard that hoarse voice say
""It weren't so long ago, boy
They paid me to play ""

I said, ""It's kind of late for music, sir
Two hours 'til it's daylight""
He answered, ""I need my music most
In these dark hours of the night

You see I've tried gettin' high on something son
But it only brings me down
Staying dry don't work out better, boy
'Cause my eyes get wet and I drown

Won't you please let me continue
And I'll be in your debt?
You see I'm not singing to remember, son
I'm just singing to forget""

And he sang
Hold that D chord on the old guitar
'Til I found the G
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around for me

That's when I said
""If I'm supposed to listen to you sir
Just one quick question then
Why in the hell do you sing one song
Over and over again?""

And this is what he said
He said, ""I gave her the music, son
She gave me the words
Together we'd write the kind of songs
The angels must have heard

Of course we'd fight like cats and dogs
But life ain't no rosebud dream
Still whatever we'd do everybody knew
We truly were a team

I can't remember now if I done her wrong
Or if she done wrong to me
But all I know that when I let her go
That it did not set me free''

That's when I said, ""You sound like what's-his-name""
He said, ""That's who I am
But you can't wrap a name around you, boy
'Cause it really don't mean a damn""

""You see, a song don't have much meaning
When it don't have nothing to say
What she could do was magic, son
All I could do was play""

He started singing again
That's when I drifted off
Maybe I dreamed what I heard
'Bout this stranger with his melody
Who'd gone and lost the words

Hold that D chord on the old guitar
'Til I found the G
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around to D

Harry Chapin,"The old lady on the park bench
In the park with just one tree
Was there from the very first day
That you were part of me

It seemed like she'd been sitting there
Since 1000 B.C.
And you said, ""She is as permanent
As anything can be""

From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

You sat there in the window
You were looking 'cross the street
You said, ""The birds and the old lady
Yet the same bread crumbs they eat""

I could not get you back to bed
'Till you took them both a treat
And I learned that you were twice as stubborn
As you could be sweet

From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

Do you remember that summer rain storm
On the day that you moved in?
I was caught in the excitement
Of what was to begin

Well, you disappeared for a little while
And when I asked you where you'd been
You said you'd lent the old lady my new umbrella
Then you gave me that wicked grin

From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

Yes, on March 21st the first day of Spring
The old lady would be there
Spend all the days of summer
Then she'd disappear somewhere

Where she spent her falls and her winters, babe
No one was aware
But you were the first to wonder
Yeah, you were the first to care

It was three years we were together
The old lady held that spot
Through the nights when life was wonderful
Through the days when it was not

And the times we were in trouble
In a way we sometimes got
Just knowing that she was out there
Meant we gave it just one more shot

From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

Well, it's March 21st the first day of Spring
And you know what I had to do
I got up and I ran to the window
To confirm what I already knew

I wish I had your address to send this letter to
You see the old lady's not on the park bench
And I'm still wondering where are you?
Where are you, where are you?

You laid me down on the mattress on the
Floor that was your bed

Was trying to find an island in the stream

Harry Chapin,"Remember when the music 
Came from wooden boxes strung with silver wire
And as we sang the words, it would set our minds on fire,
For we believed in things, and so we'd sing.

Remember when the music 
Brought us all together to stand inside the rain
And as we'd join our hands, we'd meet in the refrain,
For we had dreams to live, we had hopes to give.

Remember when the music 
Was the best of what we dreamed of for our children's time
And as we sang we worked, for time was just a line,
It was a gift we saved, a gift the future gave.

Remember when the music
Was a rock that we could cling to so we'd not despair,
And as we sang we knew we'd hear an echo fill the air
We'd be smiling then, we would smile again.

Oh all the times I've listened, and all the times I've heard
All the melodies I'm missing, and all the magic words,
And all those potent voices, and the choices we had then,
How I'd love to find we had that kind of choice again.

Remember when the music
Was a glow on the horizon of every newborn day
And as we sang, the sun came up to chase the dark away,
And life was good, for we knew we could.

Remember when the music
Brought the night across the valley as the day went down
And as we'd hum the melody, we'd be safe inside the sound, 
And so we'd sleep, we had dreams to keep.

And I feel that something's coming, and it's not just in the wind.
It's more than just tomorrow, it's more than where we've been,
It offers me a promise, it's telling me ""Begin"",
I know we're needing something worth believing in.

Harry Chapin,"So here she's actin' happy inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flyin' in my taxi, takin' tips and gettin' stoned
I got into town a little early
Had eight hours to kill before the show
First I thought about heading up north of the bay
Then I knew where I had to go
I thought about taking a limousine
Or at least a fancy car
But I ended up taking a taxi
'Cause that's how I got this far
You see, ten years ago it was the front seat
Drivin' stoned and feelin' no pain
Now here I am straight and sittin' in the back
Hitting Sixteen Parkside Lane
The driveway was the same as I remembered
And a butler came and answered the door
He just shook his head when I asked for her
And said ""She doesn't live here anymore""
But he offered to give me the address
That they were forwarding her letters to
I just took it and returned to the cabbie
And said ""I got one more fare for you""
And so we rolled back into the city
Up to a five-storey old brownstone
I rang the bell that had her name on the mailbox
The buzzer said somebody's home
And the look on her face as she opened the door
Was like an old joke told by a friend
It'd taken ten more years but she'd found her smile
And I watched the corners start to bend
And she said, ""How are you Harry?
Haven't we played this scene before?""
I said ""It's so good to see you, Sue
Had to play it out just once more""
Play it out just once more
She said I've heard you flying high on my radio
I answered ""It's not all it seems""
That's when she laughed and she said, ""It's better sometimes
When we don't get to touch our dreams""
That's when I asked her where was that actress
She said ""That was somebody else""
And then I asked her why she looked so happy now
She said ""I finally like myself, at last I like myself""
So we talked all through that afternoon
Talking about where we'd been
We talked of the tiny difference
Between ending and starting to begin
We talked because talking tells you things
Like what you really are thinking about
But sometimes you can't find what you're feeling
Till all the word run out
So I asked her to come to the concert
She said ""No, I work at night""
I said, ""We've gotten too damn good at leaving, Sue""
She said, ""Harry, you're right""
Don't ask me if I made love to her
Or which one of us started to cry
Don't ask me why she wouldn't take the money that I left
If I answered at all I'd lie
So I thought about her as I sang that night
And how the circle keeps rolling around
How I act as I'm facing the footlights
And how she's flying with both feet on the ground
I guess it's a sequel to our story
From the journey 'tween heaven and hell
With half the time thinking of what might have been
and half thinkin' just as well
I guess only time will tell",Sequel,1980

Young boy open up your eyes
It's supposed to be your day
Now off you go horizon bound
And you won't stop until you've found
Your own kind of way
And the wind will whip your tousled hair
The sun, the rain, the sweet despair
Great tales of love and strife
And somewhere on your path to glory
You will write your story of a life

And all the towns that you walk through
And all the people that you talk to
Sing you their songs
And there are times you change your stride
There are times you can't decide
Still you go on
And then the young girls dance their gypsy tunes
And share the secrets of the moon
So soon you find a wife
And though she sees your dreams go poorly
Still she joins your story of a life

So you settle down and the children come
And you find a place that you come from
Your wandering is done
And all your dreams of open spaces
You find in your children's faces
One by one
And all the trips you know you missed
And all the lips you never kissed
Cut through you like a knife
And now you see stretched out before thee
Just another story of a life

So what do you do now?
When she looks at you now?
You know those same old jokes all the jesters tell
You tell them to her now
And all the same old songs all the minstrels sang
You sing 'em to her now
But it don't matter anyhow
'Cause she knows by now

So every chance you take don't mean a thing

We listened to his visions of how our land should be;
We gave him our hearts and minds to send across the sea.
Nineteen sixty-three, white and black upon the land;

It was nineteen sixty-five and we were marching once more

From the burning cities against a crazy war.
Memphis, L.A. and Chicago we bled through sixty-eight
Till she took me up to Woodstock saying with love it's not too late.
We started out the seventies living off the land;

She was sowing seeds in Denver trying to make me understand
That mankind is woman and woman is man,
And until we free each other we cannot free the land.
Oh, she is always seventeen;

She has a dream that she will lend us and a love that we can borrow.
There is so much joy inside her she will even share her sorrow;

But she was picketing the White House chanting,
""The truth's the only hope.""

She was feeding starving children saying the dream must go on.
She is always seventeen;
She has a dream that she will lend us and a love that we can borrow.

You see I don't know what to tell you babe
I can't say thanks a lot
For I know I really owe you
For almost everything I got.
You were with me in the good times
And when things were going bad
You were with me when your love
Was the only thing I had.
I have been a song man
For a long long time
Coming up with some melodies
Trying to find some words that rhyme.
And while I have been singing
You've been there to see me through
And so I think it's long past time
That I wrote this song for you.
I was going to keep it simple
And not make it too long
But I had hoped to make it beautiful
For after all it is your song.
You know how I love my music
It is my life and my livelihood
But of all that's happened to me babe
You are everything that's good.




",Song Man,1985
Harry Chapin,"I came into town with a knapsack on my shoulder
And a pocket full of stories that I just had to tell.
You know I've knocked around a bit,
I've had my share of small town glories,
And it's time to hit the city and that crazy carousel.

I been feeling sorry for myself,
But you know I was only lonely,
Like everybody else.
Until...

You brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain.
You taught me happiness just one time,
It keeps on coming back again.

These streets were never highways
For I had not known the sky above.
These days were never my days
For I had not known your love.

It's funny how a city can put on a different face,
When it holds the one you care for
It becomes a different place.
And I never felt so far from alone.
Baby you brought me halfway home.
Yes, baby, you brought me halfway home.

You brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain.
You taught me happiness just one time,
It keeps on coming back again and again and again...

You brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain.
You taught me happiness just one time,
It keeps on coming back again and again and again...

You brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain.
You taught me happiness just one time,
It keeps on coming back again and again and again...

You brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain.
You taught me happiness just one time,
It keeps on coming back again...
",Sunday Morning Sunshine,1985
Harry Chapin,"It is an early Monday morning.
The sun is becoming bright on the land.
No one is watching as he comes a walking.
Two bulky suitcases hang from his hands.

He heads towards the tower that stands in the campus.
He goes through the door, he starts up the stairs.
The sound of his footsteps, the sound of his breathing,
The sound of the silence when no one was there.

I didn't really know him.
He was kind of strange.
Always sort of sat there.
He never seemed to change.

He reached the catwalk. He put done his burden.
The four sided clock began to chime.
Seven AM, the day is beginning.
So much to do and so little time.

He looks at the city where no one had known him.
He looks at the sky where no one looks down.
He looks at his life and what it has shown him.
He looks for his shadow it cannot be found.

He was such a moody child, very hard to touch.
Even as a baby he never smiled too much. No no.No no.

You bug me, she said.
Your ugly, she said.
Please hug me, I said.
But she just sat there
With the same flat stare
That she saves for me alone
When I'm home.
When I'm home.
Take me home.

He laid out the rifles, he loaded the shotgun,
He stacked up the cartridges along the wall.
He knew he would need them for his conversation.
If it went as it he planned, then he might use them all.

He said Listen you people I've got a question
You won't pay attention but I'll ask anyhow.
I found a way that will get me an answer.
Been waiting to ask you 'till now.
Right now !

Am I?
I am a lover whose never been kissed.
Am I?
I am a fighter whose not made a fist.
Am I?
If I'm alive then there's so much I've missed.
How do I know I exist?
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?
Am I?

The first words he spoke took the town by surprise. 
One got Mrs. Gibbons above her right eye.
It blew her through the window wedged her against the door.
Reality poured from her face, staining the floor.

He was kind of creepy,
Sort of a dunce.
I met him at the corner bar.
I only dated the poor boy once,
That's all. Just once, that was all.

Bill Whedon was questioned as stepped from his car.
Tom Scott ran across the street but he never got that far.
The police were there in minutes, they set up baricades.
He spoke right on over them in a half-mile circle.
In a dumb struck city his pointed questions were sprayed.

He knocked over Danny Tyson as he ran towards the noise.
Just about then the answers started comming. Sweet, sweet joy.
Thudding in the clock face, whining off the walls,
Reaching up to where he sat there, answering calls.

Thirty-seven people got his message so far.
Yes, he was reaching them right were they are.

They set up an assault team. They asked for volunteers.
They had to go and get him, that much was clear.
And the word spread about him on the radios and TV's.
In appropriately sober tone they asked ""Who can it be?""

He was a very dull boy, very taciturn.
Not much of a joiner, he did not want to learn.
No no.No no. 

They're coming to get me, they don't want to let me
Stay in the bright light too long.
It's getting on noon now, it's goin to be soon now.
But oh, what a wonderful sound!

Mama, won't you nurse me?
Rain me down the sweet milk of your kindness.
Mama, it's getting worse for me.
Won't you please make me warm and mindless?

Mama, yes you have cursed me.
I never will forgive you for your blindness.
I hate you!

The wires are all humming for me.
And I can hear them coming for me.
Soon they'll be here, but there's nothing to fear.
Not any more though they've blasted the door.

As the copter dropped the gas he shouted ""Who cares?"" .
They could hear him laughing as they started up the stairs.
As they stormed out on the catwalk, blinking at the sun,
With their final fusillade his answer had come.

Am I?
There is no way that you can hide me.
Am ?
Though you have put your fire inside me.
Am I ?
You've given me my answer can't you see?
I was!
I am!
And now I will be
I will be",Sniper,1988
Harry Chapin,"When the summer fled past my window
And autumn's chill was in the air
There's a special kind of lonesome
'Round that ending time of year

When the leaves fell
And they drifted 'neath the trees
That soon were bare
I felt that wind blow ever colder
And suddenly you were there

We laughed and scuffled
While the snow fell
And the cold gave your cheeks a glow
And in your arms come evening
A kind of peace I know

Often I'd wake at midnight
Mid some icy winter storm
But then I would find you beside me
And you made the night seem so warm

Now I go my way, you go your way
Now that the winter's come and gone
But somehow with the springtime
Your golden warmth still lingers on
",Winter Song,1988
Harry Chapin,"It was raining hard in 'Frisco
I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light

Oh, where you going to, my lady blue
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain
She just looked out the window, she said
""Sixteen Parkside Lane""

Something about her was familiar
I could swear I'd seen her face before
But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more

It took a while, but she looked in the mirror
And she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile, just the same

And she said, ""How are you Harry?""
I said, ""How are you Sue?
Through the too many miles
And the too little smiles
I still remember you"" 

It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of the Dodge
The lesson hadn't gone too far

You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off to find the sky

Whoa, I've got something inside me
To drive a princess blind
There's a wild man, wizard
He's hiding in me, illuminating my mind

Oh, I've got something inside me
Not what my life's about
'Cause I've been letting my outside tide me
Over 'till my time, runs out

Baby's so high that she's skying
Yes she's flying, afraid to fall
I'll tell you why baby's crying
'Cause she's dying, aren't we all

There was not much more for us to talk about
Whatever we had once was gone
So I turned my cab into the driveway
Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns

And she said we must get together
But I knew it'd never be arranged
And she handed me twenty dollars
For a two fifty fare, she said
""Harry, keep the change"" 

Well, another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go
I stashed the bill in my shirt

And she walked away in silence
It's strange, how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long, long time ago

You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
I took off for the sky

And here, she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flying in my taxi
Taking tips, and getting stoned
I go flying so high, when I'm stoned",Taxi,1995
Harry Chapin,"My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say ""I'm gonna be like you, dad""
""You know I'm gonna be like you""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when""
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw, I said, not today
I got a lot to do, he said, that's okay
And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed
It said, I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when""
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please?

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when""
But we'll get together then, dad

I've long since retired and my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, I'd like to see you if you don't mind
He said, I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time
You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, dad
It's been sure nice talking to you
And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon

Harry Chapin,"Oh God babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You picked me up in your battered blue
Volkswagen, babe
You laid me down on the mattress on the
Floor that was your bed

Some wisdom in you told you
Ministering to my body
Brought a temporary respite to the
Demons that were screaming in my head

Oh God babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You see it was not the things you told me
Though what you told me served to make me smile
You just knew enough to hold me
And in holding me you held off the night a little while

You had a beach and a cottage and some nights that were free
You had those eyes that smiled in a dream
But I was lost, confused and still you seemed to see
How I was tired of running rapids
I was trying to find an island in the stream

Oh God babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You see it was not the things you told me
Though what you told me served to make me smile
You just knew enough to hold me
And in holding me you held off the night a little while

Harry Chapin,"Hello honey, it's me
What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said 'That's the place for me'
And how I got the job as an FM Jock the day you married me?
We were two kids and I was was into AM rock
But I just had to run around
It's been eight years since I left you babe
Let me tell you 'bout what's gone down

I am the morning DJ on WOLD
Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen
The drinking I did on my last big gig made my voice go low
They said that they liked the younger sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way back home again, via Boise, Idhao
That's how this business goes

I've been making extra money playing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, begging for a new toupee
And a tire on my gut from sitting on my
But they're never gonna go away
Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just drive off in my car
But you can travel on ten thousand miles and still say where you are
I've been thinking that I should quit disk jockeying
And start that record store

Maybe I could settle down if you'ld take me back once more
Okay honey, I see
I guess he's better than me
Sure, old girl, I understand
You don't have to worry, I'm such a happy man

Some days make a mess of me
I touch the ground when I can find my feet

I juggle everything
I drop the ball
Sometimes it feels my life's impossible
But then it all comes down to

I'd love to take you on a time machine
Fill those cracks things fall between

I found a river to an ocean
Concrete sky and a stone cold sea
I came to where the emptiness cracked open

All my fears came crashing through
And met the fire of my sorrow
But I found my strength in forgiving you
I never even dreamed how far my heart could go

To give my life beyond each death
From a deeper well of trust
To know that when there's nothing left
You will always have what you gave to love

In this life the love you give
Comes back around to be your treasure
What you lose will be what you win

A silver coin rings down that well
You can never spend too much
A diamond echoes deeper still
And you'll always have what you gave to love

And dream of the spring inside the trees
How heavy the empty heart
How light the heart that's full

Sometimes, I have to trust what I can't know
Sometimes, I have to trust what I can't know

We walk into paradise
The angels lend us shoes
'Cause all that we own
We'll come to lose

And heaven is not so far
Outside this womb of words
With every rose that blooms
My soul is assured

It's just like a song I've known
Yet still unheard

And every leaf of fire lets go
Melting in the arms of earth and snow
And if I could hold you now
You'd enter like a sigh

You'd be the wind that blows
The answer to 'Why?'
You'd be the spring-filled trees
Of every December sky

And it sings like a thousand bells
For sorrow and grace, for my love of you
The feathers, the bones and the shells

I try to believe wherever you are
There's a sky and a sea of blue
And someone you trust whose sheltering arms
Have finally comforted you

The touch of your hand still lives in my skin
While a shadow I can't embrace
Wherever it ends is where it begins
Without ever leaving a trace

So you live in me and I live in you
And the rest is for love to tell
That nothing escapes the wind blowing through
The feathers, the bones and the shells

How beautiful and sad

And peace I think to myself
For all of us, for all of us

Reaching out form endless dreams
With open hearts and fragile souls
Like children always seeking home

Where love is as easy as breathing
And breath is as light as the atmosphere

How frightening and sweet it is

The same heart crushing sorrow
The same unspeakable loveliness
All at the same time
How beautiful and sad it is

And when it seems like all my hope is spent
There's only one prayer I pray...wait for the way

Each small step of my life
There's a loneliness I've known
I take the road that's right

Even if I'm left alone
But I know that heaven holds amazing grace
When you trust what you feel inside
And a true heart opens at it's own pace
And I must say goodbye, and

Now my soul keeps calling for a long lost day
And a love that I held so true
Though there's no use falling for the heartache
That leads me back to you, I'll

Harry Chapin,"Day one god smiled
Gave us all the wisdom of a new born child
But by the time we take our first step
We've already begun to forget

What the heart knows the heart sees
We're just as much the forest as we are the trees
Every little seed trying to find
Where the light comes from

[Chorus]
And it's a world of hurt
Nothing works
It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt
Who'd ever thinks that in de midst of all this
Something as beautiful as love exists
And when i hold you and you hold me
Heaven doesn't seem like such a mystery
Darling in a world of hurt

You make me feel so good
Day one of our love
Two heartbroken people scared to trust too much
Oh here it's comes that feelin' again

What every lover swears will never end
We thought we'd been there, done that,
But when we've kissed,
We knew we'd never been her...

We've never done this
All the walls comes tumblin' down
When you love someone

Harry Chapin,"When your daddy plays guitar,
You dance without a smile.
Kid you may not have great rhythm,
But you sure got style.
Just four years old and still it seems,
You've got it figured out.
When daddy sings, and then you dance,
The people clap and shout.

Cause, you're my dancin' boy,
And it's so scary how you trust me.
Just one look from you,
And I come pouring out like wine.
Dancin' boy, I'm sure by now that you must see,
You're dancin' means much more to me,
Than any dream of mine.

Yes, I'm so proud when you are with me,
That my heart digs in my throat.
And when you stop to strut your stuff,
My eyes go all afloat.
And when I have to leave you home
As sometimes it must be.
I feel that with my leaving
I leave far too much of me.

Yes, you're my dancin' boy,
And it's scary how you trust me.
Just one look from you,
And I come pouring out like wine.
You're my dancin' boy,
I'm sure by now that you must see,
You're dancin' means much more to me,
Than any dream of mine.

You know the time will come my dancin' boy
When you're dancin' days are done,
And when daddy and his dancin' boy
Will have dwindled down to one.

You know the world will've taught you other steps
To match the march of time,
So you'll have to keep our dancin' days
Dancin' in your mind.

Yes, do your dancin' , boy,
Cause it's so scary how you trust me.
Just one look from you,
And I come pouring out like wine.
Do your dancin' , boy.

Harry Chapin,"It was raining hard in 'Frisco
I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light

Oh, where you going to, my lady blue
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain
She just looked out the window, she said
""Sixteen Parkside Lane""

Something about her was familiar
I could swear I'd seen her face before
But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more

It took a while, but she looked in the mirror
And she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile, just the same

And she said, ""How are you Harry?""
I said, ""How are you Sue?
Through the too many miles
And the too little smiles
I still remember you"" 

It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of the Dodge
The lesson hadn't gone too far

You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off to find the sky

Whoa, I've got something inside me
To drive a princess blind
There's a wild man, wizard
He's hiding in me, illuminating my mind

Oh, I've got something inside me
Not what my life's about
'Cause I've been letting my outside tide me
Over 'till my time, runs out

Baby's so high that she's skying
Yes she's flying, afraid to fall
I'll tell you why baby's crying
'Cause she's dying, aren't we all

There was not much more for us to talk about
Whatever we had once was gone
So I turned my cab into the driveway
Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns

And she said we must get together
But I knew it'd never be arranged
And she handed me twenty dollars
For a two fifty fare, she said
""Harry, keep the change"" 

Well, another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go
I stashed the bill in my shirt

And she walked away in silence
It's strange, how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long, long time ago

You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
I took off for the sky

And here, she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flying in my taxi
Taking tips, and getting stoned
I go flying so high, when I'm stoned",Taxi [DVD][Live],2005

What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said 'That's the place for me'
And how I got the job as an FM Jock the day you married me?
We were two kids and I was was into AM rock

Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen

They said that they liked the younger sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way back home again, via Boise, Idhao
That's how this business goes

I've been making extra money playing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, begging for a new toupee
And a tire on my gut from sitting on my
But they're never gonna go away
Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just drive off in my car
But you can travel on ten thousand miles and still say where you are
I've been thinking that I should quit disk jockeying
And start that record store

Maybe I could settle down if you'ld take me back once more

I guess he's better than me
Sure, old girl, I understand
You don't have to worry, I'm such a happy man

When I awake, I'll never take a chance that I can't keep.
A thousand first times never add up to last,
And I've been told a heart of gold melts away too fast.

But I didn't count on you
Running into me,
No I didn't count on you.

I could learn to love you,
I could get used to this.
I could learn to love you,
And the shelter of your kiss.

The day's not as hard as trying to go through it alone,
And in the end you can't depend on any love,
But your own.
Sometimes the impossible shows up undeclared;
That's when the impossible
Shows you that it's possible,
Maybe even beautiful,
To double what you've dared.

My eyes were really droopy, but I really do believe
It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that, oh no

And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door
The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four
He stands outside my bedroom yelling: ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" because
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus, no way

I think my daddy sees me
Peeking from my door

And then ol' Santa took me up, up, and away

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show
It was really past my bedtime, and so ol' Santa said
""Little boys like you should be in bed""

So I hollered: ""Ho! Ho! Ho!""

It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that

And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door
The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four
He stands outside my bedroom yelling ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" because
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus

I think my daddy sees me
Peeking from my door
But he pretends he's Santa anyway
Every year he tries to fool me
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in Santa or his sleigh...

I stared out my window and looked into the night

Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me

I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said
""Little boys like you should be in bed""

So I hollered ""Ho! Ho! Ho!""

Then he let me hold the reins awhile

My father gave my nose a tweak and told me I was bad
Then one day I learned a word that saved my achin' nose

If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

I've traveled all around the world and everywhere I went
I'd use my word and all would say, ""There goes a clever gent""
But when Dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me
I say my special word and then they ask me out to tea

My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe
It must’ve been ol’ Santa ’cause I saw his big red hat
And I know my mom and dad can’t fly like that, oh no
I know my mom and dad can’t fly like that

And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door
The same ol’ Christmas trick, my dad had played since I was four
He stands outside my bedroom yelling, ""Ho ho ho"", because
He knows I don’t believe in Santa Claus, no way
He knows I don’t believe in Santa Claus

I think my daddy sees me, peeking from my door
But he pretends, he’s Santa anyway
Every year he tries to fool me
But I’m a big boy now, I don’t believe in Santa or his sleigh, no way

So I went back to bed and I curled up nice and tight
I stared out my window and I looked into the night
And then, all of a sudden, through my window I could see
Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me

Santa Claus, Santa Claus
It must’ve been ol’ Santa Claus
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Happy, ho ho ho, to you

Then I heard ol’ Rudolph tellin’ me to come outside
He told me that ol’ Santa wanted me to take a ride
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh
And then ol’ Santa took me up and away
Santa took me up up and away

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show
It was really past my bedtime and so ol’ Santa said
""Little boys like you should be in bed""

So I hollered, ""Ho ho ho"" and I put on Santa’s hat
Then he let me hold the reins awhile
We pulled up to my window and I jumped back in my room
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile

When I woke up Christmas morning it was clear and bright
My parents said my window had blown open in the night
I smiled as I told them that it must’ve been the cat
And they asked me where I got my big red hat, yeah yeah
They asked me where I got my big red hat

Santa Claus, Santa Claus
It must’ve been ol’ Santa Claus

It ran, ""Louis dear, it's too slow for for me hear,

Every street is paved with gold 
And it's just across the borderline 
And when it's time to take your turn 
Here's a lesson that you must learn 
You could lose more than you'll ever hope to find 

When you reach the broken promised land 
And every dream slips through your hands 
Then you'll know that it's too late to change your mind 
'Cause you've paid the price to come so far 
Just to wind up where you are 
And you're still just across the borderline

The river flows on like a breath 
In between our life and death 
Tell me who's the next to cross the borderline

Hoy tenemos que cruzar (today we have to cross)

He got mixed up with a Flo,

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1998

Well of all things can it be really
No. Yes. Ho. Hi. Oh my eye!
My mind may be wandering but I confess
I believe it is Old Deuteronomy

Old Deuteronomy's lived a long time
He's a cat who has lived many lives in succession
He was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme
A long while before Queen Victoria's accession
Old Deuteronomy's buried nine wives
And more I am tempted to say ninety-nine
And his numerous progeny prospers and thrives
And the village is proud of him in his decline
At the sight of that placid and bland physiognomy
When he sits in the sun on the vicarage wall
The oldest inhabitant croaks

Well of all things can it be really

Harry Groener,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,

At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,

The song that Crosby sings

And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Remain to love until they droop and die

Of paradise, where roses grew

Sure, it looked so sweet and fair

For it looks so peaceful there""

It has a passion, The Continental,

You kiss while you're dancing.

You sing while you're dancing.
Your voice is gentle and sentimental.
You stroll together arm in arm.
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two

There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon

Harry James & His Orchestra,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light

",I'm Beginning to See the Light,1990

Harry James & His Orchestra,"A sleepy lagoon, a tropical moon and two on an island
A sleepy lagoon and two hearts in tune in some lullaby land
The fireflies' gleam reflects in the stream
They sparkle and shimmer
A star from on high falls out of the sky
And slowly grows dimmer
The leaves from the trees all dance in the breeze
And float on the ripples
We're deep in a spell as nightingales tell
Of roses and dew
The memory of this moment of love
Will haunt me forever
A tropical moon, a sleepy lagoon
And you",A Sleepy Lagoon,1990

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
