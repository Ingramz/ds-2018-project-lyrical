Sonny Jackson,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2012
Sonny James,"Mighty oaks from little acorns grow
Tall plants come from tiny seeds you sow
Low hills turn into mountains don't you realize
Big hurts came from little white lies

Tornadoes once were soft gentle winds
Fire is just a warm flame when it begins
But fire out of hand can cut man down like they were flies
Big hurts can came from little white lies

You told me little white lies just to be kind
Oh, those little white lies broke this heart of mine
Oh, all those words you said at the start
Could have built such a hope here in my heart

Now there's oceans of tear
Drops hoeing from my eyes
Big hurts can came from little white lies
Big hurts can came from little white lies",Big Hurts Came from Little White Lies,1964
Sonny James,"I'm just going through the motions of living
She seemed to love me so how was I to know
I'd be going through motions of living
I've lost so much within I'll never love again
I'm going through the motions of living
When you see me dressed in my very best
I'm going through the motions of living
It isn't really me it's what I used to be I'm going through the motions of living
You have to live so much to know so little so little in return of all the giving
We laughed we loved I've cried we parted and I died
Now I'm going through the motions of living
We laughed we loved I've cried we parted and I died
Now I'm going through the motions of living (living) living oh Lord",Going Through the Motions (Of Living),1964
Sonny James,"Tying the pieces together
All of your trinkets I'm saving the picture that you gave to me
Each night I look at them gently and pray that you'll come back to me
Tying the pieces together trying to make our love last
But little by little I'm losing living too much in the past
The walks that we took together the places and things that we had seen
Oh each night I relive these memories will you ever come back to me
Tying the pieces together
Living too much in the past",Tying the Pieces Together,1964
Sonny James,"I do love you, I truly do
You do love me, you truly do
It's no secret it's part on every tree
That I truly love you and you truly love me

There's no love truer than my love for you
I do love you, I truly truly do

Dreams do come true
I truly truly do, truly do

Sonny James,"Now he couldn't move a mountain or pull down a big oak tree
But my daddy became a mighty big man with a simply philosophy
Do what you do do well boy do what you do do well
Give your love and all your of heart and do what you do do well
Now sometimes he'd kissed my mama and hold her so tenderly
When he'd look across the top of her head then he'd wink and say to me
Do what you do do well boy

Now he was a man of laughter but if tragedy came by
The tears ran free and he'd say to me never be afraid to cry
Do what you do do well boy

Today I still remember just like it was yesterday
About a mighty big man with a mighty big heart and a mighty few words to say
Do what you do do well boy
Do what you do do well do what you do do well",Do What You Do Do Well,1965
Sonny James,"Ever since you went away it seems I age a year each day
Don't know what I'm gonna do I'm gettin' gray from being blue
Before too long I think you'll see just how bad you're hurting me
I worry so much over you I'm gettin' gray from being blue

My hair is turning gray from being blue over you
And it's cause I'm a thing you put me through being blue
Oh I'll go along so lonesome you're with someone new
I'm gettin' gray from being blue
I'm gettin' old before my time because I love you and you're not mine
You never will be I know it's true I'm gettin' gray from being blue

Sonny James,"Invisible tears in my eyes incredible pain in my heart
Indestructible memories are passing in review
Impossible though things may get improbable I will forget
Indelible memories of sweet lovable you

You're back again so I'll let you in although I'm only seeing pictures from the past
Those arms are not real but somehow I feel
If I'd just close my eyes then maybe it will last

Sonny James,"Burning bridges behind me
It's too late to turn back now
Burning bridges behind me
All I want is to forget you somehow

Found some letters you wrote me this morning
They told of a love we once knew
One by one I'd burned them to ashes
Don't want nothing to remind me of you
Burning bridges behind me

Sold the house that we once planned together
Said goodbye to the friends that we knew

Don't they know it's the end of the world 'cause you don't love me anymore
Why do the birds go on singing why do the stars glow above
Don't they know it's the end of the world it ended when I lost your love
I wake up in the morning and I wonder why everything's the same as it was

Well you was so dazy how you drove me crazy but I guess it doesn't matter anymore
There's no use in me of cryin' I've done everything and now I'm sick of tryin'
I've thrown away my nights and wasted all my days over you

Hurtin' with heartaches and tears
Don't give up keep trying thou faith never fear
Just look up there's someone who cares

All at once an open field of happiness surrounds you
Lookin' up lookin' up to the sky
Someone's there watching you and he knows all your troubles

And friends turn you down nothing is turning out right
When there's darkness about you no light seems in view

Someone's there watching you and he knows all your troubles

And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine

And no one cares at all or seems to worry about that once upon a time
When love was kind
Sometimes in our lives it's good to know
That there's a place to go and hide those tears

Some girls love for money some make love a game
Some girls use their love a stepping stones to fame
There are many kinds of love in this great big world
But there's no whole lot of love of a true blue girl
True love's a blessing

Some girls take their love too casually they flirt
Some girl use their love to break a heart to hurt
There are many kinds of love to be found that's true
But there's no love like the love I found when I found you
True love's a blessing
(Sing it loud) true love's a blessing
(One more time) true love's a blessing",True Love's a Blessing,1973
Sonny James,"On a quiet street
In the city
A littleold man walked along
Shufflin' thru the autumn afternoon
And the autumn leaves reminded him
Another summer's come and gone
He had a lonely night ahead
Waitin' for June

Then among the leaves
Near the orphan's home
A piece of paper caught his eye
And he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands
As he read the childish writing
The old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside of him
Like a brand

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

The old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And came to rest upon a child
With her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain

And they did spend the winter laughing at the rain
Talkin' thru the trees and exchanging little gifts 
They'd made for each other
The old man would carve toys for the little girl
And she would draw picture for him of beautiful ladies
Surrounded by green trees and sunshine
And they laughed a lot
But then on the first day of June
The little girl ran to the fence to show
The old man a picture she had drawn
But he wasn't there
And somehow the little girl knew he wasn't coming back
So she went back to her little room
Took a crayon, piece of paper and wrote:

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you
",Whoever Finds This I Love You,1974
Sonny James,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain

Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""

with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow

My heart and I agree,
Shes everything on this earth to me.

Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1967

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish

When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies

Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

I surrender, dear.

Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,

(Irving Caesar/Vincent Youmans) 

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear; 
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

I'm so free that I can fly while ya'll can't even crawl into a ball of freedom
In my life I count the cost I take lost accused of treason
And I could die for this cause and you might just be the reason
And in order to if I must die it's denial of self
And if you claim to be the way that means there ain't no one else
I trust it, done, there ain't no room for discussion
So if you just don't get it then let the just come with it
I know that much more is required of all that I've been given

And him create me right and wrong
And him create me script and song

And so we love the prospect and hope to put our helmet on
And that is why we build upon for each and every chosen one

Sonny Sandoval,"I was just a boy when they told me 
What you gonna be and they sold me 
The American Dream for a small fee 
The price of my life and my own dreams 
What about a dream where the Kingdom comes 
Peace on the earth and his will be done 

What about a dream where the people fight 
Not for fortune and fame but for saving lives
She'll consume your future if you just let her be 
Hold the world a hostage From sea to shining sea
You can call her freedom, but she can't set you free 
And don't you dare disgrace her She's our American dream

American dream, I was never told that the high life 
Would demand my soul such a high price 
I've been drinking the Kool-Aid the whole time 
Believing the dream till it stole mine 
What about a dream where the people cry 
For the healing of a land both soul and mind 
What about a dream where the dream was changed 

Not for change sake but for the highest gain
They say cash rules everything around me it seems 
For thirty pieces of silver you can buy you a king 
And forfeit your soul become a slave to the machine 
Some would sell they're own momma for the American pipe dream 
Redemption disregarded to the good news imparted 
Exempt from consequence spiritual free-dumb to free-tarded 
Morally decayed selfish in my ways I live to get paid 
I'm so American made

American Dream (America my American Dream) 
American Dream (America the American Dream) 
American Dream (What does it cost for my American Dream)

Program me then program the future 
Program schools and program the teachers 
Program youth then program the future 
Then program me to think I can lose her

Consume my life with the dollar sign 
Till I pledge my allegiance to lose my mind",American Dream,2011

Sonny Shroyer,"While riding in my Cadillac, what, to my surprise,
A little Nash Rambler was following me, about one-third my size.
The guy must have wanted it to pass me up
As he kept on tooting his horn. Beep! Beep!
I'll show him that a Cadillac is not a car to scorn.

Refrain:
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
His horn went, beep, beep, beep. (Beep! Beep!).

I pushed my foot down to the floor to give the guy the shake,
But the little Nash Rambler stayed right behind; he still had on his brake.
He must have thought his car had more guts
As he kept on tooting his horn. Beep! Beep!
I'll show him that a Cadillac is not a car to scorn.

Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
His horn went, beep, beep, beep. (Beep! Beep!).

My car went into passing gear and we took off with dust.
And soon we were doin' ninety, must have left him in the dust.
When I peeked in the mirror of my car,
I couldn't believe my eyes.
The little Nash Rambler was right behind, you'd think that guy could fly.

Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
His horn went, beep, beep, beep. (Beep! Beep!).

Now we're doing a hundred and ten, it certainly was a race.
For a Rambler to pass a Caddy would be a big disgrace.
For the guy who wanted to pass me,
He kept on tooting his horn. Beep! Beep!
I'll show him that a Cadillac is not a car to scorn.

Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)

Now we're doing a hundred and twenty, as fast as I could go.

Sonny Stitt,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1980

I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad (Coward)
But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games, with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's OK
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
I'm alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp",The Lady Is a Tramp,1997

When I was a young man never been kissed
I got to thinkin' it over how I had missed
I got me a girl and I kissed her and then
Oh, lord, well I kissed 'er again

Oh kisses sweeter than wine
Oh kisses sweeter than wine

He asked would I marry and be his sweet wife
Then we'd be so happy for the rest of our life
He begged daddy, pleaded like a natural man
And then, oh lord, I gave him my hand

Oh kisses sweeter than wine

I worked my day hard and so did my wife
Workin' hand-in-hand to make a good life
With corn in the field and wheat in the bins
Then, oh lord, I was the father of twins

Oh

Our children numbered just about four
They all had a sweetheart knockin' on the door
They all got married and they didn't hesitate
I was, oh lord, the grandfather of eight

Oh kisses sweeter than wine

Now that I'm old and ready to go
We get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago
We had a lot of kids, trouble and pain
But, oh lord, we'd do it all again

Full of my good gin
A lady was in the doorway she said
""Mister, won't you come on in?""

She wanted me to clean her house
Move her furniture around
Said she would bake a jelly roll
And it would be nice and brown

But I got fooled
Yes, I got fooled
Well, don't you know I got fooled
She was jivin' me all the time

She said, ""I own this apartment
And I got a big blue Buick Sedan
All that I need
Is just a handy man""

You know that she promised me
When the work was through
That I could have my way
And do anything I wanted to

But I got fooled, sonny
Yes, I got fooled, buddy
Don't you know I got fooled
She was jivin' me all the time

I hear you, boy

But I went on and cleaned her house
From the front to the back
Cleaned out every corner
I didn't even miss a crack, uh huh

She promised me a kiss
And a great big hug
Sweep down my stairs now
And beat my bedroom rug

But I got fooled, sonny, yes, you did, boy
Yes, I got fooled, buddy
Don't you know I got fooled
She was jivin' me all the time

In the evenin' about five o'clock
I said, ""House lady, I'm through
Come on and tell me now exactly
What in the world are we gonna do?""

She said, ""We gonna dance all night long
And have plenty of good gin""
Soon as she spoke those words
You know her husband come walkin' in

I got fooled, sonny, yes, you did, boy

And get fooled in the end

Sittin' on his papa's knee.
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel;
Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.
Hammer's gonna be the death of me.""
The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,
Down.
Whop that steel on down.""
John Henry told his captain,
""A man ain't nothin' but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me
Down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand. Lord,
Lord.
I'd dies with a hammer in my hand.""
John Henry said to his shaker,
""Shaker, why don't you sing?
I'm throwin' thirty pounds from my hips on
Down.
Just listen to that cold steel ring. Lord, Lord.
Listen to that cold steel ring.""
The man that invented the stream drill
Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.
The steam drill only made nine.
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor
Heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord,
Lord.
He laid down his hammer and he died.
John Henry had a little woman.
Her name was Polly Ann.
John Henry took sick and went to his bed.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man. Lord,
Lord.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man.
John Henry had a little baby.
You could hold him in the palm of your
Hand.
The last words I heard that poor boy say,
""My daddy was steel-driving man. Lord,

My daddy was a steel-driving.""

On Jerry Lee Lewis's, back door step someday

I'm gonna lay my head
On somebody's lonesome railroad line
Let that ol' midnight special
Ease my troubled mind

Well, they tell me that old graveyard
Is a mighty lonesome place
Lord, they put you six feet under
Shovellin' mud directly in your face

Well, goodbye, baby, may God bless you
And may He bless ol' Killer a little bit too
Oh, don't meet you over yonder, baby
When they throw that Jerry right over you

Troubled in mind, when I'm little blue
Bet you I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
On, on my back door step
Some lowdown, lonesome, mother humpin' day

",Trouble in Mind,1996
Sonny Terry,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1997

Lost John was a boy that got loose
From a chain gang down in Louisiana

About sixteen bloodhound, took in after him
Sheriffs, deputies
And everybody else in the county
Chasin' him all across the swamp

All night long, it was long towards mornin'
He looked up to the tree there
And seen the lights from a house

He didn't know whether the people inside
Was friends or were enemies
So he wanted to go up to the house
So, and asked if he could stay there
To get away from the bloodhounds

He was afraid if he did go up there
That the people might set their dogs
Barking at him or shoot him down
With a Winchester riffle

Being loud, living fast, keep your eyes on me
Standing still, standing tall, brother be my shelter
Diving deep, jumping high, loosing energy

Loving less, keeping cool, learn your exercises
Serving chilled being killled, be the the one who's blamed?
Feeling lost, talking much, living in the background
Saving lives, loosing games, time to feel ashamed

Tongue is tied, talk is loose, secret understanding
Making rules, breaking fools, survival is the game
Time is now, got no use for begging and demanding
No one wins, no one looses, no one is to blame.....

Slipping round, 'walking wounded, hiding my revolver
Don't regret, be upset, make your life complete
Feeling high, passing by, don't know what I'm doing
Callimg God, being taught, try to stop the greed

Speeding fast, turning brakes, living in the fast lane
Moving on, walking back, standing still would kill
Smoking grass, body aches, what's happening to my brain,
Cameras on, live attack, big brother for a feel.

Tongue is tied, talk is loose, secret understanding
Making rules, breaking fools, survival is the game
Time is now, got no use for begging and demanding

Heaven comes, heaven goes, solid as a rock
Nothing seems left for me need a different measure
Count me in, count me out, will this ever stop?

I'd give my freedom just to be with you
Together, divided

You are like a song I want to hear again
I know that I belong here by your side
Love is something that you cannot hide

Come to me, set me free
Love can last an eternity
Play your part within your heart
That's your love show

Love can change everything
Turn your winter into spring
Play your part within your heart
That's your love show

My spirit, our story
I know I never felt this way before
You give love new meaning

And now we're opening a brand new door
No one else can make me feel so fine
No one else is ever on my mind

Come to me, set me free
Love can last an eternity
Play your part within your heart
That's your love show

Love can change everything
Turn your winter into spring
Play your part within your heart
That's your love show

Only for you
Do I see?
I will as the show must go on

Play your part within your heart

Solo grigio piombo che mi spegne il sole

Due fotografie è tutto ciò che rimane
Sul mio letto il vento le fa volare
La distanza che ci divide fa male anche a me

Se non vai via, l'amore è qui 

Sei un viaggio che non ha ne' meta ne' destinazione
Sei la terra di mezzo dove ho lasciato il mio cuore, così 
Sono solo anch'io, come vivi tu, cerco come te

Quel che so di te è soltanto il tuo nome
La tua voce suona in questa canzone

Sei la terra di mezzo dove ho lasciato il mio cuore, così

They only see a sacred fist, they only see a bomb today

In a place where patience can prevail
I believe in a thought that can set you free
And the seeds of hatred always fail

In your mind you can't forget what evil has been done to you
It leaves in what you say or do and dictates your reality
But your soul is clean, disinfected by your innocence
And while it makes no sense, you pursue a slave's insanity 

I believe in a world that can take you high
In a sky where sunshine breaks the clouds
I believe in a thought that can set you free
In a mind that fears it's heartbeat

But you won't let go because you're always right
And you won't say no, so you die tonight

In a place where patience can prevail
I believe in a thought that can set you free
And the seeds of hatred always fail

But I have yet to see a cause to believe
(I need to feel it, please just let me feel alright)
It comes in waves of need
Ten ways to make you bleed before you get to die

Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?
This is not a requiem
We're wasting time as victims

Why spend our lives on bended knee
Choosing not to be free
He sighs, ""I'm quickly burning out""
All that's left of me are jaded memories
(I need to feel it, please just let me feel alright)

Of what I could have been
If I had only been less of what they wanted
Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?

This is not a requiem we're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives on bended knee
Choosing not to be free and we're still here
All together and alone consumed with fear
That one day we'll discover how empty we've become

Sickened and ashamed
We crave what they provide us
So we'll never feel alone
Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?

Te extraño en futuro, presente why pasado
Te extraño en la tarde why te extraño temprano
Talvez no rima, pero te necesito
Es que realmente me has convertido en la otra mitad
De mi vida, olvida tus heridas why cúrame esta herida
He venido a suplicarte que tomes mis manos
Que me abrases muy fuerte why me digas te amo
Porque yo soy tu dueno aunque quieras negarlo
Aunque te aya perdido why no estés a mi lado
Que no me eches al olvido que extraño tu cuerpo
Cuando estoy dormido, cuando estoy despierto
Why cada mañana que ya no te tengo, me miro al espejo
Why me estoy muriendo, por que no estas aquí???

Tengo negativos de dias positivos
Al verte sonriendo en mis fotografias
Sino no lo recuerdas, tu vida era mia
Es que vivir sin tu presencia es querer
Esperar bajo en agua, si tu no estas conmigo
El aire se me acaba

He venido a suplicarte que tomes mis manos
Que me abrases muy fuerte why me digas te amo
Porque yo soy tu dueno aunque quieras negarlo
Aunque te aya perdido why no estés a mi lado
Que no me eches al olvido que extraño tu cuerpo
Cuando estoy dormido, cuando estoy despierto
Why cada mañana que ya no te tengo, me miro al espejo
Why me estoy muriendo, why es que no puedo 
Acostumbrar a estar sin ti
Porque si tu no estas no quiero respirar
Why hoy he venido a arrodillármele a tu amor
Why si no vuelves tú ya nada será igual

He venido a suplicarte que tomes mis manos

Han sido mis celos los que te pusieron la trampa

Que lo que he comprado

Mejor soy feliz

Otros le llaman amigo
Solo sé que con él llego
A donde yo finji contigo

De este tesoro existente
No me hubiese interesado

O no comprendes la razon

Reponerme de tu condicion

It never takes too long.

You keep me without chains.
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
But you're on to me and all over me.

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
When I thought that I was strong.
But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.

I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that you're everything I think I need here on the ground.
But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go.
