Pete Droge,"I woke up near rittenhouse square
There was noise in the hall; snow was flowing in the air
And I could see just then the flashing spark
Of the match to my first smoke

Some houses are built to last
It's the couple inside that change too fast
I can see their faces looking through the glass
They're not where they belong

I want to stay with you, babe.
Won't you let me stay?
You're a beautiful girl.
I'm right where I belong, babe.
I'm here with you.
You're a beautiful girl.

I see your feet at the edge of the bed
While an old love song is creeping into your head
And as your eyes just closed I could only guess
If you were dreaming of me again

Stained glass casts a flickering light
With the curtains closed I can't tell if it's night
But I know for sure that this sure feels right
With you here between my arms

I want to stay with you, babe.
Won't you let me stay?
You're a beautiful girl.
I'm right where I belong, babe.
I'm here with you.
You're a beautiful girl.

And I hope that you can take me 
When I'm going out of my head.
And I hope that you will keep me
Keep me warm in your bed.",Beautiful Girl,1996
Pete Droge,"If you want I'll be by your side, and if you don't maybe suicide
And it's my love that'd kill me dear, if you won't hold me and have me near
But don't you fret and don't be scared, cuz baby I am a millionaire
I'll make you a star and I'll make you a queen. I'll put your face in all the 
magazines.

Okay so I lied and none of that's true, but not having you is making me blue
And I want you for the rest of my life, yes I want you to be my wife,
I'll give you a ring and a home sweet home, and if you want you'll be free to 
roam
But not too far I'm begging you please. Begging you please upon my bended knees.

If you don't love me I'll kill myself

I need you more than a sailor needs a breeze
I need you more than an eskimo freeze
I need your loving more than money or air, and if you don't love me baby that's 
not fair
Cuz I'll be good to you in every way, I'll give you loving baby everyday
A loving that's good a loving that's all right. A loving like an oven on the 
coldest night. 

If you don't love me I'll kill myself
",If You Don't Love Me (I'll Kill Myself),1996
Pete Droge,"With your sunspot stopwatch renegade savior stances 
You say to take your chances
Or else you break your branches as you climb to that top shelf 
Tuna melt buckle up your seat belt, Rickie Lee Jones
And everything that you think you own 
Is fool's gold and ancient fossil stones
You got more than you need, but you need a lot more than some do
Look at your cigarette burn through 
The things that you can't undo if you try
Well, that's tough luck King Tut
Daffy Duck never got old, babe
They'll bury you with gold, yeah 
Is that enough to hold you for today?
I got to hand it to you
Why do you do what you do?
It's times like this 
I'm glad that I ain't you 
You think you got the devil on retreat, but 
He's back up on his feet, and he's looking for you
With your monkey wrench, you dig a trench 
Don't you see the lights? 
They're shining
Shut up and quit your whining 
Four star restaurants; dining in the shade
Then your mini skirt'll hit the dirt 
And, baby, you'll be crying and bleedin'
You'll bite the hand that's feeding 
And then you're back there, pleading for your soul
I got to hand it to you
Why do you do what you do?
It's times like this 
I'm glad that I ain't you 
You think you got the devil on retreat, but 
He's back up on his feet, and he's looking for you",Sunspot Stopwatch [Live],1996
Pete Droge,"Deep in this melody is a cool affair
Longing to stay with you
So wide awake and feeling inspired
So much that we can do
I wanna hear you tonight
Wrapped up in low candle light 

Please stay, I wanna hear you play 
The small time blues
That's all we've got tonight 
You and me we're bound by harmony This wild desire is fed by reaching Higher we're still reaching higher with Them small time blues

Here in my hide away I'm alright 
Safe in this song with you 
Oh the sweet sound we make is locked Up tight

Pete Droge,"Sacrifice the lamb
Without a little torture
Tied it up with string 
And hung him from the line
It’s not my first excuse
A shot across my mouth
Sure I’ve done it too
It’s just a point of view
Shame on you
Shame on you
Shame on you
Shame on you
Up against the wall
The meat of my misgivings
Practicing for sure
I’ve been shot up there before
It’s not his first offense
To vary in my grasp
They handed out the views
Made sure it's run would last
Shame on you
Shame on you
Shame on you
Shame on you
It seemed to need a voice
To direct the fire demons
Sentimental cheer
To make it all alright
I’ll try to understand
The nature of the beast
I know it's in my hands now
I’ll sign for its release
Shame on you
Shame on you
Shame on you

Pete Emery,"You're standing at the door
I'm falling to the floor
You look even better than you did before
I'm staring at my feet
Wondering if I can do this
It's been a while but I couldn't forget you

Just a little look has got me feeling things
Just a little taste has got me seeing things
Just a little touch has got me off the chains
Doing things that I don't want to

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

We're sitting real close and I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand but I lay back
'cause you know this thing could sprial in the night
I've changed my mind I'm ready for you this time

We're sitting real close I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand but I lay back
We're sitting real close I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand I cannot fight it off",Do It,1976
Pete Emery,"Baby's back, dressed in black,
Silver buttons all down her back
High, low, tipsy toe,
She broke a needle and she can't sew
Walkin' the dog,
Just walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how to walk te dog

Asked a fellow for fifteen cents,
See the fellow he jumped the fence
Jumped so high he touched the sky,
Never got back till the fourth of July
Walkin' the dog,
Just walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how to walk the dog",Walking the Dog,1976
Pete Escovedo,"There's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
When we get to know each other
And we're both feeling much stronger
Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

Remember that special night
When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor to stay together
We made our very first promise
To love, to share, and be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love can be greater
You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing to you
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because, I'll never give up on you
Let's wait awhile
Ah well before it's too late
You know you can't rush love, love

Let's wait awhile
(Ooh hoo hoo)
Before it's too late
(Let's wait awhile)
Wait awhile
(Our love will be great)
Let's wait awhile
(Wait awhile, ooh)
Before we go too far, oh, oh, ooh

Let's wait awhile
(Let's just take our time)
Before it's too late
(Let's wait awhile)
Your love's so good
(Our love will be great)
We shouldn't rush in
(Let's wait awhile)
Slow it down
(Before we go too far)

Pete Escovedo,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.
I need you, please hear me.
Say you really love me baby,
Say you really love me, darlin';
'Cause I really love you, baby.
Oh, I really love you, darlin.

Say you really love me baby,
Say you really love me, darlin';
'Cause I really love you, baby.",All This Love,1995

For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see 
For you
There might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody 
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two 
For you
Love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray 
For you
Love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday 
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two

Pete Escovedo,"Every man has a place, in his heart there's a space,
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true, right away

And we will live together, until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever, as one

Every thought is a dream, rushing by in a stream,
Bringing life to our kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true, miles away

Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never,
We all, will live forever, as one

Come see victory, in the land called fantasy
Loving life, a new decree, 
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

Our minds will explore together, old worlds, we conquer, forever
We then, will expand love together, as one

Come to see, victory in a land called fantasy,
Loving life, for you and me, to behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find, other kind, that has been in search for you,
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life, now in review
And as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you,
A glowing light will see you through

It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true
As you glide, in your stride with the wind, as you fly away
Give a smile, from your lips, and say
I am free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way",Fantasy,1997
Pete Escovedo,"There are sad things
There are bad things, the blues
When they threaten 
Start betting you'll lose

You hide yourself behind a prayer
The blues'll come and they'll find you there
I mean the blues they call Pete Kelly's Blues

There's no exit
You can try the blues
If you're born with
You will die with the blues

That happy dream is yours they say
If you can pay the dues
That's why I'm stuck with
Fresh outta luck with the blues

There's no exit
None you can try with the blues

Pete Escovedo,"As I look into your eyes I see the sunrise
The light behind your face helps me realize

Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all
It should be me, it could be me
Forever

Wandering through life will love come home to you
And the love you want forever, will they be true to you

Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time
Love's indescribable
It should be me, it could be me
Forever

Easy, ready, willing, over time
Where does it stop where do you dare me to draw the line
You've got the body now you want my soul
Don't even think about it say no go",Sunrise,2003
Pete Escovedo Orchestra,"Do you know the way to San Jose
I've been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose

L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years
How quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you're never alone

Pete Finestone,"Come and see the brilliant light
Don't let your emotions mask your sight
It's the manifestation of a deeper fight
That affects me and you

My optimism was running high
A new world order was on my mind
But I couldn't belive it when I heard them say
They're blowing it away

And the fertile crescent is burning today
And baby my emotions are too
The cradle of humanity has led us all astray
And we're all in this together don't you know

'Cause our species has nowhere else to go
Aggression rears its ugly head
Retaliation brings further dread
The two are linked by unseen threads

That wind back through time
I don't agree with the outdated trend
Nationalism is an evil friend
But hatred is instilled by invisible lines

Drawn in our minds
And the fertile crescent is haunting us today
And baby our instincts are too

Pete Finestone,"As I walk beneath the valley
I shall fear no evil
For thanks to King George and his rainbow cabinet
Today murder is legal

To kill my brother for what he hasn't done
And as the planes blacken the sky
It sounds like heaven is falling
It sounds like heaven is falling
You promises me a new day a'dawning
I've seen a thousand points of light
Like so many points of hatred, shame and horror

But I don't want to die with a rifle in my hand
And as the planes blacken the sky
It sounds like heaven is falling

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger

Was romance what it seemed at the Mardi Gras
Was the love that we made just a brief masquerade

Was it just by chance we spoke of love
Or did you somehow feel that the wonder was real
While we danced at the Mardi Gras",While We Danced at the Mardi Gras,1957

Someday again we'll meet.

Pete Fountain,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl

In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

When I first met that gal of mine
It seemed just like a dream
But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean
Like mary led her little lamb 
She led me all the time
Until the worm had to turn
That's the reason I'm
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold

Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care

All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
No gal will ever make a fool of me
No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely

Strolling down the avenue

Reminded me of all the holes I had to fill

It's in my brain, it's in my legs
I'm a muscle man, a dragon queen
Card in hand, behind the scenes

And the kind of love I chose, the implements I use
The pairs of high heeled shoes in the basement

It's a perfect down that wakes me up
A shaky hand, a coffee cup
Comin' out of a closet room
Where there ain't no mop and there ain't no broom

And the aching in my knees, the fears that makes me freeze
I feel like such a sleaze and a loser

It's not my fault I'm in this mess
I can lift my weight on the steel bench press
In a way we're all the same
In another numbered room with another nameless pain

Lights coming on inside and outside Central Park

Magic beads, beginners loves, scraped-up knees

Shining eyes, auburn hair and a backward glance
A snapshot in a penguin suit at a senior dance
Hearts getting hardened to the breakup of first romance

Nothing's ended gentleman
All the trappings, means and ends
Hudson Bay, the appointed date of a lover's valentine

Specks of dust drifting now and landing lost

And your face when you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the party goes
You always smile but in your eyes this sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

Well, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you must know

If it's love that you need

I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1960

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

and that reminds me too of you dear

[Chorus x2]
If I could hear no music
If there could be no roses
no summer nights to make me dream as I do
I'd still would not forget you
One thing would still be true

I love you",My Heart Reminds Me,2013

I'll always place the blame, dear,

Make everything hazy, 
Clouding the skies of blue.

Oh no, overnight there's been a breathless 
Change in you!

Was I out yonder somewhere blinkin' at a star?

And your warmth become desire?

Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat

A heavy rain a fallin'

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

Pete Lauderman,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

I'm making everyone uncomfortable
I heard what they said but how would they know
Cause lately I've been hangin'
Out in the sun with the living and breathing
Sometimes life is surreal

I know where my mind has gone
And so I'm livin' on automatic
At least I'm hangin' on
Just taking me the long way around

I think it's a sin there's nowhere to go
Then again anything is possible
You made it quite clear it's better I know
And if you need me I'll be

Ignore the days and they just slip away

Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2006

Lose all their meaning with the rising moon

Do you want to make loe
Or do you just want to fool around

Making war just for fun
Treating like people just like pawns in chess

Making mercies for their sins

Pete Miser,"I thought it was done when I packed my bags and walked into the light
I picked the books I thought I should and closed the door behind
And when I handed back the keys I thought that I was free
No shame, no dirt, no surprises wait for me

I want to believe, where I began is not where I'll always be
But you're all I see and I carry you with me
You're all I see and I carry you with me

Thought it was safe to assume once I locked up the room
That I'd be gone for good but I would be back soon
Memories burned out still I'm smelling the fumes
Melodies turned down still I'm singing the tunes
Like a witch on a broom I wish I could fly fly away
Disappear into the ether find a hideaway
But the memories invade when I lie awake
Can't hide from yourself is what I'm trying to say
And by the way what would I be without my past
Only find the right number when I doubt my math
Avoid blunders only after I recount my last
Setbacks that don't kill me just amount to laughs
Anyway if I could turn back the hands of time
Would I change the events or change my mind
Wouldn't recognize myself without my doubts and fears
Got a feeling all I need is all right here

You're all I see and I carry you with me
You're all I see and I carry you with me

I've been told apples don't fall far from the tree
I hope they're wrong when they're talking about me
All I see are the ruins of a plan gone wrong
All I need is a reason to keep on and stay strong
Gotta couple old ghosts that won't leave me alone
Even after moving three thousand miles from home
Thought I shook 'em when I hit Brooklyn wasn't even looking
But they're putting their mark on everything I do
Find a few quieted moments and they creep back through
Infiltrated my dreams and held my sleep back too
I don't know where I could go without them following me
It seems everywhere I look they're all I see

Rising to a snowy height.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.
Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.

Shouldn't change you
Now you tell me why is it so,

And I would love to bring you down, plant your feet back on the ground

Turned my head and I heard the sound that reminded me
Of the days so young and sweet
Always so much fun to me,

Now you think you're so damn fine,
You could rule the world,
No not mine,

Pete Rock,"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Y'know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, prducer extrodinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the B-I-T-C-Hes
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skinz in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uhn, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, i'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother #1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, y'knowhatI'msayin
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitley chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enuff
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't wanna hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

(Free Slick Rick...)
",Don't Curse,1991
Pete Rock,"[Chorus]
I don't want to go outside
I just want to be with you
I don't feel like takin' a ride
You know what I want to do
Girl you makin' me sweat
Come close
Let's see how far we can get
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain

Let it rain 
Honey pop the umbrella
The heavster goes down smooth as ?
Fingers keep twiddlin'
But I'll keep drizzlin'
Play like a fiddle and 
Here to move a million plus
Cause when I'm damp i don't rust
Girls make a fuzz
For the lover they lust
Nature takin' it's course 
So precise
Provin' Heavy D can strike more than twice
Pronto
Snuggle
Better yet
Cuddle
Happy like a little kid 
Playin' in a puddle
Of H2O
A drip drop ?
So figure I'm somewhere
Makin' a rainbow shine
With an intend to broaden
The quiet storm
That lurks more often
So lay with the lover 
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

[Chorus] 

Now we can go down stairs
Strike a match to the log
Let the fire place burn
Dim the lights till it's dawn
Don't worry honey
I'll take good care of ya
I know what I'm doing 
I get wrecked on a regular
Red light
Green light
One two three
Hey yo who's on the mic
Well it's me Heavy D.
And I become somewhat of a national figure
You see some are big but the heavster is bigger
And I like candy bars with nuts
And ippy dippy girls
With prodigious butts
So lay with the lover
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

[Chorus

Okey Dokey
Lookin' for a trophy
Giggolo, Romeo
Wrong category
More the dawn one type
Smooth like preacher
Your high school teacher
Just call me your daddy O
Loungin' on the padio
Actin' like a kid 
But drive a jeep 
not a caddy though
Pardon me Miss
In your high heel steps
Come inside the crib set
Before you get wet
Now just for prop
Let's keep this official
Heavy is the name
D is the initial
I love the way you strut in that suit from France
There's a party tonight
Would you like to dance
You're rollin' with the lover
So be sure you dress clever
I pick you up at eight
And my drops off whatever
All of a sudden  
I got the tingle fro a Twinkie
Fever, flavor for a Pringle
I think I like to mingle 
With somebody thick
Someone that I can cling to
A milk chocolate beauty
Someone that I can sing to
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see 
how it would be

[Chorus]

Lightning and thunder
Kinda makes you wonder
Not too bad
For a brotha who's the son
Of a father who's a tech
And a mother who's a nurse
And I get paid 
'Cause I learned to kick a verse
I'm on a roll
I got 'nough control
Who needs a grammy 
When you know you got soul
I'm a smooth

Intelligent fella
You look worried
Does something trouble ya
We can take a ride in my

But let's wait till the rain stops
So you can 
Gimme what you want 
And show me what you got
But for now 
Just snuggle me Snuggle me
Quit the chit chat
Double up and snuggle oven me
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see how it would be",Let It Rain,1991
Pete Rock,"Intro (spoken):

People, 
The world today is in a very difficult situation,
And we all know it,
Because we're the ones who created it.

Chorus:

What's wrong with our future? (4x)

Verse One:

Bust this

How long will this last?
A friend to the end, a memory in the past
You think you're big, cause you walk with a shotgun
I got new for you, your days are numbered, son
Why don't you get yourself a job?
When your kid grows up, do you want him to rob?
Look at your mother, teardrops
She just received a phone-call from the cops
""Your son will do life, 'cause he wigged a man's wife
Shot her with a gun and stabbed her with a knife."", or
Take a look at your mother's heart torn
She just received a phone-call from the morgue
""Your son is dead from three shots to the head.
The killer left a note and this is what the note said:
""Never be bigger than you are.
 Never try to pose like you're a superstar
 Next time you rob somebody, and you give him the death-wish.
 When you pull the trigger, nigga, don't miss.""
Is this how you want to be
Dead on the street or locked in a penetentiary?
It's cool to be free
And it's alright for you to be you and for me to be me
Look at you, 15 years old
Coolin on the corner with a can of Old Gold
Whatever happened to school?
Yeah, sure you go to school, but you go to be cool
To sport sneakers that you took from somebody
To talk about the kid that you bucked at some party
Life is a gamble, and you're losin
Before it's too late, brother, you better start choosin
Left from right, right from wrong
Or you'll be singin that old blues song
(Yo, you gotta buck em, or else you're soft)
Some I knew thought the same, now they're way up North
You ain't soft, cause you didn't buck a shot
Put the pistol down, throw up your hands, see what ya got
Old Johnny Walker from around the block
Was livin' rather large 'till he got knocked
He had ""Livin' Large"" on his Jeep plates
""Livin' Large"" on his real estate
He even bought a diamond ""Livin' Large"" name plate
He used to look at cops and smile in their face
Drive a BMW and pump the bass
One day, he made a move for a friend
The f-are-iend, the voice said, ""Yo, I need ten."", Johnny said, ""When?""
Later on that day, Johnny went to play the game he normally plays
To do a favour for a chum
You see, a friend is a friend, but then, some are none
Cause when he got to the spot they were supposed to meet
All he found was a police-infested street
I guess havin a friend is rough
Cause now Johnny's up north, doin push-ups, gettin buffed
You see this chain I've got, I've got it, honestly
You see the clothes I wear, I've got it, honestly
You see the Jeep I drive, I've got it, honestly
I work hard, it ain't easy being me
Never had an excuse for life
Just did what I did, now what I do, I do it right
""Jumbo, Jumbo"", they cry on the block.
5.0, 5.0, lay low, here comes the cops
Man, your lifestyle is petro
On your knees again, because Jumbo said so
""Free Mandela"", you cried
But you still sell dope to brothers and sisters outside
Martin Luther King had a dream (ooh yeah)
That's exactly what turned his dream into a nightmare
Malcolm X said, ""By any means necessary.""
He didn't mean just for you, brother, he meant for everybody
Maybe if we were still slaves, we'll be closer; however
Pickin cotton was bad, but we picked it together
I pray for you, and you pray for me
Sincerely yours, the overweight lover, Heavy D

And now your bucks are big, and let out ya asshole
Gun smoke when the hood is broke and need the riches

Pete Rock,"One in a million (Funk for you baby) (Listen it drives you wild)

I'm one in a mil and from the Vernonville
I work it out and wait to get curled
I'm here to sell more joints than ""We Are the World""
Flows and old bros and new foes are open and closed shows
So never doze attention, the Mecca's representing
The uptown jazz sound and the chicks start mingling
Now let's watch a flick by John Singleton
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth is in the Mecca house building
Cause this funk is one in a million

One in a million (Funk for you baby)(Listen it drives you wild)

Poetic, energetic rhymes that I'm droppin on ya
Justice, must this be hotter than a sauna
You know the boy wonder Mecca Don's got the soul
The black brother's in control now it's time to roll
We kick the flavor neighbor rappers when you need a savior
We're the two man band that everybody favors
Check the resume as we sit back and parlay
I'm on the job like the mob every single say
'93 no shorts, music is my sport
The hot metal's on my waste, brother here's a taste
In your face, the bass chillin like a masked villian
Nobody better cause we one in a million

One in a million (Funk for you baby) (Listen it drives you wild)

You know the bump jump can damage your rump and dump ??? in a lump
And leap higher than a Reebok Pump
My funk style, wicked and wild and me you dial smooth as New Now
Many call this my Poetic Justice
So my fist can dismiss your hitlist here's another twist
Listen in fact I brought my cheek's kiss
Roots and our loots and Tim boots the funk is ???
Now my sound brings new recruits, hey!
Mecca raw the more I toured to get my first born
It's a boy, now my name lives on and on
Whip a jam, fully aware that I can scare a cocky new pair
Slide em and guide em to the rocking chair
Up and away I'm trying to play the classics to today
Hip-hop nonstop, collecting ghetto props
Drilling grilling holes I feel because we're here to make a killing
Cause this funk is one in a million

Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets

Yet I'm the mild, money-getting style, rolling foul

Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days, for broke days we sell it: smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesus, soaking their sins in trays
Of holy water. Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
Born in correction. All the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lamping, Big Willie-style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burning dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks with a bop, checking dames, plus the games

Ain't nutting - it's CL Smooth
Sextafied everyday; you gotta know that this live
Let's get right to it

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

Feel the vibe, when it's bumping in my tribe, steps the Goodfellas
Live on screen now you protect the black queen
Takin my time from the black on black crime
Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doing trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, living well
And never cease to flip the hottest dimepiece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slipping off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

You want a slow wind under my ceiling fan, read books
And beat me at chess, but as for rocking you, who's the best?
It's all good and correct with no disrespect
Skirt chasing hits, taking love to Digable Planets
Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop faking me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dimepieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinking totally nude with no limits
Going through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showing nothing but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from
So feel the beat in Three-Peat like Jordan got wings
Cause I'm doing them things, listen

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

At last come the goodies, every woman got a love
Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby

Welcome to the zone where the strong only survive
Places I drive all the gangsters can't stay alive
Take my universal journey through the jungles of the hardest town
Where my brothers lay their life down
You want something to play with?
Go find some toys when you mistake these grown men for little boys
More real than what is real so feel I'm sending
Compare the God with no beginning and we'll have no ending
My blessed rings are down with the kings revalation
Had heard me on the run-dmc's reincarnation
Child abuse, women loose, robbery and triple homicide
Every where this black man resides still
Check the monolouge, I'm on a 6 a.m. jog
To regain my powers, do a set before the showers
I'm prime for the summertime, the big time bowler
But any season or reason we can't take it over

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Are you ready for the legendary crazy rugged ready war?
Known to be the smooth that sat by the door
Furthermore, for you and I to click, here's the stats
Take all that dirty money, set the wash doors and laundromats
You love to gamble now we open an after-hours spot
20 Sacks with the guiness for the jackpot
Members only, playing pool like willie marconi
With a tenderoni chatting about the gs I'm batting
I'm patting down with the sound of a general
Fully supplied by my ghettofied residential
We come to rebuild and turn off the heat now
Hoping we can take it back to yugenot street
Palled around the screen tv watching the fight
Tonight, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right
Ink tents in all of my circumference I connect
Now demanding all types of respect, can you dig it?

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Traveling the warp speed we come to the peak
Like a missle I probe and seek, many can't critique
My physique is still solid, chiseled down to the very last compound
I'm trying that chin, fool, where you been?
Still sliding girls in as soon as pops fall asleep
His game tight, set to flip a shorty late night
I like rocks and groupies, condo shows and cuties
The hottest cars and the strongest drinks at the bars
This is one of those joints that make you stand by the exits
Cause every time I'm yapping something crazy happens
Keep my tool in my baggy jeans rolling with sneaker feet
Who got a life term working for the firm
My labor's fruit off of business as usual
Plus my two clan band is making me a wealthy man
Now from where I stand, believe it's not a game
Pete rock and c.l. smooth's a household name

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Pete Rock,"Let me take you on a journey through Carmel City
Where CL's God, and the ladies gotta hit me off
Ballin on the set now baby what's the matter
When all this is Hot Sex served on a platter
Enter my flow so I can hit this show with somethin rugged
It's mainly how all the honies dug it
Like every single day and, bounce around the way and
Chicks are never waiting when the bodies start marinating
We expand in player's land to unknowns
To turn my stumbling blocks, into my stepping stones
The pound Donna Karan New York down found
Where there can be no type of slacking in your macking
The whole agenda is for me to decide; the major hustle
Is God, when brothers coincide, with the bonafide
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City

C'mon ya'll

Top notch, butterscotch, lyrics hits the mode
To make the most gorgeous women wanna get nude
Your eyes stay glued, when this is popping word is bond
Wifey's gone, now I'm about to get my swerve on
Lay my clothes across the bed, cause I'm here to make a point
Plenty chips, got me balling in a hot joint
Respect the sextafied aura you could never take light
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight
My large releases got me mixing with the dimepieces
And down to rival one of Uncle L's little nieces
In my palace of pleasure, everything is done properly
And if you didn't know, you better ask somebody
Right now, the players are the power structure
Check the roly-poly, now it's time you see the brother
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City

It's freaktacular, wasn't hard to get em out the blouse
If only wifey knew, hubby got a stash house
And what moves your man got with so much emphasis
Maybe one or two many get ridiculous
So scandalous, the honey arrives with her crew
And now they're talking bout coming back without you
Yeah my boys are balling, here's the raw deal:
Come to my house, you gotta get naked for real
Indulging, my peoples said let's have a talk
About the time my lady's plane hit New York
I'm bailing off the set, heading for the crib G
Cause I'm the first thing the woman wanna see
Take a hot shower, slip on some linen
Now it's a new time, a new day, a new beginning
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City",Carmel City,1994
Pete Rock,"We go back and forth, sending this out to my people up north
Tell 'em if you ain't from New York you're soft
Box or throw rocks, fish or cut bait
Cause I fight great, but wait
Here's the hottest joint on lockdown
Ready for release what they call a masterpiece
Covers are blown, known for keeping shit lethal
Cause now I'm like water in the desert for you thirsty people
What's the fixation with all this artillery?
Now you catch a look, saying ""Who are you to question me?""
Giving sighs from enemy lines taking care of my business
Is how you found out Wayne's World was never his
See my pend holds strong for all my cookies in mink
We call all types of bitches running out of ink
Later for ticky mind, avoid like suama
But I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind

You know it's my thing, get your bell rang
By the Meccafied slang, the jack of all trades
Couldn't even gang bang, and niggas can't hang
With so many styles, you'd swear the shit was out of Wu-Tang
But the samurai, CL Smooth I
Be slicing, dicing you down when the mic is around
I rebound like Oakley when you provoke me
This is the Chocolate Thai, be careful how you toke me
I razzle dazzle your fragile ass until you pay homage
To the man I plan is holding all the knowledge
In five minutes of funk off my tounge, read the label shown
Is it Pete Rock or Oliver Stone?
Still the same, they remember my name
Kind of reminds me of when Rocket Ismail played for Notre Dame
Invincibility with no vulnerability
Selling more than gold with the killers on my payroll

You'd better watch your step, known for the rep
Of being real but can't accept jealous brothers and others
Who can't relax with pep, and if it was the playoffs
Your ass would get swept and kept on stash
The Tango & Cash competitors bow
Cause I would think we all know who The Don is by now
Making loot at the pace of a horse race
Now once again my friend, the great paperchase
Here's a taste of life in the fast lane
Now house full of chicks, he's stripping off the Don P
With the profound sound, I ride swoops like a hawk
And can only bring the essence of New York
It's the Vernonville daddy, can you comprehend?
How some real live niggas set a new trend
Of being so blasted, smoothest prophets to the brain cell
While I bid you all a farewell",Check It Out,1994
Pete Rock,"Check the verse in the Bible says man shall never covet
But in your life you put nothing above it, you seem to love it
Invest some stocks to clock what's in my stable
Sweating me like Cain sweating Abel, you're unstable
You couldn't speak, now what's the fake smile for?
The jealousy, that's why you're feeling so insecure
Used to be by my side but now all I see is pride
On the quest to make lucci, got you open wide
It feels funny, cause it never used to be that way
Remember PR back in the day?
Hey, the number's changed and the crib's a little fatter
But if you was real, you'd see it really wouldn't matter
Check the stat in fact yo, don't ever try to peep this
Don't mistake my kindness for a weakness
The name is Pete Rock, I'll take you higher than the izm
I'm on a exodus, Escapism

Yo, check it out
I like to rhyme, no time for silly head games
Strictly known for busting up your head frames
But skins bold, act like they want to know a nigga
Break they neck to show they figure
But yo, you can't gas me up, you can't hype me
Play it cool when it comes to schooling wifey
On the ways of life it's life, checks, and big money
So the next kid will be up on your honey
Sexing your honey, flexing your Benz and your money
Playing you like a crash test dummy, so take it from me
Cause when it happens don't say I never told you so
Peep the verbal lessons in the flow
And ayo, you know they style, and yeah I'm here to warn ya
Getting shaky cause I'm coming up on ya
It's Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth on a major pape mission
Rising to the top, Escapism

I'm sitting back, I got the funk on cruise
While you snooze Pete Rock is steady paying his dues
Putting styles on lock and making beats by the bundle
Scooping more props than Bryant Gumbel, and staying humble
But then you go and have to act that way
I just hit you off the other day!
But this is sick, cause here you come with your crew of derelicts
Talking about you need a pair of kicks, or this or that
You hang around cause the pockets are fat
But when I'm on ""E"" yo, you ain't trying to check for me
You got more game than rugby
You're only stressing the name now that the papes is flowing lovely
So stop searching for idealism
And check the off-beat flow of the Soul Brother with the realism
Shedding some light just like a prism
You can't wait, you can't fake it, Escapism",Escape,1994
Pete Rock,"Capture this funakthon loaded by the Mecca Don
Into the red zone, you spot my skull and crossbone alone
To fill the Watergates, slaughter great, think and meditate
Set behind the pace of the CL's war face
Cras and tints, making blueprints for over six figure salaries
Luchified, cause many did and died
The mic wrecka, study Mecca, now building
Cause I love my shorties like Jesus loved children
Cause being smooth is the science I crafted
To a state, when they incarsarate me I wanna be free
And play some D on the high-scoring thrill from the Veronville
Taking my yards with no bodyguards
My click's the first round draft pick for time in prison
So the only way to cover that is clean living
Respect given, hear the bell go ""ding""
It's like Tyson stepping back into the ring, soon as I

Ladies and gentlemen for dead presidents it represents
Now hear what it's like when I (get on the mic)
It's strike cause every Nike I wear is kicking ass there
Too dope to scare and too damn smooth to care
So flick your lighters in the air, and let me blow the roof off
The Collesseum plus I got to get per diem
All dueces file out, and leave the dimes to the front row
And when I say ""Go"" I want 'em showing lovin'
Tossing dough, cause with the daddy unemployed
And the old earth raising me, any other rugged nigga's history
No mystery, I'm physical in action
So guess relaxing is a weekend with Toni Braxton
On your TV is me, incredible MC, B
With the P to the R, my break a ways can bounce for days
This fillets, I'm trucking jewels like Eric B
And all you corny fools can't see me, oh my my my

Healthy, wealthy, and wise is your size
Come and try the hardcore, set on down by every law
Moving in your Lex trecks out a sextivity
At its highest level of funktagious served in major
He's the real Mabel, overqualified to be luchified
Pete Rock's the god when my stiz-ile profile
Slide into the Milky Way, the Carmel King's sing
We're back on crazy to put the duke up in Daisy
Amazingly, none of y'all can faze me never
Add the spice to make you shoop like Salt N Pepa
How large is he? Mastered my degree in mic surgery
With plans to retire at the tender age of 30
Jah is what I cherish, all informers must perish
On the down low, lift my peoples from the ghetto
In every borough CL is quite thorough

Feel the vibe when it's bumpin' in my tribe steps the Goodfellas
Live on screen now you protect the black queen
Takin' my time from the black on black crime
Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doin' trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, livin' well
And never cease to flip the hottest dime piece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slippin off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds

And beat me at chess, but as for rockin' you, who's the best?
It's all good and correct with no disrespect
Skirt chasin' hits, takin' love to Digable Planets
Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop fakin' me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dime pieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinkin totally nude with no limits
Goin' through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showin' nothin' but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from
So feel the beat in Three-Peat like Jordan got wings
Cause I'm doin them things, listen

At last come the goodies, every woman got a love
Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin' in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin' this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby

The broters I sparred, which only means the man got nothing to prove
On a power move made by the CL Smooth
Live 495 I arrive in person
Hard dialogue without a whole bunch of cursing
It's my perrogitive, so back up and live, fool
As long as they don't violate everything's cool, cause it's all good
Understood is the smoothest daddy with the roughest raps
Am I thinking about blowing the spot? Perhaps
Carry straps on strips for the trigger-happy pirates
Where ladies catch fits steady reaching for my privates
But hold, how I unfold my whole repotoire
Now here we are at home to make another superstar
With Rob-O and Deda with the P.R
But nevertheless it's CL Smooth

""In the flesh""

Rob-O's at the top of the list, so bust this
Stick to funk like Scotch, the top-notch vocalist
You don't stop, cause I can illustrate with the needle
Penetrating straight to the souls of many people
Is there any evil? On this path I'm innovating
Stil faking, put down your pads and stop waiting
See the year of the fly MC is here, so stand clear
I'm facing the Gods with no fear
Rob-O, East Coast, uptown
MCing the most and spreading the Mecca all around
Selecting the sound to make the party people hound

Yeah INI's representing in the flesh

KABOOM! Stepping in the sound room mellow
A dangerous flavorous fellow, hello
Style and grace, the original's in this piece
In the place right along with the pace
Nevertheless, in the flesh no quest
The sex in the system, of course I'm fresh
I rest in the Villes, the skills is big
To a level of extravagence, the talent's all balanced
The extreme dopeness for the nation
D. is the inital, MC's the occupation
Five master hype, light the color of the skin
Once the beat roll, my goal is to win
My friend the best, the real side yes
I rest my case in your face in the flesh

""In the flesh"" 

Soul Brother supreme to catch wreck in the flesh
So check one two and a mic test
Now clear the room, I scoped you with the wide angle zoom
Trying to overstand my funk tunes
Coming soon, so chill, don't stress The Creator
I'll kick the funk loop from here to Cal Tjader
And cross the fader, and pack the lines on my paper
With rhymes so tough, who got the flavor?
Plus the knack to rock, I'm steady heating up the spot

In slow motion, domes crack open like the pavement
Off some shit I made down in the basement

To lit blunts, now all agreed we're sippin OJ with the Dom P
Bounce and bring it like it counts to be Luccified
CL is sextified and women spell me nationwide
You say you want my lips where and I can grab your what?
I love your hips legs breasts faces with the firm butt
Now feel the muscle when I hustle in the bedsheets
Cause my manly treats can hit the fridge for more sweet
SPLASH, and let me do my thing til it's hot and sweaty
Reload the CamCorder, I guess by then you'll be ready

And all the real shit come in pairs, and bounce em in the house y'all

Pete Rock is in the house, CL is in the house

Back again, I'm here to win, to bust rhymes on beats again
Copycats and rugrats, sit back and watch a champion

So check the style and peace to niggas in the penile

Funkadelic for lightin up spots ever since little tots
When the dust settle I'm packin heavy metal plenty
The drop'll slaughter many, strictly off illegal entry
It's elementary Watson, I drive a Benz not a Datsun
Before my kicks hit the stage, we've been Foot Locking
Body rockin to keep the ladies flockin with a concoction
Rippin your blouse for no less than arrest in Morehouse
My teeth prints where my knife slits, we train em
And scar em like pits, off vibes of the Mecca joint
Vibe to position, never runnin out of ammunition
Now to the heart, I'm steppin with a concealed weapon
Nothing's calm when the bomb blaze you know the phrase

The armed and dangerous, the bulletproof
Couldn't stop the homicide of another youth
Penetrating your body parts with hollow point shells, you fraud
Cause vengence is mine said the lord, indeed
My own click now turns greedy
Out of twelve of my soldiers, one will decieve me
With salt in the game, shame the family and push
My black ass straight into a terrifying ambush
The whole empire's at stake
Mastering the streets, devil the mental won't break and turn snake

Submit the wanted signs posted, chickens spots for major knots you get

To the head piece, I release firepower, only I'm controlling
We put in work and got the right brothers rolling
When hell kicks off we lick off
Keeping mine hard like stone from the red zone, to each his own
Smile in my face behind my back you talk trash
But my pockets hit empty and my lexus crashed
But not in your wildest dreams
Hear my name in all the scandals and all the schemes, I rest in queens

I know you wonder what kind of way is that to think:
Put all the wackest rappers on a boat and let it sink
Don't blink; next thing you see you spot is taken
No Jax I'm Fakin' soldiers took the whole reservation
On a scale of one to ten, we move rather swiftly
Want a dimepiece but we'll settle for an eight-fifty
Don't blow mine, your trump card is exposed to pages
Now your beginning's already at the final stages
Pumpin like 12 gauges from a shotgun blast
I never saw people run so fast, aight?
Stay up all night, then sleep all day
Makin big Lucci and would have it no other way
In conjunction, with the function, as stated
Orchestrated by the Soul Brother nickel plated
Tell the judge you were foolish, and try to be lenient
Cause you never had the The Main Ingredient

The Main Ingredient
Hit the third verse off kid

This cap is peeled layin joints like a minefield
When dynamite's my rhythm this is East coast terrorism
The Vernon-ville's Mecca Don, formin Voltron tactics
Let off three verses and the crowd panics
Get em all, the kingpin of the Player's Ball
Now every tramp in your camp's going AWOL
My Lucci situation is A Daily Operation
On the strip, I refine you like Tales From the Crypt
Right here's the real shit, and all that other's counterfeit
Funk to let you know exactly what you're dealin with
P-R slash, C-L smash, love to spend cash
For proper livin, slidin up in wealthy women
Stick your hand in my pants, and grab the mic's no crime
Cause like Sisters With Voices, it's about time
For you to respect my whole foundation precisely
Be obedient, to The Main Ingredient

Yo, The Main Ingredient

Pete Rock,"You're everything that I dream about, talk about
Walk around and brag about, cause I don't give a damn about
What they say, what he say, or she say
I'm addicted like drugs to your loving, but hey
You got me strung like I'm young and it's crazy
You're making me nervous, I don't deserve this, I'm Swayze
I wish I could be but you really got a hold on me
With your sex appeal, I'm telling you how I feel, shit is real
Now I don't really want to play myself so I say to myself:
""Self get a grip and don't slip""
Cause I don't want you to think I'm some clown from out of town
I get down, I've been around, I ain't no hand-me-down
So you gotta show respect for me if you're checking for me
And don't sweat me cause I really don't want no sweat on me
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

Everybody knows you and they show you mad respect
You give me funny feelings with your million-dollar step
Never quiet is kept, honey always stayed dip
I'm thirsty for your love, sugar can I get a sip?
Well maybe just a taste in the place that make your face bend
And I would never try to kick it to your best friend
So what's the deal, what's the haps, where we at now?
Keeping it strong, moving it along, I'm here to show you how
So all I wanna know is what you really wanna do
I try to flex but sex ain't sex unless I'm sexing you
And I'll be swimming in some trim with a beachfront view
Cause all I wanna do is get next to you
Now leave your crew so we can step into my hideaway
So I can step into it right away
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

Before you sit back and think I ain't saying nothing
You need to sit back and think about what I'm saying
Now relaying, my carmel flow
So you can see the arrow fly before it leaves the bow
Slow like Cupid, taken from a mobster
At night I crack her open just like a lobster
(My CL Smooth) It's all good baby
Now you know why I'm stressed when you act shady
Sometimes you chit chat, now and then hide the cat
When all I wanna do is just flip that
But there's a side to me only you can see
Only you can so believe in your man
I want you to love me in a special way
When I come home from making lucci to parlay
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?",Searching,1994
Pete Rock,"Open Sesame, stepping through the mist, it's the specialist
Coming to box, and flooded with rocks
We'll get down for mine, the kind that makes cement feel us
Standing in the company of killers
Follow my trail as I walk through the valley of death
Left, to fear no evil, cause what I grip is legal
I'm hot like yard, the point guard of this group, on the loop
Never your right, raising all your game type tonight
Entering the level of high gear
You'd think it took a Bob Marley spliff to get here
Front to rear God of the drugs that you're hearing
While my neighbors say we need to be jailed for rackateering
Now appearing, Pete Rock and CL Smooth to the jugular
Now you got Mecca and the Soul Brother
Slightly, you might raise a hair of doubt
But if we don't rock the spot, The Sun Won't Come Out

If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

Un-chained heat, I hustle on the street or beat
To keep you on the edge of your seat, you consumer
A QB-like Boomer, the ultimate team
But if I wake up in another woman's bed, I'mma scream
I'm settin up shop pop to overthrow Castro
Chokin over Noriega's Garcia Vegas
Guess who supplies the pies and dope triples
Now she leaks ass cheeks, pearly whites and titty nipples
Would CL ever trick loot on PC?
Even if I never had sonny boy I disagree
Cut the small talk, I give more marks than a school of sharks
On attack, so keep your ass back
When it's wack you get a thumbs down, another record deal wasted
Listen man, find another occupation man
Here's the persuasion, blazin one amazin route that's all about
The Sun Won't Come Out

Yo, so check it out, with Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta Act Like You Know

If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

I rule chicks off acoustics, watchin the Knicks
We up ten, but need to stop shootin bricks
Put the jailhouse funk in under stars
Til the lines on my looseleaf, look like some metal bars
My forecast hits a megablast, and what I invent
A pack of bloodhounds could never get the scent
Payin off the beast now my bills increase
If there's a five dollar rock sold in the park I want a piece
The Sun Won't Come Out, unless the crowd start this
Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness
Cause any verse rips a total eclipse for sun rays
Anyways was the phrase back in my younger days (so check it out)
Now the God displays the attribute, dealin with heat
From the bassment, enterin the streets you meet

You know The Sun Came Out, now pass my shades

Ahh yeah 
Back again with another hit smash 
Pete Rock and CL Smooth 

We got the groove for you 
So go call your crew 
And let em know we in the house 
CL hit em off with the verses 

Never judge a book by the cover; discover the Soul Brother 
With the Mecca Don Workin' brunette to blonde 
How many Edison Con when I respond in full black 
with us havin' the Vernon Villians back to back 

Amazing grace when I face the great paperchase 
For real it's long overdue, so I don't want to talk to you 
I stroke the hell out of mademoiselle who insisted 
every night, she get her back twisted in the unlisted 

I'm livin through my son so daddy see it this way 
I want him in the NFL, his brother in the NBA 
No doubt I with a 'piece, down in Mecca, all crazy 
to the lady, none of this is make-believe 

I breathe some of the most powerful lyrics of our century 
Battle physically, conquer mentally 
Essentially, you're dealing with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, why'know, I'll take you there 

[Chorus]
C... L... what you gonna do 
You... know... you can make me Boo 
Over... and over again 
Come on, and take me there 

Control now so in the future see me callin' the shots 
From larger plots to cash to mini-bikes and open mics 
I'm blowin' up spots for knots in the millennium years 
And now I drop it on my peers, brings Tears and Fears 

And now the question manifest in my only 
My soldiers wear Versace or the army fatigue 
That brings a world of intrigue and glamor to my arsenal 
of Gods, pimps to players and layers of Deceptions 

My whole mindstate gravitate to weapon 
Makin people in the business get a misconception 
It ain't hard to the core, it ain't Sex on the Beach 
It's just another plateau the brothers have to reach 

Emphatic with non-cypher, then we were broke and misguided 
Try to gas me like Hitler once we get divided 
No question, you're dealing with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, I'll take you there 

[Chorus]

Set it so I can make em all respect my fame 
When brothers try to count all my chips in the game 
Now let me civilize your foolish acts of gunplay 
The plan of a stick man, the price in how to get away 

Chose for Negroes, the most hypnotical flows 
on the planet, another East coast track rose, God dammit 
My theme, to mainstream's the knocker 
Only time I get right as block is when my lucci's on lock 

Pretty much I'm comin through in the clutch see 
My thought is a bombshell, built to only propel 
Or is it just my style of hustle makin a mark 
To rumble the playgrounds with more danger than Jurassic Park 

It was dark, when I brought it to the light, despite 
my staff's got me takin nothin but champagne baths 
Now the aftermath's dealin with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, I'll take you there 

[Chorus] 

Just come on 
Take me right where I want to be 
Come on 
Come on to you and me 

Come on 
Ohhh 

Keep doin' it baby 
Check it out, bust it 

[Chorus: x2]",Take You There,1994
Pete Rock,"Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

There she lays, never the nonsense
The mood to watch her focus on and
Slide so she can ride the man who's born to be sextified
Study my flicks if only chicks knew the mix for better brands
When power lands the sister had other plans
The plot is set for her to wed giver her dad's permission
To marry the next boss in line in his position
Overprotective, the objective is never to leave her
Taking street, who pack the heat, now meet the Black Caesar
Bought her diamonds and furs, silky jammies isn't hers
But deep down I think a simple man she prefers
Every kiss was a death wish, every plan was a let down
Stopping in tears she pulls over by the playground
Clearing her vision, spots a game through the schoolyard fence
Sneakers squeeking, ball bouncing, looking so intense
And since her hobby was photography with nothing to do
Cool, she takes a flick or two

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

A couple of weeks go by, clocking the boys around the town
Her mommy shopping, daddy dealing, leaving night all time around
For her to execute her a level to break the family ties
To gamble her future on the love, murder, money, and lies
Watch out, the woman's about to love and claim her king
So she drove up in the ghetto looking to do her thing
Checking the brothers going crazy when the car skirts by the flow
I keep it real and peep it all from my window
So please, the lady's heading upstairs the first door
The second deliver my clothes, the third, run my tub water
Every way she represented made sense to me
When black is out of state, building spots, making lucci
The wind blows the candles, now the moon shines on my chest
But nevertheless I gently rest my head on her breast
But danger lurks in the wings based on how the cards read 'em
I think she'd better tell 'em

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

The blackest of the seeds to dawn stepping with two briefcases
Son you bless your people when you conquer like Hannibal
When I was about your age, I ran the numbers for money
I'm picturing him and John Gotti hanging in the study
I grew to be large in Crooklyn with your daddy back in the day
We were ready to take Harlem before he passed away
Women and booze, the weapon I choose then was truly major
I'm ringside with Don King when Ali fought Frazier
Scars and metals, when the mob settles I was flexing
My daughter was born so I called the X for some direction
Your father's words are like the Bible to black
But beware, he came barging in your room and you wasn't there
You let your mind wander, taste and face the search party
Left the grounds fully loaded with the tre pound
Then come in deep on the creep to find you and me
Cause you can't stop destiny

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real",Tell Me,1994
Pete Rock,"Who keeps it methods and orthodox, who caught the props
Who's styles are shit, who's gonna rock?
On to the break of dawn, you wanna battle, pay the price
Mathematically precise, smooth and plus nice
With a flow that's like a mailman or letter carrier
Rob-O brings the ghetto area
Funk flavor through your neighborhood, state, town, or borough
Stay down, I don't think I'm quite thorough
Not your average rapper (Listen)
Cause in a sec I write some shit to blast your wack ass to Mecca
See Rob's the most Mecca
To grab the microphone and yes y'all it
To school these dreds and stress these bald heads
The INI's in the house (You don't stop)
Pete Rock, Grap Luva, Mark, and Polo rising and you don't stop
We let the funk slide and let God be our guide
Flowing from the Vernon worldwide

It's the funk god, taking you worldwide, so bust it
Flowing over beats cause it's a must, kid
That I proceed to fix the hardcore in the mix
Check one two with the flow that fits
I make the hits that soar, I put the wreck in the raw
'94 in your local record store
It's Pete Rock and CL, the Main Ingredient
Now leave your wack style home, cause you won't be needing it
I grab the mic and get wreck for real
You hear me on the wax, kid, you see me on the steel
Can you feel the funk as I inject?
Then God protect it, hold the mic, see I select it
To keep it crazy versatile
But still underground, packs the four pound cause it's wild
In this place you'll find it hard to hide
Soul Brother and I'm going worldwide

Now who's the greatest? Few debate this, you're still figuring?
Well perish the thought, there's none bigger in
This act son, Mecca is all I attract
You're wack, son, yeah your talent's a fraction
While I'm nice, as Christ, there's two religions
So envision a messiah on a mission, the competition
I'll stop your wishing point blank cause you lost it
Your joint sank, your soft style's exhausted
And now it's mandatory, you stand before me amazed and awed
Giving praise, you're the God
Rob cipher's born, most Mecca supreme
A fly MC with the self-esteem
You keep it wholesome and still I relax a bit
I play your shit out like ??? cause my wig out has to hit
I'm steadily encouraging head bops while you're scurrying to get props
I'm worldwide

Yo, check out the rhyme buster, pulling niggas through the wringer
I'm not a singer, as I conduct with one finger
It's the orchestrater, mutilator, master funktator
I've got mad flow from here to Asia
Cause I'll amaze ya with the skills that I possess
Not categorized with all the rest

You might break a hip

As I provide the slide
You`re going on a ride
I know the weather`s nice

There`s no need to play the outside

I save this subject for later
But, it`s time to catch wreck with the creator

I`m addicted like a stoag
Not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there`s a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold `cause I`m busy kickin` rhymes to the rhythm

Fortified with soul `cause that`s what I give `em
Honeys form a line form a line `cause I always seem to capure
Beats made of rupture
Rhymes made of rapture

Far from illiterate
Always seem to get a hit

Don`t even consider it

Skins when I want `em
But, only when I eat `em
To set the record straight, I`ll be damned if eat `em

Just a crowd motivator

Now, I`m`a take a try
And get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec
To get some wreck

Never filled with anger
A good body banger
If you try to step to this you`ll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye

Suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can`t see this
My word is beneficial
Pete Rock is the issue

And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch
(Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse

(No question)
Either one, I can`t be seen
Honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around

I`ll show you what I mean

I rap lyrical, always on da humble and sometimes I`m spiritual
Hands down accept any mans challenge
I strive and keep the competition off balance
Da fruits of my talent is this it`s simple
I drop science on the instrumental
I take seven ill drums put `em in a line
And add seven more snares to make it combine
It`ll take seven more horns before I start to rhyme
Now that twenty-one beats made up at the same time
I was bound ta shine haters get left behind
Ain`t no time for them, stamp my name on rap
Perhaps you hear da words from pay next sequel
Part two something for tha people

Now I appear return ten years the pioneer
Deliver action thrillers that explode in ya ear
Compensate for all the ups and downs in my career

Magnificent ya style is irrelevant
I`ll flip the bass and erase any trace of sample evidence
Trust a few men within this circle of thieves
Single out the enemy with ease
Earned every stripe on my sleeve
The five star general keep it moving ya rap needs improvement
So here`s a lesson ta learn, lyrics under fire burn third degree
And my steez is making hot tracks for G`s

Let my words express move men like chess
My mic will stand erect like projects
It's drastic top draft pick in this rap shit
You just a fraction caught up in tha midst of action

My catalog is current events breath the contents
What I move crowds for local events the show stopper

Yo it's the Capital P book rhymes of the century
Speak rap line essentially on tha M I see

My competitors and clients worldwide as my words coincide

With real life think twice transmit like true lies
It's televised take my manuscripts out of context
Who want next situation is complex
Stop the nonsense it's 98 time to set the record straight

Separate movers and shakers from those that hesitate
Ya featherweight name carry weight in every state
Ya name brand no frills niggaz is marinate

It's Pete Rock new world innovator
Crush imitators five years since the creator
It's nuff said as I paint the town red and move ahead

Pete Rock,"From the basics and warm, weather places
Dedicated to the brothers that never made it
Cut short, they prime read life between the lines
Photographed by rhymes yo it's hard times
All across the nation cold points of frustration
Created hot joints of illustration
Concentrate while stakes are high falling victim to the lie
Keep a sharp eye there's a steady supply of hate in the air
To them cats who stare the ice grill with the glare
But everything is fair in the city the sheisty the shiftee
I'n the epitomee of a raw deal now carry a sword and shield
And walk with a forcefield for real I overcame the odds
And got the hell out of dodge soul survivor of the war
And master in charge

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But my true and real live nigga keep on risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

I watched the whole world from the side of my eye
I seen a lot of cats die and evil men lie
On the road to riches in pursuit of my wishes
It's a close call between friends and snitches
On the low the game brought moments of pain
Strong emotions plus the hardships of fame
No need to live forever just keep some type of cheddar
A buttersoft leather to rock in cold weather
Times are mad real official like the seal
Try to understand what I feel
My word to the wise it's where ya heart lies
Keep your biz straight far from family ties
I'm the illest soldier that represents the culture
Dignified bywords like fresh, fly and ultra
Champion heroics and passionate poets
Flashback to the future let it self focus

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But beautiful black sisters keep risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

Still in basement for four years arranging
Lyrics and beats my first lote engagement
It's outstanding the boy wonder's back in the world
By popular demanding on top commanding
My own destiny go ahead try to test me
I been living right so expect no less g
Got positive reaction and affirmative action
The soul survivor guaranteed satisfaction

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But my true and real live people keep on risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

And if I die before I wake I pray go God my soul to take
My crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die before I wake I pray to God my soul to take
My crew knows what to do they're soul surviving

Sunrise, starts the day
Lay back, ease your pain
Don't sweat, simple things
Take your time, do your thing

As grains of sand pass from hand to hand
I watch time stand still I'm just one man
That's out for all so all should be for one
Grew up on the drum with the j.b. unh!
The son, who spun the record that his pop's collected
Went on to create and perfect the unexpected
Funky beat sound watch the family get down!
Slide with the right and give cousin a pound
Watch the young ones play and think back in the day
When fresh was the style, plus the word to say
It's all love now, let me show you how
To take time out, and show you what life's about

Savagely attack this, clash with, accurate aim
Spark the flame, burn this inside the vein
Ride tracks like the soul train, hold ya brain
In the state of shock, make em drop hits of cocaine
I bang with the big boys, those who hold name
Amateurs get hung with they own gold chains
I swing blades, best bring grenades against
A tru master, way beyond your freshman attempts
Spit rounds on the floor, evidence of the war
It's on til the death til we settle the score
You can never measure, to the standard, of the most

Pop corks while the style knock your tops off
Ghetto summer jam's got the streets blocked off
Plots to knock me off get stopped short
Armed with my thoughts, move the world with an unknown force

Collaborate, break bread with kurupt and deck
Keep my feet blessed, fresh with the scottie pippen's
In the game of life, I play all positions
Stop look and listen, total package, yes a true master
Produce rhymes, slang hits faster

Paint the masterpiece that lies inside the frame

Death with the intellect from wizards to warlocks

More ways to get paid, more ways to display
More rhymes to say, more ak's to spray
God is good growin up in the hood
Done some things bad, done some things good
Me and pete is like rhymes to chemicals, clash
Atom bombs to mustard gas
We intervene, I break ya, take ya to a whole difference scene

Got em jumpin like I swallowed a gang of jumpin beans
Explode and reload, we dumps machines

 As a ten then again she was probably an eight 
 Her ass was kinda phat so she moved me yo 
 When I scoped out her mental was straight said let's roll 
 Stared this shorty everynight and everyday 
 On the rebound around left right and hey 
 I'm a critical brother when it comes down to broads 
 But this wop here is like the Grammy Awards 
 Had style and grace and class a lot of taste 
 On a slow dance we romance around my place 
 Like a king from queens is how she made me feel 
 And if I did dirt it was locked and sealed 
 No doubt was all about me and my love thing 
 If the phone called Paul I was lettin it ring 
 Absolutely, she looped me the hook was good 
 Niggaz buggin on me buggin in my neighbor hood 
 Yeah boss, but on course is my game plan and 
 Shorty wop keep me chillin with the name brand 
 Kicks and whips, going all out chicks, flicks and tours 
 Yeah you know who you is kid truly yours 
 This I dedicate to the mixtapes I hate 
 Exclusive shit it really holds no weight 
 Put ya skills on the plate backspin to eighty-eight 
 Now this I dedicate to a girl I hate 
 Try to post fly with ya Mabeline eye 
 Sportin DKNY working on ya alibi 
 Imitation at best Miss American Express 
 Dismiss the charge, cool G Rap and Large Pro 
 Here to let you know were not the mens 
 I'm through with you but still talk ta ya friends 
 Don't stop to say hi or even reply 
 The position is filled with fresh new material 
 Keep ya head up, catch some black cat luck 
 Sped off in my truck not givin a fuck 
 Lookin At My Front Door, it's locked and closed 
 So I use the window for all you ninety-eight hoes 
 Ave yo go head hood rat 
 I can't see where ya any good at 
 Put that trash back on tha rack 
 You a put back a stripper 
 Just like a chicken peckin wherever wood at 
 You sewer rat better be careful where you step ya foot at 
 You might get snapped, caught in the trap 
 Sneekin bout a cheese stack so sewer that and ease back 
 You fleece that it's G Rap many cats want to be that 
 Better believe that iced up, find me where it's below zero degrees at 
 Skis at see the G stack puffin on scarface and Garcia Vegas 
 G Rap and Pete Rock we bond papers 
 Both of us together we bomb makers bottles of Dom breakers 
 Many mansions on farm acres pushin porches with four doors 
 Diamonds with no flaws with the pretty mamas 
 on beaches of Bahama shores 
 Pinky ring is like a stone age without the dinosaurs

When correcting my errors the first shot came in 91
E.P. done my struggle
To label is untouchable foundation due in 92, top ten review

Still riding with CD's and leather, roll fives and better
For all that's folded in ya pocket, how long it take
To re-up and clock it, drop and make a profit
And lay my position with you that we know what to do
And not to do, stop this fighting each other
God knowledge ya wiz, that you know who the enemy is, furthermore
Don't hide it divide it then X ya squares
To keep them other cats folded like beach chairs
Got an eye on that street aristocrat
Let C.L. show ya where the strengths at
Turn it up right here or just call the cop
'Cause we on it like this to the last stop

Like a jeweler wit a diamond cutter, taking 'em apart

Fully backed by bullies who be peelin caps

Rocked Adidas but he had no stripes 
I could tell in high school that he had no fights 
Hold dick better than he hold mics, he spiked his punchlines 
with current events, called for backup 
like one time when he heard it was Sense 
that deliver words with intents to kill 
Whether the hip-hop type, country rapper, or big wheel 
I peeled some raps back, that peeled his cap back

Track shit and when you hear it man I don't know how to act, shit

It's like the first related verse and now we rock with the beat
Just another causality for S and the V
It's like action is what we give and receive
Best do believe we got some shit up our sleeves
Shit to dance to, some shit to the trees
Some shit if you dyin' and they help you breathe
Make a handicap nigga exceed with speed
It's like totally with Toronto to V
Doin this for DET in the place to be
Can't forget the rest R,O,I, and T
Mac Nicholas baby, what else could it be?
Please, lace me with a scratch for the beat

In the beginning, it was the S, never no name shit
Motherfuckers traveled for miles to Mac Nick
We kick rhymes we know they never sound like yours
To the mic lookin' like cheap thoughts
Fuck this rap shit, I'm too smart for that
I do this shit for kicks with my crew, believe that
The S is on the way to makin' emcees quick
I shoot the kinda rhymes to make the emcees duck
On the mic I never fight I call an angel of war
Slice an emcee with my palm, a lyrical sword
You really want a bottle? You must be ill

Well it's the S, numero uno, I'm in your favorite
The negroes make the music that you run out to get
Now this is love at the less, new bomb shit
Mac Nicholas is earnin' money on some burner shit

Yo
Just when I think that I've forgot you
I hear that thug that we used to rock to
Just When I think I'm gettin' on without you
Somebody Passed and asked me about you

Was in the back of the cab the other day
Swear to God I saw you walking passed the other way
My heart rushed, my face flushed
Tell the driver hit the breaks slow the pace up
Wait up, It wasn't you
Realized it's a mirage I was running to
Damn, can the affects of Love and time
Cause the mind to trick the eye?
I wonder how you gettin' by
And all the stars still in your eyes
But you still just get the five
You break the bank to spend the time
I reminisce of shifting time, to when you was mine

[Bilal]
Years ago, in a mist of hallways and sliding doors
Missing links of family very obscure
Vision of you shine
But only for a short time
My mistake I didn't pick up on it till years down the
Line

Here now as I (reminisce) reminisce, will I ever see
Your face again?
(In-fect-ion)
Baby as I lay back (reminisce) will I ever see your
Face again.

Hold still (uh)
The divine has placed us
In a small world (yes)
And thankfully so (Thank God)
Our paths cross once more
And to whose surprise but mine
Was 14th and 6th was the placed where we combine once
More
There at the front door of the cornor store you stood.

I reminisce Infection

As I lay back (reminisce) will I ever see our face
Again

Yes Sir
Yo I reminisce over this chick
Colder than a soda
Princess a soldier
Raised in Islamic culture
Sexy as the girl on the Jamaica poster
Men are over seas where there really don't be no
Sistas
Brought her on stage as Bilal sang ""Soul Sista""
In body parts the blood was thicker
Sweet only tryna make sure it ain't the liquor
She was with a nigga come to find out
She and Sista backstage, conversation kissed her
Made me forget to remember that I pimp the dime
Put the pimpin' aside I see Kenya in her eye
Our connection lies in a life before
For us to meet again was devine law
So I can't describe how deep I dug her
Now only in memory can I hug her
I reminisce why'all

""Sucka MC's please think twice"" -> Special Ed - Think About It

[Verse 1: Grap Luva]
Who'll be the sucka MC to get dismantled
I hope that you can handle your whipness or sees ya flippin gettin
Down with my lazy boy laidback style of speak
The funk makes you dance cheek to cheek
I be the black civilian who is bound to make a million
Or make enough loot so I can buy my own provillian
Throw a fat party and invite everybody
And play all the old school hits like Lodi Dodi
Connections like OPEC while ya hung up like a Kojak
I'm real like a ruby while ya fake like a pinchback
That's imitation gold if you didn't know
My rhymes flow as my vocab' grows and grows
I freak it for the basslines always walkin on ya frontline
Catch me while I'm boomin' in ya alkine
Yo I'm out like a shot from a tec
You need to think twice just to earn respect, so

[Chorus: Pete Rock](5X)
""Sucka MC's please think twice
You don't know what you doin'
Think about that"" 	-> Special Ed - Think About It

[Verse 2: Pete Rock]
Aiiyo, as I come through for '95 with the flav'
So amazin' the Boy Wonder's blazin'
Respect the mic check, one, two
Cause I display the funk material as I stand imperial
To others, gotta lay low, undercover
Cats flow to the hands for the crowd in the stands
So here I am, plus I rock to please the public
They want it, word son, they want it
To hear the Soul Brother disperse words of wisdom
When InI comin' direct on the set
So represent, a lot of rap niggaz came to win
But the style played out when they chose a different route
Whatever as I stay true to the game
Word to the troubled T-Roy you know my name
Keep an eye on the stakes as I watch my back
Think Twice before you try to grab the mic and react

[Chorus](5X)
[Verse 3: Rob-O]
Yo beg your pardon...
Whn I put one to the head now the funk shit startin'
Fine soul I headline for my public get mine
Yeah my rap subjects packed with potential
Plus the versatile elements to crush ya scent
I get down so cheer the mental
Rhyme-pro I'm Rob-O the super spectacular brown skin nigga from Africa
Blowin' up so it's impossible to get
With the highlight and fly right and the niggaz on my dick
Split when it's through, gotta skip with the Guinness Crew
Give a shout out to my Uptown Crew, word up
From New York, New York the Big Apple
To the four square miles Uptown armed for battle
Your niggaz is nice but my advice is you can't suffice
So Think Twice, uhh

Pete Rock,"I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
22 years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 years younger than my mama
But I really got beatings cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one’s a girl, let’s name her pam
Same father as the first but you don’t give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won’t down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma’s gettin' married in the house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother queen’s risin' a chapter
Deja vu, tell you what I’m gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my god

When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand poppa doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn’t bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I’m clocking pop’s liver
But you can never say that his life is through
5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
Never been senile, that’s where you’re wrong
But give the man a taste and he’s gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don’t wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he’s taking over
I said pop maybe when you’re older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good god, almighty
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of wayback, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the r-uh-o-y, how did you and I meet?
In front of big lou’s, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes in any weather
My grandmom pam holds the family together
My uncle doc’s the greatest better yet the latest
If we’re talking about a car, uncle sterling got the latest
I strive to be live ’cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my aunt joyce
So pete rock hit me, nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that’s word is bond
I’m not playin
Everybody, just coolin
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another

First of all, you better count your blessings
When you got C.L. now you got bad boy, your connections
In return, while we live and we learn then you know what it is
To only build a bigger future for the kids

In peace, in war, let's take it to the floor
Every time we take two steps the crowd takes four
Lay the heat, how I come to the street, how I cut through the beef
Let me handle that, that's why you make me chief

It's packed, what they want in this here
Can we weather the storm, six minutes, C.L. Smooth you're on
All the anger and the fear was in the dressing room prayer
That we came out to light it up and put it in the air

That's real, so holler back at ya boy, step aside Leroy

The security is tight and the secretary is gorgeous

That's official, me and Pete in the lab, that's what they want
Pushin' that real hip hop up to the front
The game's been good to me, preserved my youth
Not only did it capture my goals and told me the truth

Look out my hustle, made a living, paid and driven
See why they tour around the world came to save us from prison
It's great, I rather love than hate
You think it fell out the sky, I'm here to tell you, why believe in faith

And when pop passed, two weeks later I cried
And when great grandma left it all went crazy now
All I had left was grandma Pam, that's my baby

Can't talk bad about me, she tell 'em why we need to give her
All those roses while she could smell 'em
I live this moment used to stay how we was
How my mother came to her in a dream and told her

Corey will come out of this deep dark depression, stand by me
Give my insight a resurrection and heal me
And feel me, what you got is to love, got a thing
This little woman who brought back the thug, let's grind

Ghetto's of the mind while I'm in my prime

Word to my cousin, the truth and no lie
Me and my dawg was in his brand new Land, puffin' on lye
Tameka came by, glossy-eyed as she cried
Lil' Jay got sprayed with a chrome four-five

That's my motherfuckin' man, get in the Land
Head to the rest, grab vests, switch whips to the Caravan
I heard an ambulance right up the block
Plus more shots, the shit's gettin' hot, pull up and park

By the back, pass the gat, hit the lights and lay back
Hold up, now roll up, yo where them niggaz at?
I know one of them cats from the projects with Jay
The first nigga move, I'ma pull this gun, spray

No delay, we stay night to fuckin' dawn
It's on, my head spinnin', feelin' my cheeks get warm
Tears drip as I stepped out the whip
Slipped a clip, had to get hit, uh-uh that's that bullshit

Bullet laced as he laid, chokin' up blood with no aid
Made money for the purpose of his daughter
Victim of an unmerciful slaughter, explain harder

Or don't bother, I'ma heat yo' ass like lava
Identified was that tinted gray Chevy Impala
Fleein' the scene, as the back tires screamed
Now for them my man [Incomprehensible], ruined his whole dream

Of playin' ball pro, bitch that's how it go
You let me know, I'll hit your whole fuckin' team with the metal
Mental struggle got my hand under the bubble
Tryin' to blow steam and leave the scene blood puddles

Snakes, whattup nigga? These niggaz ain't explainin'
Well, fuck it then, it's time for some gestratin'
Hit him in the worthless shell he came in
Murder is a sin, but it's worse him dyin' on revenge and I ain't havin' it

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

I ain't havin' it, reached in the bubble and grabbed it
Automatic cocked back and squeezed through his Polo fabric
Nigga duckin' and runnin', irrationally gunnin'
Thinkin' to myself, do I gotta hit someone

Then I heard shots from a back route
Fired back out, got shot, dropped and blacked out
Put in a clap out, didn't map out or act out the plans
Now I'm consciously layin' while bullets is sprayin' the Caravan

We can't lose, I hear shotguns then 22's
Left arm booze, or blood soaked through my Adidas shoes
Heavy breathin', a lot of bleedin'
Bitches screamin', put over on my good shoulder, started squeezin'

Out the back window, she gave the wrong info
Suddenly crashed into a Pinto
Hopped out, flew through the back yard, word to God
It's on and I felt the gat slip through my palm

Kept runnin', hopped the fence, hopin' that I didn't leave prints
Spotted a black Ac' parked with dark tints
Broke the passenger's side, hotwired the wide and slide
Another unsolved homicide

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

Between examining rhymes, without severing my family ties

Groupies skipping pills with ill plans of fucking you
A high price for fame that's non-refundable
All in the hopes of one day coming out with a ""W""
I know it sound crazy right?

Everybody made jams '93 and before

Lost my mind but I knew exactly what to work towards

Pete Rock,"[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
You're beautiful, the way you wear that, share that
Have many ladies, but nothing can compare to that smile
That style that drives men wild
That ring could have Big Daddy walkin' down the isle
Proper you a show stopper, girl endure dropper
I can see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama
What you lookin at is pure bred stallion
I'm slayin' it you really care to know whose jay in it
Oh how lucky are we catch you comin' out the shower
And I'm right there to wipe down your body
Spread that scented lotion all around your curves
Anything you want, all she deserves
Baby calm your nerves make this work
Only thing in life you fear is being hurt
Here to protect thought otherwise
I'm here to correct you can trust me

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
You and I now that's a hot couple
When it's off in the same club
Now you askin' for nothing but trouble
Watch you jumpin' at the Red Labels
Got my woman and her girlfriends dancin' on the tables
Shut down the joint, me I'm just laidback and all
Surrounded by the gangsters puffin' on the cigar
Badder chick in the world keep niggaz cranked
Yes the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga ranked
The question is can you top that homie
You can probably pull something close but stop that homie
Not even, could have that even if I stopped breathin'
Don't hope for that my ghost will be pokin' the steel
Read my will my boys get it all no gimmicks
But I'm here to let you know my jump off is off limits
Life and love get made for a thug
Once I settled in you made me a gentleman

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Tot game is crazy diamonds off the lettle
Travel through these ghettos drop to top
Let 'em see what I'm workin' with came to win
How the don keeps the fun to blow in the wind
World war is magnetic that attracts loot
She look Wall Street briefcase, pen strife suit
The hair rub in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
They say a woman's never satisfied
Till she have me to fill it to her heart's content
It's my blessing, God gave you to me
And words can't describe, what you do for me
Your C.L. is, love me or love me not
But no-one can match this chemistry we got
Why they all fall, you C.L.'s wive
Cause all we got is eachother a bond for life",It's a Love Thing,2004

E'ry day, spend superstar rapper bucks
Go to the dealer, cop trucks after trucks
High as a kite, rollin' dutch after dutch
Honey leavin' the scene with me
Now she wanna get a room, but at one nineteen with me
Lowrider jeans, fanny pokin' out the pants
Do the snake, the wop and the uh-oh dance, ohh!

Wide door knockers with the rings in they noses

I start checkin' my peep mo'
I come from Harlem, the home of the hustler negroes
Like, R.P., Alpo
Jim Ice, Nicky Barnes, and my nigga Bumpy John
All I need is a pair of my Pro*Keds
Half moon part and a two-wheel moped
Quarter water, Jimmy Chu's for my honey
It's the Postaboy, Winning Team, good money

I said throw yo' lighters in the motherfuckin' urr
The roof on fire and not a muh'fucker curr
There's so many bunnies and I'm seein' over her

Hey! I'm mean mixin' my two-step

Goin up in four months, need at least a buck
The way I rock ice you would think my name was Peter
Bitches tongues out like back in the day in the theatres (woo!)
And the heaters is kept where they supposed ta
Smoke ya like the welcome poster
And Dilla got killers that'll gat your boy like Reese's pop
Keep knots like a crumb snatcher boy
When these two niggaz collab', these niggaz collapse
Cause see it gets no hotter, holla at'cha boy

Yeah, I spit fire at that ass
Many often wonder will hip-hop still last
Cause I'm the one they call the Boy Wonder
Fuckin with J-Dilla, rappin niggaz, know how I feel-a

Yo, this is not child's play
Similar to a gat when my mind spray
I spit rhymes like a pro son, rappin shogun
I lunge at you niggaz with a bolo punch
It's the, Boy Wonder at the cruise control
Are you really ready for some super dynamite SOUL
Relax, let me spark the L
And leave smoke on the track as the tires peel
When I rock what's real niggaz appeal to that
13 in the game, makin classic rap
And stay elusive, a lot of y'all fake-ass niggaz
Wish you can do this, passion from the heart makes you true in this
Music, number one sound, overground
Make haste on the freeway like the Greyhound
And avoid these clowns and let real niggaz know

Linked up with the grand master of the beats, P'Rrrah
It's the Pete Rock, why-yeah, NY to T Dot
C'mon - yeah, raisin my fist
Is like the bat sign, bringin out lyricists
I attract heat, I be the under overground
Microphone magician, subteranean, unindentified
Sky-toucher, maneuver the machines
And rip apart MC's and hang 'em from the seams (yeah)
Large nigga seem scary, out in the hood
Shootin tic-tac-toe in your Burberry
For generations, a cold verse killer's been chillin out
Waitin in the cut, spillin out
Hot shit, yeah they feelin me now, cause I linked with Pete
The best at it since Nas and ""Illmatic""
Respect is automatic, got it, well hold it
A lot of MC's will need it to pay they rent, sewed it
And eventually fold it (uh-huh) check my resume
I'm like H&R Block when I rock
Y'all niggaz get the greatest return, plus a 3rd degree burn
When I earn airtime like H. Stern
Kardinal's like a 20 carat diamond
Up in the rough dust, New York check the shinin
I'm intertwinin, line for line combinin
With Mr. Rock rhymin, flowin on time and
Stop your whinin, y'all couldn't let go
Since I flowed over the remix of ""Grindin'""

Still the nigga to get up in it, rip the place down
Rock a wife beater, show off my belly when I'm ready
The type to drive around on bootleg Pirellis
MC's gettin stuck like clubgoers in Chi-Town
Rip any prick from Brixton to my town
The T Dot, yeah you know me
Bringin back the bad bwoy style, yeah ya owe me
Gun finger in da air, shootin blanks

Massacre masses of MC's on mixtapes (yup)
Street cats get taken out with street raps
Live from the streets where peeps meet to see a weak nigga see defeat
Why'know, take a week to look back
And reflect on how you can't spit when Kardinal speak
Unique like o-ccasional crackheads
Monster talk to settin off a gourmet verse like rice pilaf

Save the petty black trash talkin for Ricky Lake

Skinz? Yeah the skinz, you know, girls
Fine women
Skinz, listen listen to my man

[CL Smooth]
I hear it callin never stallin hit the skinz bed or shelter
Love to tap her on the shoulder, roll her over, then I belt her
Leave a bite when the joint is tight, lovely when it`s loose
Produce the proper juice, plus I never hump a deuce
Give me the head on the waterbed, play you like a Pro Ked
Slide the flavors on the sled, listen to what he said
Come and lie on the bearskin, notice how the firm make him grin
Cover the checks and then I go cash em in
Hold the zipper, unlock, and grab the whole bag of treats
Hear the hooker slam the butcher with the biggest stack of meats
Take two hands to hold it, flip it out and unroll it
If you spot a brother larger then the next man stole it
Oochie coo now, you know the Mecca want to bang bang
Beggin a pardon as I knock a new skinz stank thang

Speakin on the wins, I`m about to hit the skinz

I take precaution, before I slide up in the slit
Man (fuck) that I put aluminum foil on my (dick)
Cause if you catch it, boy that (shit)`ll kick you quick
Better yet, you can pass me a Ziplock
A bag of boom, and a 40 then some boot knock
I get stiff and it`s hard like Charles Bronson
It`s kinda (fucked) up what happened to Magic Johnson
But anyway, you know the resume
Time to drop the Girbauds and parlay, HEY
I rock the world over big botty girls
Won`t hit the skinz if she gotta jheri curl
cause when I jump into my thing I make the bedspring sing
And you can ask my old fling, who`s the bedroom king?
Hit the skinz hard, she`ll hang on to the bedpost
Then I drop my load, then get up and make some french toast
Run and get the paper and it won`t be the Post
After that you know the flavor I`m ghost!

[Pete Rock]
That`s right, be out..
Hit it off.. on the skinz

[Cl Smooth]
C`mon, with the funky flavors
Uhh, gonna hit this off right quick

Hit the skinz they`re forever wins, cozy like my Timbs and brims
but never heard a bigger limb around the rim
Set to hurdle when I pop a girdle, sum it up surgical
Lay down the pubic and the stuff won`t curdle
I got the remedy for competition of any
sleepin with the enemy who never got a pretty penny
Skinz I`m with, check the lower lipped pal of mine
Now you know the Pete Rock, skinz all the time

[Pete Rock]
Oh Pete Rock, raw as I ever been
Give me room so I can speak about the skinz
Take a tidbit, but God (damnit) can you dig it
Sisters play me close and they want my beeper digits
cause I love em undercover, the Chocolate Boy Wonder
Break like an earthquake, boomin like thunder
til the honey dip the blouse, slip in the house
Sip the Stout, rip the boots, and I`m out

[CL Smooth]
Like the Isley`s, apply these, in-Between the Sheets
Follow yes another trail as if I had on cleats
Rip my way through a negligee, park it like a valet
Sure it`s OK, just met the skinz yesterday
Tap the baggy drawers, lay the laws, lovely puff it up
For the ride, honey buckle up, smearin all your makeup
CL can wreck it well a bombshell finishin
So get the tunnel vision on how I hit the skinz

How I hit the skinz, uhh

Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was meeca, and it went this way
Wrecka lecka mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts, wearing Godfather hats
It's okay to parlay to fortee better
Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather
Swing another Rodney King thing in our right
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake, 'cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Becon, now your dumb ass is leakin'
C.L. and Run DMC so rush it
Big time way before Hammer got to touch it
Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma, no shoelaces
And I'm

I'm takin' the tours, I'm wreckin' the land
I keep it hardcore because it's dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not mean for a hoe like a slow jam, check it
Sucka emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be
The microphone is granted when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society
I rages on the stages with a tune of verse
I get praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw, my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw

On one side I hear somethin', 
And on the other side I hear some other shit

It feel like fire (fire) Shut up in your bones
What's this devilish shit you on?
(It's like the body of a vampire, you nocturnal, you don't tire)
Only move around in the dark
The light burns your skin you have no heart
(They call me Mr. Sinister, arch angel, Lucifer)
I'm a son to the anarchy
I'll show you the way if you follow me
(And I come in many shapes, the message I spread to you, is hate!)
And I'm a catch you a homicide
They killed your cousin in your face and you 'gon' let it slide?!

Now do it just how we planned
(Get right up on him and blam!)
You can do it from the front or behind
(But I wanna see a nigga lose his mind)
And don't worry 'bout the police
(That's just one less nigga on the streets)
And now this block is yours
(His girl is yours!) The world is yours!
(I'm just a voice in ya head)
A figment of your imagination instead
(And I spoke to the best of them, got a long list
And I ain't get to the rest of them)
(And not yet, how much you wanna bet,
I make you go postal shootout your projects)
(Or you whole school, you a young fool, 
And don't nobody love you like I do)

I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!

My child! I have a place you could rest
And take the stress off your chest
Just sell me your soul and we go
To the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
I make you rich (Celebrity overnight)
Fuck bitches (Sell drugs) Live your life
(Don't need to worry 'bout nothin'!)
Keep on gunnin', keep on hustlin'
(Plus I know how to make it pop)
Oh you a hot boy? I know you like it hot
(So give a nigga up, go 'head, wear a wire set a nigga up)
(And all your care about is Benji's)
Triflin' you don't feed the hood, you stingy!
(And it's just a dream and it don't seem right)

Pete Rock,"And it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of (I remember your face, I remember your ways)

I remember you now
Part of my existence
I remember your face
You came here and got me
All in a day
Yeah, all in a day
I remember your lips
Do you remember the taste
Remember family names
Your child, my child, our child
Whitley and Dwayne
Different turn my world now
Remember the waist
You gripped my hips so tight now
Slow at the pace, made me erase
Don't remember my waist

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of (I remember your face, I remember your ways)

How could I forget
A ballad was born upon a demo of a fly love song
Didn't take long before the archer with the wings heard it
Shot us in the heart with a contract, he knew we were a hit
The right amount of soul with a parallell amount of grit
But the archer couldn't see the target of depature
Gave you a pink slip and called it quits
It's understood you would
Label me the mate who wronged you, cause I kept wanting a feature
With them other females on they songs too
The words spoken in mono for monogomy
Telling me I have to go because I chose stereo for stereo 
Typical male biology
And now I'm left setting traps for you to fall in
For me again but with haste you tell me
To slow up the pace, make me erase
Don't remember my waste

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of

Our last trip to Vegas had me feeling like we had a chance
But chance showed up at the wedding
I guess I didn't read the heading
Forgiven on a race to bitter past, but I ain't up for kissing ass
I bought you everything your pretty feet could fit in
Put you behind the finest steering wheels 
Fearing you would drive a nigga crazy
Told you grow up, but shit you was my baby
Bits and pieces never made nothing decent
When I accommodated you, you played me like a stranger
I remember you now
Accountability is major
A part of what I did then
Remember your face
Just don't let me trip over memory lane
'Cause time can't be replaced

Mmm and I don't want to stay
Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of

I remember your ways, De La featuring Estelle",Memory Of... (US),2016
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"It's time to dip dive dip, you might break a hip
To the sound that's legit, I've come to make a hit
I usually bust scratches with my brother, C.L. Smooth
But, I decided to get wreck on this groove
As I provide the slide you're going on a ride
I know the weather's nice, there's no need to play the outside
Guess who's on the flyer, the man of your desire
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth all the honey-dips admire
Beats are rough and rugged, Pete Rock is the creator
Now I'm busting raps while switching cross-faders
Making sure my sound hits from here to Grenada
Honey gave me skins, man, I told her friends I ate her
But, wait up, I save this subject for later
But, it's time to catch wreck with the creator

I'm addicted like a stoag, not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there's a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold cause I'm busy kickin' rhymes to the rhythm
Fortified with soul cause that's what I give 'em
Honeys form a line form a line cause I always seem to capure
Beats made of rupture, rhymes made of rapture
Far from illiterate, always seem to get a hit
If you try to step to this, don't even consider it
Skins when I want 'em, but, only when I need 'em
To set the record straight, I'll be damned if eat 'em
Call me Pete Rock, I make the girls flock
And if you want a beat like this, I got them in stock
So, flow with the flow, because you know I'm good to go
As I proceed to get wreck on your stereo
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

Now, C.L. Smooth, cut it up like this

Now, I'm'a take a try and get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec to get some wreck
Never filled with anger, a good body banger
If you try to step to this you'll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can't see this
My word is beneficial, Pete Rock is the issue
And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch (Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse (No question)
Either one, I can't be seen, honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around, I'll show you what I mean
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

It's time to get wreck with the creator
Get wreck with the creator
The creator

To hype the show I gotta go with the flow
And take it to another degree that many people wanna see

More than minimal, for any individual
That I send, to reach the end
And just like Clark Gable, it's gone with the wind
And take flight, through the night
Like a meteorite, insight to shine like a bright light
You gotta tip-toe from the get-go
Live in stereo, rhymes gotta flip, so
Pete Rock can move your butt and cut the strut
Yeah, what?

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Some live the good life loungin' by the pool 
Catching a suntan and everything's cool 
Male or female  you want to be set 
In the big mansion drinking Moet 

You read the Wall Street Journal 
Later for the comic 
Far from dumb because you practice logic 
You lived poor in the ghetto 

Never had the money easily 
But you found the remedy 
So you  your girl  and your kids could have a better opportunity 
And teach them all about unity 

Cultivating in the brains the words of Allah the master 
And they go far 
But, you still go visit your old stomping ground 
Indeed to help another that's down 

A tough situation cuts like a knife 
In search of the good life 

From the church, the home, on down to the prison 
People want to know how is he and she living 
Does he work? 
Do you wonder if his life will bloom? 

Is the girl going to have the kid anytime soon? 
How's the mother? 
Do they ever go visit the brother? 
What about the dad? 

I heard he drinks undercover 
Some are still shooting up, another on crack 
Just the other day trooper got sent back 
What type of life do you lead? 

Tell me 
'Cause you can be anything you want to be 
Some will strive for the good life in any case 
The mind is a terrible thing to waste 

On drugs, violence, and hatred of another color 
Hear me now, brother 
All around the world the husband and wife 
Work night and day in search of the good life 

The G double O-D L-I-F-E 
Living in luxury 
Care free 
Period 

No time to waste 
We catch ours all day 
We work instead of play 
I B-U-I-L-D inside me 

Knowledge and quickly you vacate the city 
From a paranoid mental delusion 
Plain and simple 
I won't cause confusion 

Yo, that's your fault 
Stop the somersault 
'Cause I put the bad like mo to a halt 
My destiny I define is heavenly 

So, Fort Knox, open sesame 
Light shines and the birds keep singing 
As I still cling to my positive upbringing 
With the need to succeed, right? 

On a natural high 
The good life",Good Life,1991
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Here comes the hurricane, C.L. same name
Cut by the grain when I land upon the plain
Jah knew the Hebrew, a Papa Duke need you
But none of the fam who saw had a clue
Escalate the prime rate, words coagulate
Generate the mind's state, never can deflate
Nigger, you jigaboo, it doesn't have to be you
Funny like a cartoon, Pepe Le Pew
Pimp are the lyrical, g-string the individual
But the metaphysical isn't spriritual
Straight from the heart I frame the art
Tune up my class, real fast, very smart
Dictate the technique, wait a minute, I speak
Loved by my son and a kiss on the cheek
Stutter-step the concept, blueprint, or pro
Steady as we go so act like you know

I stand by the rabbi, sail in Shanghai
Always had an alibi even if I lie
Crucial, never neutral, bare the fruitful
Past time, another rhyme, skedaddle, Yankee Doodle
Light skin in lovely gyp, just for the honey dip
Here to make a megahit fit
Don't install the pipe dream, renaissance regime
When you run ragged I pick up the steam
Chart on the record book, what Corey Love took the hook
Here's a new book to civilize a crook
Purest of the pedigree, feed 'em a line
C.L., no Jezebel, can never sleep well
Thick like a dred, at the Club Med
The Mecca Don said, a fish out of water is dead
Pete Rock, the soul brother, cruise on a flow
Swing low and yell ""Geronimo!"", act like you know

C.L. can play like Nike, come on just do it
Pacify the Gemini, soul into it
Beat to my feet is a lock like concrete
Hard for the street, decipher never incomplete
A clean editorial, rather historical
Affordable, recordable, nifty like a portable
Mecca is the syndrome, when I come back home
Boogie on a baritone, listen on a phone
Libra, the achiever, toke a reefer
C.L. the girl pleaser, like Ebanezer
So here is the good sign, I incline
Titties with the bitties when I wine and dine
Worn like corduroy, comes the bad boy
But just like Anita Pita, I bring ya joy
""Agoobilonians"" with your knowledge
And take as said so, flow and act like you know",Act Like You Know,1992
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"""You know, nowadays it, seems like there's a lot of..
Bad things going on and, I guess a lot of it,

For the Original Man, architect of the Motherland
Kings to Queens, is the Asiatic Black plan
Pre-Adam-ite, first to see the light
Way before Adam and Eve took flight
Bless the seed of Abraham, I came to jam
Protest the teachings of another man
Uncle Tom stay loyal so they boil
I'm the alchemist with the twist from the true soil
My blood brother Adolpho on the side of me
My vision ain't blurry, so don't even lie to me
The rebirth the revival of our culture survival
To elevate, the black man is vital
You gotta realize now what we're facing
The floors I'm pacing from the anger in the nation

(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together, and raise)

(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together, and raise)

Here's the situation from a darker view
Night and day, salt and pepper in the earthly stew
But the salt think it taste better, straight up superior
Therefore, the flavor of the pepper's inferior
Incorrect though, giving some heartburn
Level of a devil better wait your turn
And here is one recollection of imperfection
No one should be judged by complexion
Lie-braries; broken down as lies buried
To force their beliefs to pilgrims all hurried
Television; tell-a-lie-vision
A schism; negative realism
Four-hundred-and-thirty-five years til weak
Mental deaf dumb and blindness put us to sleep
Out of the dark comes light so the first can't be
So Armaggedeon comes like a thief in the night
Rednecks flex to my context but in the projects
Some won't survive the next confrontation
And I'm aware of segregation
Pump your black fist for the anger in the nation

(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together, and raise)

(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together, and raise)

Some walk slow, cause the water's not shallow
Let my people go, you little Pharoah
Listen how they word it, be observant
Then house negro; today, civil servant
I want to drop the bomb but remain calm
Strong like the power of the Fruits of Islam
Black is beautiful, hot like fire
Guess how many times they thought they killed the Messiah
Malcolm X, Dr. King, let's sing
All around the world let freedom ring
Reality is real, so how do you feel
From being kings on a throne to picking cotton in a field?
Your slavery is lack of identity
One of the things that's not making you a friend of me
What's your cause - aim, rationale?
Cause I made up my mind, I never scrape or bow
But teach my own, the sound of black unity
Together we can rise and now's the opportunity
The Tuskegee Experiment, indeed it was big
When they used the black man as a guinea pig
Animalism, pumped on a lower level
But can only be the works of the devil
And I'm telling you now the frustration
The future's facing from the anger in the nation

(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together, and raise)

(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together, and raise)

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Ah yeah! feel the funk bay-be!
That’s right, this is called the basement!
And my man cl smooth kick it for you like this

From the heights, not what am I write, simple I can do this
Like Popeye to Brutus, I’m your host like a stewardess
Fly with the neighborhood hi-jackin' fella
So prepare for landing, and crash into a cellar
Bodies in the Buddha cloud, misty in the tune
Like a show all nights, a figure eight in a lagoon
With Pete Rock, the complete lock and beat stop
Now all the horny heffers wanna dangle on my er
Down by the dungeon with the cracks on the wall
Buffoon I’m like a mink while you’re soon to pimp a raccoon stole
Vocal arrangement, ready set to hit the pavement
But not before the kid leave the basement

The basement, put the funk in grand
Here comes my man
My brother, grap lover, get wreck cousin, c’mon

Call me the grap lover, yes, the younger soul brother
Keep your eyes on the prize cause you won’t find another
When the funk is played, the rhyme I display
Quick to bust a ditz so don’t slip in the way
Of the kid, with the flavor, the party people savior
Clockin' all the honies, eyes sharp like a razor
I kick a dance step, you’re soon to discover
Yo, that’s the kid from mecca and the soul brother
Yeah once in a while I be with cl on the dl
Or I flow with pete, and find my placement in the basement
The basement, yes where the beats and the rhymes flow
Peace I gotta go, grapster’s out the door of the basement

Of the basement! next we got, a special guest
I ain’t gonna tell you who it is
C’mon, rap along

Tick tock tick, things are gettin' thick
Here comes the heavster, and I know it makes ya - sick!
To see a black man gettin' paid on the regular
Car with the cellular, fellas I’m tellin' ya
I got plots and plans, pots and pans
Stocks and grands, so make room for the big man
I walk the streets in peace and I’m never strapped
But I know a crew of young guns that’ll send you back
So easy does it on the dl
Peace to Pete Rock, and the mecca don cl
Heavy d’s on this track, lettin' you know there’s no replacement
Peace signin' off, check one two straight from the basement

Straight from the basement
I’m tellin' you now, kid
It’s crazy fat
I wonder who this is comin' up? 

Fourth but not least, the backbone of the wig out
Freestyle, crazy hardcore, no sellout
Speakin', upon where I dwell from the dungeon
All over the u.s. states, even London
Past time present, black to the future
Swimmin' in beats like a dolphin, so call me don shula
A raider well like art shell, crazy defense
A pro bowl with soul for local events
The crew name is cl smooth and Pete Rock
Here to sail when I prevail and stare into the dock
The pimp daddy of the funk flavor, catch you later
Clever like a secret agent comin' from the basement

That’s right, crazy funky
Aw my man
He’s crazy funky, his name is rob-o, check him out

Ali-kazaam, you’ll never guess what I am
Motto is that nothin' ever changes but haircuts and kicks
To stacks of vocal breaks life pays when
Kid said, Pete makes beats in the basement
Cold hit, the pavement, over to the chill side
The real side, the 7-7 hillside
I thought I’d just chill, take a breath
Straight up Columbus hill, make a left
And get fixed, plus the ghetto chicks got flicks
Of me stacks of kicks, my joint’s bumpin' lovely
Walkin' down the street, much props, on the ? 
I hear voices sayin', that’s rob-o’dingo in the basement

Ah ha ha ha! hah yeah! this is funky!
I can feel it
My man from the Vernon, his name is di-da, make it raw

Fly like an eagle, a seagull
Always into somethin', like snoopy, the beagle
People, grab a tight hold of the sound
Hard, snatchin' raw papes off the shelves
Blowin' up spots from state to state
I’m comin' to town but you just can’t wait
Check the station, for conversation at six-block
Uno here, to put suckers in the mix
I get deeper than oceanography
Thinkin' of crazy shit, like psychology
So speak the piece, then slide like grease
The beat is fat, but the rhyme is obese in the basement

In the basement, is where I dwell
Check the MC swell
Cause I am, crazy funky, with cl smooth
My man ? ,rob-o, g-r baby pah

Psychedelic 

Uh  come on 

This is what I like 

It's that Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth stuff 

Uh huh  yeah 

Brothers can't understand 

You know I'm about to drop a funky beat on you 

Like this... 





Hit the war drums that vibrate the earth underneath 

Here my people and I come  gotta wake up the chief 

Not a pale frail ghost  C.L.'ll wreck the most 

'cause the Mecca land never had a Leo Africanos 

The Sudanian, master of the Mediterranean 

And if it's lovely I'm the one you're Skypagin' 

Lower than the Mole Man, R&B, you're silly 

The only male hardcore crusin' through my city 

Rise to the supernova, swami like Bola 

Heavy hitter I consider Ueuker leanin' on my shoulder 

Measure like a yardstick, thick at arithmetic 

You add it up and I roast a high pick flick 

Hit the pitch and then I'm gone as the funk lingers on 

I don't publicize here to keep the black race torn 

But steady at an altitude where you get the mental food 

Not to be rude, here's a fresh pot brewed 

Oh, what a web we weave when we practice to deceive 

Sparkin' off a trick up the sleave 

Pete stocked the bedrock, listen and you'll see 

And I'm sure you will agree you can't front on me 



Yo, you can't front 

It's like that, c'mon, yeah 

Yes, you know I got to talk 

You can't front 

I'm tellin' you now 

C.L. Smooth and the Rock, c'mon 



Many consumed what was locked in a tomb 

That I gradually groomed, coming out now smelling like perfume 

So take a whiff when I wrap a gift, play ya like a gospel 

A logical apostle, colossal (whoooweee!) 

Afro, a cut me like a fade with a Braun 

Sport a bald head, but never needed Hair Club for Men 

Drop a SCUD, fully-capable, a form in a eclipse 

Skips to backflips soon as it leaves my lips 

Suave know, I can make the funk turn the habit 

Kick the old 45 and I can boogie on static 

Welcome to the Brahma Don, pilgrimage to Mecca Don 

A prayer for the parish, Soucron Affwaun 

'cause ain't no misbehavin' when they manage what you're cravin' 

Put the ""Anger in the Nation"" on your station 

Anvils that fills the whole circumference 

And black people crowd in a mass abundance 

To hear Gabriel's horn, blow it like a Naiji 

What's the flavor unit with the top priority? 

C.L., untouchable with the clip full 

Impossibly, the posse can't front on me 



Don't you dare front 

Don't you dare front 

Not on me 

'cause I'm the man 

C.L.'s the rhymer 

Right on time 

Right on, my brother 

Come on, kick another verse for me 



You desire the messiah for the entire empire 

Total organizer of the earth, wind, and fire 

C.L. and Pete Rock unlock the hard rock 

Many want to mock and the honey-dips clock 

Intercontinental for the residential 

Never coincidental, rough on a rental 

Count all the bars numeric 

Pro-prosthetic if ya let it resurrect the nongeneric 

The brother on the cover, yes, a rapper not a singer 

If you recognize him, point with your index finger 

Shock another flock when I hit the block 

God or Devil on the set that's level, labeled as a rebel 

In retrospect I detect those incorrect 

And reflect the black power project 

Supreme 'cause I chose to never blaspheme 

Going to the extreme, place it on a very high beam 

And drop jewels for five thousand fools who stampede 

'cause the proper show stopper's what ya need 

So come and get a taste of the dynamic duo 

And I'm sure you will agree you can't front on me (Yoooo!) 



You can't front, boy 

'cause we're the skilled fools (skibooze?) 

We'z are the funk

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Here come's the rugged one, plus the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark lover, prefer to be called the chocolate lover
Cuz I can do wonders under cover
I'm dip-dip-dope, I rhyme like riz-ope
I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause slick like blue nile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Plus the way that I flow blood clot

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah
So funky, like a street junky
Like I said before, here we go, c'mon
For Pete's sake I break and update, wait, I radiate
The dub played to navigate the tune I make
I fit like a slipper, so catch the Big Dipper
Vital signs are quicker, not the flat line picture
Showtime original, official with the smooth criminal
I hit the cliches on the subliminal
With the soul technician to fill the prescription
In addition listen close to the mission
The P.E.T.E.R.O.C.K., resume
With the route to Brut by Faberge
No doubt, to shout about a 20-bar segment
Off spring the lyrics when the microphone's pregnant
Give it a rubdown, now here's the sermon
Everywhere you go you hear Mecca from the Vernon
Pound for pound, uptown, I get down
And bound to spin the record like a merry-go-round
The cut don't flow that I touch is not a preemie
And who would ever see me when I dream of Jeanie
I don't think so, peace, I gotta go
And shake like an earthquake, cousin, for Pete's sake

Yo, my style's cock-diesel and I can do the hustle
Niggas know the time, I don't have to flex a muscle
I'm not the type to fake it, I wouldn't try to take it
Tie your girl to the back of my Jeep butt-naked
Slide her monkey ass down the hill
So if you don't want beef, money, chill for Pete's sake

To my man

Music please

The Mecca's sweet like nectar, maybe cause you need it
There's a ribbon in the sky, but I wonder if you see it
In the days of thunder, notice how I suplex in the proper context
Here steps the one, the answer to the riddle
Survey says the black press can make you wiggle
The staff to the craft, the stroke of a pena
Perfect stranger, melody arranger
Loopholes are filled when I build with the skill
Liquid steels the mic on the Rock's chill
No financial aid wade when I'm paid
Deep as the Everglade, the escapade a renagade
Study in the archives, place your bet, sonny
Head crack back to back for the bail money
For you, a chapter, slayed by the author
Lickin' on your daughter, say, south of the border
Now, here we are with the funky repertoire
Draw warm like a spa, star, forget all the hoopla

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Above the level of a mezzanine, healthy as Ovaltine
The dominant gene clean, I mean go, the light's green

Confess, never poor as Bangladesh
I get busy like a boxer, operate like a Doctor
Seal like a locker, pop like Orville Redenbacher
Buy the tape, LP, CD
All me, and Petey, to cater to the needy
Like a Prayer for Madonna but A Different World for Jasmine
CL is well a physical attraction
Let me make myself perfectly clear:
While I'm there, I make a peer a positive pap smear
Really I do, once I light the barbeque
Thread the loose ends, see my friends are the crew
The fright night King of New York like Frank White
If it ain't rough it ain't right man listen

If it ain't rough enough, to mingle in the stuff
To scar and scuff and make you cuckoo like a cocoa puff;
It ain't right so I smash the satellite
Check the farenheight, before I take flight
Unique as Mozambique, here to freak Sheik
The skills that won't leak, and never antique
Warm like a oven you're lovin the style I'm druggin
Alleyway muggin, heavyweight sluggin
No fibs I kick the ad libs and rock it in the cribs
Break your ribs like a toothpick cause you were never slick
? you lacked back when I first started
CL's the one who got the Red Sea parted
My conversation qualification is a doozy
The rude Rudy wreckin write you off as a floozy
I shoot for the moon, but even if I miss
I'm among the stars, to put a bullethole in Mars

In my frame of mind I design the best-seller
For rougher cats can Rockafeller you're Penn and Teller
Steady with the convo, rought like Brillo
Let your head hit the bed and knock the feathers out your pillow
The master intelligent, with the black testament
Found it relevant, and mailed it to the President
But overall I get papes for my labor
With the physical manifestation of a saviour
You wanna test this, but I slay anyway
Cause your rhymes are old, with more wrinkles than a shar pei
Mecca Don upon the streets of Babylon
Pass the baton to respond like Farrakhan
Hard like Shaft with the staff for the Backdraft
A blazin aftermath, so hon make a path
If you don't trust him, bust him
But if you don't have a weapon, then kid keep steppin

Now I'm a flip a style and get crazy versatile 
Never fragile 'cause I'm flowin' like the Nile 

Swing a jewel or a gem, notice how I say them 
With my approach, smoke a rhyme to a roach 
A four-season lover, light-skinned and bigger 
But what I deliver come before the cotton picker

What we talkin bout? Talkin bout the skinz
Skinz? Yeah the skinz, you know, girls
Fine women
Skinz, listen listen to my man

I hear it callin never stallin hit the skinz bed or shelter
Love to tap her on the shoulder, roll her over, then I belt her
Leave a bite when the joint is tight, lovely when it's loose
Produce the proper juice, plus I never hump a deuce
Give me the head on the waterbed, play you like a Pro Ked
Slide the flavors on the sled, listen to what he said
Come and lie on the bearskin, notice how the firm make him grin
Cover the checks and then I go cash em in
Hold the zipper, unlock, and grab the whole bag of treats
Hear the hooker slam the butcher with the biggest stack of meats
Take two hands to hold it, flip it out and unroll it
If you spot a brother larger then the next man stole it
Oochie coo now, you know the Mecca wanna bang bang
Beggin a pardon as I knock a new skinz stank thang
CL, kickin flavor with the Grand Puba
Speakin on the wins, I'm about to hit the skinz

Talkin bout the skinz
The skinz
That's right, talkin bout the skinz baby
No disrespect, just talkin bout an everyday thing
C'mon

Ha ha ha!
Hey, hey
Yeah

Nowadays I'm on some extra be careful (shit)
I take precaution, before I slide up in the slit
Man (fuck) that I put aluminum foil on my (dick)
Cause if you catch it, boy that (shit)'ll kick you quick
Better yet, you can pass me a Ziplock
A bag of boom, and a 40 then some boot knock
I get stiff and it's hard like Charles Bronson
It's kinda (fucked) up what happened to Magic Johnson
But anyway, you know the resume
Time to drop the Girbauds and parlay, HEY
I rock the world over big botty girls
Won't hit the skinz if she gotta jheri curl
Cause when I jump into my thing I make the bedspring sing
And you can ask my old fling, who's the bedroom king?
Hit the skinz hard, she'll hang on to the bedpost
Then I drop my load, then get up and make some french toast
Run and get the paper and it won't be the Post
After that you know the flavor I'm ghost!

That's right, be out
Hit it off on the skinz

C'mon, with the funky flavors
Uhh, gonna hit this off right quick

Hit the skinz they're forever wins, cozy like my Timbs and brims
But never heard a bigger limb around the rim
Set to hurdle when I pop a girdle, sum it up surgical
Lay down the pubic and the stuff won't curdle
I got the remedy for competition of any
Sleepin with the enemy who never got a pretty penny
Skinz I'm with, check the lower lipped pal of mine
Now you know the Pete Rock, skinz all the time

Oh Pete Rock, raw as I ever been
Give me room so I can speak about the skinz
Take a tidbit, but God (damnit) can you dig it
Sisters play me close and they want my beeper digits
Cause I love em undercover, the Chocolate Boy Wonder
Break like an earthquake, boomin like thunder
Til the honey dip the blouse, slip in the house
Sip the Stout, rip the boots, and I'm out

Like the Isley's, apply these, in-Between the Sheets
Follow yes another trail as if I had on cleats
Rip my way through a negligee, park it like a valet
Sure it's OK, just met the skinz yesterday
Tap the baggy drawers, lay the laws, lovely puff it up
For the ride, honey buckle up, smearin all your makeup
CL can wreck it well a bombshell finishin
So get the tunnel vision on how I hit the skinz

How I hit the skinz, uhh
It's fat, yes
As you know I like to flow
Don't try to show
Because I'm, the accurate man
Everybody knows it

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"""He's a SWEET soul brother""

Soul Brother #1, here I come on the new tip
Nestle coated right, cause I'm rich thick and chocolate
Plug up any mic I'll bet you Pete Rock'll spark it
Hons always ask what's the bulge in my pocket
I tell em, ""Papes,"" I rock them top to bottom
Never hesitate to say (""Mmm I got them"")
Oppressed on the Hillside, over on the chill-side
Of town, so let's get down
Funky is the word describe this Brother on a Soul mission
Hookin rugged joints, more Soul than the Soul Kitchen
CL doesn't scratch, so I won't leave you itchin
White people even say, ""Pete Rock is bitchin""
Harder than the hardest, odder than the oddest
I guess that's just because I'm smarter than the smartest
So back up, clear the path hon cause here I come
Soul Brother #1

I hit harder than a kick, quick to scoop a chick
When it comes to skinz, Pete Rock got it thick
I'm not your average, everyday, one-two to the beat
And don't stop, bust the shit I drop
New style for the 90's Pete Rock's a trendsetter
I'd just be lyin if I said there's someone better
You can ask Greta, Greta with the red Jetta
Honey did me lovely and I'm glad that I met her
I come style after style, sucker MC's try to swallow
But them seem to say my style's too hard to follow
So just raise your hand and give praise to the #1
Soul Brother, who keeps the crowd in a daze
Pete Rock, and CL Smooth and if it ain't our groove
Then you might not move
Remember, cause there's no need to worry none
Yo, Soul Brother #1

Soul Brother #1

Nuff respect to my man Grand Puba
Nuff respect to my man BizMarkie
Nuff respect to my man CL Smooth
Nuff respect to EPMD
I'm like high octane, with everything to gain
Those who try to step to this can catch pain
I keep a mag in the trunk of my Jag, in case some punk fag
Wants to catch one bad
Soul Brother #1, and I didn't come to riff
The finesse I posess will make the hardest unstiff
I'm full of motivation handle any situation
Hon said I'm so smooth they should call me lubrication
Mr. Splendor, a good back bender
Honies always say, Pete love me tender
Call on Pete Rock, CL Smooth if you want the job done

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Uh, yeah. Uh-huh
We got Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth
And we're here to tell you to
And that's a fact, baby
Now you're gonna kick some lyrics
Like this, c'mon

Walk the fine, short line, and put the needle to the grind
Representin' one kind, seeing eye for the blind
Witness what I carry on bears a further purpose
From how we do slam a few, then you want to purchase
A dialogue of funk, you love to pop it in your trunk
I win, more disciplined than a Show-lin monk
Pete Rock and C.L., well set to spark it
The powerful target to destroy the black market
But when you say black, listen, I don't know, you lose me
I guess another beggar can afford to be choosey
I come to the maximum, artist on a major label
Any duplication of this one is fatal
On one to five, I gotta hit ya live
Beat your ass with my tape, any race or shape
Cuz if they got mine, they got yours too
But together here's what we gotta do

Tell 'em straighten it out
Ah, yeah straighten it out
You know this is the word (say what?) straighten it out
That's right y'all straighten it out (say what?)
You got to straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out yeah
Straighten it out it's like that (say what?)

The funk legacy I pass on, clearancy for high rates
Every time we sample all the past time greats
Stick it in the SP-1200 beat, I make a loop
Lovely, where the Troop in a Lexus coupe
Just a little bit, set to make a whole lot happen
The musical inside my rappin'
Written by the C.L., produced by the P.R
And add in any credit that you heard thus far
I start from scratch, cuz the bass line's critical
Better than the original who first made it
But now you want to sue me, but fans never boo me
Believe I know the times, we been broke, too, G
Here's another sample clear, seeya, get the hell outta here
Like a bootleg, you're over for the year
You'll only get the credit where the credit is due
So, listen, what I shout out is true

Yeah, true straighten it out
You gots to tell 'em to straighten it out
(Say what?) straighten it out
You got to tell 'em to straighten it out
(Say what?) straighten it out
That's right straighten it out
C'mon (say what?) straighten it out
That's right straighten it out
Straighten it out (say what?)

Like the strands of lamb's wool, I'm thinkin' that's said
Here to go to the head and count the locks on a dred
I and I'd 'mit to verify, goin' to multiply
A theory many thought a conspiracy
Here to let you know that it applies to all of us
You're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus
Cause who Jah bless, let no one curse
Straighten out what I be about, reckon above the clout
And let the management work for me
Because I don't need the unnecessary hostility
A proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough
Straighten it out, so everybody know
The kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface
Kickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous
We're finally here and very long overdue
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew

You gotta straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
You gotta straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out you got to
Straighten it out c'mon (say what?)
Straighten it out
All black people must straighten it out
Say what?
Straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out
The YG's, they must straighten it out
The Hilltop, they muststraighten it out
The whole money-earnin' must straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out
Come on straighten it out
Ah, yeah straighten it out (to close)",Straighten It Out,1992

Uhh
Ahh yeah
What we talkin bout? Talkin bout the skinz
Skinz? Yeah the skinz, you know, girls
Fine women
Skinz, listen listen to my man

[CL Smooth]
I hear it callin never stallin hit the skinz bed or shelter
Love to tap her on the shoulder, roll her over, then I belt her
Leave a bite when the joint is tight, lovely when it`s loose
Produce the proper juice, plus I never hump a deuce
Give me the head on the waterbed, play you like a Pro Ked
Slide the flavors on the sled, listen to what he said
Come and lie on the bearskin, notice how the firm make him grin
Cover the checks and then I go cash em in
Hold the zipper, unlock, and grab the whole bag of treats
Hear the hooker slam the butcher with the biggest stack of meats
Take two hands to hold it, flip it out and unroll it
If you spot a brother larger then the next man stole it
Oochie coo now, you know the Mecca want to bang bang
Beggin a pardon as I knock a new skinz stank thang
CL, kickin flavor with the Grand Puba
Speakin on the wins, I`m about to hit the skinz

[Pete Rock]
Talkin bout the skinz
The skinz
That`s right, talkin bout the skinz baby
No disrespect, just talkin bout an everyday thing
C`mon

[Grand Puba]
Ha ha ha!
Hey, hey
Yeah...

Nowadays I`m on some extra be careful (shit)
I take precaution, before I slide up in the slit
Man (fuck) that I put aluminum foil on my (dick)
Cause if you catch it, boy that (shit)`ll kick you quick
Better yet, you can pass me a Ziplock
A bag of boom, and a 40 then some boot knock
I get stiff and it`s hard like Charles Bronson
It`s kinda (fucked) up what happened to Magic Johnson
But anyway, you know the resume
Time to drop the Girbauds and parlay, HEY
I rock the world over big botty girls
Won`t hit the skinz if she gotta jheri curl
cause when I jump into my thing I make the bedspring sing
And you can ask my old fling, who`s the bedroom king?
Hit the skinz hard, she`ll hang on to the bedpost
Then I drop my load, then get up and make some french toast
Run and get the paper and it won`t be the Post
After that you know the flavor I`m ghost!

[Pete Rock]
That`s right, be out..
Hit it off.. on the skinz

[Cl Smooth]
C`mon, with the funky flavors
Uhh, gonna hit this off right quick

Hit the skinz they`re forever wins, cozy like my Timbs and brims
but never heard a bigger limb around the rim
Set to hurdle when I pop a girdle, sum it up surgical
Lay down the pubic and the stuff won`t curdle
I got the remedy for competition of any
sleepin with the enemy who never got a pretty penny
Skinz I`m with, check the lower lipped pal of mine
Now you know the Pete Rock, skinz all the time

[Pete Rock]
Oh Pete Rock, raw as I ever been
Give me room so I can speak about the skinz
Take a tidbit, but God (damnit) can you dig it
Sisters play me close and they want my beeper digits
cause I love em undercover, the Chocolate Boy Wonder
Break like an earthquake, boomin like thunder
til the honey dip the blouse, slip in the house
Sip the Stout, rip the boots, and I`m out

[CL Smooth]
Like the Isley`s, apply these, in-Between the Sheets
Follow yes another trail as if I had on cleats
Rip my way through a negligee, park it like a valet
Sure it`s OK, just met the skinz yesterday
Tap the baggy drawers, lay the laws, lovely puff it up
For the ride, honey buckle up, smearin all your makeup
CL can wreck it well a bombshell finishin
So get the tunnel vision on how I hit the skinz

[Pete Rock]
How I hit the skinz, uhh
It`s fat, yes
As you know I like to flow
Don`t try to show
Because I`m, the accurate man
Everybody knows it
Peace to all stealers

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been

Welcome to the zone where the strong only survive
Places I drive all the gangsters can't stay alive
Take my universal journey through the jungles of the hardest town
Where my brothers lay their life down
You want something to play with?
Go find some toys when you mistake these grown men for little boys
More real than what is real so feel I'm sending
Compare the God with no beginning and we'll have no ending
My blessed rings are down with the kings revalation
Had heard me on the run-dmc's reincarnation
Child abuse, women loose, robbery and triple homicide
Every where this black man resides still
Check the monolouge, I'm on a 6 a.m. jog
To regain my powers, do a set before the showers
I'm prime for the summertime, the big time bowler
But any season or reason we can't take it over

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Are you ready for the legendary crazy rugged ready war?
Known to be the smooth that sat by the door
Furthermore, for you and I to click, here's the stats
Take all that dirty money, set the wash doors and laundromats
You love to gamble now we open an after-hours spot
20 Sacks with the guiness for the jackpot
Members only, playing pool like willie marconi
With a tenderoni chatting about the gs I'm batting
I'm patting down with the sound of a general
Fully supplied by my ghettofied residential
We come to rebuild and turn off the heat now
Hoping we can take it back to yugenot street
Palled around the screen tv watching the fight
Tonight, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right
Ink tents in all of my circumference I connect
Now demanding all types of respect, can you dig it?

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Traveling the warp speed we come to the peak
Like a missle I probe and seek, many can't critique
My physique is still solid, chiseled down to the very last compound
I'm trying that chin, fool, where you been?
Still sliding girls in as soon as pops fall asleep
His game tight, set to flip a shorty late night
I like rocks and groupies, condo shows and cuties
The hottest cars and the strongest drinks at the bars
This is one of those joints that make you stand by the exits
Cause every time I'm yapping something crazy happens
Keep my tool in my baggy jeans rolling with sneaker feet
Who got a life term working for the firm
My labor's fruit off of business as usual
Plus my two clan band is making me a wealthy man
Now from where I stand, believe it's not a game
Pete rock and c.l. smooth's a household name

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Let me take you on a journey through Carmel City
Where CL's God, and the ladies gotta hit me off
Ballin on the set now baby what's the matter
When all this is Hot Sex served on a platter
Enter my flow so I can hit this show with somethin rugged
It's mainly how all the honies dug it
Like every single day and, bounce around the way and
Chicks are never waiting when the bodies start marinating
We expand in player's land to unknowns
To turn my stumbling blocks, into my stepping stones
The pound Donna Karan New York down found
Where there can be no type of slacking in your macking
The whole agenda is for me to decide; the major hustle
Is God, when brothers coincide, with the bonafide
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City

C'mon ya'll

Top notch, butterscotch, lyrics hits the mode
To make the most gorgeous women wanna get nude
Your eyes stay glued, when this is popping word is bond
Wifey's gone, now I'm about to get my swerve on
Lay my clothes across the bed, cause I'm here to make a point
Plenty chips, got me balling in a hot joint
Respect the sextafied aura you could never take light
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight
My large releases got me mixing with the dimepieces
And down to rival one of Uncle L's little nieces
In my palace of pleasure, everything is done properly
And if you didn't know, you better ask somebody
Right now, the players are the power structure
Check the roly-poly, now it's time you see the brother
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City

It's freaktacular, wasn't hard to get em out the blouse
If only wifey knew, hubby got a stash house
And what moves your man got with so much emphasis
Maybe one or two many get ridiculous
So scandalous, the honey arrives with her crew
And now they're talking bout coming back without you
Yeah my boys are balling, here's the raw deal:
Come to my house, you gotta get naked for real
Indulging, my peoples said let's have a talk
About the time my lady's plane hit New York
I'm bailing off the set, heading for the crib G
Cause I'm the first thing the woman wanna see
Take a hot shower, slip on some linen
Now it's a new time, a new day, a new beginning
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City",Carmel City,1994
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"We go back and forth, sending this out to my people up north
Tell 'em if you ain't from New York you're soft
Box or throw rocks, fish or cut bait
Cause I fight great, but wait
Here's the hottest joint on lockdown
Ready for release what they call a masterpiece
Covers are blown, known for keeping shit lethal
Cause now I'm like water in the desert for you thirsty people
What's the fixation with all this artillery?
Now you catch a look, saying ""Who are you to question me?""
Giving sighs from enemy lines taking care of my business
Is how you found out Wayne's World was never his
See my pend holds strong for all my cookies in mink
We call all types of bitches running out of ink
Later for ticky mind, avoid like suama
But I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind

You know it's my thing, get your bell rang
By the Meccafied slang, the jack of all trades
Couldn't even gang bang, and niggas can't hang
With so many styles, you'd swear the shit was out of Wu-Tang
But the samurai, CL Smooth I
Be slicing, dicing you down when the mic is around
I rebound like Oakley when you provoke me
This is the Chocolate Thai, be careful how you toke me
I razzle dazzle your fragile ass until you pay homage
To the man I plan is holding all the knowledge
In five minutes of funk off my tounge, read the label shown
Is it Pete Rock or Oliver Stone?
Still the same, they remember my name
Kind of reminds me of when Rocket Ismail played for Notre Dame
Invincibility with no vulnerability
Selling more than gold with the killers on my payroll

You'd better watch your step, known for the rep
Of being real but can't accept jealous brothers and others
Who can't relax with pep, and if it was the playoffs
Your ass would get swept and kept on stash
The Tango & Cash competitors bow
Cause I would think we all know who The Don is by now
Making loot at the pace of a horse race
Now once again my friend, the great paperchase
Here's a taste of life in the fast lane
Now house full of chicks, he's stripping off the Don P
With the profound sound, I ride swoops like a hawk
And can only bring the essence of New York
It's the Vernonville daddy, can you comprehend?
How some real live niggas set a new trend
Of being so blasted, smoothest prophets to the brain cell
While I bid you all a farewell",Check It Out,1994
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Check the verse in the Bible says man shall never covet
But in your life you put nothing above it, you seem to love it
Invest some stocks to clock what's in my stable
Sweating me like Cain sweating Abel, you're unstable
You couldn't speak, now what's the fake smile for?
The jealousy, that's why you're feeling so insecure
Used to be by my side but now all I see is pride
On the quest to make lucci, got you open wide
It feels funny, cause it never used to be that way
Remember PR back in the day?
Hey, the number's changed and the crib's a little fatter
But if you was real, you'd see it really wouldn't matter
Check the stat in fact yo, don't ever try to peep this
Don't mistake my kindness for a weakness
The name is Pete Rock, I'll take you higher than the izm
I'm on a exodus, Escapism

Yo, check it out
I like to rhyme, no time for silly head games
Strictly known for busting up your head frames
But skins bold, act like they want to know a nigga
Break they neck to show they figure
But yo, you can't gas me up, you can't hype me
Play it cool when it comes to schooling wifey
On the ways of life it's life, checks, and big money
So the next kid will be up on your honey
Sexing your honey, flexing your Benz and your money
Playing you like a crash test dummy, so take it from me
Cause when it happens don't say I never told you so
Peep the verbal lessons in the flow
And ayo, you know they style, and yeah I'm here to warn ya
Getting shaky cause I'm coming up on ya
It's Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth on a major pape mission
Rising to the top, Escapism

I'm sitting back, I got the funk on cruise
While you snooze Pete Rock is steady paying his dues
Putting styles on lock and making beats by the bundle
Scooping more props than Bryant Gumbel, and staying humble
But then you go and have to act that way
I just hit you off the other day!
But this is sick, cause here you come with your crew of derelicts
Talking about you need a pair of kicks, or this or that
You hang around cause the pockets are fat
But when I'm on ""E"" yo, you ain't trying to check for me
You got more game than rugby
You're only stressing the name now that the papes is flowing lovely
So stop searching for idealism
And check the off-beat flow of the Soul Brother with the realism

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Capture this funakthon loaded by the Mecca Don
Into the red zone, you spot my skull and crossbone alone
To fill the Watergates, slaughter great, think and meditate
Set behind the pace of the CL's war face
Cras and tints, making blueprints for over six figure salaries
Luchified, cause many did and died
The mic wrecka, study Mecca, now building
Cause I love my shorties like Jesus loved children
Cause being smooth is the science I crafted
To a state, when they incarsarate me I wanna be free
And play some D on the high-scoring thrill from the Veronville
Taking my yards with no bodyguards
My click's the first round draft pick for time in prison
So the only way to cover that is clean living
Respect given, hear the bell go ""ding""
It's like Tyson stepping back into the ring, soon as I

Ladies and gentlemen for dead presidents it represents
Now hear what it's like when I (get on the mic)
It's strike cause every Nike I wear is kicking ass there
Too dope to scare and too damn smooth to care
So flick your lighters in the air, and let me blow the roof off
The Collesseum plus I got to get per diem
All dueces file out, and leave the dimes to the front row
And when I say ""Go"" I want 'em showing lovin'
Tossing dough, cause with the daddy unemployed
And the old earth raising me, any other rugged nigga's history
No mystery, I'm physical in action
So guess relaxing is a weekend with Toni Braxton

Slide into the Milky Way, the Carmel King's sing
We're back on crazy to put the duke up in Daisy
Amazingly, none of y'all can faze me never
Add the spice to make you shoop like Salt N Pepa
How large is he? Mastered my degree in mic surgery
With plans to retire at the tender age of 30

Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doin' trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, livin' well
And never cease to flip the hottest dime piece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slippin off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds

Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell

Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dime pieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinkin totally nude with no limits
Goin' through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showin' nothin' but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie

At last come the goodies, every woman got a love
Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin' in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin' this

As long as they don't violate everything's cool, cause it's all good
Understood is the smoothest daddy with the roughest raps
Am I thinking about blowing the spot? Perhaps
Carry straps on strips for the trigger-happy pirates
Where ladies catch fits steady reaching for my privates
But hold, how I unfold my whole repotoire
Now here we are at home to make another superstar
With Rob-O and Deda with the P.R
But nevertheless it's CL Smooth

""In the flesh""

Rob-O's at the top of the list, so bust this
Stick to funk like Scotch, the top-notch vocalist
You don't stop, cause I can illustrate with the needle
Penetrating straight to the souls of many people
Is there any evil? On this path I'm innovating
Stil faking, put down your pads and stop waiting
See the year of the fly MC is here, so stand clear
I'm facing the Gods with no fear
Rob-O, East Coast, uptown
MCing the most and spreading the Mecca all around
Selecting the sound to make the party people hound
The DJ for more of what I say in '94
It's like that, so don't stop
It's like this, so God bless
Soul Brothers get down with no stress
Yeah INI's representing in the flesh

""In the flesh""

Even in the mirror, it just doesn't get any clearer
I hear a funky beat and I gotta get nearer
KABOOM! Stepping in the sound room mellow
A dangerous flavorous fellow, hello
Style and grace, the original's in this piece
In the place right along with the pace
Nevertheless, in the flesh no quest
The sex in the system, of course I'm fresh
I rest in the Villes, the skills is big
To a level of extravagence, the talent's all balanced
The extreme dopeness for the nation
D. is the inital, MC's the occupation
Five master hype, light the color of the skin
Once the beat roll, my goal is to win
My friend the best, the real side yes
I rest my case in your face in the flesh

""In the flesh"" 

Soul Brother supreme to catch wreck in the flesh
So check one two and a mic test
Now clear the room, I scoped you with the wide angle zoom
Trying to overstand my funk tunes
Coming soon, so chill, don't stress The Creator
I'll kick the funk loop from here to Cal Tjader
And cross the fader, and pack the lines on my paper
With rhymes so tough, who got the flavor?
Plus the knack to rock, I'm steady heating up the spot
The Chocolate Boy Wonder making heads bop
In slow motion, domes crack open like the pavement
Off some shit I made down in the basement
The funk ambassador, asking you to get with the pro-
Fessional, yo there's no question I can flow
Time to slide, you know the P.R. will provide
The real and still I feel the vibe, I'm in the flesh

Check it out and give me my 'spect

Hit the lights and I appear beyond the stratosphere of Meccable function
And if you're pretty let your lady sleep in Carmel City
Begin and end the day on Lennon hunts for beachfronts
To lit blunts, now all agreed we're sippin OJ with the Dom P
Bounce and bring it like it counts to be Luccified
CL is sextified and women spell me nationwide
You say you want my lips where and I can grab your what?
I love your hips legs breasts faces with the firm butt
Now feel the muscle when I hustle in the bedsheets
Cause my manly treats can hit the fridge for more sweet
SPLASH, and let me do my thing til it's hot and sweaty
Reload the CamCorder, I guess by then you'll be ready
Cause All My Children got One Life to Live
But knockin wifey out the box is clearly a negative
I'm in rugged wears with fancy facial wears
And all the real shit come in pairs, and bounce em in the house y'all

Pete Rock is in the house, CL is in the house

Back again, I'm here to win, to bust rhymes on beats again
Copycats and rugrats, sit back and watch a champion
It's time to wreck shop and show the world I'm true to hip-hop
So check the style and peace to niggas in the penile
Now umm, it's the original Funky Chicken tactic
I run game on your brain for the fame cause I'm active
You try to follow in my footsteps, you can't do it
I'm pullin your card it ain't hard, I don't have to prove it
It's Pete Rock and CL Smooth to the utmost
From coast to coast, the music makes you overdose
You fiend, for the gangsta lean, I makes you scream
Rugged Bro Soul on the scene
A.k.a. the funk doer, numero uno, that means
Number one I get the job done plus I pack a gun
So run, and tell your peoples you'll be on the lookout
It's all about ""Who's in the House?"" with the funk

Pete Rock is in the house, CL is in the house

Money up steps the new era of my lyrical terror
Funkadelic for lightin up spots ever since little tots
When the dust settle I'm packin heavy metal plenty
The drop'll slaughter many, strictly off illegal entry
It's elementary Watson, I drive a Benz not a Datsun
Before my kicks hit the stage, we've been Foot Locking
Body rockin to keep the ladies flockin with a concoction
Rippin your blouse for no less than arrest in Morehouse
My teeth prints where my knife slits, we train em
And scar em like pits, off vibes of the Mecca joint
Vibe to position, never runnin out of ammunition
Now to the heart, I'm steppin with a concealed weapon
Nothing's calm when the bomb blaze you know the phrase
It's Pete Rock and CL Smooth knockin nowadays
Eastside kid, you don't want none, so catch a relay

On you (""just in case a brother acts a fool"")

It's death before dishonor
Strap the vest down tight when you bring the drama
Now raise up off mine, and taste it in the raw
Before snipers on the floor galore, in my hardware store
Nightmares of thirsty crooks, niggas all acting fishy working off the books
Painting pictures of poverty, causing armed robbery
And if provoke every last one gets smoked
No doubt for real it's like wildlife
Where thugs forever pull caps and always keep a knife
Cause on the strip warefare's inevitable, hot steel's incredible
And it's a pride the revolution won't be televised
As I supply and demand, as I build my currency to expand, call it progress
When I bless my territory all respect due

Now praise the most high and represent the best
Cause the number one killer of black men is stress
The armed and dangerous, the bulletproof
Couldn't stop the homicide of another youth
Penetrating your body parts with hollow point shells, you fraud
Cause vengence is mine said the lord, indeed
My own click now turns greedy
Out of twelve of my soldiers, one will decieve me
With salt in the game, shame the family and push
My black ass straight into a terrifying ambush
The whole empire's at stake
Mastering the streets, devil the mental won't break and turn snake
For pete's sake you gotta be true to the crew

Capture the beast within me, beware when it's moving deep in new york city
The diabolical gangster chronicle mob scenes in all directions
The type of connections to get your wig split
Submit the wanted signs posted, chickens spots for major knots you get
Toasted
To the head piece, I release firepower, only I'm controlling
We put in work and got the right brothers rolling
When hell kicks off we lick off
Keeping mine hard like stone from the red zone, to each his own
Smile in my face behind my back you talk trash
But my pockets hit empty and my lexus crashed
But not in your wildest dreams
Hear my name in all the scandals and all the schemes, I rest in queens
The veronville's my capital, so memorize the cuts
Then give you two more seconds to get off these nuts, it's on you

Want a dimepiece but we'll settle for an eight-fifty

Pumpin like 12 gauges from a shotgun blast

Walk around and brag about, cause I don't give a damn about
What they say, what he say, or she say
I'm addicted like drugs to your loving, but hey
You got me strung like I'm young and it's crazy
You're making me nervous, I don't deserve this, I'm Swayze
I wish I could be but you really got a hold on me
With your sex appeal, I'm telling you how I feel, shit is real
Now I don't really want to play myself so I say to myself:
""Self get a grip and don't slip""
Cause I don't want you to think I'm some clown from out of town

So you gotta show respect for me if you're checking for me

You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

Everybody knows you and they show you mad respect
You give me funny feelings with your million-dollar step
Never quiet is kept, honey always stayed dip
I'm thirsty for your love, sugar can I get a sip?
Well maybe just a taste in the place that make your face bend
And I would never try to kick it to your best friend
So what's the deal, what's the haps, where we at now?
Keeping it strong, moving it along, I'm here to show you how
So all I wanna know is what you really wanna do
I try to flex but sex ain't sex unless I'm sexing you
And I'll be swimming in some trim with a beachfront view

You need to sit back and think about what I'm saying

So you can see the arrow fly before it leaves the bow
Slow like Cupid, taken from a mobster
At night I crack her open just like a lobster
(My CL Smooth) It's all good baby
Now you know why I'm stressed when you act shady
Sometimes you chit chat, now and then hide the cat
When all I wanna do is just flip that
But there's a side to me only you can see
Only you can so believe in your man
I want you to love me in a special way
When I come home from making lucci to parlay
If you got it, good, flaunt it

Never judge a book by the cover; discover the Soul Brother 
With the Mecca Don Workin' brunette to blonde 
How many Edison Con when I respond in full black 
with us havin' the Vernon Villians back to back 

Amazing grace when I face the great paperchase 
For real it's long overdue, so I don't want to talk to you 
I stroke the hell out of mademoiselle who insisted 
every night, she get her back twisted in the unlisted 

I'm livin through my son so daddy see it this way 
I want him in the NFL, his brother in the NBA 
No doubt I with a 'piece, down in Mecca, all crazy 
to the lady, none of this is make-believe

Battle physically, conquer mentally 
Essentially, you're dealing with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, why'know, I'll take you there

C... L... what you gonna do 
You... know... you can make me Boo 
Over... and over again 
Come on, and take me there 

Control now so in the future see me callin' the shots 
From larger plots to cash to mini-bikes and open mics 
I'm blowin' up spots for knots in the millennium years 
And now I drop it on my peers, brings Tears and Fears 

And now the question manifest in my only 
My soldiers wear Versace or the army fatigue 
That brings a world of intrigue and glamor to my arsenal 
of Gods, pimps to players and layers of Deceptions 

My whole mindstate gravitate to weapon 
Makin people in the business get a misconception 
It ain't hard to the core, it ain't Sex on the Beach 
It's just another plateau the brothers have to reach 

Emphatic with non-cypher, then we were broke and misguided 
Try to gas me like Hitler once we get divided 
No question, you're dealing with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, I'll take you there

Set it so I can make em all respect my fame 
When brothers try to count all my chips in the game 
Now let me civilize your foolish acts of gunplay 
The plan of a stick man, the price in how to get away 

Chose for Negroes, the most hypnotical flows 
on the planet, another East coast track rose, God dammit 
My theme, to mainstream's the knocker 
Only time I get right as block is when my lucci's on lock 

Pretty much I'm comin through in the clutch see 
My thought is a bombshell, built to only propel 
Or is it just my style of hustle makin a mark 
To rumble the playgrounds with more danger than Jurassic Park 

It was dark, when I brought it to the light, despite 
my staff's got me takin nothin but champagne baths 
Now the aftermath's dealin with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, I'll take you there

Take me right where I want to be 
Come on 
Come on to you and me

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

There she lays, never the nonsense
The mood to watch her focus on and
Slide so she can ride the man who's born to be sextified
Study my flicks if only chicks knew the mix for better brands
When power lands the sister had other plans
The plot is set for her to wed giver her dad's permission
To marry the next boss in line in his position
Overprotective, the objective is never to leave her
Taking street, who pack the heat, now meet the Black Caesar
Bought her diamonds and furs, silky jammies isn't hers
But deep down I think a simple man she prefers
Every kiss was a death wish, every plan was a let down
Stopping in tears she pulls over by the playground
Clearing her vision, spots a game through the schoolyard fence
Sneakers squeeking, ball bouncing, looking so intense
And since her hobby was photography with nothing to do
Cool, she takes a flick or two

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

A couple of weeks go by, clocking the boys around the town
Her mommy shopping, daddy dealing, leaving night all time around
For her to execute her a level to break the family ties
To gamble her future on the love, murder, money, and lies
Watch out, the woman's about to love and claim her king
So she drove up in the ghetto looking to do her thing
Checking the brothers going crazy when the car skirts by the flow
I keep it real and peep it all from my window
So please, the lady's heading upstairs the first door
The second deliver my clothes, the third, run my tub water
Every way she represented made sense to me
When black is out of state, building spots, making lucci
The wind blows the candles, now the moon shines on my chest
But nevertheless I gently rest my head on her breast
But danger lurks in the wings based on how the cards read 'em
I think she'd better tell 'em

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

The blackest of the seeds to dawn stepping with two briefcases
Son you bless your people when you conquer like Hannibal
When I was about your age, I ran the numbers for money
I'm picturing him and John Gotti hanging in the study
I grew to be large in Crooklyn with your daddy back in the day
We were ready to take Harlem before he passed away
Women and booze, the weapon I choose then was truly major
I'm ringside with Don King when Ali fought Frazier
Scars and metals, when the mob settles I was flexing
My daughter was born so I called the X for some direction
Your father's words are like the Bible to black
But beware, he came barging in your room and you wasn't there
You let your mind wander, taste and face the search party
Left the grounds fully loaded with the tre pound
Then come in deep on the creep to find you and me
Cause you can't stop destiny

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real",Tell Me,1994

Who's styles are shit, who's gonna rock?

Rob-O brings the ghetto area
Funk flavor through your neighborhood, state, town, or borough
Stay down, I don't think I'm quite thorough
Not your average rapper (Listen)
Cause in a sec I write some shit to blast your wack ass to Mecca
See Rob's the most Mecca
To grab the microphone and yes y'all it
To school these dreds and stress these bald heads
The INI's in the house (You don't stop)
Pete Rock, Grap Luva, Mark, and Polo rising and you don't stop
We let the funk slide and let God be our guide
Flowing from the Vernon worldwide

It's the funk god, taking you worldwide, so bust it
Flowing over beats cause it's a must, kid
That I proceed to fix the hardcore in the mix
Check one two with the flow that fits
I make the hits that soar, I put the wreck in the raw
'94 in your local record store
It's Pete Rock and CL, the Main Ingredient
Now leave your wack style home, cause you won't be needing it
I grab the mic and get wreck for real
You hear me on the wax, kid, you see me on the steel
Can you feel the funk as I inject?
Then God protect it, hold the mic, see I select it
To keep it crazy versatile
But still underground, packs the four pound cause it's wild
In this place you'll find it hard to hide

Well perish the thought, there's none bigger in
This act son, Mecca is all I attract
You're wack, son, yeah your talent's a fraction
While I'm nice, as Christ, there's two religions
So envision a messiah on a mission, the competition
I'll stop your wishing point blank cause you lost it
Your joint sank, your soft style's exhausted
And now it's mandatory, you stand before me amazed and awed
Giving praise, you're the God
Rob cipher's born, most Mecca supreme
A fly MC with the self-esteem
You keep it wholesome and still I relax a bit
I play your shit out like ??? cause my wig out has to hit
I'm steadily encouraging head bops while you're scurrying to get props
I'm worldwide

Yo, check out the rhyme buster, pulling niggas through the wringer
I'm not a singer, as I conduct with one finger
It's the orchestrater, mutilator, master funktator
I've got mad flow from here to Asia
Cause I'll amaze ya with the skills that I possess
Not categorized with all the rest
So I suggest if you're in the way step aside
Cause Pete Rock is coming worldwide",Worldwide,1994
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
22 years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 years younger than my mama
But I really got beatings cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one’s a girl, let’s name her pam
Same father as the first but you don’t give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won’t down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma’s gettin' married in the house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother queen’s risin' a chapter
Deja vu, tell you what I’m gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my god

When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand poppa doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn’t bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I’m clocking pop’s liver
But you can never say that his life is through
5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
Never been senile, that’s where you’re wrong
But give the man a taste and he’s gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don’t wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he’s taking over
I said pop maybe when you’re older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good god, almighty
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of wayback, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the r-uh-o-y, how did you and I meet?
In front of big lou’s, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes in any weather
My grandmom pam holds the family together
My uncle doc’s the greatest better yet the latest
If we’re talking about a car, uncle sterling got the latest
I strive to be live ’cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my aunt joyce
So pete rock hit me, nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that’s word is bond
I’m not playin
Everybody, just coolin
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother

It’s like that y’all

You see, I'm not at ease you're diseased
A reason for the treason, hunt season I'm from rabbit ordeal
Where niggaz kick the beer loungin' off block

The hell raiser burner blazer stressin' major caution
See the Mecca Don swirvin' a tongue like Jordan

Anything you cherish I perish, I'm here to roll
And now your bucks are big, and let out ya asshole
Gun smoke when the hood is broke and need the riches
'Cause all this nigga want is more dough and more bitches

Buck, buck, buck, buck, rat, tat, tat, I'm on a mission nigga
I shoots to kill when I pull the motherfuckin' trigger
I'm sick in the head, I'm crazy I'm fuckin' wild
I swear to God, I come from the P now

Ain't nutting - it's CL Smooth
Sextafied everyday; you gotta know that this live
Let's get right to it

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

Feel the vibe, when it's bumping in my tribe, steps the Goodfellas
Live on screen now you protect the black queen
Takin my time from the black on black crime
Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doing trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, living well
And never cease to flip the hottest dimepiece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slipping off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

You want a slow wind under my ceiling fan, read books
And beat me at chess, but as for rocking you, who's the best?
It's all good and correct with no disrespect
Skirt chasing hits, taking love to Digable Planets
Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop faking me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dimepieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinking totally nude with no limits
Going through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showing nothing but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from
So feel the beat in Three-Peat like Jordan got wings
Cause I'm doing them things, listen

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

At last come the goodies, every woman got a love
Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby

I watch time stand still I`m just one man
That`s out for all so all should be for one

The son, who spun the record that his pop`s collected
Went on to create and perfect the unexpected
Funky beat sound watch the family ""Get down!""
Slide with the right and give cousin a pound
Watch the young ones play and think back in the day
When fresh was the style, plus the word to say
It`s all love now, let me show you how
to take time out, and show you what life`s about

Nine years in the mix and if time permits
I`ll continue to make my melody for the tapes
And walk the fine line between love and hate

In return, while we live and we learn then you know what it is
To only build a bigger future for the kids

In peace, in war, let's take it to the floor
Every time we take two steps the crowd takes four
Lay the heat, how I come to the street, how I cut through the beef
Let me handle that, that's why you make me chief

It's packed, what they want in this here
Can we weather the storm, six minutes, C.L. Smooth you're on

That we came out to light it up and put it in the air

The security is tight and the secretary is gorgeous

That's official, me and Pete in the lab, that's what they want
Pushin' that real hip hop up to the front
The game's been good to me, preserved my youth
Not only did it capture my goals and told me the truth

Look out my hustle, made a living, paid and driven
See why they tour around the world came to save us from prison
It's great, I rather love than hate
You think it fell out the sky, I'm here to tell you, why believe in faith

All those roses while she could smell 'em

How my mother came to her in a dream and told her

Esta basada en hechos ficticios 
Cualquier parecido o semejanza con personas 
Vivas o muertas es pura coincidencia 

La patrulla a llegado al pueblo con la noticia 
Que acabaron con Juan Gonzalez el guerrillero 
Que por fin el león de sierra reposa muerto 
La guerrilla murió con el grita un sargento 

En la cañada del muerto fue la emboscada cogieron 
A la guerrilla hambrienta y cansada ay 

En un bohío monte adentro se escucha el llanto
De una mujer con un niño que esta en pañales 

Con ella lloran también los pobres del mundo

Una carreta va andando
Y un hombre tan salomando 
Contra de sudor y sueños

Yo trabajo pá mi dueño

Y en el mundo no hay ninguno 
Que en mi pueda encaramarse 

Soy mi propio mayoral

Y a quien trate de obligarme 
Conversa con mi puñal 

Para el bien o para el mal

Del campo vengo compadre

Yo soy del lado del espino 
Y todos los viejos cuentan 
Que no respeto lo mientan

De mi tierra sale el sol
Y por la noche la luna 
Y no existe lengua alguna 
Que me niegue la razón 
Que tengo el alma de aguas clara 
Y mano curtida en cuero oh oh oh 

Es mi descarga par que baile 
Es mi descarga para que goce

Goza que goza mi descarga gózala 

Para aquellos que no se acuerdan de las amistades 
Yo le vengo a inspirar este pequeño pedacito 
Para que se lo repitan a cualquiera cuando sea 
Cuando llegue la oportunidad 
Oye que tumbaó mas rico 

Me extraña que no te acuerdes 
Si con el correr de los años 
Hagan parecerte extraño 
Los rostros que ya conoces 

No te acuerdas de la voces 
Que calmaban tus pesares
Cuanto tienes cuanto vales 
Ese es tu pensar de ahora 

Pero va a llegar la hora 
Que establece la verdad
Y entonces comprenderás 
Lo inmensos de tu errores 

Para conseguir las flores 
Podrán perfumar tu ambiente 
Dar de entender a tu mente 
En tu cuarto de madera

Nadie puede con la muerte 
Que de la tierra saliste

I wonder why
I'm standing now where you made your vow
So blue for you I could cry

Leaves come tumbling down round my head
Some of them are brown some are red
Beautiful to see, but reminding me
Of a faded summer love

Weighing high above in the trees
They were so in love with the breeze
Now the autumn wind brings to them the end
Of a faded summer love

I'm like the poor leaves that swayed with the breeze
I thought that life was sweet 
You are the sweet breeze that tried hard to please
Then swept me off my feet

Pete Rugolo,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice,
Warmer than the Summer night.
The clouds were like an alabaster palace,
Rising to a snowy height.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.

Pete Rugolo,"In the spring when the feeling was chronic
And my caution was leaving you flat,
I should have made use of the tonic
Before you gave me that!
A mental deficient you'll grade me.
I've given you plenty of data.
You came, you saw and you slayed me,
And that-a is that-a!

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all.
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will,
You've made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me!
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow.
So what's the use,
You've cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me!

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near.

Just a babe in arms where you're concerned,
So lock the doors
And call me yours

When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone, of course;
It can't be a sister or brother

With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal.
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day.

There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found.
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around.

O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be,
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me.

The sun was hot that day,
So he said, ""Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away.""

Down to the village,
With a broomstick in his hand,
Running here and there all
Around the square saying,
Catch me if you can.

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop.
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""

For Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye saying,
""Don't you cry,
I'll be back again some day.""

Those come what may places 
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life 
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces 
With distant gay traces 
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away 
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales. 

Then you came along with your siren of song 
To tempt me to madness! 
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness 
Of a great love for me. 

Ah yes! I was wrong
Again, 
I was wrong. 

Life is lonely again, 
And only last year everything seemed so sure. 
Now life is awful again, 
A thoughtful of hearts could only be a bore.

While yet you are still burning inside my brain.

Oh Lord, how they did love
Swore to be true to each other true as the stars above
He was her man but he wouldn't do her wrong.

Now Frankie went down to the corner
Just for a bucket of beer
She said Mr Bartender has my loving Johnny been here
He's my man, he wouldn't do me wrong.

I don't want to cause you no trouble
Woman, I ain't gonna lie
But I saw your lover an hour ago
With a girl named Nellie Blie
He's your man but he's doin' you wrong.

Now Frankie looked over the transom
She saw to her surprise
There on the cab sat Johnny
Making love to Nellie Blie
He's my man, but he's doin' me wrong.

Frankie threw back her comona
Took out her little 44
Rutty too-too three times she shot right through
That hardwood door
Shot her man, he was doin' her wro

Now bring out your rubber tired hearses
Bring out your rubber tired hack
I'm taken said the man to the graveyard
But only six of 'em called him back
He was my man but he done me wrong.

Bring round a thousand policemen
Bring 'em around today
To lock me down in that dungeon cell
And throw that key away
I shot my man, he was doin' me wrong.

Now Frankie she said to the warden
What are they goin' to do
The warden he said to Frankie
It's the electric chair for you
You shot your man, he was doin' you wrong.

This story has no end

Some of the troubles that bothered my mind
And a lot of good people that I've left behind, singing

I asked the man how his butter was sold

So long, it's been good to know ya
What a long time since I've been home
And I've gotta be driftin' along

My telephone rang and it jumped off the wall
That was the preacher makin' his call
He said, ""we're waiting to tie the knot
You're getting married believe it or not""

The church was jammed and the church was packed
The pews were crowded from the front to the back
A thousand of friends waiting to kiss my new bride
But I was so anxious I rushed her outside, told her

To a city fair rode I.
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by.
No pipe did hum, no battle drum did sound it's loud tattoo.
But the Angelus Bells o'er the Liffey swells rang out in the foggy dew.
Right proudly high in Dublin town
Hung they out a flag of war.
'Twas better to die 'neath that Irish sky
Than at Sulva or Sud el Bar.
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with their long range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew.
Their bravest fell and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide in the
Springing of the year.
While the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men but few.
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew.
And back through the glen
I rode again.
And my heart with grief was sore.
For I parted then with valiant men
Whom I never shall see n'more.
But to and fro in my dreams I go
And I kneel and pray for you.
For slavery fled the glorious dead
When you fell in the foggy dew.",The Foggy Dew,1961

Do all that you can to help mom.

Trapped down in this hell hole of fire.

He'll work and he'll fight and he'll fix up the mines,
So fire can't kill daddy no more.

Pete Seeger,"Farethee well Old Joe Clark
Farethee well I say
Farethe well Old Joe Clark
I'm bound go go away
I will not go to Old Joe's house
I'll tell ya the reason why
Every floor in Old Joes's house
Is filled with chicken pie
Old Joe Clark he did take sick
And what do ya think ailed him?
He drank a churn of butter milk
And then his stomach failed him
I will not marry an old maid
And I'll tell ya the reason why
Her neck's so long and stringy boys
I'm afraid she'll never die
Old Joe Clark he did get drunk
And he sat down to his supper
He leaned over at the dinner table
And stoved his nose in the butter",Old Joe Clark,1962
Pete Seeger,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

Roll on, Columbia, roll on

Down her wild mountains and canyons she flew
Canadian Northwest to the oceans so blue
Roll on Columbia, roll on

Yakima, Snake, and the Klickitat, too
Sandy Willamette and Hood River too

An empire he saw in the Pacific Northwest
Sent Lewis and Clark and they did the rest
So roll on, Columbia, roll on

It's there on your banks that we fought many a fight
Sheridan's boys in the blockhouse that night
They saw us in death but never in flight
So roll on Columbia, roll on

At Bonneville now there are ships in the locks
The waters have risen and cleared all the rocks
Shiploads of plenty will steam past the docks
So roll on, Columbia, roll on

And on up the river is Grand Coulee Dam
The mightiest thing ever built by a man
To run the great factories and water the land
So roll on, Columbia, roll on

Matching their strength 'gainst the river's wild flight
Through rapids and falls, they won the hard fight

Pete Seeger,"Ira Hayes,
Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land

Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparklin' water stopped

Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

[Chorus]

There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill,
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

[Chorus]

Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored; Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance

[Chorus]

Then Ira started drinkin' hard;
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!

He died drunk one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

[Chorus]

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died",The Ballad of Ira Hayes,1963

Pete Seeger,"There was once a farmer, walking down the road whistling a tune to himself. 
He said, ""Dog-gone, I wish I had some words to that tune. 
But all I've got is the melody."" Just then he came to a little bridge, 
And he leaned on the railing looking down at the brook. 
There was a big old bullfrog, hopping from bank to bank. 

Well, the bullfrog looked up and saw the farmer and decided to show off. 
He took an extra special big hop - z-z-z-z-tt! 
He landed, splash! in the water and got himself all wet. 
The farmer laughed and laughed and started singing
""Way down south in the yankety-yank, a bull frog jumped from bank to bank, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do! 
He stubbed his toe and fell in the water,
You could hear him yell for a mile and a quarter, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do.""

Now the farmer went walking down the road 
Feeling mighty proud of himself for making up a song. 
He went down to the corner store, bought himself some groceries, 
A pair of work gloves and a plug of chewing tobacco, and said, 
""Oh, before I go, I have to sing you my new song.""

""Go on home,"" says the storekeeper, 
""I'm busy here, can't you see all these customers?""

""I won't pay you any money unless you let me sing you my song!""

""Well, sing it and get it over with then,"" 
Said the storekeeper.

The farmer began to sing and the man in the store cried out, 
""That's a w-o-o-nderful song, gather round everybody, 
We'll have a party."" And he passed round the free Coca Colas 
And the free soda-crackers, and everyone was stamping on the floor.

Meanwhile, all the wives and children back home 
Were sitting down to supper, and, where's father?

The mother said, 
""Children, you better run down to the corner store and fetch your old man. 
He's probably down there wasting his time as usual.""

So all the children run down the road. 
They run inside the corner store. 
You know, they heard all that music, 
They forgot about coming home. 
The children started singing 

And they were passing around the free Coca-Colas and 

Now, in every farmhouse it was the same situation. 
The mother said to themselves, ""This has gone far enough. 
Supper's getting cold. 'Spect us to work all the day nobody show up?""

They reached over on the stove 
And grabbed some heavy frying pans 
And start down the road with a mad look in their eyes. 
Somebody's going to get beaned.

Well, they get near and they hear all that pretty music, 
And they forget all about being mad. 
They drop the frying pans in the gutter, 
Walk into the store, and the mothers start singing! 
Way down yonder in the yankety-yank, 
A bullfrog jumped from bank to bank 
And they're passing round the free Coca-Colas 
And the free soda crackers, 
And everybody is stamping on the floor!

Meanwhile out in the barns all the cows started talking, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be milked and it's getting mighty uncomfortable!"" 
So the cows left their stalls, they wobbled out of the barn, 
And down the road right into the corner store. 
And the cows started singing, 
""Moo, moo, moo, moo, moo moo, moo, moo, moo, moo."" 

And the cow's tails were swishing out the windows, 
And they were stamping on the floor,
And drinking the free Coca-Colas and eating the free soda 

Out in the barnyard all the chickens said, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be fed and we're getting hungry!"" 
So the chickens hopped over the fence, 
Hopped down the road, hopped into the store, 
And the chickens started; (Chicken imitation to tune). 
And the chicken were stamping on the floor and drinking the free Coca C 

Meanwhile all the barns started talking to each other. 
""We feel mighty lonely,"" they said, ""without any cows or any chickens. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
So the barns picked themselves off their foundations and galumphed down the road, 
And s-q-u-e-e-z-e-d themselves into that corner store, 
Believe it or not. Did you ever hear a rusty hinge on a barn door? 
That's the way the barns sang

Out in the fields all the grass says, 
""Where is everybody? The cows are supposed to come and eat us. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
And the grass picked itself up and swished off down the road, 
And swished right into the store and started singing

Of course, when the grass was gone, the fields were gone, 
So the brook didn't have any banks to flow between. 
It said, ""I've got to go someplace,"" 
So it bubbled down the road. 
It bubbled right up into the corner store and the brook started
Bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl.

The brook was bubbling up and down the stairway! 
The grass was growing out the chimney! 
Feathers flying through the air! 
Cows tails swishing through the windows! 
Everybody stamping on the floor 
And drinking the free Coca-Cola 
And eating the free soda-crackers!

Meanwhile, there's the bullfrog in mid-air!

He looks down, there's nothing underneath him. 
He looks over and there's no bank to land on. 
He says, ""Where am I?""
And he starts hopping down the road. 
Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop!

""Hey, what's all that racket down at the corner store?"" says the frog.

""Why 
They're singing! 
They're singing about ME!"" 
And he was so proud he puffed himself up with pride.

And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he boom!

He exploded. 
Cows, barns, chickens, farmers, the whole corner store went up in the air, 
And everybody floated down 
And landed right where they were supposed to have been all the time. 
They all sat down eating supper again, 
Feeling kind of foolish for themselves.

Next day they went out to find the frog. 
They looked high, they looked low. 
Coca-Cola bottles and soda crackers in all directions. 
But no frog.

So all there is left of the frog is the song. 
We might as well sing 'er once again.

He felt their blinding hatred, and he tried to save their lives
And the answer that they gave him was their fists and feet and knives

It isn't too near and it's not far away.
It's not a place where I'd want to stay.

[Chorus:]
Now the people are scratching all over the street
Because the rabbits had nothing to eat.

The winter came in with a cold icy blast.
It killed off the flowers and killed off the grass.
The rabbits were starving because of the freeze.
They started eating the bark off the trees.

[Chorus]

The farmers said, ""This sort of thing just won't do.
Our trees will be dead when the rabbits get through.
We'll have to poison the rabbits, it's clear;
Or we'll have no crops to harvest next year.""

[Chorus]

So they brought the poison and spread it around.
And soon dead rabbits began to be found.
Dogs ate the rabbits and the farmers just said,
""We'll poison those rabbits 'til the last dog is dead.""

[Chorus]

Up in the sky there were meat-eating fowls.
The dead rabbits poisoned the hawks and the owls.
Thousands of field mice the hawks used to chase
Were multiplying all over the place.

[Chorus]

The fields and the meadows were barren and brown.
The mice got hungry and moved into town.
The city folks took the farmer's advise
And all of them started to poison the mice.

[Chorus]

There were dead mice in all the apartments and flats.
The cats ate the mice and the mice killed the cats.
The smell was awful and I'm glad to say
I wasn't the man hired to haul them away.

[Chorus]

All through the country and all through the town
There wasn't a dog or cat to be found.
The fleas asked each other, ""Where can we stay?""
They've been on the people from then 'til this day.

[Chorus]

All you small creatures that live in this land
Stay clear of the man with the poisonous hand!
A few bails of hay might keep you alive
But he'll pay more to kill you than let you survive.

[Chorus]",The People Are Scratching,1966
Pete Seeger,"Come and take a walk with me through this green and growing land
Walk through the meadows and the mountains and the sand
Walk through the valleys and the rivers and the plains
Walk through the sun and walk through the rain

Here is a land full of power and glory
Beauty that words cannot recall
Oh her power shall rest on the strength of her freedom
Her glory shall rest on us all (on us all)

From Colorado, Kansas, and the Carolina's too
Virginia and Alaska, from the old to the new
Texas and Ohio and the California shore
Tell me, who could ask for more?

Yet she's only as rich as the poorest of her poor
Only as free as the padlocked prison door
Only as strong as our love for this land
Only as tall as we stand

They twist away our freedom & they twist away our fate
Fear is their weapon and treason is their cry
We can stop them if we try",The Power and the Glory,1966

Take warning how you court your men
They're like a star on a summer morning

I never would've courted none
I'd a lock my heart in a box of golden
And fastened it up with silver pin

I wish I were some little sparrow
And I had wings and I could fly
I'd fly away to my false true lover
And when he'd speak, I would deny

But I am not some little swallow
I have no wings, neither can I fly
So I will sit down here to weep in sorrow
And try to pass my troubles by

Oh don't you remember our days of courting
When your head lay upon my breast
You could make me believe by the falling of your arm
That the sun rose in the west

Pete Seeger,"My name is Lisa Kalvelage, I was born in Nuremberg
And when the trials were held there nineteen years ago
It seemed to me ridiculous to hold a nation all to blame
For the horrors that the world did undergo
A short while later when I applied to be a G. I. bride
An American consular official questioned me
He refused my exit permit, said my answers did not show
I'd learned my lesson about responsibility.

Thus suddenly I was forced to start thinking on this theme
And when later I was permitted to emigrate
I must have been asked a hundred times where I was and what I did
In those years when Hitler ruled our state
I said I was a child or at most a teen-ager
But that only extended the questioning
They'd ask, where were my parents, my father, my mother
And to this I could answer not a thing.

The seed planted there at Nuremberg in 1947
Started to sprout and to grow
Gradually I understood what that verdict meant to me
When there are crimes that I can see and I can know
And now I also know what it is to be charged with mass guilt
Once in a lifetime is enough for me
No, I could not take it for a second time
And that is why I am here today.

The events of May 25th, the day of our protest,
Put a small balance weight on the other side
Hopefully, someday my contribution to peace
Will help just a bit to turn the tide
And perhaps I can tell my children six
And later on their own children
That at least in the future they need not be silent
When they are asked, ""Where was your mother, when?""",My Name Is Liza Kalvelage,1967
Pete Seeger,"I think of Andy in the cold wet clay

So I ask the killers can you see those three again
Those three are on my mind

I see dark eyed Michael
With his dark eyed bride
Those three are on my mind
And three proud mothers
Weeping side by side
Those three are on my mind

But I'm grieving yet
And for some the sky is bright
I cannot give up hoping
For a morning light
So I ask the killers do you sleep at night

I see tin roof shanties
Where my brothers live
Those three are on my mind
And the little burnt out churches
Where they sing we forgive

I know the price of liberty
Now I ask the question that is deep inside of me
Did they also burn the courthouse

Pete Seeger,"It was back in nineteen forty-two,
I was a member of a good platoon.
We were on maneuvers in-a Louisiana,
One night by the light of the moon.
The captain told us to ford a river,
That's how it all begun.
We were -- knee deep in the Big Muddy,
But the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, ""Sir, are you sure,
This is the best way back to the base?""
""Sergeant, go on! I forded this river
'Bout a mile above this place.
It'll be a little soggy but just keep slogging.
We'll soon be on dry ground.""
We were, waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, ""Sir, with all this equipment
No man will be able to swim.""
""Sergeant, don't be a Nervous Nellie,""
The Captain said to him.
""All we need is a little determination;
Men, follow me, I'll lead on.""
We were, neck deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

All at once, the moon clouded over,
We heard a gurgling cry.
A few seconds later, the captain's helmet
Was all that floated by.
The Sergeant said, ""Turn around men!
I'm in charge from now on.""
And we just made it out of the Big Muddy
With the captain dead and gone.

We stripped and dived and found his body
Stuck in the old quicksand.
I guess he didn't know that the water was deeper
Than the place he'd once before been.
Another stream had joined the Big Muddy
'Bout a half mile from where we'd gone.
We were lucky to escape from the Big Muddy
When the big fool said to push on.

Well, I'm not going to point any moral,
I'll leave that for yourself
Maybe you're still walking, you're still talking
You'd like to keep your health.
But every time I read the papers
That old feeling comes on;
We're, waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.

Waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.
Waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.

Tall man'll be over his head, we're

Sailng down my golden river
Sun and water all my own
Yet I was never alone

Sun and water, old life givers
L'll have them where ere I roam
And I was not far from home

Sunlight glancing on the water
Life and death are all my own
Yet I was never alone

Life for all my sons and daughters
Golden sparkles in the foam
And I was not far from home

Sailing down this winding highway
Travelers from near and far
And I was never alone

Exploring all the little byways
Sighting all the distant stars
And I was not far from home

Sailing down my golden river
Sun and water all my own
Yet I was never alone

Pete Seeger,"Twas in the merry month of May
When green buds all were swelling,
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling,
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen.

So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him,
And the only words to him did say
Young man I think you're dying.

He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling,
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen.

When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard hearted Barbara Allen.

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow.

And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow.

Sweet William was buried beside her,
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar.

Pete Seeger,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

That the cats with the bugs were there
And you never go along with that kind of stuff nowhere
But that just isn't the point man
That's the wrong wrong way to go
If you didn't know about that one, well then what else don't you know
You said that you were lied to
Well that ain't hard too see
But you must have been fooled again by your friends across the sea
And maybe you were fooled again by your people here at home
Because nobody could talk like you
And know what's going on
Nobody elected your family
And we didn't elect your friends
No one voted for your advisers 
And nobody wants the men
You're the one we voted for, so you must take the blame
For handing out authority to men who were insane
You say its all fixed up now, you've got new guys on the line
But you had better remember this while you still got the time
Mothers still are weeping for their boys that went to war
Father still are asking what the whole damn thing was for 
And People still are hungry and people still are poor
And on this week of work these days don't feed the kids no more
Schools are still like prison
'Cause we don't learn how to live
And everybody wants to take, nobody wants to give
Yes you will be remembered, be remembered very well
And if I live a long life, all the stories I could tell
A mans who falls in poverty of sickness and of grief
Hell yes
You will be remembered, be remembered very well
You said you didn't know
That the that the cats with the bugswere there

Gonna make this garden grow
Gonna mulch it deep and low
Gonna make it fertile ground

Inch by inch, row by row
Please bless these seeds I sow
Please keep them safe below
'Til the rain comes tumbling down

Pullin' weeds and pickin' stones
We are made of dreams and bones
Need a place to call my own
'Cause the time is close at hand

Grain for grain, sun and rain
Find my way in nature's chain
Till my body and my brain
Tell the music of the land

Inch by inch, row by row

Gonna mulch it deep and low
Gonna make it fertile ground

Plant your rows straight and long
Season with a prayer and song
Mother Earth will make you strong
If you give her loving care

Inch by inch, row by row
Gonna make this garden grow
Gonna mulch it deep and low
Gonna make it fertile ground

Slug by slug, weed by weed
Boy this garden's got me t'd
All the insects come to feed
On my tomato plants

Sunburt face, skined up knees
The kitchen's chocked with zucchinis
I'm shopping at the A&P's
Next time I get the chance

Old crow watching from a tree
He's got his hungry eye on me
In my garden I'm as free
As that feathered thief up there

Gonna make this garden grow
Gonna mulch it deep and low
Gonna make it fertile ground

Pete Seeger,"Come and listen to my story, come and listen to my song. 
I'll tell you of a hero, he's now dead and gone
He was the bravest union boy that I have ever seen
Expecting to be shot on site, or taken for a ride 
By them dirty coal operators
A'shootin down the union men wherever they were found
Gave his life in struggle
That was all that he could do 
He died for the union, 
Also for me and you.",Harry Simms,1979
Pete Seeger,"When I was a little girl I wished I was a boy
I tagged along behind the gang and wore my corduroys.
Everybody said I only did it to annoy
But I was gonna be an engineer.

Mamma said, ""Why can't you be a lady?
Your duty is to make me the mother of a pearl
Wait until you're older, dear
And maybe you'll be glad that you're a girl.

Dainty as a Dresden statue, gentle as a Jersey cow,
Smooth as silk, gives cream and milk
Learn to coo, learn to moo
That's what you do to be a lady, now.

When I went to school I learned to write and how to read
History, geography and home economy
And typing is a skill that every girl is sure to need
To while away the extra time until the time to breed
And then they had the nerve to ask, what would I like to be?
I says, ""I'm gonna be an engineer!""

""No, you only need to learn to be a lady
The duty isn't yours, for to try to run the world
An engineer could never have a baby
Remember, dear, that you're a girl""

She's smart, for a woman.
I wonder how she got that way?
You get no choice, you get no voice
Just stay mum, pretend you're dumb.
That's how you come to be a lady, today.

Well, I started as a typist but I studied on the sly
Working out the day and night so I could qualify
And every time the boss came in, he pinched me on the thigh
Said, ""I've never had an engineer!""
""You owe it to the job to be a lady
The duty of the staff is to give the boss a whirl
The wages that you get are crummy, maybe
But it's all you get, 'cause you're a girl""

Then Jimmy came along and we set up a conjugation
We were busy every night with loving recreation
I spent my days at work so he could get an education
And now he's an engineer!

He said: ""I know you'll always be a lady
The duty of my darling is to love me all her life
Could an engineer look after or obey me?
Remember, dear, that you're my wife!""

As soon a Jimmy got a job, I studied hard again
Then busy at me turret-lathe a year or two, and then
The morning that the twins were born, Jimmy says to them
""Your mother was an engineer!""
""You owe it to the kids to be a lady
Dainty as a dish-rag, faithful as a chow
Stay at home, you got to mind the baby
Remember you're a mother now!""

Every time I turn around there's something else to do
Cook a meal or mend a sock or sweep a floor or two
Listening to Jimmy Young, it makes me want to spew
I was gonna be an engineer.

I only wish that I could be a lady
I'd do the lovely things that a lady's supposed to do
I wouldn't even mind if only they would pay me
Then I could be a person too.

What price for a woman?
You can buy her for a ring of gold,
To love and obey, without any pay,
You get a cook and a nurse for better or worse
You don't need a purse when a lady is sold.

Oh, but now the times are harder and me Jimmy's got the sack;
I went down to Vicker's, they were glad to have me back.
But I'm a third-class citizen, my wages tell me that
But I'm a first-class engineer!

The boss he says ""We pay you as a lady,
You only got the job because I can't afford a man,
With you I keep the profits high as may be,
You're just a cheaper pair of hands.""

You got one fault, you're a woman
You're not worth the equal pay.
A bitch or a tart, you're nothing but heart,
Shallow and vain, you've got no brain,

Well, I listened to my mother and I joined a typing pool
Listened to my lover and I put him through his school
If I listen to the boss, I'm just a bloody fool
And an underpaid engineer
I been a sucker ever since I was a baby
As a daughter, as a mother, as a lover, as a dear
But I'll fight them as a woman, not a lady
I'll fight them as an engineer!",I'm Gonna Be an Engineer,1979
Pete Seeger,"First you get the buckets ready, clean the pans and gather firewood,
Late in the winter, it's maple syrup time.
You need warm and sunny days but still a cold and freezing nighttime
For just a few weeks, maple syrup time.
We boil and boil and boil and boil it all day long,
Till ninety seven percent of water evaporates just like this song
And when what is left is syrupy don't leave it too long
Watch out for burning! Maple syrup time.

I know it's not the quickest system but each year I can't resist it.
Get out the buckets, and tap the trees in time
Making it is half the fun, and satisfaction when it's done.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time.
My grandpa says perhaps it's just a waste of time.
Ah! but no more than this attempt to make a happy little rhyme,
So pat your feet or swing your tail, but keep in good time.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time.

I'll send this song around the world with love to every boy and girl,
Hoping they don't mind a little advice in rhyme.
As in life or revolution, rarely is there a quick solution,
Anything worthwhile takes a little time.
We boil and boil and boil and boil it all day long.
When what is left is syrupy, don't leave it on the flame too long.
But seize the minute, build a new world, sing an old song.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time",Maple Syrup Time,1979

Sittin' on his papa's knee.
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel;
Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.

The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,

Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.

John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor
Heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord,

And neither have I wings to fly,
Give me a boat that can carry two,

A ship there was, and she sails the sea,
She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in,
And I know not how, I sink or swim.

I leaned my back up against some young oak,
Thinking he was a trusty tree,
But first he bended and then he broke,
And thus did my false love to me.

I put my hand into some soft bush,
Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
I pricked my finger to the bone,
And left the sweetest flower alone.

Oh, love is handsome, love is fine,
Gay as a jewel, when first it is new,
But love grows old, and waxes cold,
And fades away, like summer dew.

I hear the truth, it live'th.
What through the darkness round me close,
Songs in the night it give'th.
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging.
Since love is lord of Heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?

When tyrants tremble, sick with fear,
And hear their death-knell ringing,
When friends rejoice both far and near,

Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight
And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight
What the dollar used to get us now won't buy a head of lettuce
No the economic forecast isn't right
But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray
I can even glimpse a new and better way
And I've devised a plan of action worked it down to the last fraction
And I'm going into action here today

CHORUS:
I am changing my name to Chrysler
I am going down to Washington D.C.
I will tell some power broker
What they did for Iacocca
Will be perfectly acceptable to me
I am changing my name to Chrysler
I am headed for that great receiving line
So when they hand a million grand out
I'll be standing with my hand out
Yes sire I'll get mine

When my creditors are screaming for their dough
I'll be proud to tell them all where they can all go
They won't have to scream and holler
They'll be paid to the last dollar
Where the endless streams of money seem to flow
I'll be glad to tell them what they can do
It's a matter of a simple form or two
It's not just renumeration it's a liberal education
Ain't you kind of glad that I'm in debt to you

CHORUS

Since the first amphibians crawled out of the slime
We've been struggling in an unrelenting climb
We were hardly up and walking before money started talking
And it's sad that failure is an awful crime
Well it's been that way for a millennium or two
But now it seems that there's a different point of view
If you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic
Down to congress there's a safety net for you

All my bone and sinew take
Put me in the compost pile
To decompose me for a while.

Returning me to common clay
All that I am will feed the trees
And little fishes in the seas.

You may be having me for lunch
And then excrete me with a grin,

Looked into your eyes this morning
You were far away
You must have known I was looking for you
You knew you couldn't stay
All these winds blowin' on me
Blowing in the nighttime lonely
Blew on over the ocean to you
Blew my words away

Put on your heavenly shoes babe
Walk around the clouds
You know that's where I'm bound to be now
I'm coming with the crowds
All these faces looking at me
Looking through me I don't mind
I just seen your face a-worrying
I loved you when you cried

Take my hand across the water
You won't leave no tracks behind
Step all over the moon lit ocean
It's only in your mind
All these thoughts just rip me
Who can heal a heart that's broken
Like the winds that blow unspoken
Blow my love away

You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you.
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong,
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long.
You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.

It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.

Now you know you're underpaid but the boss says you ain't;
He speeds up the work 'til you're 'bout to faint.
You may be down and out, but you ain't beaten,
You can pass out a leaflet and call a meetin'.
Talk it over, speak your mind,
Decide to do somethin' about it.

Course, the boss may persuade some poor damn fool
To go to your meetin' and act like a stool.
But you can always tell a stool, though, that's a fact,
He's got a yaller streak a-runnin' down his back.
He doesn't have to stool, he'll always get along
On what he takes out of blind men's cups.

You got a union now, and you're sittin' pretty,
Put some of the boys on the steering committee.
The boss won't listen when one guy squawks,
But he's got to listen when the union talks.
He'd better, be mighty lonely
Everybody decide to walk out on him.

Suppose they're working you so hard it's just outrageous
And they're paying you all starvation wages.
You go to the boss and the boss would yell,
""Before I raise your pay I'd see you all in hell.""
Well, he's puffing a big seegar, feeling mighty slick
'Cause he thinks he's got your union licked.
Well, he looks out the window and what does he see
But a thousand pickets, and they all agree:
He's a bastard, unfair, slavedriver,
Bet he beats his wife!

Now, boys, you've come to the hardest time.
The boss will try to bust your picket line.
He'll call out the police, the National Guard,
They'll tell you it's a crime to have a union card.
They'll raid your meetin', they'll hit you on the head,
They'll call every one of you a goddam red,
Unpatriotic, Japanese spies, sabotaging national defense!

But out at Ford, here's what they found,
And out at Vultee, here's what they found,
And out at Allis-Chalmers, here's what they found,
And down at Bethlehem, here's what they found:
That if you don't let red-baiting break you up,
And if you don't let stoolpigeons break you up,
And if you don't let vigilantes break you up,
And if you don't let race hatred break you up,
You'll win. What I mean, take it easy, but take it!",Talking Union,1986
Pete Seeger,"There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
And when the Legion boys come 'round
She always stood her ground.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard
And this is what she'd say

You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

He carried two guns ev'ry day.
He shot down a man on that West Virginia line,

John Hardy stood in that old baroom,
So drunk that he could not see.

Poor boy, Johnny, come and walk along with me.""
John Hardy stood in his old jail cell,
The tears running down from his eyes.
He said, ""I've been the death of many a poor boy.
But my six-shooters never told a lie,
No, my six-shooters never told a lie.
The first one to visit John Hardy in his cell
Was a little girl dressed in blue.
She came down to that old jail cell,
She said, ""Johnny, I've been true to you.
God knows, Johnny, I've been true to you.""
The next one to visit John Hardy in his cell,
Was a little girl dressed in red.
She came down to that old jail cell,
She said, ""Johnny, I had rather see you dead,
Well, Johnny, I had rather see you dead.""
""I've been to the East and I've been to the West,
I've traveled this wide world around,
I've been to that river and I've been baptized,
So take me to my burying ground,
So take me to my burying ground.""

Have room for all of His children
As long as we do share His love

And see that all are free to grow
And see that all are free to know
And free to open or to close

What is a room without a door
Which sometimes locks or stands ajar?
What is a room without a wall
To keep out sight and sound from all?

And dwellers in each room should have
The right to choose their own design
And color schemes to suit their own
Though differing from mine

Yes and each door has its own design
To suit the owners state of mind

If we could heed these early warnings
The time is now quite early morning
If we could heed these early warnings

Some say that humankind won't long endure
But what makes them so doggone sure?

Could make those freedom bells go ringing

And so keep on while we live
Until we have no, no more to give
And when these fingers can strum no longer
Hand the old banjo to young ones stronger
And when these fingers can strum no longer

Pete Seeger,"Jesse James was a lad that killed many a man
He robbed the Danville train
He stole from the rich and he gave to the poor
He'd a hand, a heart, and a brain

Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor
He couldn't see a brother suffer pain
And with his brother Frank he robbed the Springfield bank
And he stopped the Glendale train

Poor Jesse had a wife, a lady all her life
And three children, they were so brave
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid ol' Jesse James in his grave

It was Robert Ford, the dirty little coward
And I wonder how he feels
For he slept in Jesse's bed and he ate o' Jesse's bread
But he laid Jesse James in his grave  

It was with his brother Frank that he robbed the Gallatin Bank
An' carried the money from the town
It was at that very place that they had a little chase
For they shot ol' Captain Sheets to the ground

Poor Jesse had a wife to morn for his life
And three children, they were so brave
But that dirty lettle coward that shot Mr. Joward
Has laid ol' Jesse James in his grave  

They went to a crossing, not very far from there
And there they did the same 
For the agent on his knees delivered up the keys
To the outlaws, Frank an' Jesse James  

It was on a Wednesday night, not a star was in sight
When they robbed the Glendale train
Those people, they did say for many miles away
It was robbed by Frank an' Jesse James 

Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life
And three children, they were so brave
But that dirty lettle coward that shot Mr. Joward
Has laid ol' Jesse James in his grave 

Then on a Saturday night, Jesse was at home
Just talking with his family brave
When Robert Ford came along like a thief in the night
And laid poor Jesse in his grave

Now, the people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death
They wondered how he came to die
It was one of his own gang called little Robert Ford
An' he shot Jesse James on the sly

Poor Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life
And three children, they were so brave
But that dirty lettle coward that shot Mr. Joward
Has laid ol' Jesse James in his grave

Jesse went to his rest with his hand upon his breast
And there are many who never saw his face
He was born one day in the County of Clay
And he came from a solitary race

This song was made by Billy Gashade
As soon as the news did arrive
He said there's no one man with the law in his hand
Could ever take ol' Jesse James alive  

Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn his life
An' his children too, they were brave
But that dirty little coward shot Mr. Howard
An' laid Jesse James in his grave

Oh, they laid poor Jesse in his grave, yes, Lord
They laid Jesse James in his grave
Oh, he took from the rich and he gave to the poor
But, they laid Jesse James in his grave",Jesse James,1989

And I set down with my fishing pole
Somethin' grabb'd my hook and it got my bait
And jerked me out in the middle of the lake
Some jump 
I got sunk, baptized on credit

Fishin' down on th' muddy bank
Felt a pull an' give a big yank
I holed out three old rubber boots
A Ford radiator an' a Chevrolet coop
I handed it in
For National Defence

Settin' in a boat with a bucket of beer
Hadn't caught nuthin' but didn't much care
I guess I was pretty well satisfied
Had my little lady right by my side
Takin' it easy, yeah still waitin'
Worm been gone off-a that hook for a couple of hours

You go fishin', tell y' what to do
Go set down by the grassy dew
Take a piece of string, tie it on yo' pole
And throw it way out in th' middle of th' hole
Find you a good shady tree and then just set down
Go to sleep, forget all about it

Jumped in the river and went down deep
There was a hundred pound cat-fish lying there asleep
I jumped on his back and rode him all aroun'
Saddled him up and I came into town
People came runnin', lookin', dogs a-barkin'
Kids a-squallin'

Stagnate water's a stinkin' thing
Slick on top and all turned green
When the water goes bad, the fish all run
Sit all day and not catch a-one
Mud wallopers, jewgars
A few little suckers

I waded out to a sandy bar
And I caught myself a big alligator gar
Brung him home across my back
Tail was dragging a mile and a half
Flippin' and floppin'
Sold him for a quarter
Shot craps, got in jail

Early one mornin', I took me a notion
To go out a-fishin' in the middle of the ocean
Throwed out my line, I caught me a shark
I didn't get him home 'til way past dark
He's man-eater, tough customer
Just wasn't quite tough enough

Last last night I had me a dream
I was out fishin' in a whiskey stream
Baited my hook with apple-jack

Moon rolls through the nighttime;

The years keep rollin' by.

It seems like I've been here before;
I can't remember when;

That we'll all be together again.

And all my roads have bends;
There's no clear-cut beginnings;
And so far no dead-ends.

I guess you done the same;
