Ghostface Killah,"[Chorus]
Pass another shot of that Patron
Shorty I'm goin', why chu goin' with me
After this, tonight I'm goin' home
You wanna come, shorty come with me
Now I wanna see you get your hands up
Shorty wanna shake it for me
Ladies if you with me, get your hands up
Shake it, shake it, shake it for me

Lil nasty bitch
Cute face, slim waist, nice ass and tits
It's a damn shame that lil' sweet thing ain't nothin' but a freak thing
""In Love With A Stripper"" like T-Pain
Er' weekday, up in the club like Lis' Raye
Makin' niggas make it rain like Lil Wayne
Boy, mami tottsie rollin' that pole
I ain't Peedi Peedi baby, I just know what I know
Call me Iceberg baby, Pimpin' Ken on a stroll
Got the right one baby, wouldn't give you a cold
No, but I could give you the coat
Pimps up, hoes down, bank roll all froze
Mack keep em looking pretty, but won't give em no dough
Uncle Diddy run the city, butch you ain't know?
Now let that thing bounce, drop slow
And show out your outsides, you know how it go, oh

[Chorus]

I'm at my maximum, I'm fully loaded
Baby girl c'mon, roll with it
Don't be askin' them if I'm gon bomb
Like the atom or the a-tom, just order the dom
B Mack and them, you better know it
Nab hoes, after the show, she gon show it
That hoe, I told you she gon do it
The loads is full, she let me smash in the Buick
I'm comin' for clothes, these hoes, we goin' through it
Pull out my gat, she though I was goin' shoot her
Mr. P Crakk Cocaine, I got rulers
My mind in the gutter, and my heart in the sewer
I kick a bitch to the curb, I keep it movin'
Married to the game, I love my money and my music
Half Puerto Rican and black, they think I'm Jewish
I don't give em shit, and they keep comin' back to it

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now come and sit yo big ass down
Right here on daddy legs, now hush, take a sip of the brown
Lap dance on it, leave a white stain on my Levis
This the twat team, I'm a show you how we ride
Through a lasso over your hips, rustle your mean thighs
You bow-legged too? I'm a hit it from all sides
Uh huh, we brought the bar, you bought the bar
Beans got the big lighter out, waiting to spark
Word up, dance floors, noise, asses shaking
And she winding that body like she got Jamaican
Asians, sistas, blacks, bad Caucasians
Get em all Goosed up, then I persuade them
To bounce to the c-r-i-b
Shorty to young, sorry, gotta chill in the lobby
It's the penthouse, big couch, get digged out
You bring your lil' male friends, I get kicked out

[Chorus]",Shake It for Me,2008
Ghostface Killah,"Pss, yo, yo, yo (yo son roll!)
Oh shit, yo, yo, run!

Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon
So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G.
Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to, Ghost here they come now!
Er! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on the rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge

I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up
Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest
I had to break free, police on me and they F-B's
Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze""
That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty
Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden
Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace
Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting Parmesan cheese
And I won't stop moving til the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me
That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup
But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is

[Chorus]
Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns!

Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid)
I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)

Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down
Down to Dela', when y'all rarely toting the milli round
I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south
Carolina had the milli down there
Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks
In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech
Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run
But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece
I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate
It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon
Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches
They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom
I did, and then we went zoom
Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness
I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin'
The cops got me trapped in the Audi wit the Smith and

[Chorus]

D-Boy, yeah, Birdman Jr. in ya building, people
I'm a let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie

It's sure about does that you heard me
And I dropped in effect since 9/11
I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon
That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11
Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law
So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know
I had that 'dro in the seat of the car
But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow
Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights
While your boy bypassing fare light
But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right
Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right?
I speed at night, take it easy in the day
Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae
Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up
But at the pull up, come, I say my crew run run, boy

[Chorus]",Run [Remix],2008
Ghostface Killah,"You ain't sayin' nothing slick to a can of oil
Tell your man to tell his man that his man's a girl
I holds weight, y'all niggas skinny like Olive Oil
We throws at least half a ki' in the pot to boil
Royal niggas, rags to riches
Because your boy breaks bitches like glasses, dishes
Burn money like I put it in some grass and spliffed it
If I don't get my man that's passed, it's not misses
Female donkeys, y'all niggas ass and dickless
Hard white rap, just some foil like Chiclets
Never had a wife, you better settle for the mistress
The truth like Al Capone dying from the syphlis
Cross me, your name flying on the hit list
Y'all niggas buck, won't even pop a clutch on the gear shift
That ain't the hard pose, nigga, you just scared stiff
I'm on my grizzly, you might walk right into bear shit
You rock your pants too tight, get off that queer shit
No turning back when it's on, I ain't trynna hear shit
Like the coast guard, I got them choppers than can airlift

Sword, don't you know what you bring?
You destroy everything, all the blood that you give to men
There's, no excuse I could give, we just all want to live
All the war that you bring to men
War, is comin' home, takes families
War, I'm not a great big fan of it
War, is something that is scandalous
Oh no, oh no
War, is comin' by air, land and sea
War, is man's insanity
This world, for sure...
Must stop, this world of war

Tell ya fake niggas don't get me involved, my back is chunky
Four-five hanging out the jeans, is crunchy
Facial hair beard, looking like Abe Lincoln
Stand next to you and my jewels look like ya cage is shrinking
Love sweets like a dope fiend, nodder with fat hands
Keep birds around me, they be calling me Batman
Precisely I pop like cheap luggage, prefusely bleeding
Word on the streets is you lost three buckets
Fuck it, you keep dying, I'm into red diamonds
Rob me, bitch, I have your whole hood crying
Lighting candles on the street like, ""why you trying?""
Oh Lord, why you had to lullabye him
His jewels is cursed, his seeds is first
When he do shows, he pop a wheelie off his merch'
6'3, medium built, tall like Lurch
While y'all faggots be sleep, he be putting in work

That's his absorbance stance, I got it down to a glance
It's war, I got the biggest gun down my pants, pants
Got a rock, rocket in my pocket
For to knock ya head right out the socket
Turn teardrops to smile, been graced this spare child
Spray a gallon of mace in your face, burn off your 'brows
No phone home, you dribbling, we stone ya sibling
Get my bloods from Tilden, to burn your building
Poison tip dagger sword, chop through your collar bone
No, you don't got a fucking chance to holler home
Nice dream, your sliced spleen, cut through your ice bling
G-O-D, heats, melts you like it's ice cream
I'm not vanilla, I'm Black Panther chinchilla
My cousin's an orangutan, my brother's a gorilla
The other's a ape, he turn a rainbow straight
Get you trapped in the jungle now you can't escape
War it is, that's the biz, glock pop, plops the feds
Split your wig, crack your whip, smack your wiz, blast your 'quip
Chains and whips, planes and ships, guns, swords and flip stones
And bricks, munch, clothes and kicks, you know it's

Sword, don't you know what you bring?
You destroy everything, all the blood that you give to men
There's, no excuse I could give, we just all want to live
All the war that you bring to men
War, is comin' home, takes families
War, I'm not a great big fan of it
War, is something that is scandalous
Oh no, oh no

His swagger ditty bopping gone be just like mine,
And if it's a girl (ooh)
Just like her mama she gone be so fly
What a joy we made
From the love we made
Yeah, yeah

I ran up on the corner,
Popped a boner, like what
She pulled her shirt down, smiled, trying to hide her butt.
I said, 'Nah, baby girlfriend, you ain't got to do that'
I hope you ain't the anorexic type trying to lose that.
Us boys like 'em thick short weaves curls braids
I take'em buck 50 60 with them thick legs
We can sail it out 5 nights 6 days
Boats cruise wardrobe flights everything's paid
If I'm aggressive just pardon my gangsta
I just wanna get to know you
Get to show the way I move that's part of my gangsta
Like art yo I can sit you down and paint cha
Plus my stove games up no red meat

I'm alright, just that the baby's kicking I want some popeye chicken
And my back kinda hurts from the way I was sitting

And I need some, don't be fresh girl
You know I can't help it baby but stay away girl
Yeah, that's my joy, love, strawberry shortcake
leave me weak in the the knees
When I can't event walk straight
That's the reason why I got two court dates
Grown nigga like me let his thing blaze for that

That's my word I pluck something If you fuck with my back
And my name ring round the way girl
She's the sweetest thing
I love you starks riding hard

He jacked Nate, while he took the picture
And we tapped his crib, bugs all in the jacuzzi
Under the seeds bed, we found an uzi
Trully, and we know about his bitch in Charlotte
Pulled her over, State Troopers found two revolvers
And she told us them handguns ""That's my fathers
And I'm licensed to carry those shits regardless
Y'all just played my man, caught her with a million dollars
Worth of fireworks, coming back from Japan

For some reason, she be really hot, when her friends gone
That's when I slide on over with a Guinness on the stouffer

Ghostface Killah,"This is a story of a player from the Island
That lost his way, such a price to pay
To, kiss those girls and make them cry
Kiss those girls and make them cry
To love, to lose, to plead for a do over
A do over, give me a do over, I want a do over
It's that Radio Raheem and Ghostface Killah

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?

Aiyo, I used to get a threesome, every other weekend
Cheated on my girl til we nearly stopped speaking
She broke down and cried, and it hurts so bad
Her friends went and told her I was a brand new dad
Of course, she knows now, I ain't used no bag
My excuses, I couldn't cum like that
She warned me of days like this, if this should happen
She'll be out, and we'll be the ones, sharing the napkin
Silly dilly me, didn't follow the instructions
Don't bring nothing home, I don't wanna hear nothing
But brought to the world, innocent, two month old
Little girl, but what am I to do? Yo, I lost my boo
It's like being kicked out the group and lost my crew
Throwing the baby up to someone I hardly knew
Nah that shit don't add up, what am I to do, yo, I lost my jewel

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?

Aiyo, I wrote this right here, on the bus to Riker's
Right next to the thieves, the cons, the lifers
For mad years, you held you down, I'mma overwhelmed in pain
And the worst time to leave you, now
I'm sorry, please forgive me, the streets caught me
I appreciate your concern and support for me
Most important, your honesty and trust, your heart's incredible
This the truth spilling out of my guts
If I, would of took the chance to see
What was place right in front of my face
For sure, nine out of ten times
My accent's wouldn't allow me to be so naive
And blind, to carry out these mistakes
I'm cheating, running around, blasting my gun
For me, my rep on the streets like touching a son
You like a fingerprint, I never find a match like you
Thanks for your patience, you find a man, I hope it's true

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?

She was screaming out the window, I was walking up the block
Throwing out my Timbos, and all my clothes
She said, if my, apologies
She said, the lost won't fit those
And I said, baby, now let me explain
I know I had fucked up, it was a one time thing
So take all the time you need in this life
And if you let me do it over, I promise to do it right

If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time

Pull down your little red drawers and start to kiss you all over
You hope it ('last, forever') I know baby, I hope it ('last, forever')
So I, took off my paisley pajamas I got from St. Thomas
Yo, I love you so much, so let me pay homage
And if you do, yo I promise never break a promise
So can I give you the honors my little Pocahontas?
Play by play, Miss Camay
You like a Zales Diamond in the window, right on display
You just a shining, precised in every curve you cut
And for your daddy, yo, you never have to tuck in your gut
Because I love it like that, stretch mark fat, plus let me show my crunches
To burn it off, just lay right on your back
And let me do my love dance, I pop it to the left
I pop it to the right, I get it all night, come on

Them other chicks must hail to the queen, as I
Put them dudes straight up and check, cuz the queen is mine

We can be broke, holes in our coat, even still we shine
We got each other through the bad and the best of time
(Last, forever, last, forever)

Yo, yo, I'm lost in love, with nowhere to go
She says I'm a pain in the ass, boy, get to the store
She can say that, cuz we best friends, we play together
She carry my left rib, therefore we pray together
Bury me on top of her, in our graves together
Cuz when she feel pain, I know how to make it better
Talks, some long walks, communication in parks
Understand what she's going through, our listen was smarts
Especially when she's on her friend, I be hoping it leave
I have to bite my tongue, just to keep from arguing
Six days of that is like, who let the monster in
After it's finished then, I can get on top again
Shorty girl's my oxygen, never catch her gossiping
Look it ya'll, this my flower, she gon' keep on blossoming
Long as she is mine, and I am her, we gon' ride the wind
This lady here is all for me, I never have to lock her in

Them other chicks must hail to the queen, as I
Put them dudes straight up and check, cuz the queen is mine

We can be broke, holes in our coat, even still we shine
We got each other through the bad and the best of time

Yeah baby, let's do it

Oh shit, look at miss thing, you done grew into a stallion
Girl, and still don't got no ring?
Back then, you was a lot younger, now you older
Broke my heart, on what you had in the stroller
On the low, that could of been me, Huggie down
Fly and handsome, talk about little Starksky
With little Barkley's, little car seat
Two years later, here comes little Sharneese
I'm saying, are you involved, what's up with you?
And where homeboy at? Oh word, ya'll through?
Eff him, you know how I do, when I come through
Shut the whole block down like I got something to prove
But um, besides the lane, you look the same
Still blowing beauty marks, sitting under your bang
Ankle bracelets, that Donna Kay shit
I saw one rope for your throat, yo, it cost about 8 chips
Hoodrats, they be wearing that fake shit
Like her, she wear the same bag, like it ain't shit

Don't worry, let's breeze the bar
And in case I ain't tell you, those jeans is hard
And those is the snitches, mean mugging, can't fight
Run into the police, fuck them niggas
I pull out, like a tooth, when the back is rotten
Finish 'em off, like your menstrual, after you spotting
Ghost can't complain, 5'6"", swinging those hips
And my miss got me wanting to sing
Walking down the street, watching ladies
I got by watching you, watching you
I want you, like if I ain't got nothing to do

Ghostface Killah,"In the crib on this rainy day, I'm chilling
Glass pianos and Portuguese drapes, hang from the ceiling
Persian rugs, Moroccan sofas
I walk to the house in paisley robes and Ferragamo loafers
And Iron Chef just season the salmon
It's coming down pouring, he watching BBC, eating a salad
I'm on the couch hitting the chalice
Checking my texts and out of nowhere, my dick is hard as a callus
I stood up, pulled back my sleeve, checked my watch
Where the, fuck is my wife, it's 12 o'clock on the dot
Very impatient, I'm getting nervous, can't stop pacing
My heart's racing, her Nextel don't get no service
Damn, all this over a gallon of milk
Something, happened to her, somebody wig'll get peeled
Okay, let me calm down, maybe she at Keeba house
Her birthday's today, we both bought her jeans and a blouse
Since 7 o'clock, she been gone for Owls
Jetted up the steps to the master suite, checked the shower
Nope, all that is there is towels and soap
Stomach is nauseous, caught a big lump in my throat
Found a phone book with mad names, looked down
Bow, there go Keeba, tying my shoes, I put the bitch on speaker
And bluntly addressed her, 'where's my girl?' (Yeah, she ain't out here)
(Last time I seen her, Ghost, she beat it on an old nigga)
Yo, Keeba stop playing, yo (Nah, we took a shot of Henn')
(Lately she work out by 10, I told her, bitch, buy a Benz)
(Or even shot a car, I'm getting me some Advil)
(Show these motherfuckers, how Keeba love to drive stick)
I snatched up my raincoat, the grass was soaked
Under the bed in the guest house, where I keep my toast
I yelled to the Chef, yo, watch for Kayla, check the pool and the bowling alley
If anything, just hit my cellular
Hopped in the go cart, the yard is dark, I'm bugging
Few feet from the guest house, is where I parked
Hope she's OK, is what I say in my heart
But something don't feel right, so is what I'm saying to God
As I got closer, something ain't kosher
I heard a bunch of squeaky sounds from the house, I don't think I'm suppose to
Is this the end, of the Starks regime?
Let me find out somebody on my ground, yo, is pounding my queen

Yo, I'mma kill, yo! (Hold on, cause)
(Baby, let me explain, you over reacting, that's not what it was)
Shut the fuck up, you got caught moaning with your legs up
Eyes all red, what? Did y'all just blaze up?
Then froze for a sec, so I dipped quick, lift the mattress
Aimed the biscuit at both of them bastards
What ya'll excuse now (Yo, cause, she said she live with her pop)
(Her dude mad strict, that's why we up in the spot)
(And yo, this little trick of yours, bought me a ten G watch)
He reached down for his drawers, that's when I let off a shot
Back the fuck up, snatched his covers
Had 'em looking like the black Adam and Eve, some sinful lovers
(Chill, Tone, put the gun down) How you know my name, son?
(Hold on, let me explain) Yo, y'all two is done
(Just let me put my drawers, get dressed, before I get rocked)
(Cause real talk, is looking like you trynna let off that glock)
Yeah, you right, you look familiar, you put my cable in, right?
The FiOS nigga, and you fucking my wife?
(Yeah, I put that cable in, nigga, we both got caught)
(And she a triflyn ass chick, don't act like it's all my fault)
(Baby, no) Mind your business
(Now Kayla, don't stop him, let the sucker do what he do)
(He touch me, and he finished)",Guest House,2009

You suck your teeth and keep it moving with the screw, yes

Blow your cake out, earrings is snowflaked out
Will you marry me? Will you carry me?
Through rain, hail, sleet and snow
Don't say no, you'll embarrass me

I can't take it, let's stop playing

Yo, boo, let's cut the crap, you know we like each other
I been wanting you bad, yo, that's word to my mother
I know you got a man, and I'm involved
But we can play this right, if we shuffle the cards
I've been wanting you for mad years, when the elevators broke
I run and help you with your bags upstairs
I was scoping you out, today you was late, to leave by eight
With no time to be at work at nine
She'll be back by six, son pissed you off, I know
When I spoke, yo, you didn't say shit
But still, you was looking mad cute to me
With your lips poked out, being rude to me
You're still sexy, luscious, and all them words
Only girl in the building with a full length fur
Had no choice to raise and press up, explain how I feel
It's only your love I want the best of

I had a dream, yo, I seen you on the laundry mat
Folding your clothes by the dryer, my drawers is wet
So you passed me a Bounce, one fell when I bend down
And got up, you start tonguing me down
Butterflies ran across my stomach
Didn't wanna put the fire out, cuz God damn, I love it
Moved the basket out the way, cleared the table
Laid you down, my mouth slid past your navel
Your feet, had knocked over the Clorox bleach
Held my head closer to you when my tongue got deep
I'm saying we both of those, this how I feel
If you don't want a part of me, it's no big deal
But ma, I'm not here to game you, babe, I'm going on vibes
Somewhere inside, I know you feel the same
It's alright tho, you look like, you know how to get it

Ghostface Killah,"Don't be surprised, when you see me 'round town
Walking around, with my head hung down
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
And don't be surprised, if you see me on the train
Like a homeless man, who's lost his way
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely

On this cold pavement, I feel like laying
In the middle of the street, and just saying
I can't take it, I won't make it
Too much weight on my shoulders, and my kids are getting older
For so long, I've been so strong
I've been crying all week since you've been gone
And as the tears roll out my eyes
Another happy young couples walks by

[Chorus]

Someone been sleeping in my bed, eating my food
Using my soap, laying up in my pool
Walking around in his boxers, like every thing's cool
Gassing my chick for the whip, dropping her off at school
Under my covers and changing my channels
Playing my CD's in my robes, another man's burning my candles
My cologne's half way gone, a fake don, my wiz fell for
Now she strolls the park under his arm
This is my fault, I've never thought I'd see this coming
From the outside bugging, with crazy knots in my stomach
Say what goes around, comes around, now I know it now
Now I'm the fool looking in while it's going down
If somebody would of told me, I might be lonely
Now it's on me, baby call me please

[Chorus]

Now he's getting all my kisses, stroking my loving
That 'posed to be me, but I was too stupid and stubborn
Like a piece of rope, I let it go, my mother said it so
You better straighten up, don't act like you didn't know
Her birthday came, heard she was hugged up, wearing his chain
Play in the sky box, at some bullshit Knick game
My son said, daddy, he like his eggs well done
And he kinda cool, mommy happy, I can't front
He take us on trips and clothes shopping, most of the time
We watch flicks on your surround sound, he watch boxing
You better go beg or something, before she go love him
He's taking your spot, 'cause you was dissing mommy, you bugging
They don't argue, he sent her flowers for no reason
She's cheesing, I'm wishing you could come back and see this

Shareefa, oh

From the blocking, to the dropping
I need a girl that's stacking and popping
When I come in late, she's not clocking
Not in the crib, throwing 'round pots and
Nice girl, that's clean, that was raised to cook
Be on the couch chilling, shorts on, reading a book
Biting on a pen, thin glasses on
French type frames by Yves Saint Laurent
Say hey pretty mama, do you fit the bill
Do you got what it take for you to fit in my wheel?
Would you bust that steel if, niggas came to kill me
Protect that safe, baby, dag, that's filthy
Whoa, somebody let her know up in here
He like Papa Smurf, I'm like Papa Bear
I'm just looking for a queen, so I can rock her ear
Tell her P. Tone in here, I got her locked this year

I be your Bonnie right beside you
No need to worry, boo, I got you, yeah

That's fresh squeeze with the pulp, mama got a big butt
Tiffany chain, the stones freeze in the throat
Love to hold my hand, stepping off planes from D.R.
Luggage with a big black tan
Whatcha gonna do? You or him, me or you?
Fucking with him, you look mad pitiful
Boo, I'm not the type that be slobbing down hoochies
Looking at these hoes, eyes low like Droopy
Tugging on my jacket til the lights come on
We run trains on them bitches, never ice they arm

Nagging til the sun up, shut up, I'm not a double-up, boo

Looking any further cuz the girl is ours
Holds it down for you, any place, any time
You already know, I'm the one, yeah, I'm that
Fly girl, rider, just say the word
Anything pop off, it's us against the world
Such a hood girl, with that dirty loving that'll make your toes curl

Yo, relax and chill, analyze the story
Love, your boy Tone got mass appeal
All them other little players ain't as half as real
They just wanna get up in you like Mass & Gill
But me, I need a wisdom, play it like wifey
Well mannered, understand the kid and not bite me
All my real ladies, put your hands up
Holla at your boy, if you ain't a groupie, right now, stand up

She's happy, her hair, toes and nails is dumb right
The smell of her fragrance, baffled my nostrils
I can see through her eyes, she's feeding on in the possible
She blushes, as I kept splashing her compliments
Polite thank yous, is all around, she crush the mints
Developments, smooth keys from the piano
Changed the mood, like we changed the channel
This is art, Picasso, I got him beat in the flesh
I'm staring at beauty, Nefertiti, heaven bone in the chest
Yes, everywhere she step, went off like a flare gun
Stilettos on, parquet floors
Miss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three
Bad little mama, she built like Alicia Keys
No facade, her strut is hard, based on books by
Intelligent jail crooks, writing to let the time fly
She dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down
Prestigious gentleman, with my right hand, I picked it up
I stood up, to the cutest eyelashes, as I gave her, her jewels back
Miss thing started rubbing her gut
Excuse me, are you pregnant? Not to be rude
But if it means anything, I can get you some food
Cheese crackers, in the back there's sauteed shrimp
(Nah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp
See my due date is January, my first, and it's kinda scary
It's only June, and Christmas, I'll be getting married
And I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name?)

But before I go, can I give you one last statement
You the most beautifullest queen, I ever seen
And I would love to have a thing like you, on my team, you take care

Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight
It's OK

You can tell he must be on a mission
Because my heart has made it's decision
As soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision
I fell in love, sweet love
And no infatuated 3D glasses to see
That your the one I need
And the situation don't matter to me
'Cause this is love, it gotta be love
Love at first sight

Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight

Skilled with the gats, even feds don't know where the shells at
The shell trapped up in nice crib with four packs
Four macs, caught a nice cell for four stacks
Yeah, me and my nigga Arafat
Gotta escape but we'll be right back, real soon
Chef cook it up, we got a date with real goons
Telling you Ghost, my connect crazy with the wreck
Pythons used to talk to her sister named Yvette
I speed it up, me and the Linx, was getting weeded up
I beat it up, yeah I hit that, but I ain't seed it up
Meanwhile, back on the block, we seen two trucks
Then the windows rolled down, we see these two fucks
Soon as they jumped out, see these tools bust

Knock the ash off the blunt, confront niggas who cunt
Swing an ax, tax niggas rhyme different from cats
Specialize in mic rippers, splashes
We the last skippers, big rocks and the block will stick

Yo, I lit a booger up, rocks is gone, so we bagging up all shape
Binoculars, scanners, we all listen to jake
Ran out of baggies, my mouth is dry
Got them dirty joints all scattered, don't act surprised
Nah, nigga the currency rushes like popping a wheelie
Holding a pipe with one hand, the other down in the Bentleys
You know how it be with the peppermint Clarks
Throwing darts at a hoodrat
Getting slow necked all up in The Bronx
That's all me, thirty four shines, forty four lines
I just chill like Aaron Hall, writing raw rhymes
Like, threw Kool-Aid rubies in a lemonade bezel
When I was 12 in the church, I started packing that metal
A deuce deuce, my supplier was Loose Bruce
Ever since I had the drop, my instinct was to shoot-shoot
This ain't For the Love of Ray J, it's for the love of the AK
'Cause you can get scratched like AJ
Cuban Link Dynasty has emerged, this rap shit stop
I have a team of niggas moving my furs

With the different color records they had back in the days
You know what I mean, the belt-driven turntables
With Technics joints (with the slipmats!)
Put nickels on the needles so the motherfucking record won't jump
The needle won't skip and shit
Getting juice from the fucking light poles
Shout out to the Bronx, nigga!

Aye yo, this shit go way back like a Uni marker, kid
Bombing the D train and hit the Bronx up
Krylon bandits attack; Planet Rock, Bambaataa
Peace to Pylon discovering rap
And the DJ that made the first scratch
Paved the way for Flex, Mister Cee, 'nuff of them cats
See, this rap shit came at a time that was accurate
Twenty-something years later, I mastered it
Seen light poles get used for power
I was a little nigga
Couldn't stay out late I was sour
So I sat by the window, heard the DJ cut
Impeach the Pres, Apache, and just begun
Otis Redding, ""Tramp"" the music stopped
Guess the system blew out one of his amps
It'd take a little while, then it come back on
Somebody stepped on the wire and shit, that's all
Now everybody's back in the groove, echo chamber
""Check one two, one two"" that's my favorite
Strobe lights is live, Pink Champale
Little pink joints being lit up on the side
Couple niggas had two fives
Other than that, cleared a circle in the park and shoot 5
Girls wore they Lees and jellies
Jordache and Lees, (TF Lords fit the fellys?)

Throwing bubbles on the wall

We must remind you
Where this rap come from
Yes my brother, my sister
It's our duty, we must remind you
Hip hop was set out in the park
We used to do it out in the dark

Yo, it all started at the After Midnight Philly, but walk with me
Mad niggas coming down from New York City
Prolly hit the skating rink USA
Banging Schoolly, ""Gangster Boogie"" and ""P.S.K.""
I remember shells, Gazelles, top tens, and lottos
Mega design, reefer smoke, Coqui nine bottles
(Entire wore velours, call the boys with the Lucci wore?)
84's from Atlantic City Gucci store
Linoleum break dancing, Rust-Oleum cans
I put the writing on the wall signed, ""Truly yours""
Philly smashed '87 Music Seminar
Out on the battlefield like Pat Benatar
Hit the borough with Krown Rulers out of Camden
People Patty Duke-ing in the party, all cramped in
Around the time Flav started cold lamping
""Rebel Without a Pause"" was the street anthem
Old Memorex cassette, tape collections
Bright spotlights on all the fights at the Spectrum
When the Fresh Fest come, leather bombers and sheepskins
Brothers would bust they guns to get one
MC Breeze, Disco C, Jazzy Jeff
Cash Money and Miz and Lady B
Everybody banging ""Sucker MC's"" in '83
I was South Philly like St. Charles and Crazy D
Them wild North Side Puerto Ricans would snuff you
Twenty deep in a Ford Escort, pumping the Tuff Crew
I used to follow my cousin, he was a buck too
""Y'all don't like how I'm living, well, fuck you!""
I been a G since a little kid
Sticking my head up into somebody's dollar party, getting into shit
And late nights, shoulda been in bed
Instead, I was running 'round with them downtown lemonheads
A little man, hanging where them grown women is
Under thirteen, seeing real strong images
And that's the reason for my real rap penmanship
That's where I started it, and that's where I'mma finish it

Ghostface Killah,"Take my hands out my pockets you can see my thumbs
Both of them turned green from counting the ones
Memorized by the glory, word life
Cut off niggas who killed good but couldn't do nothing for me
Shout 'em out every once in the blue
And kid yo, I never rocked with laws they keep away, we cool
I devised my own stimulus plan, I'm niggarish
I'm tired of eating those crumbs and black licorice
To free my mind on Friday, I cleanse in the mosque
Let the imam pray over my head and wash
Thoughts, sterilized, purified, Godly
Watch us gift men and fetch the green like barley
If that shit happen I'll feed his whole army
Talking 'bout the angels and peeps in Somali
Try to stay humble and swallow my pride
In God I trust, now talk about the ones on your five
Crisp dollar billing, catch me in a little hut in Benin
Village style, feeding the children
Big pots of jasmine tea with Mandela
Africans chanting me on like Coachella
Ghostface Bumaye, Kumbaya my Lord
My death day, 24 karat tomb I lay
Wishing they could bury me next to the prophets
Nabi, Lut, Is'a, Musa, Hadrat Muhammad, Ibrahim

The Lord takes me, gathering speeds before winds
High currents, distance, places be forming wings
Kings offering, thrones was there
Man with the seven crowns on his dome was near
Feet walked over rose petals sold from the ghetto
Face froze in gold like the pharaoh
Adorned in glory, robe of light, a power for his cherub
As He passed the path, white doves crossed the eyes of thugs
Eternal heartbeat and the dark fire in his blood
Seven hundred books were opened
Embraced to write, then threw the crooks in the ocean
Skin brass hair like it grew from goatskin
The chosen has spoken, tablets were broken
The smoke hand grabs an omen
Gravity grabbing me gradually, dragging me through Hell's cavity
This is blasphemy, I fell where the jackals feed
God felt bad for me but cast me in the Caspian Sea
Satan gave the dragon his key, Wu-Family's the faculty
K.P., K.P

He used to sling in the stairwell
Fast to put the rap on a thinking cap, ignite your hair gel
No such thing as the fair sale
He'll put the bullet out same day, delivery airmail
And on this level a thug will sell your garbage
No refund, the only exchange from the cartridge
But the users just kept coming back with their life earnings
Ready to make a deal, soul and pipe burning
The outcome tragic, the household dramatic
Living rooms for heating spoons, basements for addicts
Support from a bean, hit the courts from a fiend
Who betrayed one, who had lit the torch for his team
So he sent them gifts, body parts per diem
In a box that held prints but too dark to see 'em",Purified Thoughts,2010

Yo, what's the science, little nigga? Yo, you beefing too hard
I throw five in your Champ hood, and envy your squad
You try to stick out your fucking hand, nah, I don't want no dap, nigga
Fucking lucky you ain't get glammed
Bitch ass nigga, you wrong, yo, you mingle with rats
The other day you got caught with the gat, nigga
How you home, nigga? Why you even up in my square?
Like you get busy, got the block hot and stare
Fresh coffins fast, they spitting, y'all fake bitches
Snitches get mad love, hundred and eight stitches
My condolences, word life, if they can find you a real killa
Someone close is singing like the Jonases
Crime Stoppers, the tips keep pouring in
For a G, you be suprised who's going in
Block huggers, the ones who be holding they jock
And suck my cock, the real cock lovers

[Chorus]

Y'all can call me cook up or come back
My flow hot, my hood hot, cause of one rat
My block on fire cause of one match
I spit with paper like thumbstacks, 
These cougars wanna play all these
Young cats with pussy, turning boys to men, so I resort to the pen
But at the same time, I'm pointing the pen
And now it's game time, nigga, you in? You better thicken your skin
Move with your peoples through the thick and the thin
I watch for po-po, they raiding the crib
And I ain't trying to get jammed, and have the next man raising my kids
God forbid, dudes be hating on his, because a nigga go hard
And hit 'em harder then they saying they is
But that's just New York, I carry the torch, just long enough
To light a Newport and carry this thought
Fuck what you thought, the bigger the boss, bigger the cost
They don't know about the Tribe of Shabazz, niggas is lost

[Chorus]",Dangerous,2010
Ghostface Killah,"O, most of the time, yo, I'm flicked up
Stepping out the crib like I'm sixed up, don't get it mixed up
Even if I'm shaking your hand, I'm still gripped up
With two spots left, yeah, we still bricked up
Trees pine, gleem no seed, young boys feeling they self, they must be on E's
Me? I stay outted out, boating on oceans
He banging my old chick, and he mad open
Think I smell the goons, they been business since the Tunnel days
Shanks out, they ready to move
Somebody yelled out 'ballin'
In two seconds, lord, they was up on 'em
That voice, should of slowed down, baby
Now what we gon' tell his lady
Jaw on the floor, looking all crazy
A lot of vicks been going down in here, lately

In 2012, the DJ is still recognized as the crowd controller
The record breaking, keep the bottles popping and all the ass shaking

[Chorus]
It's that Wu shit, it's that movement
It's the Wu shit, in the house

Yo, should I talk about all the jewels I wore on my neck
While you had to tuck your little shit in out of respect
I'm a done, rebel out of Staten Island projects
I dare y'all to come in my projects
Leave with no head, no neck
You thought I was Flex, the way I bombed the set
In the hallway, banger house, smelling like cake
Tongueing bitches down, most of them got scraped
Watch how I move the crowd, I'm a make 'em, make 'em clap to this
No shit, no doubt
Two shots of Hennessey, ladies want Goose
Earlier them fronting niggas, now they want a truce
Mami got a bubble in her Jimmy Choo shoe
When I go and kick it, she's a goodie two-shoe?
Yeah, right, daddy got bread
Like J. Holiday, I wanna put you to bed
Tell me your girlfriends, kicks, don't let it go to your head
Walking around in your cheap ass threads
Get away from me, stinky

[Chorus]

Yeah, yo, I spit lines from the rubble room
Bottom line, I kick mines, like a mother's womb
I'm, still in my prime, fuck them other dudes
No biting's the rule, but we can eat each others food
Flash a camera at the all time great
Single handing increase New York's crime rate
That's why I love it in the Empire State
The city where your fat ass can still find weight
But y'all ain't getting it, the game is different
And in the recession, a lot of veterans is quitting it
Every day I'm living it, your boy got blunts
Fighting after school, a lot of y'all got jumped
Staten Island, bro, ratchet under my coat, potato salads so
And we silencing that, just every day challenge us

Word up, man (fuck them)

Spit in your mouth, piss on your bitch

Real talk, mami, you gotta bounce

Wild like Indians, Al Capone-ians
Not from Chicago, my gun named Margo
It's only when we in beef, we humble in deep
Might kill four-five niggas, die in my sleep
I argue though, who the best, we hardly know
I came through in the S, wash me, yo
Yo, yo, do that for me, go around that car

Niggas, digging they nose, and digging they ass
When I got chips, can't none of y'all dig in my bag
I pop shit, my killas is black, I got chicks that got chicks

When it's going down, I'm gon' rain
That's my chair, nigga, get the fuck out of it

Yo, fuck you, pay me, if Dirt Dog could see me now
He'd probably say ""Fuck you, pay me""
Blowing smoke clouds, shit's crazy
Doo-rag your dome, get wavy, rap ain't done shit for me lately
It's ass backwards, this game trynna play me
I bet this never happens to Jay-Z
Get money, fuck them haters, real talk

Pay me, play me, weigh he, just the right measurement
This may happen in a day, G
I'm a keep it real, for real G's, niggas is lame

Y'all niggas is playing me, man",Mef vs Chef 2,2010
Ghostface Killah,"Yo, man, just let her live, man, stop playing, man
Oh, shit, B, where's Miranda? (She with Chef)

I dreamed it, Chef out in Cuba, a ruger
Thirty thou' on him, out in Mr. Chow, blew a cloud on him
Seen a Latin chick, laughing, clapping
Like your style, homey, tell your proud, hit the Crystal
Now we chatting, coebers and klickos, who do this a size six
She split up, had a brick, I peeped those
Her jeans was fitted, hair twisted, long as a fuck
She looked Indian, titties was plump
Had juicy lips, dimples, imprint on her pussy was mad thick
She grabbed my dick, hopped in the window
We in the Monte Carlo, bravo, uncle named Pablo
Gun connect, and he had his poke in Los Cabos
Good money, honey was strung, playing Luther in the background
Spanish version, my bunny was horny as fuck
Working the kid, we burst later, lay in the bed
Duvet sheets, my face hit the spread
Then time me, I'm not the kind of nigga, I was cool down at night
Drop my gun, shorty, my nigga
Body was sexy, ""Lexy, come here, nigga, take off your drawers
Let me suck your dick, nigga, it's yours
Got real watery, Corey, damn you got good dick
You forty"" spit on it, position your jaw
Call me 8-Ball, this pussy like China, climb the Great Wall
Then she came like volcanos in the late fall

Lady Miranda, she half black and white like a panda
I met her at the BET Awards, in Atlanta
Glamor girl, shopping in Bloomingdale's, skin pure
Keep a fresh manicure, hands with the cutest nails
Wall Street banker, hold accounts with Jewish now
Big businessmen, who own stocks in computer sales
Meanwhile, I'm checking her jeans out, imagining
Her fat bubble, riding my dick, making her scream out
She got a mean mouth, her lips is like soup coolers
Hotter than niggas riding around with six rugers
Miss Beaulah took a day off with a rich jeweler
When she came back she had a suitcase full of Fig Newtons
I met her at a villa in Vancouver, blowing her man's buddah
Bumping Mary J. and that Grand Puba
Check the 411, from a smooth operator
Got some pictures of her naked, I'll send them to Un later

Ay Dio mio, mamacita ass bonita
Remind me of the nights of Del Rio
I met at the Cotto fights, playing my seat though
That night, the linen was white, me and my hijos
Live from Puerto Rico, San Juan, where niggas sniff pedrico
Look at your man wrong, finito
Girl you know how we go, you getting my grown man on
Fuck with you primo, maybe I'm hands on, I'll massage your ego
And be the love of your life, you know your people, a thug and his wife
Gave a look, she was touching my ice, so I looked at my dick
Like don't worry, we fucking tonight
She boricua, cinnamon skin, sign is Libra
She like wife beaters and men that like to eat her
Then I meet your feet up, meet me in room 112, light this reefer
You act right, and after tonight, I might keep ya",Miranda,2010
Ghostface Killah,"Yeah, them niggas talking bout y'all always want some lyrics, right?
Real lyrics, well here we go, I'm a tell you a little story
That's right, watch this shit, nigga, here we go, y'all, your ass
Yeah, we write for days, hot shit, uh-huh
Dope, drugs, sex, murder, King James version

Aiyo, needle was left hanging, in the arm of a pimp
He walk with a limp, had bitches on the payroll
He gave the seeds candy and his family was poor
Drove a '68 Caddy with the fur on the door
The other macks ain't have jack on him, not even Goldie
Slowly, he would rise, kept his runners with the police
Jim Brown was his man, his brother was Muslim, they tried to convert him
And turn righteous, but the streets got the good of him
Big hats with gorgeous stones, honey designed the slacks
With two attempts on his bottom bitch, her name was Precious
Silky skin, priceless pussy, she took karate
Her bubble ass got Pretty Chipp rich
You can smell her perfume on every street corner
A sexy motherfucka with the mean face on her
Precious, sported bulletproof dresses, defending caring sex
Thirteen smith, this boo that study her lessons
She was the key to Pretty Chipp riches, bitches is fortune slang
Control the south side, her name rings
Lookout for the black cherry pussy extortion
Any other hoes get pregnant, bet they get an abortion
Back at the pub, at the Alice spot, bumping the sounds of Curtis
Playing Live in the jukebox, this broad named Cookie
In the purse, fifty thou' in cash
Passed off to Chipp, told him count it fast, another 10 in my bloomers
Fuck the rumors, it's lies, baby, you my daddy
Bitches never saw me jumping out of Dirt Dog's cabby
I'm a loyal bitch, and chicks can't stand me, pimps
They know I'm ill, that's why they never put hands on me
From Fillmore Slim to Goldie, Pretty Toney
Frank War told me, C.C. get that money
My potentials, credentials, my mouth stay hot
Like Chinese mushrooms, wasabi with spicy lentils
The other day I brought a little gat, where I keep near my lower back
Cause these niggas don't know how to act
At the Apollo, Ray Charles told me
Bitch just get in the car, cuz I want you to swallow
I jumped in, and his bodyguards follow
He was quick, I spit the nut on his '74 wallos
He wanted to invite me to Chicago, I said 'nah, daddy'
He pushed me out and lit up a Marlboro
(Nah, papi) Cause I'm from New York
He taught me the talks, he taught me the walk
Cause I'm Chipp's bitch, we dine and resort
Only nigga ever taught me, don't put swine on my fork

And that's the truth, rest in peace, papi
This Cookie, I still got another tall Goose for you daddy
I'm a stick in the grave for you, baby
Fuck them other pimps, they ain't got shit on you, daddy",Pimpin' Chipp,2010

Indoor pools with steel doors, flipping eggs over in my silk drawers
While I""m charging my cell, sparking the L
Baby mother reading my mail, just that they switched seats
To another jail, and his banger is old fire
He's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire
That's when I passed her the bone, started to cough
And flossed all through the house, robe on, rugger out
Homebuyers see the sign, yeah y'all, I'm moving out
In front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out
Thirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates
With big giant wall units, even the front grass
Saw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall
I even put work in, under the floor
In the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw

I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down
Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found

P.O.'s violate your dirty urine
These dealers in the lobby of my building, ice grilling
I don't catch cold to catch feelings
I put in that work, then catch millions
If that don't work, back to stealing
Snatch me a purse, and stack real in
Meth, I'm that dealing, millionaire, slash chameleon
I mastered the juks, one of my niggas ""Masta, killing""
Spray shots, clap civilians at the dealing table
Off of the love of crack dealing
Once again the fatal, flying guillotine, the millions
Paper rob me able, my woman is all pre-matul
I got mouths to feed, nigga, and I'm the hand that rocks the cradle
Just like Hova, but I ain't trying to 'roc' the label
I'm a soldier, I stay on job, me, eye a coka
Honey's wanna fuck and the industry fucks 'em over

Label me a beast, call me U-Godzilla
When I rumble in the jungle, I go gorilla
Step on the set, Inspectah Deck you
Dead in your face, straight RZArect you
You highly mistaken, I'm hotter than Satan
Catch me in the kitchen with blood on Chef apron
I'm known to, Cap a Don, big gun in my palm
I'm like my arm is gone, plus I Masta the Kill
Give you something, you can really feel
Got many Methods to kill a Man, if it's real, you real
The world's worse like Dirt McGirt
Fuck a bitch raw dog, then dig in her purse
Yeah that boy's a Genius, I stay fresh like I'm straight out the cleaners
I walk hard like a criminal, holding my penis

Here's the rundown, Mustafa's getting money out in Youngstown
Get some goons together, a driver and bring them guns down
Heard he had his hands in some bricks, plus a few pounds
Hang with some wild Haitians, settle shop in the dude lounge
Niggas is migrating, he came from Cue Gardens

Broken lamps, and a flipped up stroller
The place was ransacked from front to back)

Take a left and head, down the hallway steps
Pass the painting on the wall, the third door on the left

Wait for them to come inside, I'll hit these niggas with the mack)
OK, before it even get to that, let me see where Trife is at
Hopefully he on his way, and no one gotta die today (bang bang)

Keep talkin' bro, I put one in yo leather

I might shoot ya, make your ass an example
You can't fuck with Tony Starks, get knocked, get trampled
Get hunted like a rat in a field, I hate that
Hate fake ass niggas that love to set traps
Murder the don, I'm back with a bird on my arm
Back to pillage, I rock a live grenade as a charm

I want mothers and sons, I wanna murder their daughters

He spares no one, he's not forgotten
Cause he was somewhere

Yo, look away, don't stare into the eyes of a killer
Metal lungies, junkies, nigga, I pack the nine millers and thrillers
Bulletproof robes and wave caps
Revenge more, nigga, you know Ghost gone stay strapped
Hunt them down in alphabetical order
Each person that crossed me, watch the man slaughter
The butcher, the baker, the torturer, the taker
I'mma send you right back to your maker
A few extra holes, miss your soul sold to the devil
It's the rebirth of a slave brought back as a rebel
I'm immortal, gonna kill generations of your fam
You tried to loathe my legacy away, but I stand stronger

Snatching me up off the block, what am I doin’?

Driving me around the hood so I could worry

I would walk down the street and sneeze, they all blessed me

Threw me off when my grind was prime time then
You could step on and stretch mine’s to a nine times ten
I was gone, remembering though that fine line’s thin
So I studied that chessboard and we were all blind men
Dealers ran the streets, but the d’s ran them
I was a killer underneath, but needed expansion
Something to constitute being high in a coupe
The cries from my youth so I applied for the suit

He kidnapped them both, for a scheme of revenge
Pillow cases over their heads, tossed in the Benz

And I ain't lookin for no ransom

They cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps
They raided the Kane gang [?]

He was anticipating a payday, but he was faced with a melee
He sprained to his feet but his legs wouldn't stay straight
Afraid, he reached for his piece, Bang Bang! Bang Bang!
But wait, as if on cue, the Deluca crew called out, ""Lucas!""
And began shooting unison, maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of Kane
Blew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench 
of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings!
Finally it was over
The Delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters
They shifted through the dead remains
The bedrooms, and the entry way
WHERE THE HELL IS LESTER KANE?!

Now what is this that stands before me?
Underneath this wack off coughing
It's Logan and her half beat offspring
I got the nod from Kane that I'll be enforcing

Kane's gang had no imply the Delucas had staked out the vacated building for eight days
They knew about his way in, the way out, the makeshift escape route
The hidden staircase, the way down to the basement in the safe house
Where to find Logan and her afraid child
In a dark corner where they were being held
They were blindfolded with taped mouths
No light or water, arms and legs bound

But there's a double cross of course, I'm hearing guns letting off from somewhere else

I calmly approach them with the burner
When they realized the real live G was about to serve 'em
60 pieces blew through his jaw, closing his curtains
Now it's total chaos, the people running for they lives
The other cocksuckers tried reaching for their hammers
But they was slow on their draw so I blammed em
Taking they tops off like convertible dry burgundy phantom
They say the taste revenge is sweet, well let me see
Prepare the table for a feast, take a seat, and let's eat

In the beginning, it's time for a new chapter
Twelve more reasons to die, after the laughter
It's relevant, the legacy lives on lavash

Beast mode, I'm resurrected, I hear the record spinning
Early 70s, New York [?]
And I see street life, the only life I know
I see Liberty, I see the motherfucking Verrazanos
I see gangstas getting money, bitches acting funny
Stacks upon stacks, and not one nigga bummy
Something ain't right, these ain't the greedy streets of Italy
Where Logan and my seed? C'mon son, you kidding me?
Who's calling me? Who's looking for the killer with no face?
Who summoned me into this place? I need answers!
Behave chancellors, I'm a vigilante killer
No time for games and there ain't no nigga realer

Ghostface Killah,"I used to rob and steal, now I make food for thought
Fresh like the air you snort
I drop jewels, little nuggets of wisdom
Seeds that keep growing
Paying my debts to society, so no more owing
Now it's showing and proving, keep the body moving
Exercising the mind is scientifically proven
To increase your life line, strengthen your heart
Eat fish, that brain food will get you smart
Yoga, deep medicational tactics
You no good then just practice, cause practise makes perfect
Stop burying your lies and bring the truth to the surface
Money is the root to all evil, that cash rule
Will have you out there looking like a damn fool
That's the devil's bait, the all mighty dollartry
Will have your mind fooled by technology

Follow the footprints as I lay the tracks out
He's a righteous God, I want the best for mankind
Navigate through this war without blowing a landmine
My light shines from the east my brother
Verbally I spit, I'm a beast my brother
March through the blackness, search for the ray of lights
Don't walk bare footed through the grass
Cause that's where the snake strikes
Protect ya neck, evil lurks in the shadows
Darkness is best where the Devil wins battles
The weak fall victim, the strong sound diligent
Guerilla, we gullible but manage to stay militant
Super stars, our ego is so top billin' it

My lines are cocaine, the flow is bath salts
I'm a for-sure Don, no one in your circle can box me
That's like an oxymoron
I flirt with building your empire
Gotta shake the snake in the grass and spark sharks to swim by ya
Cuz every meek head that speak street cred ain’t bangin heat lead
And probably cut like sweet bread wetting their sheets spread
So nigga holla, I coin phrases to trigger dollars
Its butterfly like the shirts made with bigger collars
Women thank the scholar, the broad stealer
Who laying them face down and ass up like a card dealer

As I palm another phenomenon rhyme thesis
Because on the contrary, 
I get it popping like Dom Perignon beyond Tom, Harry and Dick

Highly contagious
Bathsalt flows leaving bodies all on stages
Locked behind cages, Don of all ages
Its Ghostface nigga never plead in the cases
But I plead the fifth, four-fifth by the belt buckle
Crack stone-faced niggas with the steel of a knuckle
Go ahead and chuckle, I have uncle murder your goons
Hoes and balloons, ODing on flights from Colombia
Pull your trunk through your neck when the cartel's done with you
Supreme talk boss, verbal holocaust I'm a thriller
Have you jumping out, they sleep, Wigs hand me a Miller
Sick the dogs sitting in their shoes
My iron monkies spit banana clips with thick traps like Terry Crews

That ain't frail, solid goes the charm like a new born baby
10 pounds of 6 ounces, the shits looking crazy
Retarded, leaving niggas daily departed
Tried to sit but it started, it ain't for the weak hearted
Heavily guarded, my clan keep prisoners of war
Torch you niggas with the morphine drips of the raw
Peruvian white blowing dust in 'em
Feeding 'em seroquel
Fucking their minds and blowing off the pedestal

We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate

Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates

It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
Five-seven MB, yo, metallic green
Seats is piped off
Seize them old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on

The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers and beer drinkers

Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

Old-school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lacks the principles
Got mo' clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical
The gun smokey, Robinson, you need a Miracle
Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical
When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
We're the unpredictable, torture over your physical
Drop a bar, used to pour water over the cereal
Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual
But one Nation under God, that's indivisible
My time critical, hands-off from digital
Me and my lady bark, back when the Planets was Digable
I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on

It's only Logic, we got 'em mobber than the mosh pit

The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty, unpredictable, talent all-natural
Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame
INS, your highness, they callin' my name

In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same
Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain

Survival of the fittest in cold days with no money
They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me

So I ain't down if you ain't talkin that band language
Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What what? They might Crystal in the Lake you

Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No.9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me, perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in see-saw
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes are two and the same
Nigga get cooked on an open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained

My rhyme starts riots in the mountains
Thirty-six million and countin'
The harder they come, the harder I go
Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?
Stay on my tip-toes, old-school
Wu B This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'
Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw

Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Whole style is mentally strong, the strength of your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, just mellow out
Big wise chief Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning
Regardless, I speak logic, clear reasoning
The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept? Stand up

Noriega, aimin' knives which stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po, wrap you up in so-and-so

Built with Ghengis Khan, the wreck suede wiley Don

I judge wisely, as if nothin' ever surprise me
Loungin', between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece, is like buildin' stones in Greece
My poems are deep from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed, as my mind, roams the realm
My eye's the vision, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fits
I leave em split, like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

Aiyyo, camoflouge chameleon, ninjas scalin' your buildin'
No time to grab the gun they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent, from the President, to rage your residence
Because you had secret evidence, and documents
On how they raped the continents, and it's the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year two thousand and two, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola Virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes
Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chicken heads gettin' slim
Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential, vitamin and mineral
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin with the Lands, the tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen
Protons electrons always cause explosions

The banks of G, all CREAM downs a vet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax free shit by any means
Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such with cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like hams
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the limp on temp
With the stump, treat his hips like air pumps
RZA shaped the track, niggaz caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin to figure who invented

Rolling like Kaufman, and laid that ass out like carpet
Stop the stuttering boy, save complaints for the five-oh
Then praise the God - chk-a-chk POW!

And then remain in Shaolin, an endangered island
Where shorties lose blood by the gallons

Packed with visions, copywritten
Throwing bread to pigeons, Christ has risen
King Elegant, slang master, jack expensive noodle hats
In sixty-nine, old timers time that brothers shot craps
The baggy blue Guess jeans, pull strings off in Palm Springs
I'm locked in the bing, Rocky ring labelled rap king
The corner emperor - the golden thieves play the benches
Rednecks be hanging big niggas down in Memphis
Back in Now-Y, hit the bull's eye with loaded nines
Life is like Tarzan, swinging from a thin vine
Shatter dreams, then mirrors don't need a press spirals
Aim at the white shadows with big barrels
Of Moet-ers, the bald headers, milk and Armarettas
Who fear none, crushing all personal vendettas, yo

Not sure of whereabouts
My mum kept on callin' me just tellin' me to sort it out
Sort it out?
Mum look, readin' books and takin' tests won't take away the pain in chest
The aching limbs, the cider breath I sparked up a cigarette
Lookin' out the window at the world
I just ain't ready yet
Such things just get me stressed
Grey hairs are springin' up and hands start to shake a bit
I've still got some whiskey left, maybe I'll just take a sip

Boss thinks I'm stubborn eh, but I wish she would button it

But big things from cold feet, one squashed like butternut
Outside the double dutch kiddies wait for chicken fix
And I hate the lunch run, six months I'm out of here
Saving up the pennies cos the city's too gritty
And cooking french fries ain't pretty

A night on holiday
Break my back all week for
Crumbs and abuse
And I swear what's the use?
Quick sip of Lucozade to pep up the bones
And amp up Ramones
And volume maximum
I'm feeling like Maximus

Complain til bleak or some navy blue

I can't do forever friends 
Cause something in my character just takes a hold 
And throws me out the car 

Maybe if I looked afar 
I could stop the catastrophe 
But you and me weren't meant to be 
And someone somewhere knew it from the start 

Now it's love that soaks my heart 
I contemplate the dark 
And superglue the memories and better days

Never I know what's in store 
But all I know is my faith to never lose 
No never, no never

Ghoti Hook,"It was a soft summer night when you came into my life
I thought it was a dream when your hand reached out for me
There was something there that I couldn't compare
And I knew that you were the only one for me
Seasons change

It was a cool autumn's eve when you sensed that I was leaving
A tear came to your eye but I just let it run dry
You said don't go away but I just left you anyway
I wasn't sure if you were the one for me
Seasons change

It was a cold winter's morning I had been up all night crying
I knew I'd done you wrong, I'd been astray for oh so long
I'm on my knees in pain I wish things had stayed the same
And I just hope that you will take me back
Seasons change

It was a warm spring's night when you let me back inside
I thought it was a dream but you still cared for me
Your love filled my heart nothing could tear us apart
And I knew that you were the only one for me

And who will sing this boy to sleep in the stillness of his room
Present a melody of peace beckon dreams to follow soon
But if there's no one left but him ,then the curtain has been drawn
A wasted life deserves no song

On cold wings she's coming

She comes at night when you are all alone

She takes all life away
Haven't you seen?
Haven't you seen?
The ruins of our world
She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak
The sun awakes and melts it away
The world now opens its eyes and sees
The dawning of a new day

On cold wings she's coming
You better keep moving
For warmth, you'll be longing
Come on just feel it
Don't you see it?
You better believe it.

Whenever she is raging
She takes all life away
Haven't you seen?
Haven't you seen?
The ruins of our world

Gian,"So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door

Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again would only do me good
Oh how I wish I could but you're so far away

One more song about moving along the highway
I can't say much of anything that's new
But if I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't  help to know you're so far away
So far away, yeah, you're so far away

Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothing else to do but close my mind
And I sure hope the road don't get to own me
There's so many dreams that I've yet to find

But you're so far away

Na mesma rua
Como se fosse
O Sol e a Lua
Dividindo o mesmo céu

Eu a vi desabrochar
Ser desejada
Uma joia cobiçada
O mais lindo dos troféus

Eu fui seu guardião
Eu fui seu anjo amigo
Mas não sabia
Que comigo
Por ela carregava
Uma paixão

Em outros braços
E saí contando os passos
Me sentindo, tão sozinho

No corpo o sabor
Amargo do ciúme
A gente quando não
Se assume
Fica chorando
Sem carinho

E eu sofri calado

Que estava apaixonado

Me encuentro en el dilema de extrañarte

Me quedé pensando que nombre ponerle si salía varón o como la mamá

Enfrentando a la marea
Enfrentando a la ciudad y la vida que te golpea
Si bien no hay nada que ofrecer
No te preocupes corazón
Donde antes comían dos
Ahora comemos tres.

Como pasa el tiempo como va creciendo fácil sale guapo como el papá
Ella me dice tranquilo
Con que salga sano
si se parece a ti
Lo puedo superar
Y ambos sabemos llegará aquel día en que se haga grande y se tenga que ir
En ese momento recuerdo a mis padres
Todo lo que hacen por mi

Se nos agranda el corazón
Enfrentando a la marea
Enfrentando a la ciudad y la vida que te golpea
Si bien no hay nada que ofrecer
No te preocupes corazón
Donde antes comían dos
Ahora comemos tres.",Ahora Comemos Tres,2016

Lo prefieres siempre a él
Deja ya de creer
que eres su único amor

Vamos a volar
Como dice Peter Pan
Sé mi luz
En medio de ésta oscuridad

Tú eres mi amor
Siempre voy con vos
No eres feliz

Para él,
Tú eres una más
En cambio para mí
Eres una en cien

Donde de escribí
Cómo y por qué
Te haría mi mujer

tú tan sencilla
mirándome

Y fue así
te conocí
te hice reír

llegaste a mi

lo que siento yo por ti
cada mañana al despertar
y verte ahí

Y por fin
llegaste a mi
para quedarte aquí.",Llegaste a Mi,2016
Giancarlo Campomanes,"No quiero volver a verte
Estar contigo me hace mal
Nuestro amor se fue de repente
Y no importa lo que diga la gente

Es raro pero ya no te extraño
El vacío así se quedó
Volviste a abrir la herida de nuevo
Ahora lo sobrellevo

No quiero volver a ser
Esclavo de tu triste amor
El amor que aquí estaba
Por fin se marchó

Las canciones desperdiciadas
Los besos bajo la almohada
Las desveladas noches
No aguantaron ni un reproche

No quiero volver a ser
Esclavo de tu triste amor
El amor que aquí estaba
Por fin se marchó

Mi corazón a destiempo
Poco a poco se recupero
Aquí de amor nadie se ha muerto
Deberías de saberlo",Mi Última Carta,2016
Giancarlo Campomanes,"Te sentaste junto a mí
y fue así
como empezó
nuestra historia de dos

Jugando y jugando
me tomaste de la mano
y sentí algo profundo
en ese corazón tuyo

Sí... Y ahora que ya no
queda
nada entre los dos
solo quieres
sentir rencor

Poco tiempo después
te volví a encontrar
de la mano de alguien más
engañándole a la gente

Creyendo tú
esconder el sentimiento
que habita aquí dentro
para así

Fingir a tiempo libre
sentirme invisible
para ver...

Que ya no queda nada
que puedo yo hacer
por ti...

Para finalizar
te digo una vez más
que ya no me hace falta
tu amor.",No Queda Nada,2016
Giancarlo Campomanes,"Será que tal vez piense que me quedé sin ti
pero la verdad es que no te fuiste de aquí
después de tanto tiempo sé que te quiero a ti
y siento que tu cariño estuvo dentro de mi

Y quiero poder empezar una historia contigo
e irnos hacia un lugar dónde nadie nos dañe más

No entiendo porque siempre alejamos al amor
y lo reemplazamos por una corta ilusión
pero contigo nada de esto ya pasó
y pude encontrarte dentro de mi corazón

Y quiero poder empezar una historia contigo
e irnos hacia un lugar dónde nadie nos dañe más
No te compliques solo sé que te quiero
Y nada ni nadie lo podrá jamás igualar",Sé Que Te Quiero,2016
Giancarlo Campomanes,"Me hallé sentando pensando
dónde estarás
Empapada en llanto
me dijiste adiós

Recuerdo esos raros besos
que nos dimos tomados de las manos
Te pedí aléjate no vuelvas más
por favor sé cruel conmigo, amor

Me había enamorado de tu sonrisa
Y estudié cada gesto en ti

Y ahora que lo pienso
fuiste tú
Mi dulce alimento, tú
No hay nadie como tú
Quiero decir que nada como tú

Y ahora entiendo que tuve miedo
y no pude cuidar este amor

El hombre que siente mucho habla poco
Poco a poco mi voz se apagó

Y ahora que lo pienso
fuiste tú

No hay nadie como tú
Quiero decir que nada como tú
Quiero decir que no hay nadie como tú",Tú,2016

hablando en la orilla de aquel viejo puerto
donde veíamos la tarde caer
me miraste y no supe que decir

ojos color

que tú estés conmigo
y llevarte a conocer
esos mundos tan distintos

Y en ese trayecto
poder decirte
lo que
siento

Ya llego el momento
de que demuestres ya
tus sentimientos
hacia mi

Que te quieres ir
Que no soportas
El cariño que te tengo
Y no puedes, ser feliz
Aquí conmigo
Y que casarnos
Fue una equivocación

Yo te digo
Que por este matrimonio
Todo he dado
Renuncié hasta a mis amigos
Pero nunca
Pude hacerte muy feliz
¿En qué he fallado?
Me lo podrías decir

No te vayas
Yo te quiero
Te lo pido, te lo ruego
Piensa en nuestros pequeños
Que te quieren
Y te van a echar de menos
Si no es por mi
Simplemente hazlo por ellos

Pienso todo el día en ti
Borré tu recuerdo
Para poder seguir

Qué pude haber hecho por ti
Si siempre te di todo
Lo que había en mi

Después de todo
Lo que ya había pasado, regresaste
Como perro arrepentido
Me pediste
Que te escuche y que te entienda
Y que nunca
Nadie te amó como yo

Y no entiendes
Que ya no te necesito
Y que los niños
Ahora ya están mejor
Que les di todo
Lo que nunca tuve yo
Y que sin ti
Fui padre y madre para ellos

Pienso todo el día en ti
Borré tu recuerdo
Para poder seguir

Qué pude haber hecho por ti
Si siempre te di todo
Lo que había en mi

Un padre
Siempre por sus hijos
Lo entrega todo
No mide el daño
Que pueda hacerse
Y que importa!
Si hay carencias en la mesa
Lo que importa es el corazón

Son conscientes
De todo lo que ha pasado
Les di todo

Lo sabes y lo sé

Al menos quédate sólo esta noche
Prometo no tocarte, está segura
Tal vez es que me voy sintiendo solo
Porque conozco esa sonrisa tan definitiva
Tu sonrisa que a mí mismo me abrió tu paraíso

Se dice que con cada hombre hay una como tú
Pero mi sitio luego lo ocuparás con alguno
Igual que yo, mejor, lo dudo

¿Por qué esta vez agachas la mirada?
Me pides que sigamos siendo amigos
¿amigos para qué, maldita sea?
A un amigo lo perdono, pero a ti te amo
Pueden parecer banales mis instintos naturales

Hay una cosa que yo no te he dicho aún
Que mis problemas, ¿sabes qué? se llaman: ""tú""
Solo por eso tu me ves hacerme el duro
Para sentirme un poquito más seguro

Y si no quieres ni decir en qué he fallado
Recuerda que también a ti te he perdonado
Y en cambio tú dices ""lo siento, no te quiero""
Y te me vas con esta historia entre tus dedos

¿Qué vas a hacer? busca una excusa y luego márchate
Porque de mí no debieras preocuparte
No debes provocarme
Que yo te escribiré un par de canciones
Tratando de ocultar mis emociones
Pensando, pero poco, en las palabras
Y hablaré de la sonrisa tan definitiva 
Tu sonrisa que a mí mismo me abrió tu paraíso

Hay una cosa que yo no te he dicho aún
Que mis problemas, ¿sabes qué? se llaman: ""tú""
Solo por eso tu me ves hacerme el duro

Non sia stato inutile
Stare insieme a te
Ok te ne vai
Decisione discutibile
Ma sì, lo so, lo sai
Almeno resta qui per questa sera

Se c'è un'altra come te
E al posto mio quindi
Tu troverai qualcun'altro

Noi resteremo sempre buoni amici
Ma quali buoni amici maledetti
Io un amico lo perdono
Mentre a te ti amo
Pu sembrarti anche banale
Ma un istinto naturale

Ma se c'è una cosa che
Io non ti ho detto mai
I miei problemi senza di te
Si chiaman guai

Cerchi una scusa

Ma la verità bisogna ammetterla e già che chi mi manca sei tu 
Che chi mi manca sei tu

Per non pensarti più mi guardo un film ma tu che cosa fai 
Persino dentro la tv
Sai non pensavo che nel mezzo del Far West t'avrei incontrata 
Anche vestita da cow boy 
Ma lo sceriffo no non ucciderlo no che mai già ferito anche me

Uscito un prodotto ben plastificato

Dentro nei discorsi accartocciati

So soltanto io quanto son veri

E come una fotografia
Che un giorno sai era mia

Che non ti sei arreso
E sei sospeso
Come un campo di stelle

E la notte di prima

O solo quando piovono
Lacrime dalla luna

Tengo flechas en el pecho y en la mano el corazón,
Tengo herido el pensamiento que se pierde entre tú y yo

No se si es mejor mentirle sin querer a mi conciencia
Si te encuentro en otra vida ya no vuelvas a esconderte,
Ahí te dejo una señal en el camino de la suerte

Los amores invencibles no conocen soledad
Tengo herida la palabra y mi mundo esta al revés,
Si te busco y no te encuentro vuelvo a buscarte otra vez

De saber si son tus besos el remedio pa' mi cura

Gianmaria Testa,"Il primo fu Capo di Buona Speranza
Chiuso per legge e decreto speciale
Che la smettessero le onde pacifiche
D'imbastardire quell'altro mare

Poi fu la volta di Panama e Suez
E quindi del Bosforo e di Gibilterra
Ogni maroso pretese il rispetto
Della sovrana indipendenza

Niente più scambi di acque e di pesci
Niente più giri del mondo in veliero
Tutti i canali rimasero chiusi
A qualunque passaggio di flutto straniero

Così per un poco tornarono chete
Le acque dei mari di tutto il pianeta
Ma non durò molto che un'onda riprese
A dir ch'era tempo di farla finita

Successe che un giorno nel mare nostrano
Lo Jonio pretese di stare da solo
E così vollero pure il Tirreno
Il mar di Sardegna e l'Adriatico al volo

Insomma nessuno si mischi a nessuno
Tuonavan le acque dei bassi fondali
Ognuna rimanga ancorata ai suoi porti
E bagni soltanto le sabbie natali

Sembrava finita ma era solo l' inizio
E anche così fu ben brutto vedere
In quel che era stata la grande distesa
Lo strazio dei fossi a dividere il mare

Era solo l'inizio, come già si diceva
Perché? Ora la febbre secessionista
Andava ammalando ogni singola riva
E niente e nessuno riusciva a dir basta

Così da Trieste alla punta pugliese
E dalla Sicilia alla Costa del Sole
Ogni più piccola cala pretese
L'indipendenza e non solo a parole

Ma la questione divenne barbina
Quando si presero goccia con goccia
E ognuna guardando la propria vicina
Diceva vai via o ti rompo la faccia

Il mare fu presto una grande rugiada
Inutile ai pesci e a qualunque creatura
Morirono il tonno, l'acciuga, lo spada
Restarono in secca le barche d'altura

E poi un giorno, o una notte, non so
Accadde qualcosa di ancora più strano
Conoscete la formula H2O
Sì quella dell'acqua, che tutti sappiamo

Ebbene l'idrogeno trovo da ridire
Sostenne di avere la maggioranza
E quindi il diritto sovrano di ambire
All'ormai sacrosanta indipendenza

Ci fu come un vento, un soffio infinito
E l'acqua dei mari s'invaporo in cielo
Rimase un deserto di sale e granito
Ma buio e profondo più nero del nero",20 Mila Leghe (In Fondo Al Mare),2011

Col tuo ordine discreto dentro il cuore
Ma dov'è, dov'è il tuo amore 
Ma dove è finito il tuo amore

Grazie a te ho una barca da scrivere, ho un treno da perdere
E un invito all'Hotel Supramonte dove ho visto la neve
Sul tuo corpo così dolce di fame, così dolce di sete
Passerà anche questa stazione senza far male
Passerà questa pioggia sottile come passa il dolore
Ma dov'è, dov'è il tuo amore, ma dove è finito il tuo cuore

E ora siedi sul letto del bosco che ormai ha il tuo nome
Ora il tempo è un signore distratto e un bambino che dorme
Ma se ti svegli e hai ancora paura ridammi la mano
Cosa importa se sono caduto, se sono lontano
Perché domani sarà un giorno lungo e senza parole
Perché domani sarà un giorno incerto di nuvole e sole

È un cuore di metallo senza l'anima

A scuola il banco è vuoto, Marco è dentro me
È dolce il suo respiro fra i pensieri miei
Distanze enormi sembrano dividerci
Ma il cuore batte forte dentro me

Se con i tuoi non parli mai
Se ti nascondi come me

Stringi forte a te il cuscino e
Piangi non lo sai quanto altro male ti farà

Hai gli occhi di bambino un poco timido
La stringo forte al cuore e sento che ci sei

Tuo padre e suoi consigli che monotonia
Lui con i suoi lavoro ti ha portato via
Di certo il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai
Ha detto un giorno tu mi capirai

Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con gli amici parlerai
Per non soffrire più per me
Ma non è facile lo sai
A scuola non ne posso più
E i pomeriggi senza te

Dietro mille finestre
Noi guardavamo nella stessa direzione
E la storia si ferma
Quando i padri sono stanchi

Ma non ci separava

Era California, era via di là
Quanto fiato nella gola
Per rifare la realtà
Era California era via di là
Verso cosa non sapevo
Ma lo respiravo sembrava cielo

Guardami ora e dimmi cosa vedi
Non è tutto passato
Ma il sogno che interrompi non sarà più uguale
Quasi senza le stelle
Forse è più bello navigare
Non c'è niente di perso
E che non possa continuare

Siamo noi la libertà

Le tue mani da spiagge lontane sul mio corpo un po' insabbiato

Forse hai voglia di giocare
Io dipingo la stanza con gli occhi che non sanno dove andare
Basterà chiamarlo amore

Dolce che suona per me.

Che scivolò nel fiume a primavera
Ma il vento che la vide cos bella
Da il fiume la port sopra una stella.

Sola senza il ricordo di un dolore,
Vivevi senza il sogno di un amore
Ma un re senza corona e senza scorta
Buss tre volte un giorno alla tua porta.

Bianco come la luna il suo cappello
Come l'amore rosso il suo mantello.
Tu lo seguisti senza una ragione
Come un ragazzo segue l'aquilone

E c'era il sole e avevi gli occhi belli
Lui ti baci le labbra ed I capelli
C'era la luna e avevi gli occhi stanchi
Lui pose le sue mani sui tuoi fianchi

Furono baci e furono sorrisi
Poi furono soltanto I fiordalisi
Che videro con gli occhi delle stelle
Fremere al vento e ai baci la tua pelle

Dicono poi che mentre ritornavi
Nel fiume chissà come scivolavi,
E lui che non ti volle creder morta
Buss cent'anni ancora alla tua porta

Questa la tua canzone, Marinella,
Che sei volata in cielo su una stella

Gianna Nannini,"Qui dove il mare luccica e tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto.
Te voglio bene assale
Ma tanto, tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai.
Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e
La bianca scia di un’elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica, si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza,
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all’improvviso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare.

Te voglio bene assale
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai.
Potenza della lirica dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po’ di trucco e
Con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano, così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole, confondono I pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo, anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come la scia di un’elica
Ma sì, è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto.

A chi non ho incontrato

Ai playboy finiti

E a chi sta nei guai 
Dedicato ai cattivi 
Che poi così cattivi non sono mai 
Per chi ti vuole una volta sola 
E poi non ti cerca più 
Dedicato a che capisce quando il gico finisce 
E non si butta giù

A come ero ieri 
E anche per me

Stringimi forte più forte che puoi
Stringimi forte che arriva la notte
Stringimi,Stringimi

Gianna Nannini,"Ho visto
La gente della mia età andare via
Lungo le strade che non portano mai a niente,
Cercare il sogno che conduce alla pazzia
Nella ricerca di qualcosa che non trovano
Nel mondo che hanno già, dentro alle notti che dal vino son bagnate,
Dentro alle stanze da pastiglie trasformate,
Lungo alle nuvole di fumo del mondo fatto di città,
Essere contro ad ingoiare la nostra stanca civiltà
E un dio che è morto,
Ai bordi delle strade dio è morto,
Nelle auto prese a rate dio è morto,
Nei miti dell' estate dio è morto...
 
Mi han detto
Che questa mia generazione ormai non crede
In ciò che spesso han mascherato con la fede,
Nei miti eterni della patria o dell' eroe
Perché è venuto ormai il momento di negare
Tutto ciò che è falsità, le fedi fatte di abitudine e paura,
Una politica che è solo far carriera,
Il perbenismo interessato, la dignità fatta di vuoto,
L' ipocrisia di chi sta sempre con la ragione e mai col torto
E un dio che è morto,
Nei campi di sterminio dio è morto,
Coi miti della razza dio è morto
Con gli odi di partito dio è morto...
 
Ma penso
Che questa mia generazione è preparata
A un mondo nuovo e a una speranza appena nata,
Ad un futuro che ha già in mano,
A una rivolta senza armi,
Perché noi tutti ormai sappiamo
Che se dio muore è per tre giorni e poi risorge,
In ciò che noi crediamo dio è risorto,
In ciò che noi vogliamo dio è risorto,
Nel mondo che faremo dio è risorto",Dio è Morto,2014

Non mi scorderà

Non ti siedi accanto ma sei al mio fianco 
Una carezza che non va più via 
Fuori dalle sabbie mobili 
Vedo una strada senza ostacoli 
E mi riapri il cuore nel profondo 
Sai solo ora quanto ti vorrei 

Ho conosciuto tutti tranne te 
Ancora guardami con gli occhi miei 
Ho voglia di toccare i tuoi capelli 
E ridere di tutto senza un perché 
Ho riabbracciato tutti tranne te 
E scrivo addosso a me la vita mia 
Ho pianto del rimpianto e forse impazzirò 
Per questo, amore 

L'amore che ti do c'è sempre 
L'amore che ti do, per sempre 
L'amore che ti do, che non mi basta mai, che non finisce mai 
L'amore che ti do, che non mi passa mai, che non finisce mai 
Ti ascolto
Mi ascolti? 

Sali su quel treno e andiamo via 
Non è mai tardi, io ci credo alla magia 
E fammi ancora quello sguardo duro
In quello sguardo sono a casa mia 
Parto per restare insieme a te
E se ci credi sarà facile 
Perché non ti nascondo, amore mio 
Mi manca il bene che ti ho voluto io 

Ho conosciuto tutti tranne te 
Ancora guardami con gli occhi miei 
Sorrido mentre il cielo va veloce 
E se ti vedo non ci crederò 
Ho attraversato il mondo senza te 
Ancora incontrami negli occhi tuoi 
E ad ogni mio risveglio ci sarai, lo so 
Vivo d'amore

Gianni Lenoci Trio,"All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side

To write the words again 
That all in love is fair

E cosi cancella tutto e rinasce un fiore sopra un fatto brutto

Urgenti di un amore, che raggiunge chi lo vuole respirare

Dopo che ho guardato a lungo, adesso io mi siedonon ci son rivincite 
Nè dubbi nè incertezze
Ora il fondo è limpido, ora ascolto immobile le tue carezze

Gianni Morandi,"Avrai sorrisi sul tuo viso come ad agosto grilli e stelle
Storie fotografate dentro un album rilegato in pelle
Tuoni di aerei supersonici che fanno alzar la testa
E il buio all'alba che si fa d'argento alla finestra

Avrai un telefono vicino che vuol dire già aspettare
Schiuma di cavalloni pazzi che s'inseguono nel mare
E pantaloni bianchi da tirare fuori che già estate
Un treno per l'America senza fermate

Avrai due lacrime più dolci da seccare
Un sole che si uccide e pescatori di telline
E neve di montagne e pioggia di colline
Avrai un legnetto di cremino da succhiare

Avrai una donna acerba e un giovane dolore
Viali di foglie in fiamme ad incendiarti il cuore
Avrai una sedia per posarti e ore
Vuote come uova di cioccolato
Ed un amico che ti avrà deluso tradito ingannato

Avrai avrai avrai
Il tuo tempo per andar lontano
Camminerai dimenticando
Ti fermerai sognando
Avrai avrai avrai
La stessa mia triste speranza
E sentirai di non avere amato mai abbastanza
Se amore, amore avrai

Avrai parole nuove da cercare quando viene sera
E cento ponti da passare e far suonare la ringhiera
La prima sigaretta che ti fuma in bocca un po' di tosse
Natale di agrifoglio e candeline rosse

Avrai un lavoro da sudare
Mattini fradici di brividi e rugiada
Giochi elettronici e sassi per la strada
Avrai ricordi ombrelli e chiavi da scordare

Avrai carezze per parlare con i cani
E sarà sempre di domenica domani
E avrai discorsi chiusi dentro e mani
Che frugano le tasche della vita
Ed una radio per sentire che la guerra è finita

Avrai avrai avrai
Il tuo tempo per andar lontano
Camminerai dimenticando ti fermerai sognando

Gianni Morandi,"E lungo il Tevere che andava lento lento
Noi ci perdemmo dentro il rosso di un tramonto
Fino a gridare I nostri nomi contro il vento
Tu fai sul serio o no

Tra un walzer pazzo cominciato un po' per caso
Tra le tue smorfie e le mie dita dentro il naso
Noi due inciampammo contro un bacio all'improvviso
Troppo bello per essere vero, per essere vero, per essere vero

Amore mio
Ma che gli hai fatto tu a quest'aria che respiro
E come fai a starmi dentro ogni pensiero
Giuralo ancora che tu esisti per davvero
Amore mio
Ma che che cos'hai tu di diverso dalla gente
Di fronte a te che sei per me così importante 
Tutto l'amore che io posso, proprio niente

Comprammo il pane appena cotto e nacque il sole
Che ci sorprese addormentati sulle scale

Lungo il luccichio dei marciapiedi
E la gente si è dissolta nella sera
Tua madre altezza media sogni medi
Che sbatte gli occhi da cammello
E non si è rassegnata e neanche spera
Un cespuglio di spini tuo fratello
Che pensa sulle unghie delle dita
Appitonato con un'aria da bollito
Tuo padre mani da operaio a vita
Che ride e gli si spacca il viso
Impallidito di TV
Tu fretta di vivere qualcosa
E ogni cosa è già un ricordo liso
E adesso la pubblicità

Tu e le tue voglie imbottigliate
Occhi come buchi della chiave
E un'ansia indolenzita sotto neve bianca
Tuo padre aspetta sempre qualche nave
Funambolo sul filo del passato
E cena insieme a una bistecca stanca
Tuo fratello è un grammofono scassato
Un fiume di pensieri in fuga
Si specchia in un cucchiaio e fa una bocca storta
Tua madre si rammenda qualche ruga
E una domanda di dolcezza
Che porta in tavola e va via
Tu nascosta in fondo a un'amarezza
A far finta che il mondo sia un bel posto
E adesso la pubblicità

Ma che giorno è tutti i giorni
Ed una sera ogni sera
E questa sera come le altre
Che si siede accanto
E non c'è niente che ritorni
Niente allegria e nessun cerino
Per dare fuoco a tutto quanto

Tu in quella schienuccia di uccellino
Che si curva e si vedono gli affanni
Dei tuoi domani e dei tuoi pochi anni

Tuo padre si strofina le mascelle
Come impanate nella barba
Una sigaretta in mezzo ai denti e lui ci parla intorno
Tua madre che si sveglia a strappi e scuote
Tutta la polvere di un giorno
Senza persone e novità
Tuo fratello scemo che dà uno spintone
Al tuo cuore rovesciato come tasche vuote
E adesso la pubblicità

Oggi è quasi un secolo di noia
E che si fa domani e dopo
E poi nei prossimi vent'anni
Figli di speranze
Per un attimo di gioia
Nella città di antenne e cielo
E luci grigie delle stanze

E di sorrisi ingenui, tu

Sopra una panchina fredda del metrò 
Sei lì che aspetti quello delle 7:30 
Chiuso dentro il tuo paletot 
Un tizio legge attento le istruzioni 
Sul distributore del caffè 
E un bambino che si tuffa dentro a un bignè

E l'orologio contro il muro 
Segna l'una e dieci da due anni in qua 
Il nome di questa stazione 
È mezzo cancellato dall'umidità 
Un poster che qualcuno ha già scarabocchiato
Dice ""vieni in Tunisia"" 
C'è un mare di velluto ed una palma 
E tu che sogni di fuggire via

E andare lontano lontano 
Andare lontano lontano

E da una radiolina accesa 
Arrivano le note di un'orchestra jazz 
Un vecchio con gli occhiali spessi un dito 
Cerca la risoluzione a un quiz 
Due donne stan parlando 
Con le braccia piene di sacchetti dell'Upim 
Ed un giornale è aperto 
Sulla pagina dei films

E sui binari quanta vita che è passata 
E quanta che ne passerà 
E due ragazzi stretti stretti 
Che si fan promesse per l'eternità 
Un uomo si lamenta ad alta voce 
Del governo e della polizia 
E tu che intanto sogni ancora 
Sogni sempre sogni di fuggire via

Gianni Morandi,"Quella sua maglietta fina
Tanto stretta al punto che m'immaginavo tutto
E quell'aria da bambina
Che non glie'ho detto mai ma io ci andavo matto
E chiare sere d'estate, il mare, i giochi, le fate
E la paura e la voglia di essere nudi
Un bacio a labbra salate, un fuoco, quattro risate
E far l'amore giù al faro
Ti amo davvero, ti amo lo giuro, ti amo, ti amo davvero

E lei
Lei mi guardava con sospetto
Poi mi sorrideva e mi teneva stretto, stretto
Ed io
Io non ho mai capito niente
Visto che oramai non me lo levo dalla mente
Che lei, lei era

Un piccolo grande amore
Solo un piccolo grande amore
Niente più di questo niente più
Mi manca da morire
Quel suo piccolo grande amore
Adesso che saprei cosa dire
Adesso che saprei cosa fare
Adesso che voglio un piccolo grande amore

Quella camminata strana
Pure in mezzo a chissacchè l'avrei riconosciuta
Mi diceva ""Sei una frana""
Ma io questa cosa qui mica l'ho mai creduta
E lunghe corse affannate incontro a stelle cadute
E mani sempre più ansiose di cose proibite
E le canzoni stonate urlate al cielo lassù
""Chi arriva prima a quel muro""
Non sono sicuro se ti amo davvero
Non sono, non sono sicuro

E lei
Tutto ad un tratto non parlava
Ma le si leggeva chiaro in faccia che soffriva

Nei tuoi occhi il sole muore già 
Scusa se la colpa è un poco mia 
Se non so tenerti ancora qua

Che asciugava il mare 
Che voleva vivere 
Volare 
Che toglieva il fiato 
Ed è ferito ormai 
Non andar via 
Ti prego 

Passerotto non andare via

Con l'anima smaniosa a chiedere di un posto che non c'è 
Tra mille mattini freschi di biciclette 
Mille più tramonti dietro i fili del tram 
Ed una fame di sorrisi e braccia intorno a me 

Io e i miei cassetti di ricordi e di indirizzi che ho perduto 
Ho visto visi e voci di chi ho amato prima o poi andar via 
E ho respirato un mare sconosciuto nelle ore 
Larghe e vuote di un'estate di città 
Accanto alla mia ombra nuda di malinconia 

Io e le mie tante sere chiuse come chiudere un ombrello 
Col viso sopra il petto a leggermi i dolori ed i miei guai 
Ho camminato quelle vie che curvano seguendo il vento 
E dentro a un senso di inutilità
E fragile e violento mi son detto tu vedrai, vedrai, vedrai 

Strada facendo, vedrai 
Che non sei più da solo 
Strada facendo troverai 
Un gancio in mezzo al cielo 
E sentirai la strada far battere il tuo cuore 
Vedrai più amore, vedrai 

Io troppo piccolo fra tutta questa gente che c'è al mondo 
Io che ho sognato sopra un treno che non è partito mai 
E ho corso in mezzo a prati bianchi di luna 
Per strappare ancora un giorno alla mia ingenuità 
E giovane e invecchiato mi son detto tu vedrai vedrai, vedrai 

Strada facendo vedrai 
Che non sei più da solo 
Strada facendo troverai 
Anche tu un gancio in mezzo al cielo 
E sentirai la strada far battere il tuo cuore 
Vedrai più amore, vedrai 

E una canzone neanche questa potrà mai cambiar la vita 
Ma che cos'è che ci fa andare avanti e dire che non è finita 
Cos'è che mi spezza il cuore tra canzoni e amore 
Che mi fa cantare e amare sempre più 
Perché domani sia migliore, perché domani tu 

Strada facendo vedrai (perché domani sia migliore, perché domani tu)
Strada facendo vedrai (perché domani sia migliore, perché domani tu)

Insieme a luci di periferia 
Zampate della vita sulle mie ossa 
Sei più sincera quando dici una bugia 

Sull'asfalto acquoso una luna affilata 
Tagliare i fili che legano le stelle 
Stringo al cuore una lattina vuota 
E scopro che hai lasciato le unghie sulla mia pelle 
Finestrini aperti a dissetarmi di vento 
La mia ruota incollata sulla striscia bianca 
Della mezzeria 

Gli occhi come due pezzi di vetro 
Tu non sei come ti credevo io 
Un autotreno mi ruggisce dietro 
Ma perché hai fatto il mondo così triste, Dio? 

Alberi si drizzano ai lati della strada 
Mi corrono accanto e il buio se l'inghiotte 
Alla radio un rock arrabbiato come un pugno allo stomaco 
Che mi stringe nella notte 
Un dolore e un lampo di fuoco rosso 
Dentro a questo amore che io non posso, io non posso più 

Voglio andar via 
I piedi chiedono dove ma via 
Tanto non ti perderò perché tu non sei stata mai mia 
Voglio andar via 
Da quei tuoi occhi che tirano sassi 
E come in un duello far dieci passi e poi 
Guardarci un'ultima volta e via 

Dimmi che cos'è che ci hanno fatto 
Dimmi cosa c'è che io non so 
Perché tutto è finito come cenere in un piatto 
E quei ragazzi che eravamo no, non ci sono più 

E scambiare due parole brevi 
Con la notte blu dei benzinai 
Io ti baciavo mentre tu piangevi 
E adesso che io piango, tu chi bacerai? 

Un caffè che drizza i capelli, un pacchetto di fumo 
E il vento rilegge il mio giornale 
E domani uscire di nuovo, farmi una faccia allegra 
Per il prossimo Carnevale 
Un dolore freddo come un rasoio 
Per un altro giorno che nasce, muoio, muoio, muoio 

Voglio andar via 
I sogni cercano dove ma via 
Anche all'inferno ci sarà qualcuno a farmi compagnia 
Voglio andar via 
Da te, che goccia a goccia hai spremuto il mio cuore 
E dagli straccivendoli ricomprare quel che resta 
Del mio amore e andare via",Via,2016

La voglia di chiamarti amore come non te l'avessi mai detto

Gianni Russo,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2005

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams

All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high

I will be remembering

And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.

A taste on my lips, a whispering word in your ear
Oh passion, we're children just playing with passion

Still we hold on to the bitter end, thinking we can never lose
Baby it's a cold night and the winds of change are blowing

And these are the innocent days
Standing on the rocks, waiting for the tidal waves
Dreaming of love, but living inside the lands
And these are the innocent days, I know we're the last of the runaways

Never return, till love takes us home
Lover, we're drowning our doubts in each other
Closing our eyes, we bury the truth in the sand
I cannot take it, 'cause when we don't feel it, we fake it
Oh someday these nights come back to haunt us again
Oh we lie here at the water's edge, wishing we could float away
'Cause it's too late to turn back, when the only bridge is burning

Standing on the rocks, waiting for the tidal waves
Dreaming of love, but living inside the lands

It takes two, two hearts that beat together, to make it feel like one

It takes two, it takes two

I've been blinded by this fear inside that love is just a game
You distract yourself with someone else, and both havin' travelled in pain

I carry on, but getting over lovin' you
Is the toughest thing I've ever had to do
'Cause you took me straight to heaven, and I've never been so high

[Chorus]
I'm lost in paradise, without your love my heart has paid the price
I won't let go of yesterday, will I ever find my way
I'm lost in paradise

I can't sleep at night, I reach out in the darkness
To hold you close, but you're not there
I try to forget this dream of making love to you
But the memory is more than I can bear
I could find a way to make it, if I knew that you still cared

[Chorus]

Someday I'll find you, I'll search through heaven and hell
Until I have you back in my arms again, I'm lost in

Giant,"Sometimes love feels like an empty room
It's cold and silent, you got nowhere to go
And sometimes the feeling's over way too soon
'Til you find someone who tells you so
And don't you know, you're my reason for tomorrow

[Chorus:]
And I need you, now until forever
All my life I've waited for someone like you
Love won't die if we put our hearts together
You and I can make this dream come true
Now until forever
I need you

We thread emotions to be strong enough to withstand all elements of time
When we're together where there's only love
Never felt a heartbeat so close to mine
Don't you know you're my reason for tomorrow

[Chorus]

It's our love, a love that lifts us high enough
We can survive any storm, where no one's ever been before
And tomorrow will be brighter now, even yesterday is new
And all our promises ring true, and everything I have, I give to you

Sometimes love feels like an empty room, but now that all seems oh so long ago

Guard their histories well

Giant Sand,"The car stopped running in the middle of the road
Beyond any phone line or 911 code
Hopes were dismal we'd ever get towed
And if we slept in that ride we might awake upon explode

It was as dark as night when the sun went down
Long after we left the last little town
Not even the endless heat of day cared to stick around
It got as cold as it gets here then got colder we found

The linkage must've jammed 'cause now the Chevy won't budge
The kid sleeps on your lap and won't wake when you nudge
You left a whole world of light behind, now you hold a grudge
And as you carry the kid out, you curse the clutch

It'll be a wonder if you both can avoid the death of cold
This stuff used to be cake but now takes its toll
How can you be this unlucky just to get this unlucky old?
And you wonder what else lives in this slice of road

And you lie to your hands, you lie to your heart
You lie to your liver and tell them they will survive
Ironically, as you lie there by the side of the road
And can't wait for the sun to come and burn off the cold

When you awake it's still dark
And the thunder could mean rain
You check the child's breathing
And curse the clutch again

It seems impossible that no one has passed
Or crashed into your ride
And as the lull of sleep again attacks
The rain finds where you hide

Somewhere there's a bar filled with the careless and content
Somewhere folks are happy and don't care which way you went
Somewhere it's even warmer than the day you just spent
And wish them away with deplore and lament

There's songs that come to mind
When the mud turns blood to ice
A dance that shows itself
When the night becomes so spiced
A realm you never felt that steals away the life
Out of your heart, out of your soul, it takes a slice

With the dull grey thud of morning
You can't believe you're not dead
The child wakes with a smile
And just wants to be fed

There were no ghosts of the past
Nor visions of the days ahead
And as you stand to stretch
You flag down a blue flat bed

The world don't need another lover
The world don't need another lover
I've had a pocketful of love in my time
But the best of all's you
I guess we perfected the emotional thing
Just we two
I searched all over for the permanent one
And then I found you
'cause' no one's better when the lights go down
And there's just we two
Chorus:
The world don't need another lover
Now it's got you now it's got me
The world don't need another lover
'cause' our love's more than the whole world needs
Baby
You can't buy passion like it every day
From a second hand heart
You just can't separate the meant to be
They can't tear us apart

Girl our love's invincible
I''m so proud with your hand in my hand
Catch a wind and fly away
We're on a one day trip to wonderland

Girl, we live in a world that goes too fast
People don't give a love a chance
You have to say wait - stop and communicate
And girl, now thaat you're here and we're alone
It's time for a little one on one
I've got to say this I know we can't miss

I'll never let you down
And I can be, all that you need

[Chorus:]
I'm into you (into you)
I'm into you tonight
I'm into you (helplessly)
'Til you get into me

Girl, your laugh is the sweetest sound I've heard
Baby I hang on every word
You say that you care, I'm walking on air

It's stronger everyday
And all I do, is only for you

[Chorus X 2]
I'll be a fool if I should hide
'cause' it's all that you see and want it to be
Baby, please stay and feel the same way I do

I'll never let you down
'cause' I can be all that you need

Better throw her in the water
Look at her laughing
Like a heifer to the slaughter

Baby's on fire

Waiting for photos
Oh the plot is so bewitching

Do your best to change the subject
Blow the wind blow blow
Lend some assistance to the object

Photographers snip snap
Take your time she's only burning
This kind of experience
Is necessary for her learning

I could be half the man I used to
They said you were hot stuff
And that's what baby's been reduced to

Very clever with maracas
Making their fortunes
Selling secondhand tobaccoes

Juan dances at Chico's
And when the clients are evicted
He empties the ashtrays
And pockets all that he's collected

And all the instruments agree that
Her temperature's rising
But any idiot would know that

Welcome back to cap session till the sun went down
Slap box your way before you ever left the town

Welcome back to one on one fight with no grounds
Bein' fired fat boy signing session in tower
Run DMC, Houdini my first rap album
Brush groove, back when Run asked the crowd who's house

Breaking one, breakin' two beats street wild style
Jackin' five Christmas playin' on your radio dial
Reminiscing, drifting on a memory in this rap
Welcome back, welcome back

Welcome back to the crush on a girl next door
Fifth period in homeroom passin back notes
Welcome back to family barbecues every month
Sometimes there would be arguments but it was all love

Welcome back to coasters and karate shoes
The great space coaster no ganoos(?) is good ganoos(?)
Way before you ever had a sip of your first booze
Drunk off life the simple things kept you amused

Welcome back to box cuts and jags
Jheri curl activate a rock in the plastic bag with a hat on the top
When niggas started to sag and gang bang
Even if you didn't you had to claim

Rockin' corduroy hats with a crease on top
Stealing fake gazelles out of the local thrift shop
Reminiscing, drifting on a memory in this rap
Welcome back, welcome back 

We keep it movin y'all, we keep it movin' y'all
We take it back y'all, we take it back y'all

Welcome back to summer time expos in the park
Beach cruisers padded with the black foam on the bars
Welcome back cotter good times what happening now
Sanford and son, the Cosby show that my momma

Gucci sweat shirt light blue furry ??
The feel of Mickey Mouse shirt that said yo baby yo
Spuds McKenzie pee wees dance doin' the rutt
Robocop, cabbage patch fake id in the club

African medallion school days do the right thing
I get raw still number one microphone fiend

It's like we more like brothers than nephew and uncle
Comin' up at times seem survival is like a jungle
Understanding takes time, some lessons we gotta go through
I remember when we was young and the price tag on those days and nights
Can't be measured or bought
Sometimes I wish we could bring 'em back
Sundays at church, comin' home from work
Kept it on the low you lent me two dollars for them burritos
Headed out to the bay to focus on dreams
Sometimes I feel I shoulda been there for guidance
But I was learnin' what it means to be a man, still am
And every time I think I figured it out the universe expands
We was supposed to bring you out on the road
When dough got ripe
We ain't even had a chance to chill, it's just not right, man
I guess the street life had other plans, but I'm gonna see you in a minute doe

Stay strong and take in all the knowledge that you can
Stay healthy and keep in touch, I get them letters flowin' fam
This ain't goodbye, all it is is just a test to make you stronger
Be a soldier, from here we only move forward
Upward, onward, and over the hump
And yo, I know that it's a lot of years
But it's a whole lot of precious life left for you to live
God dwells within, find Him inside, free you soul
No matter what they'll never lock up your mind
So let your thoughts flow, free
And be the best you can be, learn from your mistakes
You got a destiny, man, your life's purpose is to take it there

It's been a long time comin' as well
Lots of rises, lots of falls, lots of stories to tell
Lots of 40 ounce session couch surfin', hotel
Residency, got to pay the rent, fuck it, oh well
Came to a point where a drink meant death
Cold turkey, nerves shook, all the stress repressed
Bubbled up to the surface, now I'm lookin' at me
Face to face with myself, simply tryin' to be
Sometimes it's hard to just be, when you're blinded in mist
I wonder if other people go through shit like this

Skipped out on some roommates, cussed out a few bosses
Explosion of the ego, the power of the sauce/source
I guess that I was lookin' for a confidence loss
Somewhere along the road I must have made a wrong turn
But I've come to realize that it's just a long journey
Used to search for the meaning 'till one dark summernight

Seeing beneath the surface, faith followed by action
I live it all now, with a hunger and a passion
And when I get stuck I let go and keep mashin'
And when I get stuck, I get still and just ask Him
For knowledge of His will, then my third eye transcends
Thought and everything now's exactly like it's supposed to be
Channel when I'm givin' and give it back out, over beats
Every now and then I think of how things work
All that's fuel for fire now, it's funny how things work

Dying, stabbing, shooting, thinking

Yo, check it out, one time

All the bull stop's here, I'm the matador
Here to introduce a new rap category
Climb on top of my music, mine Matterhorn
Rhyme for rhyme, you don't really want to battle boy
Just another clip added in my catalog
Get your money young playa, I ain't mad at y'all
Here to bring soul like stas-gladisol (?)
Drop the fatter raw verbal mic analog
Sorry y'all, but I didn't bring a Gatt along
Just a pen that does tricks like a magic wand
Get my cadence and a whole rap pattern on
As the sky just falls over Babylon
Travel on Pluto, Venus, Earth, Saturn on
To the place many sane brains haven't gone
When it come to this here
'specially in this year
Frankly I don't have it all

In a world full of shyst type criminals
Make a LP filled like cinema
Bring light like a rhyme prime minister
Send ya up write it off on adrenaline
On a scale of one to ten it's a ten and a
Half, feel my wrath now, sucka nigga what?
Used to puff on a daily pack of cigarettes
Til I bought a pack of chewin gum, Nicorette
Come to find that I had to get rid of that
Now at shows I got more wind in the set
Wrote a alcohol free song in the next
Thirty days drunk again like hypocrites
Dude, my ego isn't quite that deflated yet
Signed a deal with a major haven't made it yet
Got a past cable bill haven't paid it yet
Crazy wit, now I love my life takin it
Where it hasn't been taken yet

Rhyme to the rhythm
When I slip in to the zone
And zero deep into the ruse
It's to astonish my opponents
When I'm on it like I own it
Make the whole galaxy call it scripted
Held ya deep within a different world
Lightly, so only are to wane vain main
Never plain, stained brains
Try to elevate from here
Not just to simply maintain
To the vain bang boogie watch my spirit blang blang
I don't need no change of jewelery
I don't need a dang thang
Hang, rappers like you
That don't produce a realer(?) product
It's my soul's interpretation
If you want it, hey I got it
Only so much time allotted
Many thoughts that must be jotted
Clearing out the mind that's clotted
Not I'm writting on some 'Pac shit
In the month of august, take a break out to the farthest
Region on my rocketship
Now y'all MC's can eat my starter
See the crew I rep is Quannum
y'all the bench, we the starters
We the meal, the main course
For your belly, y'all some tottlers
Keep it modest, open honest
I don't claim to be the hardest
Killer, wit' a gun, I really, only want to be a artist
Travel the entire atlas, global trotter
Got a lot a proper type of sharper, riper, I can concentrate(?) to offer

In the middle of the sky, you see my Drella glimpse(?) just passing
Middle of the night, it's dusty, yet it's clear
Like as if you dipping your third eye into a tab of liquid acid
For some pyschedelic clarity to breath within the madness

When you're out and you're far away from home
And your heart and your mind, they start to roam
Fallin' out from the time they spark the zone
Seein' girls from the night they got you stoned

When you're out and you're far away from home
And your heart and your mind, they start to roam
Fallin' out from the time they spark the zone
Seein' girls from the night they got you stoned

Left the planet Earth to get a wider like perspective
On the bigger picture, now I'm steady cruising through the nebula
Headed out to Mars, with souls and minds are more connected
Built with elders how to conquer
Ignorance the mighty predator
I be the cosmic editor
And when it rains I let it pour
And if I'm sure I'm Thor, I guess I'll be the lyric pedd-a-ler
I'm deadly with the medley
Steady, ready with the metaphor
MC's are R.I.P. if they love life they why they said it for?
Headed for your head, it's gonna erupt, I'm blowing up
And popping this, it's cool I be the judge and jury
With the Johnny Cochran savvy, plus I hit the cabby green up really often
When I'm rocking like I rock it now, stopping is not an option
How a biased force subsided, never will run outta ammo
Used to build with pharoahs, riding through the desert on a camel
Ran into a camel by the name of Joe thought he was wacko
All he did was smile and pose and get my folks hooked on tobacco
I crackle as I rap, I pro attack a slacker
Never clever, sever heads
I'm clever, yes, I'll never dread a battle
If they white, they put they thumbs up up like fists if it's an afro
In the Bay I'm hella tight and plus I'm filthy in Seattle

In the middle of the sky, you see my Drella glimpse(?) just passing
Middle of the night, it's dusty, yet it's clear

Straight off the top connection conversation and some laughter
I feel I got to have ya
Though the friendship part we mastered to go and past that
Like make it a little complicated at times I stand back
And wonder if I'm missing my appointment on your M-track line
I really think it's time for you and me to pass that line

But when I'm with you I just get the sense that fate is closing in
I'm frozen in time, it's more than just you being a dyme
I see the other half of me when I look in your eyes, reflection
Soul connection for feeling circles, still working on myself
You too, I work with you through this cold world
There's no girl, that's making me do

You're everything that I ever been looking for in a lady
Should I just ignore it? and move forward?
Set's sort to assure us a fortune and build a fortress transcending metamorphis
Take a vacation out in europe, leave the whole continent tourin

To vital organs, forming your brain and tiny heart
The fetus, date of birth; until puberty finally starts
Adolescence, adult, then your elderly body rots
It was divine decree that begun the plan
But is diseased by the greed of the sons of man
Don't try to leave with the guns in hand
Understand: God's the one in command

Did we climb out of the sea?
Where did we come from, you and me?
Two legs to walk, and as you see
I'm not a man I want to be
People growing, my backyard (I'm growing in your backyard)
In my garden, in my heart (I'm in your garden, I'm in your heart)
Pink and purple, red and blue (See all the colors?)
On this sunny afternoon (It's a sunny afternoon)

Back before time was time and space was space
The ever-present eye divine so laced with grace
Decided it was time to try to chase, to chase
But what it would design, now life is taking place
Within itself, divided; now it takes some space
And it can't be found alive, the mind creates the state
Of ego, now what's mine is mine
OK, now hate will reign until the blind have eyes and lay awake in wait

How are the seeds in the ground?
How is my garden growing now?
A tender kiss, a little smile
The way a mother holds its child
Tasty little human beings (Tasty little human beings)
I grow them on the people tree (I grow them on the people tree)
I will eat them one by one (Eat them one by one)
If there's enough for everyone (Like you and you)

Born in the ever-flowing life beyond the dirt
Tell me what the purpose is for creating the earth
(Maybe we created the planet as man's habitat
Be fruitful and multiply across the planet's back)
Well, why does hate exist?
The war and AIDS and shit?
If we're to be fruitful, why can't poor people pay they rent?
('Cause love and hate, both sides are conjoined
Physical forms have to deal with both sides of the coin)
Why do we die? (So you can live!)
Why do we strive? (So you can win!
But why did you defy every truthful word I recommend?)
My question back, why do you recommend an ode temptationing
(So I can test your patience and tolerance in the face of sin)
But why attest when you hold all the answers to the state we in?
(For you to bear witness of imperfections of mortal men)
So it's a lesson? (And a blessing
Journey back to where you been

Goes around and around

Nights in the scullery
And days instead of me
I only know what to discuss
Of for anything but light

Wise men fighting over you
It's not me you see
Pieces of valentine
With just a song of mine

To keep from burning history
Seasons of gasoline and gold
Wise men fold
Near a tree by a river

There's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of aran

Gigi D'Alessio,"Sembrava una ragazza fusa
Le coprivano anche il naso quegli occhiali
Senza età
Per qualche brufolo sul viso rimaneva
Chiusa in casa con la sua malinconia
Che le faceva compagnia
Ed io la odiavo
Vestita da buttare via
Dava quella nostalgia di una vecchia ferrovia
Sembrava fatta con la cera
Della luna qualche sera era l’altra sua metà
Caduta sopra la città, ed io
La odiavo
Lo sguardo nero di un guerriero
50 chili di mistero mi portava sfiga
Come un gatto nero, come un miracolo annunciato
Quell’anatroccolo è cambiato ed io
Se avevo il tempo di pensare
Che nell'odio c’era amore
Ero ‘o primm’ a ma vasà
Forse gli occhiali
Quei suoi vestiti, so stete a me ‘mbruglià
Si travestiva fino al cuore
Quella strega dell’amore, me facette annammurà
Vorrei gridare per non morire
C'è un altro al posto mio
La storia che t’ho raccontato
È un ricordo del passato che divido insieme a te
Da quando lei si è innamorata
Ho perduto un grande amico ma non l’hai capito mai
Solo stasera scoprirai
Che io l’amavo
Sarò un vigliacco per amore, facevo finta di pensare
Che portava sfiga come un gatto nero
Dell'”anotroccolo sposato” io sono ancora innamorato
Addio

Gigi D'Alessio,"Sta scoppiando l'alba e la città
Sta svegliando pure noi e le nostre incomprensioni
Mi regali un altro giorno in più di nevrosi e di tabù
Con le solite ossessioni
Solo con un po' di fantasia, io ti vedo
A modo mio, ma vorrei mandarti via
Poi ritorno a stare male, si raffredda il mio motore
Quella che sognavo non sei tu
Poi mi sveglio e trovo accanto a me
Il tuo corpo senza te, che mi dai
Per far l'amore, tutto il resto l'hai portato via
Qui non è più casa sua, tu vuoi somigliare a Dio
E tagliando a pezzi il cuore mio, ogni giorno butti via
Quel che resta del mio amore
Vorrei morire lontano da te
Ma per morire ho bisogno di te
Vorrei comprare quel vuoto per dare al tuo corpo
Anche l'anima
Scusami
Se con te sono stato nel letto
Anche a volte romantico
Io credevo ad un'amore che supera tutti
Gli ostacoli, regalandoti tutto me stesso e mai
Niente a metà
Scusami se ho cenato con te qualche volta
Coi fiori sul tavolo
E ho rubato dai libri le frasi più belle da scrivere
Pronto pure a portarti la luna dal cielo qua giù
Potevi dirmelo che i tempi cambiano
Ed io capivo che forse l'amore non era così
Non emozionarti in quest'addio
Non è giusto amore mio
Non ti sto mandando al diavolo
Sapessi quanto ho bisogno di te, ma tu non hai più
Interesse per me, è senza prezzo quel vuoto
Per dare al tuo corpo anche l'anima

Sai che mi va
Parlare quando dorme tutta la città
Coraggio dai
Io sono qua
Ad ascoltare se qualcosa più non va

Mi puoi dire quel che non diresti mai
Anche il fatto che ogni tanto ci ripensi a quella storia
E se stai male
Arrangiati bella mia

Che sintonizza cuore ed anima

Ma cosa fai
Non parli più
Senti dei passi e allora spegni la TV
Poi dici che
Senza un perchè
Sto litigando qui al telefono con te

Non ti dico mai più
Me ne vado da te

Scusa ancora però
Tu non piangere più
Altrimenti lo so
Corro e vengo da te per baciarti le lacrime

E che nessuno può calmare tranne te

Tu che ne sai, e se cade una stella dal cielo la dedico a noi
Che respiro i ricordi più belli in un dolce replay
Ma diventa più grigio del fumo quell'arcobaleno
Non c'è sale nell'acqua del mare
Non riscaldano i raggi del sole, lontano da te
Dove sarai avrai già raccontato la storia che parla di noi
Ce l'hai ancora nascosto il segreto più bello che hai

Passerà però adesso fa male

Crescerebbe la speranza dentro me

Gigi D'Alessio,"Ho bisogno di dirti che si sta male,
È una vita da schifo se non ci sei
E mi trovo col mio disordine nel cuore senza te,
Scatoloni pieni di ricordi che non vanno via.

Ho bisogno di dirti che non è vero
Sono sempre geloso dei fatti tuoi,
Sono io che la notte chiamo al tuo telefono lo sai
Sento solamente la tua voce ma non parlo mai.

Io vorrei riprovarci ancora,
Io vorrei ma non so se tu lo vuoi.
Quante cose ho bisogno di dirti ancora,
Non possiamo lasciare tutto a metà.

Questo amore ci appartiene dal profondo
Basta chiedere.
Ma io vorrei salutarti ancora,
Io vorrei respirarti ancora,
Io vorrei fare tutto questo se lo vuoi.

Ho bisogno di dirti che sto da solo,
Non see'è stata nessuna dopo di te.
Mentre il vento mi asciuga il viso da una lacrima che see'è,
Sto pensando che è lo stesso vento che accarezza te.

Io vorrei riprovarci ancora,
Io vorrei ma non so se tu lo vuoi.
Se lasciamo parlare ogni tanto il cuore,
Viene fuori da sola la verità.

Non see'è amore senza piccoli dolori
Che ci cambiano.

Io vorrei accompagnarti ancora,
Io vorrei fare tutto questo se lo vuoi.",Io Vorrei,2002
Gigi D'Alessio,"Una come te è
L'ingranaggio esatto 
Che sta bene a me, caratterino acceso
Una come te è un dosatore giusto 
Zucchero e caffè sai darti bene 
Quando leggi che il tuo segno vincerà

Logica per me ma da studiare bene
Una come te è una poesia d'amore 
Dedicata a me come sei dolce

Miele che poi diventa sale

Col gusto che c'è in te

Gigi D'Alessio,"Ero ancora ragazzino
E con mio padre litigavo
Per i brutti voti a scuola e un solo sei
Ma di musica lo giuro
Ne facevo indigestione
Preferivo un pianoforte che due calci ad un pallone

Sopra quei tasti che sfioravo
Era tutto bianco e nero intorno a me

Sorridevano felici

Ti pensavo sempre più

Siamo un po' troppo vicini adesso per scappare via

Tu non lo sai
Prima di te
C'è stato un altro che ha lasciato
Le ferite dentro me

Non aver paura giuro amore sono qui a difenderti
Con il tempo guarirò il tuo cuore cancellando i lividi
E per tutti i giorni che verranno ti respirerò

Io ti dirò le cose dette mai
Di questo amore noi saremo gli angeli

Per la vita ti farà

Sembra cominciata già
Una storia senza fine

Farò girare il mondo intorno a noi
Arriverà Natale senza nuvole
Le domeniche d'agosto
Quanta neve che cadrà
E nel tempo che verrà
Il mio cuore ti sorprenderà

Che freddo fa
Stringimi un po'

Gigi D'Alessio,"L'orologio non va l'ora esatta qual'è
Ma la gente in città non sa niente di me 
Sembra tutto normale 
Son convinto ormai l'hai capito anche tu 
Questo amore per te è svanito così 
Come un'onda del mare 
Non mi chiedere più la ragione qual'è 
Io sto peggio di te a parlare così 
Mi fa male davvero 
Voglio solo che tu abbia cura di te 
E se parli di noi con la rabbia che hai 
Non spararmi nel cuore 
Odiarmi non è facile per te 

Via 
Io devo andare via 
A colpa non è mia 
Se adesso non riesco più a chiamarti amore mio

Aspettano anche me 
Ricordi malinconici 
Che odorano di te 

Via 
Un taglio a tutto e via 
Senza pensarci più 
Quello che adesso voglio non è quello che vuoi tu 
Ma restare fa male anche a te 
Io domani non so dove andrò che farò, 
Tanto non morirò sono morto già qui 
Nel lasciarti stasera. 
Resta lì dove sei non guardarmi così 
Mentre vado, lo so che se piangi per me,

Gigi D'Alessio,"Si comincerà quando il seno crescerà
A sentire dentro il cuore un altro battito
E si perderà
Per un bacio dato già
Quella voglia di giocare con le bambole
Cambierà il sapore delle lacrime
Se promette e poi non ti telefona
E la vita sembrerà
Una nave già affondata per metà

E ti inventerai quella solita bugia
Dormire a casa di un'amica sabato
Quando insieme a lui
Fino all'alba resterai
Per scoprire dove nasce il primo brivido
Guarderai le stelle mentre cadono
Quanti desideri avrai da chiedere
La tua penna scriverà
Quello che succederà
Sulle pagine invisibili dell'anima

Ti regalerà dentro il cammino dell'età
Una spiaggia dove il sole il giorno dopo arriverà
E ti stringerà d'inverno dentro un cinema in città
E all'uscita della scuola tutti i giorni aspetterà
Ti regalerà dentro il cammino dell'età
Un vagone tricolore per un anno se ne andrà
Coi capelli un po' più corti quando lui ritornerà
Sarai pronta a far l'amore questa volta non soltanto per metà

Ci saranno crisi da difendere
Colpa di un'amica troppo stupida
E se lui non chiamerà
Il tuo orgoglio piangerà
Sulle pagine invisibili dell'anima

Ti regalerà dentro il cammino dell'età
Due parole senza cuore quella storia finirà
E ti sentirai morire per le cose date già
Dove poggerai lo sguardo tutto gli assomiglierà
Ti regalerà dentro il cammino dell'età
Quella rabbia di sapere se stavolta ci sarà
Taglierai tutte le foto e strappando solo lui
Sarà come una vendetta contro chi ha strappato tutti i sogni tuoi

Proprio nel momento in cui non ci credevi più
Tornerà quel sole dentro l'anima
E darai colore un'altra volta al cielo blu
E potrai capire che la vita dà di più
Ti ritroverai dentro il cammino dell'età
A capire se davvero l'uomo giusto è questo qua
E bagnando la tua penna dentro il cuore scriverai
Il suo nome sulle pagine invisibili dell'anima che hai",Il Cammino Dell'età,2003
