Triple Seis,"Blam!
Bang bang baby!
Yeah, Terror Squad style
Trizzie, check it out now

Yo, I'm rated X in sex, I flex like Lex Lugor
So who's next to get scooped up by this roughneck from Cuba?
We do maneuvers like Super Dave, always with a group of babes
Sayin ""Mami's out"" like Sugar Ray
Cause Cuban Link don't play miss, I flip and do some strange {shit}
Witchu like hit you with the whips and chains, check it
I get you naked like I'm mystic, cause this {dick} is
Thick as a brick, raw with big {balls} that bend it
Now let's get, physical, my jiggable pie
Let this lyrical guy scuba dive right between your thighs
I satisfy like a Snickers bar cause I'm the bigger bar
That'll stick you quicker than a 'spic will strip a car
My repoitoire holds a four star performance with all women
Hittin more skins than Alec Baldwin
You're fallin in love and you can't get up
Now check the cut, I stripped ya, now you can't strut, word up

Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Yeah, uh, uh, yo
Paradin in the Palladium, all eyes on my presence
Poppin the Crist', sportin the chick straight out of Essence
Word up, patch thug, three quarter front Polo jiggy
Be like 'Who is he, lookin like a grizzly?'
While your girl watch me, you're busy drink pissy
Wanna lay your love, but your love wanna kiss me, huh
I got a fly team, me and my guys gleam like high beams
Makin the killin off of fiends with pipe dreams
It might seem, like I'm conceited with the cream talk
But I got the kind of green that could bribe a Supreme Court
And when we talk, the whole world listen
Turn your back to T. S. for one second and find your girl missin

Baby make me holla, take it off, I give you dolla
We can party til manana ain't nobody gotta know nada
Word to Allah, give me some Mississippi massana
I'll be in the sauna, troopin the naga like the chupacabra
Cool it mama, you gettin too hot, bust a shot
Boo - yaa! Rub it up and down like my oo - wops
Suscia!, show me your dirty dance
The way you work the pants make any man wanna jerk his gnads

Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Yo, my {shit's} official like it in you like, Keith Murray
Bury my beef, gettin your sweet cherry every week if necessary
I'm very nasty like Nas, did you ask me?
Pass me those {ass}cheeks and I'll bring you joy like BlackSTREET
In the backseat of my Jeep, we can chill
Or Creep like TLC but don't sleep, I keep it real
What the deal mami, you wanna feel on my steel salami?
Come and try me, I'll sign my name all over your punani

Ohh mami, you comin home with me
All night in my tub drinkin Hennessey
Gettin lyed up with your thighs up, I'ma surprise her
When I rise up, inside her
Yippie kay yay, I'ma ride her, and guide her
Straight to the triz, where we goin, straight to the crib
Pun in here and Cuban and Seis, you know what time it is
Soon as we walk in the crib, let's get biz

TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ (oahkayyy!)

Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Since ya man can't do it like Link (like Link?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Seis (like Seis?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Bet ya man can't do it like Crack (like Crack?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Pun (like Pun?)
I make you scream papa (you the best bana!)

Bet ya man can't do it like Link (like Link?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Seis (like Seis?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Bet ya man can't do it like Crack (like Crack?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Pun (like Pun?)
I make you scream papa - adios mama!

[JuJu] 
East to West, even if you wearin a vest 
They gon' find you with a crowbar dug in your chest 
Look at the best, still only second or less 
And even he said he don't want it with me, figure the rest 
Bigger distress, whole crew avoidin the rest 
You know the name of my click, nigga it start wit a tres 
dog that'll reload and bark with the best 
Dark with a cold heart spittin darts through your flesh 

[Psycho Les] 
You know the street code, stash the kilo 
Jump on a speedboat, blowin weed smoke 
Countin G notes, I made off the Chino's 
But this one Chino want to play Pacino 
So he standin in front of me lookin stupid like a moron 
Crept up on him (CREW) caught him with the forearm 
Called up Big Ju, M.A. nigga, the war's on 
(Fuckin with this bitch dog, let me put my drawers on) 

Chorus: Beatnuts (repeat 2X) 

Got my eyes on cheddar, as I strive to live live and better 
Cause all the shine will be mine forever 
So it's now or never, we get down whatever 
Four-pounds and leather, Beatnuts'll let off rounds forever 

[JuJu] 
Bite your face off, pull your heart out, flood it with steak sauce 
Chop you up, til there's no limbs for me to break off 
Kick your stupid ass it's just tragic nigga and take off 
Go kill everybody at work and take the day off 

[Psycho Les] 
And pay you a visit 
And knock your door down, strongman with the four-pound 
Put the joint in your mouth and push your jaw down 
(Oh) You ready for war now, lacin your hightops? 
Doma, one in the head, now who's the cyclops? 

[JuJu] 
No peace, niggaz want beef, you know we love it 
Champagne under the arm, gun in the bucket 
Never seen it comin like that, you had a chance Pah 
Now you like, ""Oh shit!"" +Blood's on the Dancefloor+ 

[Psycho Les] 
Corona Queens, where half of my crew be at 
You didn't expect this booby trap cause I'm such a groovy cat 
If you my dog then I got you with a Scooby Snack 
If you a ?, fakin a movie jack? 

[JuJu] 
I let the mac off, finish the act with the hats on 
The plan is you vanish, like you standin on a trapdoor 
I'm back for what is rightfully mine 
I spitefully rhyme, every word a trifle design 

Chorus 

[JuJu] 
Yo it's the livest nigga you ever heard, that's my word 
like a demon spittin Hell at thirty-three and a third 
You want to do it with Ju, you gotta find me 
And if you do FAGGOT, better sneak up behind me 
See that's the only way that you gon' get me 
And if you wet me I'ma turn around and laugh so you never forget me 
To my double-gat niggaz who talk shit and bubble crack 
This year, y'all niggaz gon' hear me on a couple tracks 

[Psycho Les] 
Spittin like a thirty-eight caliber 
Any challenger? One stands up, get handcuffed, to the banister 
Beat down your manager, now leave with my dough 
You can't be mad at the, hustler from the Queens borough 
It's Big Psych', we can go at it, like a pit fit 
Everything I spit tight, go out after midnight 
Like a vampire, call me your messiah 
""To burn my kingdom, you must use fire"" 

What, who the best nigga? 
Beatnuts!

Triple Seis,"Yo, I'ma lay the law with A.K.'s or metaphors
Make way for the ghetto roar, these days I set it off
Y'all hardcore, that's why I batter you all
Shatter they jaw, batter the core to make a fatter than yours

Terror Squad to my death, tombstone on my chest
With the chrome in the vest, alone or with T.S.
I'ma rep it, I'm a Dominican, now you accept it
It's like you seen death and chose the Lord as the shepherd

You skeptical, niggas on the block ain't respectin' you
Checkin' you, ain't gonna stop when they deckin' you
Who gon' dock you? I'm comin' at you like a tackle
To leave a personal scar in your chest like a tattoo

Seis'll clap you, put your dick in the dirt
Click at a herb when I spit a clip and rip through your shirt
I'm the worst of the beast, put my work on the streets
Do the work with the heat, don't make me burst through your meat

I kill alive for my twin, bust ill and do the time for my twin
Trust that it's real and he'll be at my side at the end
I got guns that'll silence your men
We bust off and let the begin, aight then

I kill alive for my twin, bust ill and do the time for my twin
Trust that it's real and he'll be at my side at the end
I got guns that'll silence your men
We bust off and let the begin, aight then

Yo, yo, Seis come off with a thunderous start
Punish niggas from the heart, rip a niga from the sparks
Of the glizze, leave a nigga clapped on 'Rap City'
I'm strapped with the Mac Milli, you wack as ass Gilly

It ain't hard to scrap, my squad's the vanguard of rap
Love to guard your back in the biz, the triz in the back
Flamboyant, never givin' a slack, I jam joints when I live on a track
Ran point when they gave me the Mac

I'm on fat, never lack the realness, I sing that B.J. killer ill shit
And still rock a nigga, I'm out to be real rich
You feel this, shaper than a tooth pain, double-deuce pain
My verse take aim, blow your fame with a burst of flames

Ain't nothin' changed, I die in this game
Take the stand and the blame for my man
I carry the name revenge
Terror Squad in begets carved on my chain

I kill alive for my twin, bust ill and do the time for my twin
Trust that it's real and he'll be at my side at the end
I got guns that'll silence your men
We bust off and let the begin, aight then

I kill alive for my twin, bust ill and do the time for my twin
Trust that it's real and he'll be at my side at the end
I got guns that'll silence your men
We bust off and let the begin, aight then

Yeah, Terror Squad, Triple Seis, baby
Up and comin', son, I'm comin' for all that shit, son
The crown and all that knawmean? I rep N.Y.
The Boogie Down, baby, L.V., R.C., Rezz Crew
MC, Terror Squad, baby, this is how we do
1 9 9 9, baby, Triple Seis backwards, feel it

We gon' ride nigga, ride nigga, ride nigga
You gon' die nigga, die nigga, die nigga
We gon' ride nigga, ride nigga, ride nigga
You gon' die nigga, die nigga, die nigga

L be servin niggas like Mr. Belvadere
I twist an L, sip a beer here and there
Drink some liquor then pick a stripper that I can rip and tear, yeah
Come hear the sounds of a rookie fromt he boogie down
Used to be a shorty but guess who's givin nukkies now
So clown if you got the heart
Start some bullshit, it's your bid
A bullet through your skull from my full clip
I pull triggas givin niggas hell, like I'm sittin, 
Fake a move, punk, and i'll run you over like Walter Payton
Makin hits, my cliques, makin moola
Like Don Shula, nothin's coola
Than puffin on a phat blunt from see you-ba

I smoke more blunts than a little bit,
What are you an idiot?
The more I smoke, 
The smaller my phillie get
I smoke more blunts than a little bit,
What are you an idiot?
Wake up in the mornin, got me yearnin for herb!

Start the buddah session,
True confessions, spark the see you' up,

Even in a suit n tie,
Cruisin though the 5 boroughs wit live thorough,
Niggas that like to smoke they Hydro in front of 5-0,
Yo Manolo shoot that piece of chit, Chichi get the yayo,
While I pay Frank a visit, but the bisquit to his cuello,
Ey yo, this fuckin blunt's got me buggin,
I be thuggin it out, like Noreaga playin,
You ain't sayin nothing, bustin rappers like adreneline,
Puttin venom in'em,
Put'em on stage, for minimum wage, to graves is where i send'em
Hem'em up like a party dress
Terror Squad is as hard as it gets
Rippin your heart out your chest
Spark the cess, chickenheads stressin the sex
want to jump up in the Lex, twin, when they see me wit the best
Twisted up the dutch, a little Tony's Touch
Let'em work the clutch while i lite the bliz up
On a highway wit this big fucka
Gettin high like Chris Tucker on Friday, hit it my way
Like Frank Sinatra, lite up at the opera
When the cops come show the prescription from the docta
I puff cause I got ta'
This stuff from the rasta's
Get enough love in the Bronx, from Italians wit all the pasta
John Blazin, keep the tree's blazin

Yeah, check me out 
""Remember Pun?""
Terror Squad 

I'll battle ya all, from the charts to ghetto stars
Face Triple Seis the God of War like Mars
That leave MC's smashed but my Squad, is odd
Y'all never seen relish, but always seem jealous
Of my extreme fellas, rockin' the ? sweaters
The ones who paid with they life
I rock for forty days and forty nights, and every verse is tight
Better than before; rough, rugged, and raw
Chainsaw metaphor that leave your brain sore
This ain't a game, I'll leave you maimed
Allow me to explain I thrive on the pain while robbin' your chain
Knahmean? Do him and the fiend, grab his wallet
Leave a trail-blazin like (Rasheed Wallace)
What's today's knowledge? Hold your heat like The Peacemaker
I walk the same streets the police take us
Livin' on the corner so won't speak it out my mouth
Respect and got the money son that's all that it's about
No doubt, silence of code, violence of mode
Under control, can tell my real niggas really roll
On the low tryin' to blow trees
And for no reas', we hit a nigga up for mo' cheese
Better relate and start to think, or be the missin' link
I got my Hustle on like Larry Flynt

We brave in the heart, playin' a part, amazingly smart
Razor sharp, futuristic raps, state of the art
Takin' New York cats past the stars
First it was Nasty Nas now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low, business never personal
Just some words to know, if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him now they inject us with juice to fry 'em
Depends on the state if death is my fate then cool I'm dyin'
If that's my destiny it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker that bent me right next to me
Aight crew? (No doubt Pun!) Aight then, let's fight then
I'm hypened, comin' with the thunder and the lightning
Invitin' the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, snipin' your moms, right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm it's the ghetto God
I rip a nigga heart out his frame while I scream TERROR SQUAD
Be larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she'd starve on a diet instead I'm a God in her eyes
The father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzlin' beer bottles by the dozen with Devin that's mi hermano

You ain't understand how I push your wig back quick
A little quiet nigga wouldn't think I did that shit
I'm from where the guns love to introduce thyself
Reduce your health, little bulletproofs get felt
Who mind ready, for this big dog who hold a nine steady
I'm John Blazin' when you see the arms razin'
Shit crime heavy already, I keep it sharper than the long 'chette
Far from a snitch nigga who call Teddy
I click triggers how you more ready and switch bigger
Than more berry I'm a cherry you a strawberry
If you lost that mean I'm on top of the whip
You plottin' to flip, fuck around and get shot in the lip
You stop with the quick and never make another move
Even your mother lose, I hurt up your pops to pay your brother dues

""Forever do you understand? FOREVER!""

Make way for krill, I don't play I spray for real
Blow your top with the glock, that's my favorite kill
Blaze your crib with like thirty shots
I'm already hot, but my last one is with some dirty cops
I play the streets with toast 'cause the thieves is close
Wanna keep your post then don't beef with Joe
Still niggas think I won't bring the heat out
That's like sayin' Puff ain't never beat up Steve Stoute
Truth first, Terror Squad, shoot first
War with me and you guaranteed to leave the earth
I'm, dressed to kill, my niggas rep for real
Joe Crack's back like I never had a deal
Hungry and shit, it don't get more lovely than this
Blow a hole through your ribs just for runnin' your lips
The street's a trip; either you deep or you sleep with the fish

Always carry two knives with me

Eat at the spot like Pac you could believe it or not

Hammer quipped we die for the strips defy the law
We the squad that do the job and beat the charge
A gold T with a old key will beat the job 
You never know when you're 'bout to go 
You never know when you're 'bout to blow

On my pops we gonna pop the Mo
Pop the krizic cock is clicked

Sippin on six murder minutes, the sauce I give blood
from the cup to the coffin lid grill 
Silence for singin some many six songs 
of a place they call heaven now skids or broke hell
Christian or rune, my Lithonia despite ghetto
suspension suspect a sent or no souls 
Sinister sins I decided distract on a ancient crucial
past like Krueger's is gross
Satanic in scent were wrote on the scent 
it's so sacred created by Lucifer slaves
Silent, secluded in secret somewhere in the swamp 
in the land of protest a man-day
Infinite six, eternal the six
forever the six I sits outta da flames
Sick minded soldiers wit suffering
singing and searching to stable severe for some pain 
Scarecrow was me, I was sent from the ceiling 
crossed over the thorn on my venomous tips
Such in the same antisocial by there is no sun 
daily as the right wipe on my lips
Indulge yourself with the posters 
and noisy money and drugs interior golds
I tell you how is your profit
demand if it gets the whole world da new dinners and clothes

Yo peep this, my niggas be packin' artillery making yo ass whine
I'm packin' this bomb ass car that's robbin yo ass blind all the time  
You think I love you, never nigga I'm out to get my cheese
Like Roger Rabbit, who framed the nigga that guy left on his knees?
Smokin' out, 'cause I need to get high before I go on my mission
My profit soldiers call me all about this thing called pimpin'
So listen nigga before you think you got a convict (bitch)
You got a steaming matter lil' boy that want the lifestyle of rich

Making some faces I made a scene, no one around to see how green

In some silly way life begins to change

Lift up my fork and celebrate ease


Liquid enough, liquid it seems

Walking on pillows I learn how to sleep

Somehow I feel what flies seem to breathe
Run away, run away dream

Time will let you in

And if you want you can have a secret

Time will let you through

Come on out

You've gotta see it

Time to let you in

And if you want you can ride with me


If the wind is right the wind is free
I knew it then


I knew it well
Like a pilot diving down wishing well,


I know it's better when the weather changes your hair
Fifteen paces a mile an hour, it's gotta feel good

Sucking a slurpee for ultimate power, it's gotta feel good

Fighting, you're back when you feel like a coward

It's gotta feel good

And everything's moving at the ultimate speed

I hear a lonesome dove off in the distance
His cry echoes out through the hills
He's sad that his lover flew off with another
And I know the sorrow he feels

Lonesome dove we're not that different
You sing a sad song but you're not alone
You've been forever forsaken by the one that you love
I know how you feel lonesome dove

I've tried to run from the pain of his memory
But I can't find a place I can hide
And that old lonesome dove is gonna mourn for his love
No matter how far he flies

Watchin' the chickens peck the ground
There ain't a whole lot goin' on tonight
In this one horse town
Over yonder comin' up the road
In a beat up Chevy truck
Her boyfriend Tommy is laying on the horn
Splashing through the mud and the muck

Her daddy say's he ain't worth a lick

Parked in the very last row
They're to busy holding on to one another
To even care about the show
Later on outside the Tasty Freeze
Tommy slips something on her hand
He says my high school ring will have to do
'Till I can buy a wedding band

While me and junior have a talk
Momma breaks in says don't lose your temper
It wasn't very long ago
You yourself was just a hay seed plow boy
Who didn't have a row to how

Who can get me laughing when my whole world breaks in two

It took a little time

There were things you couldn't hear

There's no one quite as blind

Stars would shine on stormy nights
Flowers grew in winter time
Everything seemed possible
When we were in love

When forever was what other people lost
This lonesome valley was what other people crossed
No I couldn't taste the tears other people shed
When goodbye was a word other people said

Rivers flowed, a bridge would burn
The nights would end, the earth still turned
Yesterday was just a song to sing

Daddy told me when I was young
He said it's a long road you've begun
Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's hard
But as you walk the road remember who you are

You've gotta roll with the punches
You've gotta aim to hit the mark
You've gotta follow your hunches
And try to finish what you start
And when you come to the crossroads
And you're deciding in the dark
You've gotta listen to the whisper of your heart

He said make it a practice to be true
'Cause when push comes down to shove it's up to you
To keep believing in your dreams
And to sing your song if you've got a song to sing

The dirt was clay and was the color of the blood in me
A twelve acre farm on a ridge is southern Tennessee
We left that sweat all over that land behind a mule we watched grow old
Row after row trying to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't
Grow
There was one old store in the hollow we all called town
It belonged to a gentle old man named Henry Brown
He gave us credit in the wintertime so we could live through the cold when the
Wind brought snow
Trying to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow
The one I loved walked through those fields with me
She was a hard working woman true as one could be
But then one year death was going 'round and swiftly took it's toll
Janie had to go
Now she lies asleep under ground so poor that grass won't grow
As I stand here looking over this part of Tennessee
The fields are bare as far as the eye can see
And over the grave where Janie lies there's a beautiful sight to behold
And no one knows why there's flowers blooming on ground so poor that grass
Won't grow



",Where Grass Won't Grow,1994

Trisha Yearwood,"Somebody's waiting back home in Dallas
With no idea where she has gone
Got her suitcase all packed up
In the back of the pickup
Got her red knee-high luccheses on
She's on any old two-lane
West bound she knows
'Cause she was chasing her shadow
When the sun finally rose
Man, she's just running
It don't matter where
She figures she'll know where she is when she's there

But she didn't leave nothin' she can't do without
That's enough reason for leavin' no doubt
She rolls down the window, turns up a song
Laughs at the weather and says, hello, I'm gone

She broke down in Lubbock
Got it stuck in reverse
So she hitched down the highway
Her little gun in her purse
Got to the station
Stared at the phone
Found herself thinkin' about calling for home

And she didn't leave nothin' she can't do without
That's enough reason for leavin' no doubt
She dropped in a quarter made herself strong
All that she told him was, ""Hello, I'm gone""

Then she called up a tow truck
Said, ""Fix up what's wrong
I'm paying in cash boys
Hello, I'm gone""","Hello, I'm Gone",1996

You still wouldn't hear a word I say

Or are you really too blind to see
This neglecting me, baby it's affecting me

I need that boy
The one that chose me over every other choice
And I need that man
Whose heart and soul were in this thing when it began
I need that old friend that I once knew
Baby I need you

Do you remember how it used to be
How it felt when you were holding me
That Chevrolet was like our little get away
All the dreams we used to talk about
Are all the things that we're livin' now
But without the love, baby it just ain't enough

Or shine a light in shadow when the batteries are dead
Or fly like a bird over all the works of man

Nothing seems as easy as it did when you were young
Myths may be invincible, but we are only strong
Strong like a memory, strong like a willow in the wind
Strong as you'll ever be, you will always need to bend

And if you feel the weight of the world
Put your mind at ease
Little Hercules

There are times when being a grown-up gets to be too much
And your sense of humor seems to vanish in the crush
Of the daily 9 to 9 that keeps your family alive
You're just putting in your time
Does anyone really go home at 5?

You've made a life where no one ever tells you what to do
Now the only tyrant that you're working for is you
It's never easy to keep all the promises you make
But no one's gonna get you fired
If you'd just give yourself a brake

And if you feel the weight of the world
Put your mind at ease

And I looked in your window
Lately I ain't been feelin' right
And I don't know the cure, no
Still I can't keep from wonderin'
If I still figure in your life

Could you take me back and try me again
Could you try me again

I drove around in this lonesome town
Felt just like a beginner
Friends I saw, they just brought me down
They're so cynical and bitter
Well, I guess I'm just like them now
I never thought I'd turn out like that

Could you take me back and try me again
Could you try me again

Well you say that I cheated
I was not what you needed
Well you're not being kind
When you say you tried
And you know you lied
My hands are tied
Oh, try me again

They just don't seem at home now that he's gone

Where the tears fell from my eyes
I want to play out every memory
Every last goodbye
Till the whole world cries

So who does your past belong to today?

But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies
You look so careless when they're shooting that bull
Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full

Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room""
The girls say, ""God I hope he comes back soon""

Everybody's talking but you don't hear a thing
You're still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevard's empty, why don't you come around?
Baby, what is so great about sleeping downtown?

Splitting your dice to be someone you're not
You say you're looking for something you might've forgot
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone

Took my money in a game of pool.

You feel like you don't belong
So not like the rest of them, someday, the best of them
Will realize they were wrong""

But in my world, different meant lonely
The last place I wanted to be

Was standing out in a crowd
Where the spotlight finds you and singles you out
What are they whisperin' about?
You're thinkin' up ways to take up less space
Can't see the grace in it, standin' out in a crowd
(Standing out)

Too short, too tall, flower against the wall
The last one chosen to play
Too smart, too dumb, too strange a place to be from
Same shoes every day

With all these ways to be different

By standing out in the crowd
Where the spotlight finds you and singles you out
What are they whisperin' about?
You're thinkin' up ways to take up less space
Instead of embracing it, standin' out in a crowd

Trisha Yearwood,"I was standing at the counter
I was waiting for the change
When I heard that old familiar music start
It was like a lighted match had been tossed into my soul
It was like a dam had broken in my heart
After taking every detour
Gettin' lost and losin track
So that even if I wanted I could not find my way back
After driving out the memory
Of the way things might have been
After I'd forgotten all about us
The song remembers when

We were rolling through the Rocky's
We were up above the clouds
When a station out of Jackson played that song
And it seemed to fit the moment
And the moment seemed to freeze
When we turned the music up and sang along
And there was a God in Heaven
And the world made perfect sense
We were young and were in love

And we were easy to convince
We were headed straight for Eden
It was just around the bend
And though I have forgotten all about it
The song remembers when

I guess something must have happened
And we must have said goodbye
And my heart must have been broken
Though I can't recall just why
The song remembers when

Well, for all the miles between us
And for all the time that's past
You would think I haven't gotten very far
And I hope my hasty heart
Will forgive me just this once
If I stop to wonder how on earth you are

But that's just a lot of water
Underneath a bridge I burned
And there's no use in backtracing
Around corners I have turned
Still I guess some things we bury
Are just bound to rise again
Yeah, and even if the whole world has forgotten

I wish I knew how to break the spell (Your eyes are like starlight now)

I ought to say no, no, no sir (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)
I really can't stay (Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside 

I simply must go (Baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (baby, it's cold outside)
This welcome has been so nice and warm (How lucky that you dropped in)
(Look out that window at that storm)

My sister will be suspicious (Gosh, your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh, your lips are delicious)
Oh, maybe just a kiss more (Never such a blizzard before)

I've got to get home (Baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand but don't you see (I'm thrilled when you touch my hand)
(How can you do this thing to me?)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay (Can't get over that hold out)

This is so good
There's no need for change
It's alright with me
It's as simple as it should be

And this love will build 
Through flights and streets
In the end I predict
You'll get the very best of me

And I'd float myself out of here
And I'd go wherever you are
And I'd never have to be too far from here
And I'd linger in your fingers
A transparent shade of gray
And watch as you watch me
Slowly fade away
Into the night
Where are you when I need you by my side

Shouldn't it be that easy
To just be happy for awhile
Get lost in a moment
Wasting time trading smiles
Shouldn't it be that easy
To just be happy for awhile
Come on won't you waste my time
Baby waste my time
Won't you waste all my time

Things are never what they seem
Lately you're all I dream
Well I'm running but I'm not getting anywhere and
Do you even care?

Come on won't you waste my time

Won't you waste all my time
C'mon and waste all my time

I'm just trying to find my way
Between the glitter and the gray
Baby I just want some time with you
And ohh I swear this time I'll make it through well well

Cause you'll be here by 6:30
And we'll go looking for a close parking spot again

Sitting in a room full of believers
Now you tell me what's wrong and what's right
Cause I look over at you baby
You got your good intentions focused so tight

And now it hurts me so,
To have to see you go
To watch these drugs pull you down
When the world can't get through
And there's nothing we can do
Except watch you fall in and out of this mess

What's wrong with a little bit of experimentation
To open the eyes of a new generation
Build your world on a cocaine foundation
And watch it all blow away

And it hurts me so,
To have to see you go
To watch these drugs pull you down
When there's nothing we can do
And no one to get through
Watch you fall deeper into this mess

Well I haven't seen you in a while
You know, I miss our talks 
I miss your smile
This look of innocence is priceless
But right now you look so lifeless

And now it hurts me so,
To have to see you go

And I'm the one you wish you were kissing
Pray for clear skies tonight
You better start wishin

We can read a story 
Of a love gone disaster
You write the moral
And I'll write the lesson
And we can read of love 
That kept us, guessing

Cause I am in question
You are in reason
Soon this will change
Just like the seasons
My leaves will fall
While you'll turn to cold
And the colors on the ground 
Are so bright and so bold
And I'll make no motion 
You'll hold me tightly
I'll look at you
As you let me down lightly
The story always ends up like this
Another opportunity
That you're going to miss

So you write the title
And I'll write the chapters
We can read a story of a love gone disaster
You write the moral
And I'll write the lesson

That this Isn't working out
I can tell by the look in your eyes,

I remember when I first saw you,
Remember the way I felt
And now your breaking me to pieces,
I don't know how I'll deal with this

but If I...
Learned anything at all
It was to always be true to yourself and
I know that this isn't the end of it all
And I will fall...

Have you ever watched the shadows,
Fly across the midnight sky
You know I used to watch the sunset,
But it seems that I haven't got the time anymore

but if I....
Learned anything at all it was too
Always be true to yourself and I
Know that this is what I can do and
I'm gonna' try...

been thinking for days,
Been sleepless for nights
But it all came to me,
Driving home crying my eyes out

And now your making me promises that I can't hold you 2

because one kiss, wasn't enough
To keep me here and patiently waiting
For you to decide who you want and when you want them|
While you leave me in the sun evaporating...

And now your stressing me out, ohh your stressing me out
Because I, I spent so much time trying to figure out what your all about
But it's all been said and its all done now
I'll find away to get you, I'll get to you somehow

ohh because...

one kiss wasn't enough, to keep me here and patiently waiting for
You to decide that I'm the one you wanted
Well you left me for too long outside
And I'm evaporated...

So baby, baby I'm craving your kiss on my lips
You know I, I can't resist it when you put your hands on my hips
He says I want a girl to sweep me off my feet
Well I guess, all this time, my voice was just a little too weak....

because...

one kiss wasn't enough to keep me here and patiently waiting for
You to decide that I'm the one you needed
Well you waited to long
I'm evaporated....

so tell me that one kiss wasn't enough...cause by now, by now I'm givin' up...

Where do I begin?

He's says that girls lie
But I got news for him, cause boys lie too
And I'm through with all your games
And all your excuses, down to everything you say and do

Cause I've seen things from a different view
And I realize all the things I already knew
Your not for me
You know I don't think that you've ever been good for me

Ya know, there's got to be someone out there who's real
There's got be someone who can honestly say they feel
This music underneath my fingertips
She says, ""get a grip girl, cause guys like that don't exist""

well I just wanna laugh my way through life
And no worry about whether they think what I'm doing is wrong or right
Cause I've got so much to learn
And you know this fires just dying to burn...

I think its time to leave....
Can I have the guest check please?
I'm saying good-bye, to all the comfortable things
I'm going out living my life, gonna see what a little livin' will bring

",Guest Check,2006
Tristan Prettyman,"Well I can
See you on the horizon like a
Storm that's soon to be and is it
So bad to be in love with a memory
Of you, smiling back at me
And it was subtle but it was, yeah it was subtle
But it was sexy

And I suppose I could tell you how I feel
But even I don't know if it's really real
And baby baby one day I will show you so you can see
Oh well, the secret's behind the mystery
But see baby its like thisâ?¦

I think I kinda just want your kiss
Just for the thrill and just maybe to miss
You won't when you're going, just so I know
That It can and it does get better than this,
'cause you know love is just a hit and miss
Well you're wrong and you jump and you sink and
It happens more than you'd thinkâ?¦

And I suppose I could tell you how I feel
But see I'd rather play it cool and keep it real
And maybe I could show you just so you could see â?¦
The secret behind the mysteryâ?¦

And it's, its just one of those days
When you'd wish it rain already
And the sky's no ordinary shade of gray

But you make it ok...

Oh maybe you should know that I do have a crush on you
'cause I see your trap and I fell right through
With me its always something new

To see..

And I suppose I could tell you how I feel
But that moment was magic, it was so surreal
Oh well I swear one day I will let you know
That I do, oh I do love you so...

Soft, sweet and shallow

As your pillow
To rest your tired head

So don't look back again...

when you go...away
You know, your already so far away
But I want you to know
My love it here to stay
So don't let me get in your way
No not today...

I can hear the rain in the wind
It hits me like you hit me within
And words are not needed now
Cause you know me so well
And that's how I can tell

I can tell
I can tell
I can tell

so go go go go

don't let me get in your way




",My Love,2006
Tristan Prettyman,"I am a void
Lets see you try and fill me
And mostly I'm just annoyed
With the situation that never fails to find me

well I shoulda known better and I did
I should have listened but ohh well
And now the memories are but the lines on my palms of my hands
Can you tell me this much? oh do tell...

tell me was she better?
Was she everything and more?
Cause I'm still leaning out the window on the 14th story floor
Begging for more...always more...

I remember the conversations
Pressed up against that Canadian night sky
Like l could lean out my window
And recall what it feels like to be that high

tell me me was she better?
Was she everything and more?
God I hope she pleased you
Was she everything you hoped for?

tell me was it all there, all this time
Did it pick up, did it pick up, did it pick up...

and take flight?




",Void,2006

Maybe I'm so impatient
Maybe I just don't care, about what you think

cause I can never please her
No matter how hard I try
You know sometimes I just wanna throw up my hands and say
""ok fine""!

But life's to short she said
If it works then it works, let it go
And I'm sorry I ever got you started
When it rains, it pours and it shows

I was blessed with a birth and a death
And a gift or a curse somewhere in between
Cause your only as loud as the noises you make
And as big as the things that you dream

still I can never please him
No matter how hard I try
And maybe you should have made up your mind
Before I changed mine

but life's to short she said,
If it works then it works, let it go
And I'm sorry I ever got you started
When it rains it pours and it shows

still life's to short she said
If it works, then it works, just let it go, let it go

I'm more surprised that I won't answer
Pick up the phone to call you back
Pick up the phone to call you back
Ain't it funny how things work out like that

Cause the time that it takes to open my eyes
Is the time that it took me to realize

[Chorus 1]
Madly madly madly
Well tell me that you need me
Show me I'm the only
And that's all I need to know

[Chorus 2]
Madly madly madly
Well if you really love me
When you see me leaving baby just let me go

Well I've been good no I've been great
You say you're in a better place
And honestly I'm happy for ya
But there's a tone in my voice that gives away my selfish choice
Can my heart beat any faster?

Cause the time that it takes to pass me by
Is the time that it took me to realize

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

We give it up, try to find what was with us all the time
Gotta lose some things if you're ever gonna get on by
And who was wrong? Who was right?
Always end up in a fight, and I thought I'd crumble no I'm fine

When you should stay, when you should go
But you don't
Rehearse the lines in your head
You know what needs to be said
But it all comes out bad
And if it's space that you need
If time is falling at your feet
Walking away empty
Love is a crazy dream

Is it what you want
Is it what you need
We go back and forth
Making war out of peace
And you won't let go
And I won't give up
We go round and round
But is it ever enough
Is it ever enough

Lately I'm falling away
Growing more quiet by the day
Not really sure
Why I feel this way
I guess I got a little scared
Someone could actually care
This time, just might be something there
And if it's change that you need
A little more mystery
Some kind of deeper meaning
Love is a crazy dream

[Chorus]

I'm sure I'll mess it all up
I'm sure I'll try to convince myself
That I just need to be
But what I want to be is
Something else, someone else

So why did we cross the line
Mess it all up with the time
And in the end just assume it'll be alright

Is it what you want
Is it what you need
We go back and forth
Making war out of peace
And you won't let go
And I won't give up

Is it what you want
Is it what you need

That I don't know how much you mean it

Hanging around here anymore

Nothing in the whole wide world could ever stop me
If you got love, got love to give
Oh just keep giving it up and someone will let you in
And just, so you know

Just so I can read it
The best thing that ever happened to you
You know I wanna be it
I can't recall if I ever had a love I truly missed
And if I did, it wasn't no love compared to this

Time to spread my wings and fly
Higher than the blue sky
Never did me any good

Only so much that my heart can take

Wishing for all we could-have-been

Just so you know just so you know
I never thought you'd let me go
I don’t even know the truth
Yeah we were fine, yeah we were fine
Then all at once you changed your mind
And I was gonna marry you

I gotta stay
As far away as I can get
'Cause a part of me hasn’t left
If I get too close you're gonna pull me back in to
Thinking everything you said was true
But the ring around my finger proved
That I was your girl
But in the end it wasn’t what you wanted

Just so you know just so you know
I never thought you'd let me go

Take all the words you’ve spoken
And the promises you’ve broken
And throw them all into the ocean
Just to let it be
And late at night
When you're lying in your bed alone
Wishing you were still at home

Tristan Prettyman,"Wish I would've listened to myself
You would've thought I'd known better
Shouldn't trust my heart this time
But the mind, it changes like the weather
The scars will fade away, and I may never be the same
But you can't start a fire in the pouring rain
Never say never

Now I hear you're back to your old self
And I still can't imagine
Why you take something good, like love, like us
And pretend it never happened
Cause you'll look back one day
And you'll wish we still had that flame
But you can't start a fire in the pouring rain
Never say never

You said you would never let me go
You promised me, our love written on the wall
Felt so easy but I should've known better
To never say never

Gotta be careful what you give
You never know just what you get
Who knows, maybe the best hasn't happened yet
Some days I still feel the same
And my love, it still remains

Nothing really lasts forever

I may never understand why you left
I guess I just have to accept this is the way it was meant to be
Kind of like how I never understood how the ocean just stops at the shore
And why it doesn't wash away the land
If only someone could hold my heart and my hand
And make it feel like you did, and not give up so easy
There's no need to be angry, it's okay to be sad
I just have to trust there's something better for me out there 
Swirling around in the universe
Someone who will believe in themselves as much as I do
And never take a wish for granted and always count the stars
Looking back, you're always closer than you thought
There's no point now in starting something new

by her raveneyes
by her beauty and a scarlet sunrise
May thy river bury her silvertears
A fallen angel... enshrined in moonlit seas

Leaving vitality
so serene breeds my darkness
Entreating winterwinds
though I leave... I embrace thee

Winternight
conceal thy precious angellore
I secrete my soul
under thy wings of sorrow
Dark I embrace thy eyes
wander lost on life's narrow path
I reveal my heart
to this beauty dressed in dark

Grieving raveneyes
falls asleep with the sunrise
Delightful midsummer breeze
though I leave... I await thee

Grant me thy last midsummer breeze
May thou ascend from endless sleep
... my desire
Dance me above thy moonlit seas
Glance yearningly into the deep
a cold and weary night

Widwinternight
Descending me like flakes of snow

Tristania,"I mourn thee by dusk 
I mourn thee by dawn 
Crave for thy gloss 
To seek the silent glades beyond 
Precious a glance 
Thy veils now unfold 
Tearful she dance 
Into this nightfall I behold 
Grieve at night 
Thy bereavement and thy loss in life 
Grieve by day 
Thy devotion and thy pass away 
Beyond the veils of dawn 
From where she Siren calls 
The sunset seize within as I walk 
Through velvet dusk and dawn 
Condemned to rise and fall 
So grievous through the night she calls 
The beauty I once lost 
I mourn thee my beloved 
Far beneath thy heavens lost 
Where I once pale and cold 
Beheld thy rarest rose",Wasteland's Caress,1998
Tristania,"Through scornful declarence and lumnious eyes 
The shadows enveil with the glorious night 
Trespassing the sunset like thou hast before 
Entreating the daylight to rage nevermore 
Angina striking Elysium 
A frail remembrance glorificates 
The nightside-ascendance 
Veiled underneath thy funereal skies 
The winds they may haunt me in bloodredest skies 
The moon may bewed the strangest of light

The sweeping of daylight...my vigour's decline

Tristania,"Yearning for days of yore 
In Elysian daydreams 
Burn with a fatal gloss 
A confounding mirror of souls 

Dance with the winter winds 
In thy visions so sanguine 
Glance upon Stygian streams 
Where lies hidden a pale secrecy 

Hark 
Lures of the siren 
Yearn for the days 
When blithe thou was 
Sworn to a secrecy 
An arcanum devotee 
Mourning a life with thee 
A descendance of watery Argentine 
Trance of thy frailty 
Endure the exsanguine

On a vast and frail crusade 
Invigoration of pain pervation 
This time 
Aphelion 

In decadence I take thee by the hand 
Too frail, to gain the promised land 
Too frail, to take your pain away 
Too frail, a sequel of decay 

May milleniums gather 
On the mirage of desolated souls 
Far between departure and sorrow 
I breed my afterthought 

In thy hours 
Of vast dejection's haunt, wane 
An angel strays upon my door 
So frail and lost within

Her stain and tears upon my floor

A fragile sanctuary",Aphelion,1999
Tristania,"Not fear, nor tears can reach me now
The light seems so clear as the night fades away
Behold of thy flame, below of all shame
Come conquer me sweet dreams of paradise

Dusk drawn hither to my evening star
A glance in thy mirror
The trance of thy mirror
Venus... through the looking glass

Dance so frail and lost in the fields afar
Cast off thy mourning
Clasp life and glory
Venus... through the looking glass

The sense of angels in veils of dawn
Like she runs forever among thy halls
The pale horizons are closing down
The reasons for living are lost somehow

Cross my heart with a glance upon the star of riddance
Drift afar like teardrops on the Stygian River

I'm the nightfall and wizard that summon thee
You're the blizzard that drape my eyes
I'm thy sorrow and vein of obscurity

Tristania,"Tied up and gagged
Hooded and tagged
They're all yours to command

I am corpse, I am carrion prey
I have a crow at each brow
Plucking eyes in my mask of death
The darkness is complete

Who's the hooded one, mother mine?
Who is gagged when all are silent?
And bitten when we move

Inflamed! My mask is burning
The night is dead; dark, putrid flesh turning
Upon a chair in the dying corner
I am your bagful of fear

I'll commit, I'll admit
I'll be the dagger, drive me in
I'll be all motionless and still
My river runs within - still and deep

I am beast, I am carrion prey to the Cyclops tribe
String me up to a cherry tree
Come one, come all - and hang with me
I'm already hogtied - entangled in your marionette strings

A ruckus for the righteous

I whisper sordid secrets that are neither true nor false

All I'll be your lovin' man

You're got to feel it
Deep inside girl

You got to take it
When it comes

You'll never know
Until you're tried girl
Please don't stop
What's just begun

I've got a burning in my body
Baby I'm on fire
I ain't asking
Nothing naughty
But won't you get me higher



",Be My Lover,1976
Triumph,"I know there's a time
For living
I'm aware of that
We all must die
But why must my young life
End so soon
Such a shame
To weep and cry
In the night
Someone is calling
And in my mind
A picture remains
People say
I've gone half crazy
People say that I'm insane

Don't take my life
Away from me
Don't take my life,
Set me free
A fire is burning
And time is driftin' away

They say that I killed
My dear brother
This terrible crime I didn't do
Even my own momma said
Baby what's come over you
People judge and peer
Down at me

As tears stream
Down my face
I can't find a reason
Or any rhyme
I think there must be
Some mistake

As only I stand witness
To my plea
People shake their heads
And pity me
Sentencing has dealt
The final blow
To live my life
Remaining on death row




",Don't Take My Life,1976
Triumph,"Life goes by
And things get slower

Everyday I get a little lower
Need some time to get my moving
I need a woman
To give me some soothin'

Easy life, easy times
Got no reason, got no rhyme
Easy life, slip through my hand
Easy life, easy times

I've been up and down
Three times now
Got to find a place to hide now
Easy life slipped
Through my hands
Easy women
And rock and roll bands

Easy life, easy times
Got no money or got no lines

Lookin' for a better way
Got to cash in on the dues
That I pay
Had a woman
I didn't understand
I showed her where it's at
With the back of my hand




",Easy Life,1976
Triumph,"
Come on pretty baby
Put your party dress on
Come on won't you rock-it
With me all night long
Can't we lovey-dovey like the
Way we used to do before
That's what I like

CHORUS:
Let me take you home tonite
Everything will be alright
Baby, let me get next to you

Don't you try and tell me girl
That I'm not your style,
Come on get to know me
For a little while
Can't we lovey-dovey like the
Way we used to do before
That's what I like

CHORUS

The way you shake and shimmy
Girl you drive me wild
When you touch me girl
You set my soul on fire
Can't we lovey-dovey like the
Way we used to do before
That's what I like

Use it like a knife
We've all learned to trust in profit and value

Profit over life
I have watched the skyline grow in
Defiance of the sun

I have learned the language
Of the lost that walk the streets
And I'm the city's minstrel

I can recall when ambitions were small
And the music filled the air
But the minstrel's crying 'cause the music's dying

And the city's everywhere
It's everywhere
Now there's no more singing
Just a ringing in my ears

And the city's story in all it's power
Is the greatest of my fears

It's just a game, don't let yourself slip away

It's just a game, and all I can do is play

What you do choose, now, what do you believe, now
Who are you gonna trust?
All you dreams and fancy schemes
Just crumble into dust


Calm and cool and computerized to calculate and collect
We wait and watch and wonder
Just which puppet they'll select

Like the moth, too near the flame,
Who learned his truth too late
We're all too deep into the game
That is the master of our fate

How can we make amends
All alone I watch the candle burn
Burning at both ends
Nothin's ever gonna change
Can tears wash away this pain

Tears in the rain
Here it comes again
I'll never know the reason why
I cry these tears in the rain (rain)

The time has come to make a stand
We've waited much too long
Nobody's gonna lead us by the hand
How could we be so wrong
We lost the chance to the play this game
Can tears wash away this pain

Tears in the rain
Here it comes again
I'll never know the reason why
I cry these tears in the rain

So many times, I've wondered why
We still play this game

Tears in the rain
Here it comes again
I'll never know the reason why
I cry these tears in the rain

Tears in the rain
Here it comes again
Oh, I'll never know the reason why
I cry these tears in the rain

Rain, tears in the rain

Cryin' now
Cryin' tears in the rain

Having you devitalized to prior of innocence
For too long you've gotten away with murder
A fitting justice would be your painful execution

If only I could afflict you
Hurt you in the same way that you hurt
I just want to exact reprisal
Retribution calls

The only way I depict you
Is that your attentions undeserved
Meet the vessel of your reprisal
Retribution calls

Its not that I take life for granted
Its only that the good wont make it

Choking on the feelings rushing out,
I'm choking feelings rushing out.

Let me fall from grace

Dejar un día esta ciudad
Cruzar el mar en tu compañía

Y probablemente me habrás olvidado
No sé que aventuras correré sin ti

En un viejo Cadillac segunda mano
Junto al Marbellí
A mis pies mi ciudad
Y hare un momento que me ha dejado
Aquí en la ladera del Tibidabo
La última rubia con quien iba a probar
El asiento de atrás
Quizás el Martini me ha hecho recordar
Nena, porqué no volviste a llamar
Creí que podía olvidarte sin más
Y aún a ratos ya ves
Y al irse la rubia me he sentido extraño
Me he quedado solo fumando un cigarro
Me ha sentenciado, nostalgia de ti
Y desde esta curva donde estoy parado
Me he sorprendido mirando a tu barrio
Me han atrapado luces de ciudad
El amanecer me sorprenderá
Dormido, borracho, en el Cadillac
Bajo las palmeras, dulce Y solitario

And someone way down here loses someone dear.

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.

Spectators of the show always staying low.

A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

I feel a storm coming.

When autumn first arrived you were my lady.
And love was written in the wind to show
And with the change of months there came October.
And now I wonder where our love did go.
It was the second rain of autumn we shared our feelings.
It was such, such a glorious autumn dream, yes it was.
But like kids we were too shy to say to each other that together, we would always like to be.

Someday soon I know we'll come together.
Even though our feelings change as seasons do.
But, maybe sweet November will tell us the story that will bring us back the love that we both knew.

Troop,"[Verse One]
Even when we not on tour I'm sleeping on the floor
Always on the road, on the couch, or with some girl I don't know
Hear myself say - I gotta go, I gotta leave, we gotta roll
a restless soul, mom I love you, promise I'll give you a call
once we checked out, sound checked, checked in the hotel room
Yeah, I know you want that same kind of perfume
off course I'll get it, get my brother on the phone
Tell grandma I'll help her with that garden stuff as soon as I'm home
We'll sit down and talk when I'm in Västerås
I don't know when, but once I'll get, I'll send you my schedule for shows
I'll call the booking right away, I'm going down to Jay in Malmoe
meet up with the guys in Gothenburg, work on the album
They say, home is where you're heart at, don't know where to start at
got loved ones all over, cross oceans and borders
I mean I love to travel, hate to fly, I want to go, but hate goodbyes
plus it's getting worse - Looptroop is on the rise
At times you'd like to press pause, no more ciaos and adios
but I'll be back in bit, now I'm out, business calls

[Chorus]
I gotta fly away. Gotta catch the train. We gotta catch the plane
but I really can't complain. We gotta fly away. Pack my bags today
We gotta ride the wave. See you in a couple of days

[Verse Two]
I'm sorry for all I'm sorrys that came too late
I'm sorry for the times that I went away
but yo, I'm still here cus my love came to stay
Remember that even though the weather is grey today
I know we had some situations and I hate to say
that I don't know the answers and how to erase the pain
Close your eyes for the things that led us astray
Then open them up towards a straighter way
All I ever wanted was to hear you say my name
Capture this second we'll forever stay the same
I take the blame for all my great escapes
there's a high price to pay for travellin´ state to state
I'm gone right now but you won't wait in vain
I'll be back before you know it to put the aches on layaway
Don't be afraid I know we'll remain ok
till I'll be back keep in touch through the radio waves

[Chorus]
Sometimes I fly away, but don't cry babe, cus you know I love you girl and
you know that you're my world. It's just you and me, that's the way we
supposed to be

[Verse Three]
You flew away like you were scared that I would clip your wings
after five years we haven't kicked it since
but straight up this ain't no pimpin' thing:
You a true queen baby only fit for kings
Maybe I couldn't see in the midst of things
now in my chain of life you're the missin' link
Just to hear your voice used to lift my chin
and I still feel the taste from when I kissed your skin
I'm looking at your picture wishing we'd click again
next time I make sure to get our shit in synch
next time I be your man through the thick and thin
I promise no more committing wicked sins
I buy you a house with a picket fence
get you everything you could give me twins
No bullshit on tour never hittin' skins
chasin' no groupies with chicken wings
Not the type to chain you between bed and kitchen sink
I merely praise the place where your lips begin
Your hips begin - I know you're quick to think:
It's pathetic, but I'd be the richest prince
if you once more unzip and let me sip your drink
Addicted to your love worse than nicotine
But there's too much pain for me to dig within
so I'm a let the music massage my crippled limbs..

[Chorus + Outro]
and just fly away, into my hideaway
sometimes I lie awake and cry the night away
why you had to fly away?
Now you miles away
You took my smile away
why couldn't you have stayed?",Fly Away,1998
Troop,"[Verse 1]

I never had a love that made me feel this way

And I pray your love will never go away (ya, ya)

You bring a joy to life that I have never known (um hmm)

And I want you to know that you're the only one, the only one that I adore

[Chorus]

And if I could give you the world you know I would give it to you

Cause you make me feel like I can fly over the moon

And I would lay down my life for you if you wanted me to (if you wanted me to)

Cause you make me feel like I can do anything, even fly over the moon

[Verse 2]

I wish I had the words to express just what I feel

Cause if I did I tell you something special to you, my dear

I'd walk a thousand miles or more to be where ever you are (where ever you are)

Cause without you in my life, I don't think that I can survive, no baby

[Chorus]

[Hook]

Baby, yea

When you smile I see the sun shining (sun shining)

Make the stars come out in my life again (in my life again)

I feel so good, girl I wanna cry

I'm so glad you're in life baby (in my life baby)

And every time I look into your eyes

And there's really nobody to blame
When it feels like your ship is sinking
And you're too tired to play the game

Nobody's going to help you
You've just got to stand up alone
And dig in your heels
And see how it feels
To raise a little Hell of your own

Raise a little Hell, raise a little Hell, raise a little Hell
Raise a little Hell, raise a little Hell, raise a little Hell

What you got
Why don't you change it

Been played like a game on the wheel

Yours, for glad laugh, said tears,
Last night we talked,
And you didn't say much, I told you that I love you,
You said ""We'll keep in touch""

Trooper J.,"Yo
My crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless
Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J, and Mike Boogie
And I'mma set it like this

Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts

For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew

Seventeen candles on a birthday cake

Found my heart in Los Angeles

Burning down the highway out of here
My twenties slipping in my ears
I've been killing myself just to know how to feel
Laid out on my childhood bed
To the sound of, “Sam's Town” and my hands behind my head

Trouble,"Hardcore G shit, homie, I don't play around
Ain't shit sweet bout the peach this Atlanta, clown
Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs, though
Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub, ho
Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers
Welcome to Atlanta up your jewelry, motherfucker!
These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine
And all a nigga found was a Ruger and some pain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! Come up off the chain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! One off in the brain
We some money-hungry wolves, and we down to eat the rich
Your bodyguard ain't shit, we strip him like a stripper bitch
These real-ass killers move in silence with violence
The minute it set off, we the motherfucking wildest
How you from Atlanta that they never speak upon
Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

Once upon a time in the projects
An O.G. saw a young Bun B as a prospect
Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age
So he opened up the G code to the front page
He sat me on the porch, said, ""This where little dogs sit""
Pointed at the yard, said, ""That's where big dogs shit""
He said, ""Don't leave til your ass get growed
And don't come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet, like they soaking in some salve
When you step out on the ave, make sure they wanna see ya
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G, a hater wanna catch you slipping
Try to be a Jordan, but settle for a Pippen""
Player, I ain't even tripping, but I don't really care
Cause my pistol's in your face, so put your hands in the air

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

In a six, I'm riding with a pistol grip, banana clip
From Simpson Road to Adamsville, I'm repping this Atlanta shit
Nigga trying to handle up, let's see can they handle this
A hundred round at em, that ain't no Louisiana shit
Drinking on that Hennessey, blowing on that cannabis
Amerikkka's nightmare, trap nigga fantasy
A record full of felonies, searching for a better me
But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq, Cuba, Tel Aviv
Pretty nigga, let him be fuck him, shorty
Sucker nigga I'll never be, don't give a fuck about it
Quick to round up on that Audi, make em get the fuck up out it
Nigga better be about it, he deserve it he allow it
What's a coward to a kamikaze?
He ain't robbed a man, ain't predator or prey, the law of nature where I stay
I catch you slipping with that K, ain't no illusion, no confusion
Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you're snoozing

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

Wha-da-da-dang, wha-da-da-da-da-dang
Listen to my clip before that five go bang
Bang bang, guap time, rep game
We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks
Predators, we eyeballing all of y'all lames
Let me fall off, I'm taking all of y'all chains
All of y'all watches and all of y'all cars
Well, who you talking to? All of y'all stars
All of y'all rappers and producers and such
No homo promo, homie, you might get your ass touched
Like Def Jam circa '83, you get rushed
If you rolling with some winners, then you rolling with us
I know some dope country niggas, but them niggas ain't weak
Know they dressing looking hard, but them niggas ain't cheap
I don't make dance music, this is R.A.P
Opposite of the sucker shit they play on T.V

And you know just how it go

But who the hell are you to cause so much pain

Trouble,"The Lord shall endure forever
For He hath prepared His throne for judgment
And they that know Thy name will put their trust in Thee
For Thou Lord have not forsaken those that seek Thee

I will praise Thee O Lord
I will sing praise in Thy name
Don't forget the cry of the humble
Have mercy on me

Put them in fear O Lord
That the nations may know
Let them realize
They are just men, just men

Thou hast rebuked the heathen
Thou hast destroyed the wicked
Won't forget the cry of the humble
Have mercy on me

Put them in fear O Lord
That the nations may know
Let them realize
They are just men, just men

The Lord shall endure forever
For He hath prepared His throne for judgment
And they that know Thy name will put their trust in Thee
For Thou Lord have not forsaken those that seek Thee

Put them in fear O Lord
That the nations may know
Let them realize
They are just men, just men

The Lord will be a refuge
For the oppressed
A refuge in times of trouble

We are not holy men
But at least we try
Try to serve as best we can

Treat each other wrong

Wings of envy, scenic sound
All our lives we`ve been on the run
Inner freedom rising sun
 
[Chorus]",Hello Strawberry Skies,1991
Trouble,"Child`s first trip away from home
Instant communication shown - no one knows
Ringing in my ear must be the phone
Pick my brain down to the bone - no one home
 
[Chorus]
Body touches are so cold
Someone saved her sweet soul
Tell me which way the river flows
Will you still love me when I`m old
 
Lifeline says I`m already dead
Open the window above my bed
I've been mislead
Dark crystals turn a shade of blood-red
From my feet to my head 
I`m already dead
 
[Chorus]",Manic Frustration,1991
Trouble,"Should you go first and I remain
One thing I'd have to do
Walk slowly towards your door
Soon I will follow you
 
[Chorus]
Will I dream of good times
Only love in our minds
Will I dream of making love
Always knew that it was enough
 
She's gone to live in
Memory's garden
 
I'll want to know each step you take
So I can walk the same
Someday down that lonely road
You'll hear me call your name
 
[Chorus]
 
She's gone to live in
Memory's garden
 
Traveled along so many roads
Must have tried everyone
Today we shown new directions
Ones we've never seen before
 
[Chorus]
 
She's gone to live in
Memory's garden",Memory's Garden,1991
Trouble,"I`m supposed to talk to you
Don`t even know where to start
Don`t want to stand with the setting sun
Tell me does it really show
I`ll promise you anything
Place your hand over your heart
Don`t want to fool myself anymore
Think nobody else will ever know
 
[Chorus:]
Mr. White, up all night
Hiding in my room
Mr. White, so uptight
Even knows my name
 
Could never show you just how I feel
It`s only that inside I`m so tired
So tired of being all alone
Now the hours are breathing
Gone like tears in yesterday`s rain
I remember voices telling me
Secrets of mind-changing reality",Mr. White,1991
Trouble,"Remember, when we were standing in the rain
Like so many times before
Wishing we could see again
What am I looking for
Never really could explain
I caused you so much pain
Now I understand
 
[Chorus]
Baby, rain must fall
Blue skies are clear in her eyes
Rain, she keeps fallin'
Don't be afraid, look for the sun
 
Confusion seems to be all around
Nothing is real
Sometimes, when I can't take anymore
The way you always make me feel
Never really could explain
I always loved the rain
Now I understand
 
[Chorus]",Rain,1991
Trouble,"Noises in the corner of the park
Do birds fly higher in the dark
Scenes of unopened eyes - goodbye
This is where the lonely sleeper`s soul lies
 
[Chorus:]
Shine on everyone
Somewhere there`s got to be a better sun
 
Where is peace and understanding
Strong winds of promise blow away
Lost in a cloud of mystery - I`m free
This is where the lonely sleeper`s soul lies
 
[Chorus]

Noises in the corner of the park
Do birds fly higher in the dark
Scenes of unopened eyes - goodbye
This is where the lonely sleeper`s soul lies

[Chorus]",The Sleeper,1991
Trouble,"In state his glory will
Forever creeping
Evil robes of sorrow too
Promises worth keeping
 
Rosemary should remember me
It was her son that died
Regret to inform that you have won
A trip to the other side
Spirits move musically
Appearing in human form
Crawling shape intruder
Mother you keep me warm
 
Rosemary should remember me
It was her son that died
Regret to inform that you have won
A trip to the other side
 
Another tragedy man - oh yeah
Another tragedy man
 
Once he smiled silent hope
Nightly from azure towers
Magic solitude now
Watch above the flowers
 
Rosemary should remember me
It was her son that died
Regret to inform that you have won
A trip to the other side
 
Another tragedy man - oh yeah
Another tragedy man
 
As walking in the ghost of a star
Thinking `bout the world that you shall explore
I was her only son
Son, son, son
Yeah",Tragedy Man,1991
Trouble,"I'm supposed to talk to you
Don't even know where to start
Don't want to stand with the setting sun
Tell me does it really show

I'll promise you anything
Place your hand over your heart
Don't want to fool myself anymore
Think nobody else will ever know

Mr. White, up all night
Hiding in my room
Mr. White, so uptight
Even knows my name

Could never show you just how I feel
[Unverified] so I didn't care
It's only that inside I'm so tired
So tired of being all alone

Now the hours are breathing
Gone like tears in yesterday's rain
I remember voices telling me
Secrets of mind changing reality

Mr. White, up all night
Hiding in my room
Mr. White, so uptight
Even knows my name
