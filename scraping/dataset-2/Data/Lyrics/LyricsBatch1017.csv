Ev'ry Monday mo'nin
People, that insurance man knockin' on my do'
Well now, tell him to come back on a Tuesday
Because Sonny Boy hasn't made no money, you know

He said, 'Yeah, but you haven't paid yo' insurance
In two or three week'
Said, 'Sonny Boy, an your insurance have gon' down' 
He said, 'But you haven't paid yo' insurance
In two or three week'
He said, 'And your insurance have gone down'
He said, If you don't pays by next Wednesday
I reckon I'll have to let your insurance drop, now'

I said, 'Insurance man please don't turn me out'
Lord, an I ain't got nobody to bury me
'Now insurance man, please don't turn me out'
I haven't got nobody to bury me'
Well now an I say, 'If you won't bury me
They'll throw my body in the deep blue sea'

I'll tell you, you know how times is now-a-day
Can't no one man find no job
I'll say, 'You know how times is now-a-day
Can't no one man find no job'
I'll say 'I can't even take care of my wife an baby
An I might have to let my family starve

I said, 'Please give me two mo' weeks
Insurance man please do that for me'
I said, 'Now please give me two mo' weeks
Insurance man please do that for me'
Well I say, 'I don't live up north
My home is back down in Tennessee.'

Rainy day, rainy day
Ya oughta hear my baby sing the blues
Rainy day, some rainy day
You oughta hear my baby sing the blues now

Just to tell these strange people the news

Now what's the use of loving?
Peoples, said I don't see why I should
What's the use of love?
Peoples, said I don't see why I should now
Now, an you know this little woman that I'm lovin'
Lord, an she don't mean me no good

Now but that would be alright, now
My bad luck ain't going to last always
Now but that would be alright
My bad luck ain't going to last always
Now just because I'm down an out now
I'm gonna see some ol' lucky day

Take care of my wife an my baby
Tell 'em that I'll be back home someday now
Take care of my wife and my baby 
Tell 'em I'll be back home someday now
Now tell 'er that she ain't actin' nothin' but a fool
Doggin' me 'round this way

Lord, sometime I go out walkin'
People, go out walkin' to myself
Lord, sometime I go out walkin', now
Go out walkin', talkin' to myself, now 
Now because my baby be's on my mind
An I don't be's thinkin' about nobody else

Just as sure as one an one is two now

Just as sure as one an one is two now
Now, when I give you my money

Sleepy LaBeef,"If some of ya'll never been down south too much
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this 
So that you'll understand what I'm talkin' about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods
And in the fields looks somethin' like a turnip green
And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there 
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause thats about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A mean vicious woman)

Everyday ?for supper time, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman
Lord have Mercy, pick a mess of it)

Her daddy was lazy and no count, claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for was stealin' watermelons 
Out of my truck patch
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny

Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
I've been traveling night and day
I've been running all the way
baby, trying to get to you

When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us,
But they didn't mean a thing.

I just had to reach you, baby,
In spite of all that I've been through.
I kept traveling night and day,
I kept running all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.

Well if I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do,
I would travel night and day,
And I'd still run all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.

Well, there's nothing that could hold me
Or that could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true

When my way was dark as night, 
He would shine His brightest light,

Sleepy LaBeef,"I'll take y'all down south Lousiana
Go down in the swampland
With the alligators, cypress leaves
I used to know a couple of Cajun boys lived back in the swamps
One of 'em a great big old boy
One of 'em kinda short, not too big
Lived back in the swamps down by the river
This particular afternoon, there wasn't a whole lot goin on there in the swamps
They were just sittin' there on a log
Ponderin' on what they were gonna do for the night
Stir up a little bit of excitement
Whatever the big boy decides he wants to do
The little one go along with it
'Cos he thinks he's cool
We call this the ballad of Roosevelt and his faithful companion Ira Lee

The river was dark and muddy
And the moon was on the rise
And all of the creatures in the swampland
Had woke up to feed for the night
Roosevelt and Ira Lee were sittin' there on a log
Ira Lee turned to Roosevelt and said
I'd sure like to have a mess of bull frog
He said: Yeah yeah, love them fried frog legs


Well they slipped on their rubber boots
That is, cept for Ira Lee
Now Roosevelt had them real tall boots
Kinda belt 'em around your waist
But Ira Lee didn't have no boots
But he had some eight year old Converse sneakers
With a heel done rotted completely off in the back
Walked down by the water edge
And right away they knew that the night would be a bummer
Cause Ira Lee stepped on a water mossacin 
And he said ""Oh, oh, oh, somebody help me now!""

That cottonmouth snake got ahold of Ira Lee's sneaker
Chomp, chomp chomp chomp
Gettin' a little funky over there, come on

Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

Sleepy LaBeef,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

I got the kool-aid
I hear the
something from my baby
I wade out to the ocean
Put on my sunset lotion
I see the sun glow
The water flow in slow motion
I got a beach chair
I see the blonde hair
Pick up my feet there
I feel the cool air
The breeze is nice now
I'll tell you right now
I sip my kool-aid
Boy I'm feeling better now
Do I need a vacation?
Just need to get away for a while
Wait, did I forget my sunglasses?

No
Got 'em
I paint my nails pink
There in the sand dome
I hear the oh-so calling on the radio
I see a young boy
He on the upswing
He gets a nose bleed
And I hear the girls sing
I hop on the water slide
Gotta get my swims on
I pull my straps up
I'll see your better slides
Oh no no no no no no no no
Look at the seashells
I see the young boys swimming",Kids,2010

I love all aminals but they don't love me back.
I tend to put them in a state of full attack.

You think I'd pet a kitten and it would rub against me
But that doesn't ever happen
I must be made of sweetmeat.

Cause they bite me
They try to eat me alive
I get so frightened
I cry.I cry.

I want a pet so bad I can just taste it
I'd love to walk a dog and not be chased by it
You think I'd feed a stray dog and it would love me sweetly
But that doesn't ever happen
I must be made of sweetmeat

Cause they bite me
They try to eat me alive
I get so frightened
I cry

I can't even take a walk in the great outdoors
Cause suddenly I'm being chased by wild boars.
Squirrels hit me with their nuts.
Raccoons with their hissing bit
The deer they take turns kicking.
The rabbits try to maul me.
The snakes are licking lying
Their tying me down
They wrap them selves around my legs..
The poison me they paralyze me
The birds are pecking my eyes
They rip out of all of my hair
I tell them go on have a bite
Make a pig out of yourselves

I'm made of meat.
And I am sweet meat.

They concentrate, they take what's mine
Lost they move like fractured ghosts
To empty heads in empty lines

Trapped in frames of empty films
A war is flat, in frames they kill
Light will char and edits cut
They broadcast stare, they know they must

Faded raids before they fold
Into themselves it's done I'm told
Acting last repeats to last
And beats you back when credits rolled

Build yourself a fame through fire
And douse it out when you require
List your age on lilac page
Strength in a crawl back to the stage

When it's obvious they're not scared of us
They will drag you back to cold
All film burnt at source, much too fast of course
They will drag you back for more

When your wish runs out they will make you doubt
They will drag you back for more
When your frame runs dry minds will start to fly
They will break before they fold

A 757 jet
He ain't know? You dealing with a fucking vet
Niggaz cold like banana splits
That's why I cop the are with banana clips

Real slow is how I drive past

Infrared beam on the Mausberg pump
Hit his ass with it twice, make him A-Town Stomp
In gats we trust

Refuse to talk about just, cars and bling-bling

Would've could've should've wont do with us true enough
Need a hoe break a hoe never nuthin' new to us
Turnin' hoes to house wives never been cool with us
Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up
Till then fuck it I'm winnin' so I'm a stack up
Flows like a river the current is so rapid
Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens

You looking good in them guess's shawty showing yo ass
Make a nigga want to grab a hold of yo ass
Strip you out yo couchie dress and hit the flo' wit yo ass
When I leave the club I want to see some more of yo ass
I ain't tricking shit but I might spend some dough on yo ass
The way you bouncing on my dick and grindin' slow wit yo ass
Hit the v.i.p. wit me I po' some moe' fo yo ass
Just so I can see you out there bouncing yo ass
If I leave the club wit something rather go wit yo ass
Them other broads fine but you a pro wit yo ass
When I see you popping and dropping I know it's yo ass
In a crowd full of hoes I would notice yo ass
 
[Bridge: T.I.]
A now a thug done chose 
And I don't give a damn if the club done closed
Give the DJ a dub tell him spin one mo
So I can finish watching you popping yo
Shaking yo, dropping yo, bouncing yo ass

Hey as soon as she get in I'm a find her ass

I don't care if I got some henn' I'm putting down my glass
Just so I can get out there and grind her ass
Wit yo fine ass, must I remind yo ass?
You da baddest thing in here that's why I'm eyeing yo ass

Ya nails all pretty and ya hair due too

I made this song to let you know shit that I see ya when you working that ass
Make a nigga think later on he gone be twerkin' that ass
And I can tell by the way you throw it back it ain't no hurting that ass
And ain't no room for nothing else in that skirt but that ass
The jiggling shawty, got a nigga shivering shawty
And if you don't know what to do wit you better give it here shawty
Put a bend in her back, I'm throwing the dick she giving it back
I tell her if you ever give me that ass I ain't giving it back
She bouncing her ass, later on I'm a blow a ounce wit her ass
Ride out wit her ass, cut somethin' on the couch wit her ass
Then bounce to her pad, cause you know it ain't no housing her ass
Cause since the first time I seen her, all I been thinking bout is her ass

Hey young world... the world is yours
Hey young world... the world is yours
Young world young world... the world is yours
Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld

This rap here... it may cause concern it's
broad and deep... why don't you listen and learn
Love mean happiness... that once was strong
But due to society... even that's turned wrong
Times have changed... and it's cool to look bummy
and be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
Have you forgotten... who put you on this Earth?
Who brought you up right... and who loved you since your birth?
Reward is a brainwashed kid goin wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company... hey, now you've been framed
Your parents are hurting... hurting and ashamed
You're ruining yourself... and your mommy can't cope
Hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
Here's a rule for the non cool... your life, don't drool
Don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
Get ahead... and accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves... hey they don't admire you
Their time's limited, hardrocks too
So listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
Go for yours, cause dreams come true
And you'll make your mommy proud... so proud of you too
And this is a message... that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

""You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
 We like to party, like to party""

Hey Mr. Bigshot... hey, don't you look fly?
But you don't have a nickle... ohhhh, my my my
You've been fightin again and, you forgot why
Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.... because you make your family cry
And all jokes aside, are you in good health?
Hey little boy... now have you really checked yourself?
You're a disgust, you know someone that I can't trust, you'd
steal mom's welfare... and you'd run and buy some dust, and
plus, a must so... bigshot you're not
Your friends are talkin and I'm hearin that your girls are what?
You didn't know?  Go steal and rob
And while you're at it... go get a suit for a j-awhh-ob
You see you're actin like this urge is demandin
c'mon, wake up... have some understandin
Society's a weak excuse for a man
It's time for the brothers... rap is trying to take the stand
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you deep
Guides you... and he watched you as you grew, plus
past the age of... a little child, that's true
But folks your age don't act like you do, so
so be mature... and put the point to a halt
And if you're over eighteen... I wish you'd act like an adult
Don't live in a world... of hate hate hate
Pull yourself together... and get yourself straight
Men don't steal... hey, most don't borrow
And if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
So be more mature... and kids do your chores
Make your own money... hey, be proud that's yours
You know why, cause that's a man... that's brains no spite
Stayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight
And a man never loses a fight... in God's sight
Cause righteous laws are overdue
And this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier

Well he's in indian town, and what spots his eye?
A nice looking indian, and honey looked fly
He had to talk because he just couldn't hack it
She wore some moccasins and plus a tough leather jacket
He trotted over and invented a line
He said excuse me, um, do you happen to have the time?
All was on his mind was sex, sex, sex
So she said why do ask? you got your own timex
To poor old dave that line was cold blooded
He felt that her ego was way over flooded
She started to laugh and then she started to say
I'm sorry some times I do get carried away
I didn't mean to like ill treat you
My name is running rabbit and I'm glad to meet you
He said I'm dave, with crazy clout
Oh you're the one the girls keep talking about
Yeah, you must be, because you look like a winner
Come to my house, we'll discuss it over dinner

Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier

Well, he met her father, big chief Beretti
He said what's for dinner?
Soup and spaghetti
The dinner was rotten and he swore he's gonna puke it
He never would have took it if he'd known that he had cooked it
Later on they were chilling, in the bedroom
Sitting at the window looking at the moon
Judging from the mood he swore she was hot
He said are you in the mood?
She said no I'm not
From what he believes and from what he gets
When a girl says no, he really thinks she means yes
So, he started touching her and coming out strong
Whispering sweet nothings and singing a song
He said
I'm in the mood for love,
Simply because you're near me,
Funny but when you're near me,
I'm in the mood, don't mean to be rude,
But I'm in the mood for love
She said oh dave, you've got my poor back hurting
I want you, but first close the curtain
He closed the curtain and also the doors
The next thing you knew it was off with those drawers

Take it easy Davy, you're hurting me. stop

Well, he was playing with her tits, they were soft not lumpy
And then he cracked the legs like Humpty-Dumpty
He's fucking, sucking, also finger popping
He had, no intention of stopping
Crazy fun, he did not want to leave
His head was between her tits and he could barely breathe
He had to toss, turn, turn, toss
Meanwhile he was riding her with crazy force
She was burning hot, she said stop, stop.
He said are you talking sex or what?
I guess she didn't realize what she started
Next thing you knew she was acting retarded
She said to him strangely and kind of merry
Stop now, or I'll be unable to marry
He didn't take her warning
He rode her till the morning
He rode that ass till the pussy started yawning

He said what? wait his dick went weak
It said dave, pussies ain't supposed to speak
He gathered his things he wanted to leave this place
But first he wanted to see the vagina face to face
He opened it up, with his bare two thumbs
He seen crabs with spears and indian drums!

""Wish me luck dear, I'm scared and I'm nervous""
So who stands, who falls, who crowds the halls
This one the DJ calls... lick the balls!

Now everytime I write dope raps they come vickin it
Now you know the title of this, so start lickin it
Lips kickin it, hey bitch, there is a brick in it
So when you think you're prepared, I keep stickin it
Now here they come with a spike to fight, take it light
Now who the one you're trying to be like with all your might
And anyone that attempted to remove me out the race
best give me space before I fly in they fuckin face
Now raise that vocal, play that role around your local hoods
Don't worry about a thing cause Ricky Rick is bringin home the goods
Who stands, who falls, who crowds the halls
This one the DJ calls... lick the balls!

Now everything that come out your mouth, sound like it's out of spite
I'm back on a mission and this time I'm gonna anchor right
That's right, ads help, he's improvin it
""Thank gosh Rick!  We love the way you're movin it""
Who's hittin rough in eighty-eight I bet your momma knows
Backslap you all down like I were dominoes
Stun em all, come on y'all, give me a taste of life
Act trife, I'll let my dog cold fuck ya wife
So be my friend and don't pretend you will not be forgiven
You're cleaning house up to the MASTER, that's how we both are livin
So who will stands, who falls, who crowds the halls
This one the DJ calls... lick the balls!

GO Vance Wright!  GO Rick!  Look at the style we bring
How come you cannot write a rap that will erase the king
The girls you watch are now entranced now when they see me slam
Shit on motherfuckers and I tell them who the fuck I am
My name is Rick, but now you know who's rulin it
Pump the world and the DJ put the fuel in it
Come ride the dick and if you want to know what is the word
Who write the baddest raps you and your boys have ever heard
I eat you up and give your girl a bowl of Puppy Chow
You understand alright?  Hello! I'm tryin to tell you now
Who stands, who falls, who crowds the halls
This one the DJ calls... lick the balls!",Lick the Balls,1988
Slick Rick,"Well I'm sittin on my lunch break, grinnin my teeth (my teeth)
It's the last day of the week, boy what a relief (relief)
My muscles kind of ache, they felt rigid and stuff
so I looked around, and I smoked this big fat spliff
Now I'm happy as can be I'm in this pothead spell
I put some Visine in my eyes so that no one can tell
It's 12:55 almost time for the bell
Put the breathmints in the mouth so that the mouth don't smell
Now back on the job, I don't bother no one
I keep strictly to myself and all my work gets done
Now the job's finally over it's time to have fun
and I'm hangin out with Trevor there's a kid named John
Got real drunker than a skunk and happy as can be
We went, to the Latin Quarters and we got in free
Scoopin all the girls like nuttin with my trunk jewelry
cause I'ma fly brown brother and you can't school me
Boogie Down was performin hey they ain't no joke
And a bunch of Brooklyn kids was lookin all down my throat
Was it my big chains with the big plates on em?
Then they rolled on me and told me to run em

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo homeboy take off your chains man
 Bout to hurt you real fuckin bad, I'm gonna fuck you up""
This was the moment I feared...
""Yo what's the matter stupid?  Take the shits off man!
 The fuck is up?""

I said, ""They're really not real, they're just a front for the girls""
Then a whole bunch of fists just, caved my world
I was in pain, so ashamed, I wish I had not came
Had to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train, then
I went to an open store that's where I brought/bought me a quart
Then I went to the park, and I sat and I thought
I seen Danny Boy though he's with his girl named Sarah
in one of his cars, I think this one's a Bravera
She calls out to me, but, I really couldn't hear her
So I went just a little bit closer so I'd hear a little clearer
She said, ""I need Veronica Blades that's right near Tilden""
I said, ""I know where that's at cause that's right next to my building""
I gave em the information and they went on their way
I went home, and there I slept til almost three the next day
Then someone knocked on my door, I opened up, no quit!
It was Sarah with some magazines and a bag named Kit
She tried to use me and seduce me and at first I wasn't with it
Then we did it and we did it and we did it and WE DID IT
She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it
The elevator came and Danny Boy was on it

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo what the fuck's goin on here?
 What you doin to my girl homeboy?""
This was the moment I feared...
""Oh I just KNOW y'all didn't just finish fuckin
 I just KNOW y'all ain't just finish fuckin""

Well he was huffin and puffin and he swung at me -- word
So I pulled out my jammy and I silenced the nerd
Then he was dead two in the head I took the cash and the Visa's
She said, ""Don't worry about a thing just make sure nobody sees us""
We went back to her apartment, there was blow in the freezers
She said, ""We're rich we're rich we can have whatever will please us""
Now I don't hang with no one who ain't good for my health
So I put the sugarhead out and I went for self
Now I was rich as I was rich I could have whatever would please me
Now I could wear real gold in front of folks that would tease me
Yah me, I'll be a new neighborhood dad
Cats'll roll up on me screamin, ""Yo Rick my man!!""
I guess I was too fly word up I'm sorry to say
Ya see a cop rolled up on me and told me, ""Make my day""
I said, ""Relax brother,"" but he had proof that I had done it
Yah they had false hair on underwear with my fingerprints all on it
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
And I was the main event on the TV for a while
but now I'm in jail doin life and I'm scared
Some kids snuffed me cold and greased me where no one dared

This was the moment I feared...
""Turn around nigga (HAHAHAHA)
 Spread your cheeks""
This was the moment I feared...
""UHH, AOWWHWHWAA!  STOP STOP!  AHAOWWHAHAOOHO""",The Moment I Feared,1988
Slick Rick,"Ladies, and gentlemen, and lowlifes
It is with outstanding pleasure
that we are here to present tonight,
Slick Rick, the Ruler!  And MC Ricky D!
Doing their smash hit, ""Mona Lisa,""
you know, like the picture?
Anyway, I'd like to take this time out
to bow before his divine majesty

Oh your majesty
Hmm?
Can I kiss your hand?
Mm-hm
(kisses his hand loudly)
Enough!
Come your highness, they await you

Well, it was one of those days, not much to do
I was chillin' downtown, with my old school crew
I went into a store, to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona, what?
Mona Lisa (what?) Mona Lisa, so men made you..
You know what I'm sayin?  So I said, ""Excuse me, dear
my gosh, you look nice!
Put away your money
I'll buy that slice!""
She said, ""Thanks, I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you""
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (ping!) I almost blinded her
She said, ""Great Scott!  Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth""
Ha-ha, hah!  Had to find that funny
So I said, ""No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief?  Please!  Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet""
She almost got cut short, you know, scissors
She tried to disrespect who?!  The Grand Wizard
Me!  ""Well what's your name, son?""
""MC Ricky D,"" but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
""I'm.. sorry and I know that's low class (uh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past""
She said, ""Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin""
A virgin?!  Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin, with her yea wide gap
I said, ""It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's Ricky,
R, ravishing
I, impress
C, Courageous; so careless
K, for the Kangols which I've got
that I wear everyday and
Y, why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm
quite polite like Walter Cronkite""
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, ""Hey Rick, don't you know playin' with these snakes is a sin?!?""
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, ""I don't want to see you playin' with these lowlifes no more!
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of her friends""
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it!
And as we were leavin' and drivin' along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song

""If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry, each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so, let me hide
The pain and the hurt that you gave me
When you said goodbye,
You walked on by..""",Mona Lisa,1988
Slick Rick,"Hauk, who goes yonder?
It is I, sire, Richard of Nottingham
Well, speak up man, what is it?
News from the east, sire, Rick the Ruler has returned

Gather 'round party goers as if your still livin'
And get on down to the old Slick rhythm
Now this one here is called the Ruler my dear
Its a mere party booster that will set things clear
Its a hundred percent proof from champions of truth
And if you feel you need spirit I'll bring back your youth
Relax your mind, and folks unwind
And be kind to a rhythm that you hardly find
And off we go, let the trumpets blow
Well hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Now in these times, at least to me
There's a lot of people out here tryin' to sound like Ricky D
Not tryin' to cause trouble cause its really a small thing
But they're bitin what I'm writin
God it's great being the king
Some sound allright, but then they act illy
Try conquering my crown and that's really very silly
Now I'm not the type that gets upset
Try to disrespect folks just to earn respect
But learn this fact, whether white or black
I can't be conquered in my style of rap
For jealousy and envy are dumb ones tools
So Ricky says nothing, he keeps his cool
Revenge is not a mission that the Ruler's on
Just forgiveness required for the wrong that's done
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit, hit it 
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it

Now one day when I was chillin' at this outside jam
I seen folks havin' a ball and plus clappin' their hands
To beats of records that conquer the streets
Like Pee Wee Herman and Clubhouse Treats
Girls was chillin', boys rule as usual
The slacks, the golds, the rings, I hope I'm not confusin y'all
But everyone in the house looks smashin'
Fresh clothes on their butts and nothing out of fashion
And just when you thought nothing couldn't get better
A news flash concealed in a bright yellow letter
A kid ran up to the mike and said ""Alert, hear this,""
Cleared his cloudy throat and then began to persist
He said ""Hallelujah, kids hear this
The Ruler's back and he's here to assist""
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it
Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it

Slick Rick,"well I've been a public figure for quite a long time
known to the whole world for what [my style of rhyme]
but tonight let's talk about the ones who bite
although they know they won't [never get it right]
because they have no [class] and they have no [shame]
they'll bite another brother to boost their own [name]
get paid correct on a one way gimmick
I'm happy for you lowlifes but 'member there's a limit - so say

teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the master will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]
teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the master will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]

when I walk into a party cokesnorters laugh
as the girls be crazy coming for my mere autograph
and it seems that they aspiring my new style of rappin'
and brothers all around me out of vanity are snappin'
the girls say 'wow Rick you're so unique
please tell us how you organize the words you speak'
but my will says chill and I go upon my way
'cause class will be taught some other day - so say

teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]
teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]

well I remember one night when the world was dead quiet
and out of nowhere some boy starts a riot
he tore my clothes, I had to throw blows
a shotgun barrel was dead on my nose
I froze - it was Big Foot and the Toes
yup, a bunch of small timers that (be it?) on my shows
surrounded the ruler with machetes too
they said um 'if you don't teach us how to rap you're through'
I said 'okay, now let me go, please'
I seen an officer - then the officer screamed 'freeze!'
he said 'Slick Rick you okay?'
I had to play it off, some girls were looking my way
so I smacked one in the face and told him 'I won't retire'
and many years from now I'll just be getting higher
for I am the master, set and done
my name is Ricky D and I'm the only one - so say

[...Ricky D] - [...Ricky D]

now when I was a lad my style was bad
so I had to use what little bit of knowledge that I had
so I quote and I wrote 'till I was up to par
some rhymes were [boo-hoo] and some rhymes were [hahahaa!]
I educate myself so I'm able to reach ya
answering the call of teacher, teacher
tell us how you do it, it's so easy for me
the creator of the style, emcee Ricky D
now my only task is to warn all biters
slimy sluts and fake rhyme writers
don't try your luck and get the ruler annoyed
for when I'm through with you boy your whole world will be destroyed
so chill mister muscle or I'll come and hunt ya
if you are a girl I'll make no man want ya
so if you want to rule and no (?) in the way
pay attention to my syllables and come see me and say hey hey

teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]

Slick Rick,"(Chorus: repeat 4x)
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again

[Verse One]
Aye sport, here's a thought from the old school crew
A serious situation we all go threw
It deals wit your feelins, so here what I say
It's like a dyke, but nothing seems to go your way
Bust this, two people, they really like each other
He says their's no one else
And she claims they're is no other
The feelins are same, and you receive a notion
To reveal your inner thoughts deeply hit emotions

(Chorus:4x)

[Verse Two]
Precious times, hopin they won't end
Tell your mother bout your lover
Or so your best friend
Ya mighty proud while your holdin her hand
Boys, yo that's my woman, and girls, yeah that's my man
This pressure brings a sort of warmth to ya heart
And everything seems so great at the start
For she loves him, and he also loves her
And it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
But later on, problems start to occur
And the bond, which combines, y'all turn into a blur
For the feelins were the same, now here's the score
You love him to much, and they don't love him anymore
Or did you have to choose a number
Or because your not bein true
Or maybe they're just plain sick of seein you
Word, now it might seem strange
You better take his quick, and make the right change

(Chorus: 4x)

[Verse Three]
See just when you swore, the boy was wrong and
Then they're gone, and part of ya heart's been stolen
Get back on your feet, wit a hop and a skip
But no, you rather go wit this dead relationship
Hangin around, and buyin him stuff
You seem him every darn day, you don't see him enough
You follow them around, and they claim ya hawkin
When conversation comes, you do all the talkin
Not to mention, attention, we all need a bit
Behind ya back they're sayin, yeah he's all on my tits
They're gettin sick of you, and quite annoyed
And if you had plans for the future, they're now destroyed
You saw what was happenin, and you still let it
And if you ever let him  make love to ya girl, you can forget it
Sweetheart, you been caught, spread around town
Passin then ya thoughts
And break up time, and your recitine the words
Yo this is fromt the heart, and I know the part hearts
Get over it, from now don't take short slick
If it's not true love, you shouldn't deal wit it
Just think of your future, and what is to come
And pay attention to the words that's in this song, they go

(Chorus: 4x)

Do you know, where ya goin to
Do like the things that life is showin you
And are you going to...",Teenage Love,1988
Slick Rick,"Here's an oldie but goodie
Hit it
Excuse me
What?
Can I have your attention?
Mn-hmm
There's just a few things that I've got to mention (Uh-huh)
There's girlies out here that seem appealing
But they all come in your life and cold hurt your feelings
I'm telling you
As Rick is my name
I wouldn't trust not girl unless she feels the same
Treat 'em like a prostitute (Do What?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my first example

Now ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while
Plans for the future, she's having your child
Celebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts
Telling all your friends about your family thoughts
One friend was drunk so he sstarts to act wild
He tells the truth about the kid
It's not your child
Acting like a jerk and on his face was a smirk
He said, ""Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work""
And she led him on and tried to please him
She didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him

Treat 'em like a prostitue (Do What?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my second example

It's your wife
You buy the tramp jewels and clothes
You get sentimental and bring home a rose
Give her everything 'cause you swear she's worth it
All your friends tell you, ""The bith don't' deserve it""
Love is blind, so there goes your wealth
Until one day, you see things for yourself
Came home from work early, Mr. Loverman
You had a card and some candy in your right hand
There's the mailman, he was short yet stout
He went inside your house and didn't come back out
Bust it
Just a friendly stop, come on, is it?
The mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit?
The thought alone makes your temperature boil
You say to yourself, she might still  be loyal
You open up your door and stand in a trance
You see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants
Came home to party
At work had a hard day
Look around your house and you say, ""Where the hell are they?""
Run upstairs up to your bedroom
You look inside your room, you see something brewin'
Cover your mouth because you almost choke
You see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat

Treat 'em like a prostitute (Mm-hmm)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my third example

Now your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot
And today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot
As you open up the door she says, ""Get on the floor""
She wants to try things she's never tried before
She takes off your drawers and works you over
She calls you Twinkles
And you call her Rover
Next thing you know, the ho starts to ill
She says, ""I love you, Harold"" and your name is Will
That's not the half 'til you start to ride her
Take off your rubber and there's one more inside her
It's not yours-who can it be?
I think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky

Treat 'em like a prostitute

Slick Rick,"[Slick Rick]
Well I'ma tell you a story and I come out bluntly
want to ugly shot, hey nobody will want me
I used to walk around and get upset and upsetter
Till I figured out ways to make myself look better
As I got older, my awareness expanded
I met this beautiful girl and my wish was commanded
Didn't hang wit fellas, 'cause they started gettin shady
I'd always be wit my girl and ya could her my lady
I love the wedlock, what up, not going to front
See the problem that arouses, why on earth did she want me?
Couldn't figure it out, and to make things worst
I was cursed, wit the torment of not being the first
And the first was this fly guy, made me very jealous
Ooh, I think he cheat on me, and talked to other fellas
Two wrongs don't make a right, but any time that we fight
I would call and took a phone and call a girl outta spite
I shouldn't have done it

[Chorus 2X: scratched up]
I'm feelin sad and blue

[Slick Rick]
I will to make this right, so director was admirin
I tried to stop my love, but no love was not retirin
To catcher in the rye was near impossible and tricky
Didn't want her in certain clothes, gettin really dickey
We got into it again, this time she got to bright
So me preventin a fight, I just stayed out for the night
I had to ease up of the record, all this hot increase
I went up to the parrot, wit a mega vance in vain
This girl came over, she was trucked down extensive
Startin talkin to me, and she was probably quite aggresive
A pretty young thing, she didn't strike me as no ho
So meet my nigga, rude and went on wit the flow
But Joe was gettin hard, without me even knowin
We stepped up back to my van and I could it's for growin
The girl took off her coat her body was no joke
Well, I rubbed it to unzip it, and I went for broke
I shouldn't have done it

[Chorus 4X: scratched up]

[Slick Rick]
Now I'm seein, that there's no one to blame
That night when I went home, I felt real guilty and ashamed
Snucked right into bed, I felt just like a shady fella
What made me so unsensitive, how I'm ever gonna tell her?
Shouldn't have cheated, just because we'd always doubt
Endurance, be a man, that's what I had to learn about
How me, I guess I like the wanted secrets that I did
I figure, I'd patch things up and then I'll tell what I did
Then after that, she started actin heaven sent
I found a house spot, let's say she help out wit the rent
So, I bought the ring, it was a good 20 Karat
Then word got back about me chillin at the parrot
So when I got home, I thought she'd just be out to roast
Instead I found this letter, and I found her overdosed
It said ""I had it for you"" but I guess she didn't care
All this wouldn't happen come of me and this fear
I shouldn't have done it

Forget about the people before I know tired of
Been through the whole world for what? Tired of bride
But tonight let's talk about the ones who bite
Although they know, they won't ever get it right

And can't find another brother who boost it on pain

Remember one night when the world was dead quiet
And outta nowhere some boys start a riot
Take off my clothes, I had to throw blows
The shotgun barrel and dead on my toes

Surround it and bring it wit my empty shift
And said um, will you teach us how to rap, no doubt

Slick Rick,"Yeah, boy!
Check it out Slick, ya know what I'm sayin?

No complaining
I reached my destination and its raining
I'm in Columbia, the Bond steps off the plane and
I hear a hollar from a bro with ring around the collar
Its chief of police, grease Bond, tell me to follow
Treated me to everything, no taxin, maxin
Gives me a hotel suite for me to relax in
Seems everyone was in my silk drawers
A cloud does it have to bug me a daffy nerve
Jumpin out the closet, word up, dead nigga
Said ""Chief how do you figure tryin to arrest me, the Double for the
murder of the nigga?""
Now in a cell, but not for long, and now I'm out, I hear a weeping
One asleep, other sleep, kept creeping
Bumped into another, my appearance was alarming
(To who) some lady that thought I'm charming
Please, the way I is I don't even have to say hon,
So who's a Don?
You better believe the nigga keeps girls fond,
The name's Bond!

Well, I'm outside and its the chief with twenty thiefs like the brainiac

Aware because the Double 0 was bucking like a maniac
Till nobody lives, so hon, nowhere to do correct
Said ""excuse me baby, but where they hiding the hooker at?""
""Around the block, but chill at least chill till the storm has stopped""
Decided it was a helicopter, sounds like its warming up
Grabbed ya leg, shot the chief, someone said ""Stop hawking""
Shook me off at twenty-thou, the Bond got up walking
They was laughing as they left they grew thinner like Iraqi,
Got the plans from the dying chief of police in her pocket
To make it even worse honey girl was definitely rattin
Was holding her in a club that was happening in Manhattan
I'm on the plane in the day seemed nothing was a phasing,
Except for the stewardess jocking the Amazing,
But kept my composure, had another honey hon,
Who the Don?
Better believe the nigga keep girls fond,
The name's Bond!

Back at home in New York, I didn't want to get too overfly
You want to know why I pulled out my 535i? (pimp!)
Boy I see some lookouts with some girls that's annoyed
It was a private engagement for the dealer and the boys
Double just passed the hoods with their faces painted
Walked in, say a good twent girls fainted
Throw cousins all out but seems that everyone was shitting,
And man I was so cool I even carried me a kitten (reowr!)
Trouble for the Double 0?  Wouldn't swallow that
Who's the man with the Golden Guuuuun and all of that
Turned curls of mercy, left blood on the walls of
Rescued the shorty who was all on the walls of
Whore said ""You're late!""  I don't want to hear none of your dissing
Nabbed the cash, made a good twenty million on the mission
Good job, not to mention had the balls honey hung
So who's a Don?

Call me the freaker, I bump it in ya speaker
Week on my birthday, met this girl named Tameka
Astonishing creature, made the rest look tired
Desired, that was the beauty I admired
Out by the 41 Brook, no joke
Can I have a toke, finally, she smiled and smoked
Gave the girl my number, though I still felt rejected
Hectic, called me more than I expected
Months passed by, even lived together and all
Dream come true, until suddenly a call
Oh brother, why do I discover

Well, tried to block it out my mind, here it was again:
Other men, confronted lady and she said he was a friend
Didn't believe her, she packed, brave her
Strange behavior, so silly, we forgave her
Late again Thursday, alone Rick sat
Left flat, look in the mirror and I wonder where she at
Gave the girl my heart and soul, it's after 10
And again couldn't manage if she slept wit other men
Out wearing my jewelry so you know she looked truck
Struck 3 o'clock, here she come, fishy like a fuck
Come and let me smell you, I wanted to say to hell you
Hi honey, sorry I'm late, but let me tell you
It's a fast chat, need the phone, slow rollin
Could you go to the store and get some soda 'cause they open
Again it offend and I pretend

Strike one, strike two, no exaggeration
Try to play it off like it was my imagination
Beer mix wit alcohol, help me to forgive
Deal wit weak minded and I have no where to live
I deserve honesty, get treated it like a pet
I should be in list, but no I still can't forget
Put the cards on the table, don't get loud, cut the bull out
If you slept wit another man, I'm strong enough to pull out
She confess and then she left, smooth
Wanted to kill myself 'cause to live ain't the move
Broke-hearted again, it offend and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
Once again it offend, and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
Once again it offend, and I pretend

As you see Ruler show's, is enquirin noses
Goin into a story about a kid named Moses
Once a prophet was to be born, so for anything else furve it
Fear of orders, every first born, some murdered
One got away, a girl wit profit for a river
Gently put him in a basket, went floatin down a river
Then hands up by a fair up relative, or honey peep it
Couldn't be the severed, once determined to keep
Don't say a word, she told this slim, who was a real witch
Snitch, it'll definitely be the last day you breathin
Wild kids slaughter, 'cause they was fronted them
Soldiers tellin the kid that they murdered every one of them
Thanks said Pharaoh, guys little friend tips

To a brother who arose and said, ""whoa sis""

Group to conquer land like ain't no tomorrow
Made the Sun King jealous 'cause he couldn't do a moldin

Some dish rap behavior ruins every piece of bash
Though I complain, where's the several action build
You piece of trash, tree or switch
Mo' you buildin, and find your cream's hero
Built it, anything else, you need Pharaoh
Come to star this, this my crown
One say ""How can he"" but since not takin any chance
He threw the hooker off the balcony
But word sold out to King, he bank cold cuts blessed
Stripped him of his honors and dumped him in the desert
But I'm return for the people, this chest about saw
King said ""You want war? Make brick without straw""
That's a son not being king, and shorty knows good roses

Oh boy, what do I do? Now pray to prophet
Then a vision said chill and prophecy fill
Scorm build, hells of fire, or there first born killed
It's gettin scary for the king, he made the sufferin go by Mario
You win, take these peasants and get the fluck outta my area
More villains, still in heat, didn't want my 2 to fill him
Wasn't chillin, then I flat sent the troop to go and kill him
So more, prophecy, when a crossing said run him
Did some ol' abracadabra and water fell upon him
The soldiers that is, since Moses was suave
Then Mo' and the mounds havin a convo wit the father
Came back in the tens, seen panty hoes dropin
Partner suave, folks wasn't into what po-pop was poppin
So the Earth shouldn't kill those, bible takes clothes

Saw a brother listen to, wife kissin to
Then on another mission to
The city of a sister, it was a far distance
There was a ranger outta area they needed my assistance
Tuesday of the cash, last man that rob pimpy
He never returned, I said ok and put the money in the fin
And then he bumped into this girl
who like that girl that more come Indian
How I sex a white trick, jockin me she Indian
Comin in on this feet, and comin hopin a chance for ropin in
How'd you like to put your Indian tee in my opening
So that was a deed, 'cause a nigga wasn't new to this
True to this, double barrel slide out the uterus
Calm, started singin sad popular songs
Took the money and the hon', screamin at the top of her lungs
You won a hundred per a reefer, once about to smoke a blunt
Know, run wit up fronto, screw a girl pronto, mean Tonto

I don't know why the fuck I'm doin this

Sad or loose, both thirst or a cactus full of juice

Then don't hate me the Indian, I was so embarrassed
Don't pull a kid a minute, to give in within a minute
Til I seen a shaggy condo, or a couple livin in it
Shouldn't have, friendly manner, though she pack her up and ran her
Coudln't stand the finer fellas like she wanted some banana
Led me to the back of the house, the hands that started trife
Used it as my marks and then I nearly had a heart attack
Brush it off, deal wit the floss, way past disgusted
Said what's the matter granny? Is your blood ass dusted
Back in the hunt, now what he want, poor granny offer me a blunt

And a couple o'months later kid's pushin' for the drawers.

Dawn finally gives in to the sexual advances.
Although it was a mad high cost for her
'cause' after the thrill was gone, so was the lust for her.

A live nigga keep cash in a stash 
What's the eggs without the corn beef hash? 
Blowing up like Sarah Dash 

Jerkin up the neck  known to cause whiplash 
Dance and get down with me 
Peep the steelo the strategy 
What killed the cat's curiosity? 

You better believe that I be freaking 
Pull my ? the M be leaking 
Same MC who wreck shop at the Beacon 
Uptown lingo is what I'm speaking 
So put your pedal to the metal 

And feet to the ground 
And peep this uptown sound 
It makes no sense in standing around 
Hey, it makes no sense just standing around 

Come on everybody lets all get down

I'm chilling with Nice and Smooth with my Phat Farm outfit 
They say what's up Rick what's up good to see you out kid 
Where the party at, asking and relaxing 
And pop a couple of Moe's listening to some fat tracks with them 

Being a kid locked, want to check the the scene and shit 
Zulu Nation having something tonight at the arena Greg 
Lets get drunk and roll, said they like the sound of it 
Rolled a couple of blunts, but Ruler wasn't down with it 
? want to go and hit something 

Be off work release even if you get caught with weed in yo system 
Be up north quick, since we all down to roll 
Went to the club having the up most amount of fun 
Should've heard them groupies scream for 
Wonder why this brother looking at me all mean for 
Ignored it, kept swapping til my neck hurt 
Then Greg Nice and Smooth did this very same record called

Happy birthday, what's the word say 
To papa smurf, I cover the globe like earth day 
Rollin with G and the Rickster 
Flavor full boogie down mixture 

We came back to attack with the Ruler 
You can't get no cooler 
On our way to the bank 
Now do the Patty Duke and then do the Spank 

Come from the heart things spark 
And keep your eyes glued to the top of the chart 
Oh shit, its the man with the fronts and the jewels 
The kids with the blunts and the tools 
Sewing up shop like needles 
Selling more record than the Beetles

Slick Rick,"(singing)
Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said ""You got me waiting""
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala

I got a girl, but I'm about to switch all that
Because my girl be trying to play me like the bitch all that
Shoot, clocked her daughter, for acting out of order
To impress a girl who to me knocked her out the water!
But because the kid swears love
Though when I see her friend its like the shit wears off
I don't bother, while she want to kiss and then cuss and full of hate
Get her friend?  Mission Impossible
Because she's the one the hon chose to boast to
The way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste
So make music in my basement
Don't cut her off till I find a good replacement
One day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's
house, cause the hon was sleeping over
My girl was acting fine, then the slime switched
want to diss, I said ""It's over you waste of time BITCH""
Tried to kiss her friend, twice then a third
She said ""Stop, Rick"", but didn't tell her friend a word
I went to bed, here come my girl touching me intently
Snuck out early, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before
Because she swore a nigga hit her
""Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?""
But I didn't, now the hon badgering
I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair

(singing)
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe

Another brother out for one thing, mistook him for
Steady relationship is what I'm really looking for
Sincerity, scoop the hon I done it
I said ""Being straight up, it's you I really wanted""
Though she fucked niggas with money like MAD
I still found myself wanting the honey quite bad
Loyal to her friend, though she wanted wood
Then we did it, boy that pussy was good
""But what if shorty finds out?""
Never be too clever
""Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together""
Chill, then we started to button the strap and
Then my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened
Later on, my girlfriend stormed in
""We going to the supper club, some kid's performing
Bye, see you later"", 
Her girlfriend hot, then stopped living, Rick decide to follow
I'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can
Both sluts were sliding numbers to the next man
Contradicting of words being together
My girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather
Back in my Jeep, about 4:11
Popped another can, looked up to the heavens
I'm a good man, in fact I know that I am
And I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm...

(singing)
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe
Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said, you got me waiting
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh,
lalalala, lalalala, lalalala, lalalala

So you get my point son, 
you just don't trust no bitch, you know what I'm sayin?
""Okay, daddy, I understand""
Cause bitches ain't no good, you know what I'm sayin?
""Okay, I get your point""
Anyway, listen to this, check it out

1994, as the world gets trifer,
I'm wondering, the fuck I need a woman in my life for? (ya know)
Cause its like a nigga whole history
With you hoes been nothing but misery
First rater, five-one stood
Mad coke fiend though the bitch looked good
Met her at the fever
""What's going on, stranger?""
And like a fool took her in and tried to change her
I don't who I thought I's bluffing
That BITCH wasn't giving up that coke for nothing
""Oh you trying to dis, mister bougeois nigga
Yet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too,
That type shit you ain't admitting""
Because, homegirl, I grew out of it, you didn't
Anyway, dead out of order
Came in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her
Who gave you that?
""My ex""
I said ""Who?""
Believe she had the nerve to say ""You can wear it too""

When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true

(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Scooby doo doo

Then I met Sin,
Sweating the viking
A brown skinned fox, slim just like I like them
""What?  Sweating you?  Picture that, nerd.  Please""
Anyway, the bitch had herpes!  (you know)
Imagine me, the fool being the spouse
Doctor said I couldn't catch it unless I got aroused
Found out snooping in her bag what she got
Now why you ain't tell me?  You worthless slut!
""Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to""
You know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying
Anyway, stayed with the creep
One day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep
""Chris, wait,"" the bum bitch said
So loud till a motherfucker fell out the bed
Who the hell is Chris?  She putting up resistance
Until I caught her calling the nigga long distance
Had the nerve to dis patch loving
Boy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing

When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true

(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo-ooh (doo-ooh)

Though happy I was free
The need for love was still in me
Got to the point where the need for it was killing me
Then I met short here, hanging with my cousin
Found out later how young the bitch was and
Though I done hit it and she opened up a world
And remind me of that song ""Go Away, Little Girl""
It had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled
""That's because I had you pussy whipped royal""
You see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?
You see the type of attitude the BUM BITCH carry?
Like oil and water, impossible mixture
Then temper tantrums came into the picture
Yelling (ahhhh), carrying on bad and cursing
Complete embarrassment to The Ruler as a person
""Gimme shorts""
Ruler will not permit you
Then she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture
Flirts too, excuse me, a whore
Like the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour

So when I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true

(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo
Ricky needs a love that's true-hoo-hoo",Sittin' in My Car,1994

Hey

Welcome
To
The new world

I'd like to make a small dedication tonight to the bitches of the world
Now to make this understood, I'm gonna explain somethin' to you
(biatch!)
Check this out
Bitch!
To be a bitch, you don't necessarily have to have a pussy in your pants
(True indeed, true indeed)
In fact
Most, if not all, of the bitches I know (That's right)
Have little peckers, little dicks
?

A bitch ain't nothin'
But a muthafucka that wanna come up
From another muthafucka
Hard work
Don't make no sense to these muthafuckas
Dumb ass muthafuckas
Now to make it real clear I'm gonna explain it to ya in a story form
Like this here
Check this out

I remember the way it started
Once upon a time
When a nigga named Dre came, nigga got signed
Ruthless nigga, everything is all good
You the shit, 'cause you rollin' wit' some Boyz-N-the-Hood
No One Can Do it Better, see, 'cause I'm an M-D
And when I fuck it up, you give me 25 G's
Eazy-E said, ""Yeah, oh yeah!""
So I took it
Forget the paperwork
The money made me overlook it

I rose up quick from the pit I was in
450 0300 Benz
Nothin' but ends, money bought friends
Got me in a cross ?
Now everything's lost
This is when I found out
""Look at this shit!""
You is slippin'
You ain't gonna believe what that nigga did
""My shit fucked up, Dre, you need to look""
""I ain't trippin', yo, I think your little homie, he a crook""

The spot got shook, it was hell below
Is that the future shock?
Hell, no, it's Death Row
I was all in because of the begin
Think they would see
Yo, we all gon' win
So ""The Chronic"" was upon us, the music awards
But I was still broke at the crib when they toured
The album soared and I got bored
With niggas talkin' shit, they came upon a ?

Ain't that a bitch?

I coulda been the star dude
Or maybe I shoulda stabbed out like Ice Cube
But what about your Dogg?
Who? Snoop? We was tight
I hung around, we'd get together when he'd write
In the Pound, that's the way it come to ?
When it's goin' down, niggas is in whatever
I went outside for a minute and came back
Niggas was talkin' crazy like they wanted me to rap
So I did somethin' from the old LP
""Damn! That's that shit!""
""That's what a nigga want to see""

Visit the Windy City and ?
Rock over 17,000 G's
I recognized game
The shit was kinda funny
Fucked-up voice shit, nigga make money
He came back and here comes the glory
And this is the way I'm gonna end this story

I was only 19
Lookin' for a dream
From what I put out
I never got a fuckin' thing
This and the wreck was the fucked-up part
It's just a little somethin' about some real heart

From Ruthless to Death Row do we all part
Bitches, see ya
Trick-ass, trick-ass bitch
Trick
Trick-ass

La-la-la

(Once upon a time not long ago)
(A brother tried to play me like a kid, so I just dissed him)

(It's like a message that only I can understand)

(Keepin' it dope as long as I can rock a mansion)
(Remember this forever!)

People in the house, I'm gonna let 'em know
I'm gonna let 'em know, my nigga

E-R-O-T-I-C
H-L-B
D-O-C
Comin' with the B-O-M-B

Nah  chill.....it was December 

True...cuz that's when L started his bid 

Partied through the New Year 

January third he slid 

Up until then  yo  L had it swell 

Called him Sweet Pea like his name was Pernell 

He did the job  money came with ease 

Blowing outta town  moving bricks and ki's 

Him and his chick  in forty G rides 

Holding down fort like they Bonnie N Clyde 

Luxury cars of all makes and models 

New outfits everyday, downin' champagne by the bottle 

Glass in the air (air)

What! My cash and he fucked her wit dat A

He took me for my paper so just call him Uzi Dead! 

Used to run epps wit him back in the day 

Mitch popped the trunk 

Passed the German AK 

You dirty rat! I'm bout to bless that ass 

Better take cover from the rat-tat-tat-tat 

Uzi Ed, ain't have a vest, three to the chest, Ed got blessed

cause of drug logic 

Shouldn't touch it 

Now out to budget 

With a movie star chick from outta Edenwald Projects 

Nice job, took prison camp drives 

While he promised up and down to live a civilized lifestyle 

The seat off the brow was soon on garment 

Both worked 

Got themselves a two-bedroom apartment 

Great statement, without delayment, away and went 

Saved to get a house on one of them low down payments 

But an idea concocted his stock 

Why don't we try and turn this money over on the drug tip 

So he gave his man a shriek and excitement 

Didn't know his peeps were under secret indictment 

Sick of the path that'll get you hung by the neck

Slick Rick,"Here we go
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought ta good
There lived a lil' boy who was misled
By anotha lil' boy and this is what he said
""Me, Ya, Ty, we gonna make sum cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said ""Keep still, boy, no need for static""
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said ""Why did ya hit me?""
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigga""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radioes it to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked around good and from expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said ""I need bullets, hurry up, run!""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova (?)
Raced up the block doing 83
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead
He told the cops ""Back off or honey here's dead""
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
He dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have end this story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
Just another case 'bout the wrong path
Straight 'n narrow or yo' soul gets cast

Slick Rick,"Oh my God...

[Slick Rick:] Excuse me Doug E. Fresh
[Doug E. Fresh:] Yes
[Slick Rick:] Have you ever seen a show when fellow on the mic
Wit one million rhymes and don't come out right
They bit, they're never right, that's not polite
Am I lying

[Doug E. Fresh:] No, you're quite right
[Slick Rick:] But tonight on a starry mic you're about to hear
[Both:] We swear the best star rappers of the year
[Slick Rick:]So, so, Cherrio, yo scream at brotha
[Both:] Also if you didn't know this is called the show

[Slick Rick:] Hey yo Doug, what
Put your ballies on
[Doug E. Fresh:]Yo Rick I was about to but I need the shoehorn
[Slick Rick:] Why? Because the shoes always hurt my gong
6 minutes, 6 minutes, 6 minutes Doug E. Fresh you're on
Ah ah on, ah ah on, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah on [Repeat]

Oh my God...

Here we go (Here we go)
C'mon (C'mon) [Repeat]

[Doug E. Fresh:] Yo where's it?
[Slick Rick:] Well I don't know they're late
Tell 'em the time, oh I forgot the date

Man you did it again, oh no
(Yo, here we go, c'mon, here we go, c'mon, here we go
Think we missed the show)
No, no n-n-n-no we didn't (wang)
No, n-n-n-n-no we didn't (w-w-w-wang)
No we didn't, well don't get us wrong
Excuse me Doug E., excuse me Doug E.
Excuse me Doug E. Fresh you're on
Ah ah on, on, on, on, on

Oh my God...

Well it started up on 8th Avenue
And I made up the name the Get Fresh Crew
It was me, my true DJ Jerona, that would be
My right hand man Ricky D.
I used to rap and sing, make sounds and things
For example, here's a telephone ting
(Ring, ring) Hello, is Doug E. Fresh here
(No, he's not in right now)
But anyway, no more delay
Just check out the new style I display
Now you got to be fresh to rock wit fresh
And I'm D-O-U-G-I-E Fresh
And I'm know for the...
Not for the...
The human beat box on the entertainer
No other label that fit me plainer
In a passing generation, I am a remainder
And I'm also known as a beat box trainer
Cashing checks, make sound effects
And after I'm finish rocking, Slick Rick is on next
(You know it) Slick Rick

Well, here's a little something that needs to be heard
Doug, I was walking downtown (Word Rick) word
(Sure) All along, no one to be wit
Step on the D-train, 205th
I saw a pretty girl (so)
So I sat beside her
Then she went roar, she was Tony the Tiger
I said, oh darn, there has been a mistake
Honey, my name's Slick Rick, not frosty flake
(Oh, golly wolly) She was raising hell
She said, um, my name is Maggie but you can call me Michelle
(Rick sings)
Bust a move, we show and prove
Hey, yo, Doug, do that funky jam on a groove

Oh my God...",The Show,1997
Slick Rick,"* originally appeared on the Rush Hour soundtrack

Intro: (DJ S&S), Slick Rick

(Uhh check it out..... S&S......
with the ruler '98........Def Jam.....)
And here we are, in the phase again
That ol' funeral music, is he goin to heaven or is he goin to hell?
I don't know, he's right in the centre, why'knowhutImean? (Uhh uhh)
(Uhh-huh huh, uhh-huh huh, uhh-huh huh, uhh-huh c'mon
Uhh-huh yeah, uhh-huh c'mon, uhh-huh '98 c'mon.....)

Verse One:

Nigga no way rap better than, act better, that 
veteran of rap *?ceteran?*
Brung on, motherfucker sung on, run on
Come on, go and have fun on, run on
Immediate considered, no he really ain't
The main ingredient, comedian, must be obedient
Reason why the player who away a few, say that too
'cause no one else can talk shit way I do
School kid, the cool slid
and I rule wid, still shoot wid my 2, kid
Ain't no way on Earth to faze Rick, the man plays with wit
Eras-ed the man amazin the bassin
Border him, all on ya albums slaughterin
Better spin like slavery when I order him
Rejects creep yet keep step
Every borough, every state, every country in deep check

Chorus:

Mack all of it, controller shit, catch hold of it
How you gonna move Slick when cats like solo Rick?
Accept, yet no chances that they make plans
to wreck and make a nigga, breakdance the record
I turned and learned this sequel I burned went
urgent, mad white people like servin
Interested with, gets congested with
clowns, haven't made a record, impress the kid

Verse Two:

No entry, let's keep a hood rhymin shit (A-party people)
Are you tryin to have yourself a good time or what?
No stressin you, type of beat bring out the best in you
Allegeble, ruler came to add a touch of bless onto
Niggas think they bashin me, his majesty
of garbage and never were no match for me and actually
many a girl catch the fever
and I don't need anyone else rap with either
If this is based on skill, kill anybody will
affiliate Rick real to Hicksville
Same ruler movin cowardness out of this
Never out powerless, devour this and now it is
time for one to leave upon impeach
Help teach all men how to live amongst each (KnowI'msayin?)
Although a lotta creep yet keeps
Every borough, every state, every country in deep check

Chorus

Verse Three:

The bounce men, S&S sound bend
Listen up kid, an important announcement
There's a rapper I know many interested in
named Rick, no rapper alive could mess with him
Lace records all audience roar to
Grand of a show, skill on the dancefloor too
Freakin awesome, of course I'm married
High school broads keep your drawers on
'cause this one in perf' case
Guaranteed to make you break fool at the work place
Diligent, shout as Mr. Militant
Allow me to do my thing, it's all brilliant
Although sometime the reign may slip
can't skip my part on the hu-man tip
Ain't shit, you rejects creep yet keep step
Every borough, every state, every country in deep check

Chorus

Outro: DJ S&S

Slick Rick and S&S now, c'mon
Slick Rick and S&S now, c'mon
Slick Rick'll make ya move your butt, c'mon
S&S'll make ya move your butt
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
S&S and Slick Rick'll make ya move your butt
Slick Rick and S&S'll make ya throw your hands up
S&S and Slick Rick make ya move your butt

Slick Rick,"Well I shot some there, then I copped some beer
And did a show up in West Bubblefuck somewhere
Due to raps wider ratio, satellites to Nato
Hillbilly draws flew on the stage like tomatoes
Apparently more mack than I thought
Unfortunately wife piece back in New York
And I'm starvin
Being human and open with
A mad fine hillbilly woman was scoping Rick
Thought entered how to lean and bent it
Though I'm not gonna lie I was extremely tempted
(To what, Rick?) To discharge in a sista
Next thing in the dressing room, ""Pardon me, mister""
Yes, I said cautiously
""Crazy, but possibly 
you could sign your name on the back of these Dazy Duke shorts for me""
Try to resist, now girlfriend startin' it
The pen won't write, ""You can press down hard on it"" -
Now my hand browsing her South end
Spun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when
Rring! - Loosen the grip my hell had
My girl, she was talking so nice I felt bad
Being untrue, no telling what it might do to her
""I love you"", forced to say I love you back too to her
Any thought of getting pussy was doomed to:""You got a wife?"" 
Anniversary comin up soon too
Got off the phone, cock just got mute
Don't get me wrong it's not like you're not cute (Uh-huh)
I'm wrong for mistreating her, the wanting to skeeting her
""I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya""
What an angel overcoming his wrongness
The moral I am trying to get across in this song is

If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And want to find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)
Goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And want to find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid

Casually seating with some thick chords eating
With my album playing at a big board meeting
""I love this"", being the coolest and the ruffest
A big willie woman pulls the Ruler in her office
And fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went
'Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment -
Pounding was inevitable
She said to me ""Rick, I think your album is incredible""
The way the hon' upon I, comin' on a sun I
""You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye""
Well I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya
Means a lot to me, coming from a woman of your stature
I mean, who could resist the Don head?
Start caressing Rick private, kiss me on the neck
And I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull
Girlfriend pussy look plump and poundable
She sweats the set me emporer
Put one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya
Fantastic, though I start to act drastic
When I see my wedding band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek
Deep down, she felt that I tried to diss
I'm like, I can't do this as much as I'd like to miss
An angel overcoming his wrong, kids
The point that I am trying to get across in this song is

If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And want to find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keep no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)
Goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And want to find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keep no secret, like who they creep with

Slick Rick,"Check (5X)

Well, let us skip the boring foreplay I'm slidin' right in 
This girl over my house who had to be about 19
Ass, hoes in my poster 
She's sweatin' although she tried to hold her composure
I hoped she'd take it in the ass and suck dick
(Girl) My my what a nice apartment you got Rick
On her knees about to make her fall 
(Girl) ""All platinum and gold jammies hangin' on the wall too, 
you got it goin' on""
Now my mouth start foamin' 
The lights dim we're kissin' and my hands start roamin' in her drawers 
(Girl) Stop!
Knew she was joking 
cause I ain't even fuck her and her pussy was soaking WET!
Already had her tit out 
If I play my cards right, fuck her dig in the hole she shit out 
(Girl) Rick I gotta go my girls waitin'
She recaps finally when honey drawers down to her kneecaps 
Breathed heavy all mushy bitch 
Swore up and down I was gonna fuck her in the pussy
Since friends waitin' on subtle 
Bout time to make a move upon the hungry little butthole
Meanwhile she acted quite passive 
lickin' the hun neck while she lotionin' that ass with jelly
Tit hung out the frame nigga loco
Surprised honey didn't put up too much of a struggle, at first
Sinkin' in she ain't know how to be the bitch went 
(Girl) ahh Rick it hurts take it out of me!
Knocked my magazine down, bitch threw my papers 
You want to keep it down I mean I do have neighbors!
Squirmin' away although the table was barrin' her 
Felt real good my dick was sunk so far in her
She said it felt like a bull dowser barrin her 
Sqealin about she couldn't take it anymore in her
My cummed on her straight in the perm in her, (here) 
As I drained every last drop of sperm in her (where)

Chorus:

So girls when we kiss and we cuddle, ain't no way to put it subtle 
when I want the butt hole!
(Moaning in back round)

Another girl I met, her experience fast because 
Most girls wit kids don't be hit in they ass before
Picked her up sunset 
(Girl) Don't be late for dinner, ma
Bringin' honey home from the date at the cinema
Thinkin' how to fuck the ass so plottin', 
blown in the elevator, hit the stop button
She smiled, by knowin' her butt I want to bore   
I said ""Can I have a kiss now instead of in front of your front door""
(kissing/sex in the back round) (Uhhhmmm!! Oh yeah!)
Although the rule I tried not to push hard, 
I'm all over the bitch like an octopus 
Deep down I know she also want to fuck 
Though I kept my tongue in her mouth so not to put her on the spot
To have to talk no shit to prevent me from bonin' 
Unzap the bra, when the hooker start moanin and 
Expose my espresso suck on her and lick on her 
Unbucklin' pullin' out mad long dick on her
Panties in the way of that, but I want to check it out
Slipped her wet drawers down her thigh and took her leg out
Her butt was juicy kinda fat, 
spun around start to stick her in the pussy from the back
She came, mad juice dripped out, 
still in the pussy then acted like it slipped out
Cum on the floor, She said ""Pardon the puddle"" 
Spread open her cheeks, pushed hard in her butt hole 
Uhhhmmm, wasn't a bad date at all, she went AHHHH AHHHH
Start pullin' at my balls while I'm still penetratin' 
Felt fantastic, she said 
(Girl) ""Rick I'm not really into this ass kick""
Meanwhile Rick cummin' by the gallon, 
put your hands on the wall please
And try an' keep your balance
Lickin' the grill in her, meanwhile fillin' her 
Till sperm start pourin' out her butt hole while I'm still in her
Then start rammin' the pine in her

So girls when we kiss and we cuddle, 
ain't no way to put it subtle when I want the butthole!

Is it a custom - to what?  To provoke out a hostile apostle
and make him smack the coke out your nostril
BAP, the butter cat at gutter rappin and I'm all man
Whatever gotta happen gotta happen
Boy don't make me put my grown man shoe in you
And I'm sorry father, for any wrongdoing doin you
Cause dogs barkin and the girl sigh
Here to present myself as the sparkle of the world's eye
Picture I - where Spice Girls chick arrived
England, January 14th, six-five
While you scream out Brannyville
""You old ass rapper!""  You got it, but can he still
sever, in other words, rap more clever
like no other younger rapper walkin could ever?

What you never know?  All clothes come off a hoe
Ever see me with my jewels and toast from off of Mo'?
*psssh*  Past where handsome measures
like the whole entire Rat Pack, AND some precious
And chartable, such a big spark I pull
Nuns even say, ""That motherfucker's remarkable!""
And aliens who came to earth gathering
""Great gosh the man has soul, we must have him""
Like a ?, there isn't none after me
Liz will throw away her walker and run after me
Snatch crowns -- done this, on this

Hit a lost world, actin like a lunatic *blblblblbl*

forced good men to pull out and start to murder folk
Tired of the basement placed in
Take responsibility for your action as a race then
Instead of put cheer in our bone, paperhood promote
negativity, and fear in our own neighborhood
Since royalty breed to be (uh-huh)

Releasin' me a basket case from prison - Pissed
Blood feenin', the villain like 'Wassup ya'll'
Deep down schemin' how to kill 'em
Misleadin' a bit, although proceedin' a hit
I made 'em feel I'd never jeopardise my freedom for shit
Played the empty headed part, 
Though the moment they dreaded start, neat
Back of the head and took the credit card
Seen properly decease,
Made it look like an everyday robbery to police
And I's out
Police believed a thief pop for sureity, a jerky
Alert the rest to beef up security
And not to get flashy, although another blast occurred
Another brother deservin' to get massacred
Pleasure in poppin' that flea
Should a heard mister tough guy coppin' mad pleas
Not insane, nor am I biased
Though feels good to watch a motherfucker die before 
my fly ass
Ain't nuttin' to blast, fuck it
Then I put some crack vials in the ass pocket and was off
Police said a thug awaited, since I didn't leave no evidence
A drug related incident

Reason why your girlfriends dig us - cause I kill niggaz

You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy

Well I had it up to here, that's why a brother buckin' trife
And gettin' way with murder, this the motherfucking life
At a jam, nine figure on shelf
While your army a nigger snickering among self - thiefs
Who want to clock the bread off the next
That's why I'm gonna blow their fucking head off
Maybe the victor get stuck up
Giving these clowns opportunity to fuck up
They knowin' that the kid crew showers, eye cowers
And leaves for 'bout a good two hours
While they're like 'we coulda caught Rick what, for allsort'
That's what the assholes thought
Tough guy mumblin', I thunderin'
Why I had a motherfucking A-K ya wondering
And raise it higher, start giving them the fire
As they scream like high pitch women like Mariah
Blood on the wall like, other brothers ball like they hit
Seein' shots split a motherfuckers head like lettuce
Run a nigger best bet is for another duck in gage
I'm in a motherfucking rage
Mask 'bout face, Now figure dash
Smash 'bout 10 ta 15 nigger ass out
More enemy dug, deceased, caught
Had not, gave one fuck what police thought (what?)
But first I best provide all brainiacs
With evidence of a suicidal maniac

Fine grown Pine-Sol
Heavenly rhyme throne
Remember when you were young in the 70 time zone
Stages, ages about seven I say kid
The dress code of our parents looked awfully outrageous
Not down on em, games and clownin
When soul was at it's highest rate like James Brown 'n them
??, A groovy era acting
Member seeing Shaft in the movie theater back then?
I feel Richard Roundtree got 'em a fly deal
Black man wearin' bell bottom and high heels
Laughed a lot, some action mass production
Remember when cars were darn near half a block long?
Parents were so into that crap
Bunch a sweet memories to us older rap cats
Muhammad Ali knucklin in tournament
Pimp daddy hats with buckles and ornaments
How we forget snappy
Five people sleepin' in one matress and yet happy
Could even make sex seem sour 
As I impress the world with my extreme power, cause

Chorus: repeat 2X

Rick make memories sealed in almanacs
Not to mention the immence appeal the mack hat
When you wake up in the morning (redeem from any crap)
Because I bring that love and feeling back to rap

cool-Aid couldn't last a hot minute in the 'frigerator
School notes, slidin and stealin, hidin 'em
Bazooka, bubble gum cartoons still inside of 'em

Pimps flyest dressin' muthafuckas, weren't they?
But hood lies, you afraid of a good wine?
I used to love the actor who portrayed one on Good Times
You need a friend to ? a soul, man it kinda slow
One thing 'bout a bro, overflow when it ?
Life, a pitiful game
'Member the robot?
That was my shit on Soul Train
Got hyped to, psyched to, 
And the feelin's right to chillin' on the fire 
escape on a nice night too
No, I'm not gon' try to hurt the ?
Remember ride on blood and dry turkey slang?
Brothers chippin' in for alcoholic money
When you look at old flicks don't we all look funny?

Member afros, what the fuck was that all about?
Buenos noches accents too...friends too
Everybody had a lot of roaches back then too
Profusely around us, Loosley ?
Fleets wearin' Bruce Lee Bandanas
And kick shit, ballin the hand I stick wit'
?????
Most cases, fatha' away for good

""Are you that slave everybody tellin' me rap good?
Calm down, not goin' ta murder ya
Clean yourself, Pharaoh said he want to have a word with ya""
My mom, pop, look concerned
After takin' a shower, dress and returned
The soldier, kinda on the dark end
Brought me and the motherfucking palace was barking
In the midst, a poet, dryin'
Pharaoh and his girl being entertained by him
Motherfucker got some nerve
said ""Bring slave forward, let me observe""
He asked me my name and start badger me
""Ricky, what?"", 'Ricky, your majesty'
And bowed because I had to, 
Kick a rap that shit better sound fat too

Who rotten 'em
Plaits swing, but have you forgotten 'em
Biggest big shouts since King Tut and 'em (who rotten 'em)
Kids ville, motherfucker couldn't sit still
All bitches is open off Rick's grill (who rotten 'em)

Hawk gawkin' at silk fabrics when I'm walkin(who rotten 'em)
Fondle with right, yet, spec get delighted
All a that jungle shit, whites rap

""He's fat"" queen said to the Pharaoh excited and
did seem obvious the rap delighted him
Then start banging on appliance (Yes your honour?)
""Send this other rapper to the lions"" (Please, no!)
Pleaing with merit, if you kill him for my sake
My raps will do the spirit
'Please let him live, I prefer that'
""OK, well, send him where this slave used to work at""
Do or die jammin' me into
Even was allowed to move the family in too
Any beat better rap good on
Even gave me mad nice outfits to put on
Knowing that my rap stlye bumped many
And expecting some important company
The king visits where I was put to write
""Slave, you're behind, better rap real good tonight""
In other words, lay your mack down
'Cause these cats not the one to sound wack round
So that night, when they summers be them clapping
Took a deep breath and then began rapping

Who rotten 'em
Tryin' a find out what excite, what I write, 
What ignite with
Lion never once tried to bite Rick
Excusely, assumed to meek, refuse to greet
A smoother geek, just move ya feet
Shocked all dippin' and stoppin'
Even slave owner wanted me to whip a man, fucker
Shakin' any prison, kickin' back, sick of crap
And sista breakin' when a nigga rap

Well it was obvious the raps unpluggin'
Dignitaries spat wine out they mouth, buggin'
This they never heard that type a tactic
Gold sandles all over their fat steps
One dignitary over what man said
""I'll give you half the eastern border if you sell him""
Back at the rest spot to nap a bit
Mom! Pop! They delighted with the rapper did
""Son"", my mom said sweepin' up
""That lunatic'll kill you if you don't keep it up""
What's wrong with you, ""Son, I'm not scornin' you

Oh help me make green light furriers
You know in life you can't race around with no worthless
So continue the sequel

The mule came over here wit a girl from the old school name
Though hit and all though back's about wit, memories
And that's about it, 'cause

[Chorus]

[Slick Rick]
And uneasiness kept here, even after we made this big giant step here
Womanhood, somewhere in the basement
Slowin down again, so I'm lookin 'a replacement
Music poundin a slow jam
Wit a girl knowin and down wit the program
Although the honey aim style king
Wit a took broom and taimin the wild thing
Loud, uneasiness brought out
Still tried to shove my tongue down the bushy broad mouth
Speedin, chasin after vaccine
Tried to string along, but I didn't have the patience
Learned from cussin and confusion
Breakin Commandments wasn't a solution
Though a few minor clicks in relationship
Still time to fix things

The east side kept me off the curb and
Betsy Ross was sufferin from the scaredy cat
Till my man Ricky brought the remedy for that

Hello?
Veronica, it's Dove.
Uh, I think you got the wrong number
What?
Veronica, your baby's crying.
Yo, chill
Baby?
Whatever yo, later.

[Dove]
For the past two summers I been sizin up Veronica
Southern belle, I heard she blow notes like a harmonica
Yamacas couldn't satisfy her spendin fetishes
She was all about gettin the head like she was lettuces

[Posdnuos]
Yah, them types be actin like they ain't sleazy

Delighted, the honey fly difficult, couldn't knife it

Seen the imprint on honey's private
Now she's love sick

And it's easier to claim with the fame I've obtained
Her mommy was a liar, she's so ashamed

Well, I got this rude boy Jamaican honey at the rest home
Complete with yellow hair and Cinderella dress on
Whatever
Been around, stuck her till she poppin bout

Anyway, another dime I met one time
I'm kiiind, chick in the world, butt fine
And her, structure pumpin, told her
Gotcha mumblin bout
""Slow down, what you tryin to rupture somethin?""

[Posdnuos]
I don't bug out, I chill
Never copped a feel
But these pretty ass girls come and flaunt in the grill
Big ass eyes, with the matchin big ass thighs
Asked her if she spare a moment to exchange some lies
""But you got a girlfriend""

[Slick Rick]
Yah trick, so do you
And I heard there's no preference in what gender ya do

[Posdnuos]
So stop playin so squeaky clean
And let the dirty side see me later
So we can play 'away from the navy'

[Dove]
So stuck on the love you rearranging behaviors
Second episode, and you returnin oral favors
Buyin up groceries
Searchin for hosiery
Holdin hands publicy
And now you supposed to be
Mr. and Mrs. huh, lovin and kisses huh?
But while you away is when the milkman'll visit her
Dear to the heart, we dearly depart the fallen
So skip the games ma, I stay tuned to the calling

Waiting for some guidance at the counselors office

Rock the mic with ease make G's
Rap so dope that the fans say please
Little T can we have some mo
Shakin' that ass on the dance floor
Hands in the air everybody say hoo
The guidance counselor said 
Well sir, hell sir

Slick Rick,"[Chorus]
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor

[Verse 1]
The name of this entertainement is 'Women lose weight'
Our first years of mariage everything was just great 
But after two kids And a weight gain factor 
The fact is Now she's completely unattractive 
Look fat chicks I don't mean to sound rude 
I tell her nice hit the gym And don't eat so much food 
But no Your shallow 
You need to run the course of unconditionnal love and so forth 
But how if desire's is not there That's just delayment 
Divorce is, child support, alimony payments 
My happiness I doubt discouraged 
So hurry for an easier way out of this marriage 
Meanwhile my secretary June well groomed 
When you gonna leave your wife I tell her soon mommy soon, I assume 
Or my destiny is blue Interestingly The only thing left for me to do is to kill her

[Chorus]
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
I'm gonna have to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
I'm gonna have to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss

[Verse 2]
My plans against or shenanigans Kinda ran thin
Knowin' nothing about poisoning And I can't swim 
Bad intentions pumping Might as well become numb 
Cut her lungs or the obvious robbery gone wrong 
But the catch is do I have the nerve to dispatch this 
Who can I get to help me murder this fat chick 
I guess I'll have to play a dude robbin 
On Wednesday The day she usually goes food shopping 
Anyway long story short hit the side of her Chrysler 
And sent her clean over the divider 
""You bastard"" she said 
As the wreck went tumblin down the hill I thought ""she has to be dead"" 
Later on get a call (from a) Lieutenant O'Rourke 
(had me) leapin like a frog We need you at the morgue 
So I selfishly pursue 
""boohoo"" there was nothing else for me to do I had to kill her 

[Chorus]
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
C'mon ya'll know I had to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss Kill her 
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
I had to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss 

[Verse 3]
So you mean to tell me officer you don't have no clue who did this hit and run 
No sir we don't have no clues right now 
This is terrible what am I gonna tell the kids? 
Pull yourself together sir 
I'm so broken up inside I just can't believe this 
I understand, I understand 
Catch the person who did this 
We're gonna try sir Please 
Screamin ""who done took my heart"" acting shakin up a lot 
At the funeral though everyone was lookin at me odd like I did it 
Like I was the reason my mates slain murmuring 
""I heard he was displeased with her weight gain"" 
While my secretary sort of a sexy blonde can't cook 
All she does is order from restaurants 
All of the sex you want I doubt could address, 
Clothes not washed proper and house look a mess and 
Talkin to detectives that was waitin outside 
How I took a long lunch break day the wife died 
I darn near turned pale 
And because of betrayal they indicted me, and gave me an impossible bail 
Good fortune to anyone admiring the rawtent 
Moral of the story is 
Desire is important 
So watch your weight It'll keep you mate smitten it's a given 
Though looking back I realised I didn't have to kill her 

[Chorus]
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
I didn't have to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss 
I killed her 
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
I didn't have to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss 

Well there you have it Keep thin trim Keep your mariage healthy Do you know what I mean?

Instead of uplift folks, sittin' on the non sense
Hurtin' people feelings like he didn't have a conscience
Like 'I love you', when he's hittin' that stash
Then degraded, the shorty, like he didn't have class
Even let a gay jew man tack his jheri
Then, got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy
Swindlin', forgot the god above him
Finally, fan base trinklin' down to nothing
No concern for his estate, though, was yearnin' for a break
Bitter and evil, didn't learn from his mistake
The moral of the story is, don't be a pair of knickers
Be good, boys and girls, and you can be as great as
Rick is

Slick Rick,"Here we go,
Once upon a time not long ago,
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow,
When laws were stern and justice stood,
And people were behavin' like they ought ta good,
There lived a lil' boy who was misled,
By anotha lil' boy and this is what he said:
""Me, Ya, Ty, we gonna make sum cash,
Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash"",
They did the job, money came with ease,
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease,
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha,
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover,
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic,
He said ""Keep still, boy, no need for static"",
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap,
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped,
The kid pulled out a gun, he said ""Why did ya hit me ?"",
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney,
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure,
""I'll do years if I pull this trigga"",
So he cold dashed and ran around the block,
Cop radioes it to another lady cop,
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista,
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her,
Looked around good and from expectations,
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations,
But she was coming and he made a left,
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath,
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him,
Then he made his move to an abandoned building,
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor,
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?,
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope,
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap,
He said ""I need bullets, hurry up, run!""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun,
He went outside but there was cops all over,
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova (?),
Raced up the block doing 83,
Crashed into a tree near university,
Escaped alive though the car was battered,
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered,
Ran out of bullets and still had static,
Grabbed a pregnant lady and out the automatic,
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead,
He told the cops ""Back off or honey here's dead"",
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong,
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on,
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded,
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded,
He dropped the gun, so went the glory,
And this is the way I have end this story,
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream,
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream,
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh,
Just another case 'bout the wrong path,
Straight 'n narrow or yo' soul gets cast(?).

Officer, I didn't do it; you can't blame me for this
Could you please loosen up the handcuffs on my wrists?
You can call me what you wanna, man, but I ain't a snitch
No cooperation is exactly what you would get
Till I talk to my lawyer, you get no reply
You've obviously been watching too much CSI
I'm not a crash dummy so don't even try
To talk your dirty trash to me, no BFI
If you are not guilty of anything, then why did you run?
'Cause you the police, and, plus, I saw you cocking your gun
And the chamber wasn't empty it was obviously one
If you think I'm believing that one, you're obviously dumb)
Huh? (I know that you heard the sirens, you dived in
To the vehicle you was driving and ridin' in
Instead you shouldn't be whining, but abidin' by the law

Murder was the case and they blamed me

Stop lying to me, boy it'd be best you confess
I can smell the BS on the scent of your breath
Saw the meth while I was inspecting your deck
Saw that you was ridin' dirty when I looked at the rest
Who is this guy Busta? Who is this guy Snoop?
Who is his other friend who's wearing the sky blue?
Look at this pic here, he standing beside you
Tell me his name now, I heard he was Piru
Confiscated the CD's at one of your homes
For evidence ever since we heard some of your songs
What about this Pimp guy? He was on one of your songs
I coulda sworn he said he had a pocket full of stones
Am I wrong? hell yeah, I don't know who that is
I don't know no Pimp C, all I know is I'm rich
And I'm a bond like James, bet I be out here quick
Man you ain't getting out of here, you must think that you're slick
In the car we confiscated the chronic and the clips
Diary that you had and all your blueprints
On the Death Row booklet, we found your two prints
Your thumb and your index the judge will love this

Ah, it's murda (It's a bloody murder)

Somebody tell 'em it's murda
Murder was the case and they blamed me

And you can see you're screwed as the evidence pours in
The witness to the crime was at three in the morning
Gave us a description so we picked up your boy and
You'll get a lighter sentence if you put the crime on him
A big celebrity, a case we long for
You a pirate, why you got that eye patch on for?
Funny puttin' people in a hearse what I heard for
Where were you the night of April twenty-first, son?
Home I think that you got your facts wrong, gat's on you
Chamillionaire robbed, shot couple cats on Melview
What? we gonna have to jail you, too
In the line-up, don't speak until we tell you to
This the person who jimmed your lock, sir?
Well, he's dark, kinda looked like him, I'm not sure
Failing to nail 'cause assailant's another
Leave, I see an unmarked tailing a brother
Hit the Bodega, not no more game
This chick used to be all nice, acting all strange
Like she was gonna get it, pathetic
Assailant caught, now they all apologetic

It is with outstanding pleasure
That we are here to present tonight
 Rick, the Ruler! And MC  D
Doing their smash hit, 'Mona Lisa,'
You know, like the picture?
Anyway, I'd like to take this time out
To bow before his divine majesty
Oh your majesty
Hmm?
Can I kiss your hand?
Mm-hmm
(kisses his hand loudly)
Enough
Come your highness they await you

Well, it was one of those days -- not much to do
I was chillin downtown, with my old school crew
I went into a store -- to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona -- what?
Mona Lisa (what?) *singing* Mona Lisa, so men made you
YouknowhatI'msayin? So I said, 'Excuse me, dear
My gosh, you look nice
Put away your money
I'll buy that slice!'
She said, 'Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you'
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (PING!) I almost blinded her
She said, 'Great Scott! Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth'
Ha-ha, hah! Had to find that funny
So I said, 'No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief? Please! Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet'
She almost got cut short -- you know, scissors
She tried to disrespect WHO?! The Grand Wizard
Me! 'Well what's your name, son?'
'MC  D,' but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
'I'm sorry and I know that's low class (uhh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past'
She said, 'Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin'
A virgin?! Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin -- with her yea wide gap
I said, 'It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's 
Are -- Ravishing
I -- Impress
See -- Courageousso careless
K -- for the Kangols which I've got
That I wear everyday and
Why -- why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm
Quite polite like Walter Cronkite'
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, 'Hey Rick, don't you know playin with these snakes is a sin?!?'
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, 'I don't want to see you playin with these lowlifes no more
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of her friends'
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it
And as we were leavin and drivin along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song

'If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so, let me hide

When you said goodbye
You walked on by '","Mona Lisa, Pt. 2",2008

Things are so passionate times are so real
Sometimes I try an chill mellow down blowin smoke
Smile on my face but its really no joke
You feel it in the streets people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down they focus
The focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes ya don't hear me
I push it past the bass no nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep
And its volumes or scriptures when I breath on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm every where penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave tall lead you onna shell
Universal ghetto life holla black you know it well

Quiet storm vital form pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Shoulders the lions raw voice is the siren
I swing round ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous there's no need for fightin'
Suttins tryna hide like the struggle won't find 'em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave talk'll lead you on a shell
Universal ghetto life holla black you know it well

Imma soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well say about noonish commin' out the whip
And lookin at me curious, a young Iraqi kid (awww)
Carrying laundry, what's wrong G? Hungry?
No, gimme oil or get fuck out my country
And in Arabian barkin' other stuff
Till his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush

I'm like surely hope that we can fix our differences soon (bye!)

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Punk rock Billy was an average Joe
Kickin' kids shins with his steel boot toe
With his chin up high and his feet down low
So no one tells him which way to go

And I don't know just what it will take
Watch and see all of his mistakes
Stumbling onto the ground again
And off to the jail house is where he's sent

He wore his pants too low
He spiked his hair too high, he never said goodbye
That punk rock Billy, punk rock Billy, he's the one
That punk rock Billy, he's the one

Ain't nobody gonna fuck with me
Knowin' they'll end up D E A D
Why the fuck would they call L A P D
'Cause you know those dudes can't catch me

Say where I live there's no sunshine
Kickin' in heads and your behind
Wanna fuck with me just one more time

Then you better talk about it
Before you get it started
And if you feel like making war
Then you better realize what you're fighting for

Though you've been searching for the answer, oh
To all the questions that are known
I really don't think you ever found the reason for the one thing
That will keep me moving while I'm losin' my mind

Said if you feel like making war
Or feel like givin' up
They gotta see that no one else
Can save you from yourself

So while you're waiting, hoping
Every little thing's gonna be alright
You gotta know when you'll be looking for the ones
That are ready to fight

But if you feel like making war
Then you better talk about it
Before you get it started
And if you feel like making war
Then you better realize what you're fighting for

Said if you feel like making
Feel like making, feel like making war
Feel like making, feel like making, feel like making war
Feel like making, feel like making, feel like making war
Feel like making, feel like making war

So while you're waiting, hoping
Every little thing's gonna be alright
You gotta know when you'll be looking for the ones
That are ready to fight

But now your older, so much wiser now, the one who wants to make the call. 
A little bolder now, cause while you're all alone, don't really know why you be holding on, to what was wrong. 
And if you ever really thought that you would be the one with your back against the wall.

I've got myself, but its always good to have a confident and a helping hand, cause we need eachother, don't you understand well!

Slightly Stoopid,"Ya know that lovin' ain't enough to make the world go round.
You know that lovin' ain't enough to make the world renowned.
It's just enough to make you move and want to feel the ground.
When you're down and you're out and you know
Because we're holding on to lovin'.
The type of feeling that make you want to implode
Or like a time bomb ticking explode.
Or it's a feeling that you wanted to know,
About the world how does it know,
Because we're holding on to lovin'
Because we're holding on to lovin'.
Yeah,

Yeah aye,
Using caution when I'm approaching,
Got to obtain perfection.
Using art to act as a cushion,
Which measures my main obsession.
My inner direction came into possession,
Dressed as positive vides.
There is never a question I feel like I'm blessed,
To just be part of the pride.
The feeling is hard to describe,
Call it the faith or call it the drive.
No matter the space or size,
This magic will happen in front of your eyes.
And whether you're dead or alive,
Late or way ahead of your time,
You do possess the power to change,
The negative forces that enter your mind.
See love is a seed as soon as it feeds
On human emotion and passion.
Someone who can feel when something is real,
And not just a limited caption.
We live in a primitive fashion,
Logic is distant we give in to passion.
And we can get lost and thrown off course,
And keep it, prevent it from crashing.
I know what your asking,
What is the purpose and are my efforts worthless?
Can it be reached if I can dig deeper,
Or am I just scratching the surface?
Well I was just thinking of ways,
Of singing the meaning and making the phrase.
Because trying to personify love,
Is harder than writing with ink on a page.",Just Thinking,2012

Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw

Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house

Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast

Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to seventy one, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing

They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit

On the escapade, riding a Escalade

I know you know how to keep this thang tight
I'm out doin' me, so I ain't with you every night

It's easy to see, baby I meant to be yo wife
But I can't slow down, nigga I got my own life
So get on in, when you fit in, don't trip
I stack the dough, I run this shit, got you lovin' this

Life a luxury, and you wouldn't have nothin' if it wasn't for me
I'm headed back to the States, flight land at 8
Typin' ""I miss you too, and I can hardly wait""

[Chorus]

I'm on the next first class flight late night to get to you
Sippin' trippin' off the things that we can do like...
Whoa... nooo, keep it on the low
Those the thangs I won't let nobody know

First thangs first, how you like to whip?
Platinum CL5, 2002, [unknown]
Be ready to dip soon as my plane touch down
I only got two days, so we gots to lay it down

You know how we do, in the Dirty, we live it up
When I get to the crib, ain't no frontin', give it up
We're landing in Atlanta, so it's time to crank it up
We get on the round lil' man say back it up

I'm lookin' around, there you are just like you saw
Ain't got no [unknown], headin' straight to the car
We dippin' my ride that's keepin' da real dub
Rasheeda, believe that you bout to get rimmed up

[Talking]
Back in the A-Town this is how we ride
Me and you stay down 'cause we do or die
Everybody be hatin' like we Bonnie and Clyde
Intellectual thug, the only nigga by my side

Between me and you let's keep it one on one
Check them hoe's on the side before them bitches get done
Got no time for the games, I'm collectin' more change
And flip it to bills so we can take it long range

You know what it is, and how it's goin' be
Everywhere that you go, you comin' right back to she
I'm makin' it known for all these hoe's to see
They already know that you belong to me

That's why they stay mad, just wishin'
That they could have everything that I own
The thing and the man, my love, my nigga, my hustler team

This ones for my Chi-town playboys

Where you be?
Come on, just play it with me

When it come to hoes, we don't love not one
Fucking a friend ain't no option, its a must
? stop cumming, fuck I gotta have two not one
She know a freaky nigga like me
Get her wet then I'm out like strike three
No doubt, make her girlfriend eat her out
After we fuck then the exit beat her out
Believe me, we don't love them hoes
Break out, after we dug them hoes
You want to stay bitch, what you talking 'bout?
Get your shoes on, and start walking on

[Chorus]
Get out, I don't want to hug you
Get out, bitch I don't love you
Get out, what you talkin 'bout
Get your shoes on and start walking

You know you hitting, you got me licking the hole
Before I'm sticking the hole up in my face
In the place most niggas don't see love ? baby
I'm about to O.D. cocaine pussy
One stroke be a whole ki'
You're feminine, hood from heaven an'
I'll do anything, orals to S and M
Keep you satisfied, back certified
Come and take a ride, I'll be your great adventure
Tell ya friends I bent you, who sent you?
Must of been God, my bedroom angel taken
Loving the curves as you purr while I'm stroking
Grabbing ya hair, don't you dare shed a tear
You a good girl, don't cry
Shake that thing that I give
Throw ya back as I dig
Like a broke mattress you had me sprung out
But ain't nothing changed you got to get out

[Chorus]

To all my niggas that know what I mean
When you fuck a bitch good she don't want to leave
I go through this all the time
Bitch act like she don't see the exit sign
Start crying, how much she love Shyne
That's the same thing she told my man Brian
What the fuck, she think I'm stupid?
Don't know my ? blood is deeply rooted
Inherited, that be my heritage
That I don't give a fuck about bitch fetishes
So when we fuck and its over
Throw ya pocketbook on ya shoulder
Put your shoes on and hit the road
I'll kick ya last name once, bitch and roll

You know the time I was lovin'
Girl out of time, girl out of time
Girl out of time, girl out of time
I was lovin' you baby

Every little thing you said
didn't come from your heart
Now I'm laying out in my bed
Wondering what we are
Cause you never meant what you said
And you throw it all on my head
You made me believe, that you wanted me
You could've told the truth instead, baby

I don't know why 
Didn't realize
You took the time to pick me up
And let me down baby
Look in my eyes, you can't deny
That your the reason for the pain I feel inside

When I looked into your eyes
There was nothing I can see
Now I'm lost and can't find my way
Cause love has blinded me and Now 
I don't know what to do, nothing that have to prove
You played me for a fool, all the time I was lovin' you

Now the things were going
I knew I should've left back then
But my heart was steadily growing
Blaming, all the man I am
If you felt this way 
You should've showed it
You shouldn't ever took so long
Made it cleared, that you don't care
Where did I go wrong, baby?

I don't know why 
Didn't realize
You took the time to pick me up
And let me down baby
Look in my eyes, you can't deny
That your the reason for the pain I feel inside

[Chorus]

You said you loved me
But I'm lonely a'gain
It's gonna take time for me
Yes, you did, Yes you did
You could've told me
That you don't love me anymore
Somebody tell me why, baby

[Chorus]

Can't act like you didn't know
Didn't owe it all that time
But I can't blame you 
I should've known

I just sit and wonder why
Baby, what you did was dead wrong
Didn't have to lie

Are you looking for someone to do you right
I see you standing by yourself
And I heard you're stepping for somebody else
Came up to you

I Started off by saying beautiful
And then I saw
That you already had a man
Cause I noticed the ring on your hand

So I thought to myself slow it down, cause I don't want it to get the best of me
But I'm starting to get closer now, cause I'm feeling that this might be destiny
And I'm dancing with you although its wrong
And I cant help but notice you're feeling it
And there's really no use holding out, cause I know its that good love you need
I can give it to you baby

Me and you can make it work so easily, baby I can see it in the way you move

That have been stripped of their innocence
(she was daddy's little girl)
But no matter what,
They kept their head up,
And this is my way of saying thank you.
(all alone in the world)

Confused, and don't know what to think,
Cause she thought that she was

I was raised by women,
A women made me a man,
Its just to bad that a man,
Took her innocence.
And god knows that I,
I would finish him,
Diminish him,
End up killing him.
Blame it on the ignorance,
That's where her childhood went,
New country,
New language,
That's how seven years were spent.
Time you can't buy it,
And some lose 'em here
I know that we bumped heads,
Just know mum that I'm here.

Cuba peter pan,
The rebelution was crazy,
I wanna thank you mom,
For the way you raised me,
All your life you wanted
Only one thing,
And that was to say

Took care of me,
Just like a mother,
Till you got pregnant,
Then you was off to Georgia,
It was tough how we,
How we were brought up,
Tougher for you,
Cause you had no father,
Now I understand,
Now that I'm a man,
How much a woman needs,
Someone to call dad,
You cut through the pain,
You walked through the rain,
The game ain't playin' you,
Baby you play the game.
Now your in search of,
That father figure,
And if you find him,
He denies you,
Jenny fuck that nigga,
Karmas a bitch,
Even though I know she wish

Cause she thought that she was

This is for all the women that stayed strong,
And beat all the odds
(she was daddy's little girl)
The ones that have been raped,
The ones that grew up fatherless
(all alone in the world)
Oh ho
But still found a way to raise their kids,
To do the right thing

I love y'all

Tell me why you're here tonight
Are you looking for someone to do you right
I see you standing by yourself
And I heard you're stepping for somebody else
Came up to you
So I approached you on the wall
I Started off by saying beautiful
And then I saw
That you already had a man
Cause I noticed the ring on your hand

[Bridge: Slim]
So I thought to myself slow it down, cause I don't want it to get the best of me
But I'm starting to get closer now, cause I'm feeling that this might be destiny
And I'm dancing with you although its wrong
And I cant help but notice you're feeling it
And there's really no use holding out, cause I know its that good love you need
I can give it to you baby

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
If its good love you need, I give good lovin'
How its supposed to be, all night and it wont slow down
Its good love you need, I give good loving'
How its supposed to be, all night and it wont slow down

[Verse 2]
Imagine if you came with me, and imagine all the things that we can do
Me and you can make it work so easily, baby I can see it in the way you move
The way you move
I get it from the way you dip, from the way you're biting on your bottom lip
I know you want it
Cause even though you got a man, you're still taking me by the hand

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I got that good love
You ain't heard of me by now, well you should've
What you been under a rock or you're just outta touch
I know you work, go to school, and don't get out as much
So if you let me baby, I'ma let you whats good
A TV with HD wouldn't show as good 
I got that fogging up the windows in the back of Jeeps
Yeah I wake that thing up, and put it back to sleep
You put it back to sleep? That's what I said right?
They do it wrong baby come get your head right
And I think everybody know what Biggie said right?
If its right is on tonight like headlights
I don't slow down, not even for red lights
You cant stop this G double O D
We can both try to fight it like ??
But you need this Loso, in case you didn't know so
Slim take us outta here

Now I'm rolling down my tinted window
Is you coming or staying, I see you think about it girlfriend just surrender
You got a chance to make the right choice
I'm intelligent, got my money right, plus I got a nice voice
I can give you the right touch, the right place
You don't really need to be wifed up, hes lightweight
I wrote the right hook, and got you knocked out
I take you shopping, get iced up and rocked out
I know you like the picture, I'ma paint it for real
By the way I put it down slowly when I'm rolling with ya
They'll be looking for us, but well be under covers
On the journey from perfect strangers to secret lovers
Tell me all your stories, I'ma tell you mines
Ill even lie to you, tell you Ill leave the game behind
So you can feel good, but you know what it is
I'm only tryin' to get in and handle my business

Tells me what it used to be

I'm sorry 'cause I broke you down
Made you cry, girl, I apologize

Started throwing out your things to erase the memory
But it didn't work at all
Seeing our pictures in the frame, it's driving me insane

I thought I had a lot of partnas, but I've only got some
Since I can't depend on my niggaz, I put my faith up in my shotgun
Rolling around in my '78, reminiscing on the past
16 years old trying to get into Boomerang, smelling all our lil cash
Now it's like we never knew eachother, motherfuckers act strange
It's like they got intentions, on putting bullets up in my brain
Why they can't look me in my eyes no mo'
Even though I miss my T. Jones, at least mama ain't gotta to cry no mo'
I done seen my nigga get rich, leave the hood, make a lot of rich friends
But try to come back to the po' partnas, when all the richness end
Tell him to come watch me perform, but they don't go, and if I'm
Stranded and I need a ride, they say they coming but they don't show
Picture me walking down the feeter, everybody masking me up
Oh good it's that nigga from the hood, chunking a deuce passing me up
That's alright though, I gotta make a top flight hoe, smoking and thinking
When I get I want no nobody, but a Benjamin Franklin cause uh

[Hook - 2x]
Friends just ain't friends no more
Ain't no love, cause money is all we adore
Friends just ain't friends no more
I don't need you motherfuckers round me

[Cl'Che]
Most of these hoes say they your friend, but they really ain't down
Cause when you broke and got no ends, them same hoes don't come round
The main hoes that talk down, most friends turn to foes
That's just the way it go down, that's why I stay blowing pounds
Cause Mary Jane don't change she stay the same, help maintain
And ease the pain, stay free from the bullshit people bring
Cause the world is full of evil mayn
That's why I stay one deep, fuck these niggaz and these hoes
I be solo on my creep, no one in the passenger seat

[Den Den]
First he's riding high, now he busting Mack 10's
Watch you go from homie to foe, then try to come back again
There ain't no returning with the fuck shit, that's why I murder with one click
These fake ass G's I'm done with, selling my shit for one sill
But claiming you down to the ground bitch, bitch you ain't down with
Just another fake friend, trying to chop the Benz
Helping to plead my ends, looking for a win
Lying with a grin, trying to sneak back in

Remember back in '97, we was living it up
If they had it and we wanted it, they was giving it up
Through it wrong together, I think we wrote our first song together
Matter of fact, we smoked our first zone together
Look at you now oh you a rich nigga, thinking that you running thangs
But you ain't running a damn thang but your mouth, cause you's a bitch nigga
Going against the grain, cause you done made a lil change
But I can't flip the script want to get rich, I gotta remain the same
I had visions of us balling together, pulling up at the Past at New Orleans
Together, everyday all day shot calling together, but now I'm only rolling solo
Don't get it twisted I still got love for my niggaz, but I don't fuck with em no mo'
Cause everybody want me to do, what they want me to do
And they want me to do it, but I'd rather stay full of embalming fluid
But you know what you can do for me, give me a whole lot of leave me alone
Cause the only partna I got left, got 17 partnas of his own and uh

To a Muslim, turn a Buddhist to a Christian
Tell 'em catholic Ronnie been it
Sipping red wine inside the pentagon
Writing sinister lines till all the ink inside my pen is gone
Jeremy Lin got the world watching ESPN
My sick porno obsession got me watching these lesbians
Explain I'm a sick fucking psychotic master
The mic is my sword the booth is your casket
I'm sitting inside the classic 6 4 with the ratchet
Throwing up west side is my worst fucking habit
Only snap backs and egos eyes looking through peep holes
Is why I don't trust no one except God and Tim Tebow
Living my destiny poppin' pills high as fuck
Fucking bitches in the club holding my space bottle up
I think it's time you salute me or shoot me
Either way I'm the star of this motherfucking booth

They say I got a suicidal tendency murdering my enemies verse
It ain't no questioning thunder under my shirt
Fuck around and you'll be up under the dirt
This automatic will turn your home into a hearse
Worse case scenario pipe bound your burial
They gonna have to bury your twice
The scary cat on this night life
The golf stream vibing what the weed is top flight
My PO already know I'm a motherfucking flight risk
Heavy chain light risk pay cash for everything that white bitch
She got it, she got it, that's my words the oriental
Sixty two minutes they got it looking like murder all
I'm leaning hard in that flat back turbo charge
Coupe on twenty fours pedal to the floor
Hundred shots of that nigga still got plenty more

Blocked off the scene cause your scenes don't move me
Will turn your block into a motherfucking movie

Rap boy we were kids we were the Lord of the Rings
Rep in the full train smoke in solely green
I know other case burst scenes there's no more men of honor
I might made my super armor running from karma
The good die young no country for old men
There will be blood deeper than leviathan
And my platoon full of bad lieutenants
X-men, expendables, bad company, criminals
Crush goons with a kanga, surfing in the rainbow
48 hours to kill Bill, Cash and Tango
Brave heart, battleship, devil's out to kill with the
Passion of Christ, it's a wonderful life
Miami Vice what to get right
It's midnight in the garden the good and evil are crashing
Ordinary people, lethal weapon without 4 sequels
Above the hunger games
The gods must be crazy ricochet through the purple ring
Because the devil wears prada
The dead presidents can turn a goodfella to a godfather
Animal house, standing to live with the case speech
Leonardo DiCaprio on the beach
Oceans Eleven, if all dogs go to heaven
The silence of the lambs, son of sam 7, I am legend
Fuck this new jack city I'm on the midnight express
With this American History X

Off the dome and I'm talking slick as petroleum
Because I don't fuck with pens unless I'm rolling on some eulogium
Niggas preaching hate from Napoleon nigga slowly throwing salt on my game
Like fluorine or sodium on a door
But holy I'm only in it for the cash part
Thinking fuck the world something like a pornstar with a passport
With officer walking and my side mirror in
He don't like me cause I'm dark as an nigerian
Rocking alot of juries smart as a librarian
In the look in the american eyes said I'd bury him
I said it before don't ignore it again too
Hands on the 9 like you couldn't attend due
Life's a hooker the hall raised me
This poor baby was born crazy
Put in the middle of drug wars
Thug lord and judges tryin' to call case me
Lord save me it's gone Swayze the movie

Slim Da Mobster,"[Chorus]
Sometimes it all just come together, you know?
I put my city on my back, now
And push the haters in the background
Together we walk, but divided trough the struggle, we fall
Got my city on a map, now
That’s why I could never back down
Never back down, show ‘em through it all
You gotta stand tall

To all of my friends, enemies and affiliates
Burn the back wood, burn it back to your fingertips
Let the whole world recognize this accomplishment
You couldn’t have told me none of this back in ’96
The ability to crawl upon the bottom, this bitch
This is our time I’m spending mine up in this bitch
I still remember the very moment I was enlisted
I studied on the sadistic, gangster is worth the business
And when there’s blood in the streets from my brothers and sisters
They wanna debate on television about the victim
Right or wrong, Treyfa was my little man
I would take a chainsaw to z...? my man

[Chorus]

For all the moments I wasted on making others happy
Attack me, I’m bulletproof, tag me, I’ve seen the virus through
I never lied to you, still rolling with golden views
Spend every word and I mean it, mean it and I really buy to you
'Cause I'd rather be in hell than a jail cell
I’m hancock, superheroes lend me cocktails
I never feel, don’t try to patronize me
I learn, I’m painfully aware of everything in my surroundings
I am shaved, fully shining, never touched the silver lightning
The only cross that I bear is covered with some fucking diamonds
I hear my city calling, here come the jogging
Now are twelve hundred soldiers in the parking lot

[Chorus]

So, failure ain't an option
How do you think I made it out that corner apartment?
Turn my corner to my market, and now I target the same niggas
That taught on all that dumb shit
Because when the gun clicking
That bullet leaving can’t get that life back
Karma is a bitch and believe me, she’ll get it right back
They say that success is the best revenge
But who really wins if we all die in the end
If I had it all, then I probably wouldn’t pray the same
And the club that I come from sticks the debt with the pain
My name good in every corner in my city
You don’t believe me, then come fuck with me

[Chorus]",Stand Tall,2012

Slim Dusty,"There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around that the colt from Old Regret had got away
And had joined the wild bush horses, he was worth a thousand pounds, so all the cracks had gathered to the fray
All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far had mustered at the homestead overnight
For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are and the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight
 
There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup and the old man with his hair as white as snow
But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up, he would go wherever horse or man could go
And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand, no better horseman ever held the reins
For never horse could throw him while the saddle-girths would stand and he learnt to ride while droving on the plains
 
And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast, he was something like a racehorse undersized
With a touch of Timor pony, three parts thoroughbred at least and such as are by mountain horsemen prized
He was hard and tough and wiry, just the sort that won't say die, there was courage in his quick impatient tread
And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye and the proud and lofty carriage of his head
 
But still so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay and the old man said, that horse will never do
For a long and tiring gallop lad, you'd better stop away, those hills are far too rough for such as you
So he waited sad and wistful, only Clancy stood his friend, oh I think we ought to let him come, he said
And I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end, for both his horse and he are mountain bred
 
Oh he hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side, where the hills",The Man from Snowy River,1982
Slim Dusty,"It's lonesome away, from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night, where the wild dingoes call
But there's nothing so lonesome, so morbid or drear
Than to stand in a bar, of a pub with no beer 
Now the publicans anxious, for the quota to come 
There's a faraway look, on the face of the bum
The maids gone all cranky , and the cooks acting queer
What a terrible place, is a pub with no beer
Then the stockman rides up, with his dry dusty throat
He breasts up to the bar, pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on has face, quickly turns to a sneer
When the barman said sadly, the pubs got no beer
There's a dog on the v'randah, for his master he waits
But the boss is inside, drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover, and cringes with fear
Its no place for a dog, round a pub with no beer
Old Billy the blacksmith, first time in his life
Has gone home cold sober, to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen, she says your early my dear
But he breaks down and tells her, the pubs got no beer",A Pub With No Beer,1998

I still can't wait to see
What the next long country mile will bring

Well I've walked a mile or two-oo in my lifetime
And I've travelled down some muddy tracks and dry
'Cause if I wanted to get where I was go-oin'
I knew I'd just have to walk that country mile
Yes I knew I'd have to walk that country mile",Walk a Country Mile,2003
Slim Dusty,"Oh it's-a lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night we'll hear the wild dingoes call
But there's-a nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer

Now the publican's anxious for the quota to come
And there's a far away look on the face of the bum
The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer
Oh what a terrible place is a pub with no beer

Then the stockman rides up with his dry dusty throat
He breasts up to the bar and pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer
As the barman says sadly the pub's got no beer

Then the swaggie comes in smothered in dust and flies
He throws down his roll and rubs the sweat from his eyes
But when he is told, he says what's this I hear
I've trudged fifty flamin' miles to a pub with no beer

Now there's a dog on the v'randa, for his master he waits
But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover and he cringes in fear
It's no place for a dog 'round a pub with no beer

And old Billy the blacksmith, the first time in his life
Why he's gone home cold sober to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen, she says you're early Bill dear
But then he breaks down and tells her the pub's got no beer

Oh it's hard to believe that there's customers still
But the money's still tinkling in the old ancient till
The wine buffs are happy and I know they're sincere
When they say they don't care if the pub's got no beer

So it's-a lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night we'll hear the wild dingoes call
But there's-a nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear-a",A Pub with No Beer [1979 Version Radio Edit][Edit],2007
Slim Dusty,"Trumby was a ringer
A good one too at that
He could rake and ride a twister
Throw a rope and fancy plait
He could count a line a saddle
A man lost in the night
Trumby was a good boy but he couldn't read or write

Trumby was dependable
He never took to beer
The boss admired him so much
One day made him overseer
It never went to Trumby's head
He didn't boast or skite
Trumby was a good boy but he couldn't read or write.

The drought was on the country
The grass in short supply
The tanks were getting lower and the water holes near dry
Cattle started dying
And relief was not insight
To estimate the losses Trumby couldn't read or write.

He rode around the station pulling cattle from the bog
To save them being torn apart by eagles crows and dogs
He saw a notice on a tree 
It wasn't there last night
Trumby tried to understand but he couldn't read or write.

On bended knee down in the mud
Trumby had a drink
Swung the reigns and to his horse said ""We go home I think""
""Tell 'im boss about the sign, 'im read 'im good alright""
""One day boss's missus teach 'im Trumby read and write""

Well concern was felt for Trumby
He hadn't used his bed
Next day beside that muddy hole they found the ringer dead
And a piece of tin tied to a tree then caught the boss's eye
He read the words of 'Poison Here'
And signed by Dogger Bry

Now the stock had never used that hole along that stony creek
And Trumby's bag was empty
It has frayed and sprung a leak
The dogs were there in hundreds 
And the dogger in his plight
Told the boss he never knew poor Trumby couldn't read or write

Now Trumby was a ringer
As solid as a post
His skin was black but his heart was white and that's what mattered most
Sometimes I think how sad it is in this world with all its might
That a man like Trumby met his death because he couldn't read or write.

Couldn't read or write
Couldn't read or write",Trumby,2007

Loving the curves as you purr while I'm stroking
Grabbing ya hair, don't you dare shed a tear

Shake that thing that I give
Throw ya back as I dig
Like a broke mattress you had me sprung out
But ain't nothing changed you got to get out

When you fuck a bitch good she don't want to leave
I go through this all the time
Bitch act like she don't see the exit sign
Start crying, how much she love Shyne
That's the same thing she told my man Brian
What the fuck, she think I'm stupid?
Don't know my ? blood is deeply rooted
Inherited, that be my heritage
That I don't give a fuck about bitch fetishes

Throw ya pocketbook on ya shoulder
Put your shoes on and hit the road

And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
Stuck at Folsom Prison, time keep draggin' on
And the train keep a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was a baby, my mama told me
""Son, always be a good boy and don't ever play with gun""
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
When I hear the train a comin' I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folk eatin' in that fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' whiskey and smokin' big cigars
I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
But those people keep on movin' and that's what tortures me

Well, if they free me from this prison and the railroad train is mine
I'd move it on little farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I gonna stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle, oh, blow, blow my blues away

Yo - we went from nuttin to somethin, bein real and not frontin
No one was givin us nuttin so we resorted to gunnin
Growin up and we comin, up the ladder not bummin
Dodgin warrants and summons, from the cops we were runnin
Goin to school not for nuttin they teachin lies and assumptions
And they tell us keep comin, comin to school now for what? When
Comin back to a system that's whack and really not runnin
Oh I'm sorry it's runnin, it's not PROPERLY runnin
It's a conspiracy hear me man it's got to be somethin
I can get guns faster than I can get an english muffin

I'm givin to this hip-hop, my life is hip-hop
Culture, and y'all know that
Hip-Hop in the media, y'all know it's whack
But just like them dopefiends who keep comin back
Like the mayor of D.C., buyin Joey's crack
No disrespect to either one of them but look at that
Study the metaphors in this rap
We bigger than crack, but we keep buyin it
We bigger than rap, but we keep denyin it
Justice, equality, keep cryin it
But the only way to get it is to start applyin it

Talib, that's my bro, shows 'nuff respect
50 Cent that's my bro he shows 'nuff respect
Common! That's my bro he shows 'nuff respect
Snoop Dogg is my bro showed 'nuff respect
Dead Prez that's my peeps yo 'nuff respect
Cassidy's an MC who shows 'nuff respect
Hip-Hop is one, don't forget
I'm stickin with this

I'm livin for that hip-hop culture, shape it like a sculpture
Touch it why don'tcha, touch it why don'tcha
Hip-Hop is yours and mine and that's fine
But hip-hop's culture ain't about just crime
You caught up in the image and, don't know they rhymes
You caught up in they bodies and don't know they minds
So I'm, here to bring the truth in the place
Like don't think Common won't punch you in your face~!
And don't think Talib won't hold the heat
To stop the violence you gotta know your street
You gotta know who Tanga Reed is
Fat Joe's a leader, Busta Rhymes a preacher
KRS-One's a teacher
But through Cassidy my lessons are quicker to reach ya
We one community
I'm talkin about unity, in other words you and me
I'm with this

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony

Hoes when I hate but I don't need jack
Wear this money that's when I met

Bang and screw and drinking big mow
And space and getting that dough bro

Can't beat em now when they see me slide
Through the hood like I live there

Yellow diam in my wrist if this dark outside
Just a little bitch and I catch golds
Just a little kid from the ghetto
Never had shit but I got a little bit
When I got a couple hips under his belt
Thought the... n-gga I ain't try to builtin in
Ain't got a whole lot of money but I rob the money
I sip a whole lot of drink but I thug that money
That it was cool but it can't tell me nothing, no
Everybody take a n-gga locked up
Done curko so he blue up
From the h town world wide n-gga what's up

Big money swanging whips, cause we serve the most
We live by that G code, that's what gangstas do
On the grind stacking chips, with a gangsta crew
Down here sipping lean, that's that purple stuff
Staying thoed getting bucked, playas living it up
Game spitters riding big, is a habit y'all
Everything you dream about, we done had it y'all
We got money yellow hoes, wearing g-string clothes
Sport sweaters in the summer, cause our necks stay froze
Gripping grain having change, hanging low as your belt
If you want to be a man, go and get it yourself
Down here we do it all, break laws and ball
Ghetto stars for the cause, either stand or fall
We live it up cause we love it, playa deal with that
Tite getting it how I live, keep it real with that

Fin to put it all in why'all face

I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Check this out, it's going down over here
On the South, so I'm bout to come over
There on the North and scoop you up
We gotta put it down, boys ain't feel us in 9-9
With that Braids N' Fades, it's Y2K baby

See I'm a wide body roller, wood grain remote controller
Blades on Escalades, electric shocks on Range Rovers
Man the game over, when me and Slim pull up
You see us flossing on chrome, with the styrofoam cup
I got a eight and a liter, swanging on the feeter
In the Bentley watching BET, I'm tripping off of Cita
Cristal margaritas, we some block bleeders
My balling tire size, can't ride in two-seaters
Man I need Excursion, or my Navigator
My big body Denali, sqauatting like a Florida Gator
Tell them playa haters, E.S.G. I don't bar
50 cash and dash, like my name was Peter Warren
I parallel parked it, ghetto starts cost to Mars
Man my rims cost more, than some boys cars
Hit the Boulevard, with the nine on my lap-lap
Southside on the map-map, Screw tape tap-tap

[Slim Thug]
Now when I come down, I be throwing up the North shwoing off
Six gallons of gloss, on my 7-9 Boss
I floss the candy cream gleam, when I pull on the scene
My four 18's and screens, got my shit sitting mean
My drop top is a supreme, king of a young team's dream
Like a diamond it bling-bling, when it's hit with sun beams
Shoot more spiders in my ring, when I glide up the block
I got a trunk full of knock, about to bust air shocks
I'm shutting down the parking lot, when you see me ride
See me sitting high with pride, sliding on the buck hide
Looking pretty, on a tour all across my city
Sipping drank by the pint, about to bust my kidney
From the North to the South, we gon represent
I'm getting bent behind tint, pros by the air vent
I spent a lot of cash to shine, but it came in handy
Cause like a child, Slim Thug is so in love with candy huh

[E.S.G.]
Now when I come down, I be throwing up the South
Ice in our mouth, Wreckshop and Swishahouse

Looking laid in the 'Sacci, or the Gucci shades

[E.S.G.]
Candy red smash, syrup make you lean fast
19 with screens, playing Sega Dreamcast

[Slim Thug]
That candy blue or that green, gon keep our slab looking clean
Watching a movie on my screen, when I pull on the scene

[E.S.G.]
In the new Coupe, chunk the deuce out the hoo-doo
Taper fade playa made, Iceberg or FUBU

[Slim Thug]
And I splurge the Iceberg, and drink gallons of syrup
With a why-2G bird, valeted on the curb

[E.S.G. & Slim Thug]
See them boppers still bopping, them choppers still chopping
Them tops still dropping, the trunk still popping

I had to get what I was worth so I got it
Didn't have time to talk about it
Cause my dream than got spotted
You know me a raw dog hog ass nigga
Chasing my figures trying to get it mo bigger
Like having figures like jigga but I'm on my way
Cause when it comes to the green Slim Thug don't play

Twenty inches sitting on a six machine
Hop out super clean like Listerine
From my wrist and ring I'm glistening
And the way my chain glow u can't miss a thing.

You can lick my thing freak me in ways that sickening
They licking my ass til its blittering

Ass want to be E.S.G., kinky ass niggas man
Bring they hat to they motherfucking ass man
Let these hoes know how we do it down here

[Chorus: x2]
(Down here) ha we like to roll on dubs
(Down here) we keep a chicken head up in the club
(Down here) my thugs they get nothing but love
(Down here) we off the chain like you thought we was

I'm from the city of sippers, wood grain wheel grippers
Kilo shippers, candy coat car flippers
We ride 4's and vogues, with a mouth full of golds
Country niggas and hoes, down here is how we roll
When something's tight it's thoed, when we shine we hold
You got cash cars and clothes, you balling out of control
Switching lanes on swinging thangs, that's called swang and bang
The club packed from front to back, that club off the chain
You got candy rims and beat, then you got you a slab
You cooking chickens in the kitchen, boy you off in the lab
Boys that hustle they grind, and if your diamonds shine you blind
You making money looking good, then you showing your behind
You blow endo that's do-do, screwed up means slow mo
You ride big body Benz, you riding big body fo' do'
Fa sho though you know, how that Texas talk
I'm trying to stack my green, I mean fill up my vault

[Chorus: x2]

Down here playboy, the gumbo's hot and spicy
Twinkies twist and crawfish, my wrist all icy
Better watch your wifey, down here we off the hook
You was smart that, better back-back take a look
I'm from the city where crooks, wear Cardiers and Rolleys
In Texas we partnas, in Louisiana they whodies
But it's the same thing, on this side of the Mississippi
Two hundred dollas a bottle, ain't talking bout Crissy
Talking bout codeine, baby fill up my cup
2002 Escalade, Billy grill on my truck
Now hold up man, top down in the Bentley
With a bad chick, in my tape Monica Lewinsky
Made a mill independent, can't touch me kids
Split your wig then hire Cochran, like Puffy did
(fiesta) fiesta, like my name R. Kelly
I'm the boss see the cross, hanging off of our bellys

[Chorus: x2]

I can tell that you boys, got the wrong idea
We some slab riding gangstas, get a car every year
(Down here) we like to ball, play above the rim
E.S.G., the young Don and a thug named Slim
(down here) we tolerate no type of disrespect
Have a bitch acting bad, on that do' and that X
(Down here) we push 26 sitting low to the flo'
And double deuces on a truck, when I crawl by slow
(This year) I'm gonna switch it to the platinum frame
Do shows with plenty hoes, that be screaming my name
(Down here) it ain't no telling when you talking bout us
Got rocks in both ears, 'cause that shit is a must
(Down here) we break hearts and leave punks for dead
We don't claim the blue or red, 'cause our city is FED
(Down here) I'm better known as Lil' Keke the Don
Getting rich and going hard, to get it all for my son

Slim Thug,"Yeah, this what I do when I roll with a thug
Or a gangsta...

Put my hand on the gas, drop my ass low
Slide on fast, then we go slow
Blaze up the endo, raise up the window
That's the way thugs, and gangstas roll

Baby take my advice, I'll lead you right
You need a thug in your life, that can hit it all night
I'll make sure we live laid, and keep the bills paid
You ain't gotta work, just be my personal maid
I don't want much but a bad bitch, that cook and clean
While I'm out in these streets, trying to look for green

Boss Hoggs hit the scene, we finally made it
Now some women strip, and some uneducated
But thanks to having cake, we done got our breaks
Affiliated with the streets, lifestyle ain't fake
Don't hate congratulate, while we demonstrate pimping
I ain't racist but I love to fuck, our black women
E.S.G. and I'm winning, yeah the Boss man's back
Turning heads while I spread, through your shit like anthrax
Sit that ass fat, call E and Slim them
Peanut butter Gucci brims, on them keep-spinning rims

I'm rolling, with a thug and a gangsta
That's the kind of niggas, that I like
Talking bout a hustla, that keep his mind on thangs
He don't care what them hatas say, keeping it gangsta everyday

Come get a ski-taste, we on a paper chase
For a Jada Pinkett face, with a J-Lo shape
Trying to bought a FED case, so I'm shaking and moving
Got partnas that don't rap, what you think that they doing
Now money we pursuing, SES be shining
Slim go ahead, and I done swallowed a dime

Come ride with a thug now, you could let your guards down
Be yourself, you ain't gotta act when I'm around
See I ain't the jealous type, that like to bust and fight
Live your life, sweetheart you not my wife
I'm far from a gentleman, you feel what I'm saying
I'm a hard working hard man, nigga with plans
Understand I get around, and can't be held down
Fuck what I did last night, let's have fun now
I want a brown dime piece, that can roll a sweet
That's a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets

Put my hand on the gas, drop my ass low
Slide on fast, then we go slow
Blaze up the endo, raise up the window
That's the way thugs, and gangstas roll

Who say hood rats ain't fine, they done lost they mind
On a scale of one to ten, I done seen plenty nines

I like em high class with ass, Gucci down to the ground
When she pass, she make the whole crowd turn around

Real deal Cedric Hill, trying to make a mill
Give a woman ecstasy, without taking a pill

I want a gal caramel, that smell like Shanel
The kind of female, you put in your V-12

Yellow bones race up, but I reverse on dark
They like Free from BET's, 106 & Park

White, light skinned or dark, don't hate on the race
If she cute with a body, then she in the right place, come on",Rollin',2001

We gotta put it down, boys ain't feel us in 9-9

[E.S.G.]
See I'm a wide body roller, wood grain remote controller
Blades on Escalades, electric shocks on Range Rovers
Man the game over, when me and Slim pull up
You see us flossing on chrome, with the styrofoam cup
I got a eight and a liter, swanging on the feeter
In the Bentley watching BET, I'm tripping off of Cita
Cristal margaritas, we some block bleeders
My balling tire size, can't ride in two-seaters
Man I need Excursion, or my Navigator
My big body Denali, sqauatting like a Florida Gator
Tell them playa haters, E.S.G. I don't bar
50 cash and dash, like my name was Peter Warren
I parallel parked it, ghetto starts cost to Mars
Man my rims cost more, than some boys cars
Hit the Boulevard, with the nine on my lap-lap
Southside on the map-map, Screw tape tap-tap

[Hook]
[Slim Thug]
Now when I come down, I be throwing up the North shwoing off
Six gallons of gloss, on my 7-9 Boss
I floss the candy cream gleam, when I pull on the scene
My four 18's and screens, got my shit sitting mean
My drop top is a supreme, king of a young team's dream
Like a diamond it bling-bling, when it's hit with sun beams
Shoot more spiders in my ring, when I glide up the block
I got a trunk full of knock, about to bust air shocks
I'm shutting down the parking lot, when you see me ride
See me sitting high with pride, sliding on the buck hide
Looking pretty, on a tour all across my city
Sipping drank by the pint, about to bust my kidney
From the North to the South, we gon represent
I'm getting bent behind tint, pros by the air vent
I spent a lot of cash to shine, but it came in handy
Cause like a child, Slim Thug is so in love with candy huh

Now when I come down, I be throwing up the South
Ice in our mouth, Wreckshop and Swishahouse

Looking laid in the 'Sacci, or the Gucci shades

Candy red smash, syrup make you lean fast
19 with screens, playing Sega Dreamcast

[Slim Thug]
That candy blue or that green, gon keep our slab looking clean
Watching a movie on my screen, when I pull on the scene

[E.S.G.]
In the new Coupe, chunk the deuce out the hoo-doo
Taper fade playa made, Iceberg or FUBU

[Slim Thug]
And I splurge the Iceberg, and drink gallons of syrup
With a why-2G bird, valeted on the curb

See them boppers still bopping, them choppers still chopping
Them tops still dropping, the trunk still popping

Screens and neon lights gon show 
When my trunk unlock pop and show 
Ya already know 
Paint drippin off the door 
Not Engaged with no lady, fall in love with em no! 
You may think I'm crazy never knew this type of love before 
I'm love with my foreign, yes I'm married to my dough.... 
I'm in love with my money... mmmm

You can catch me squeezing grain 
Sittin crooked on D's and swangz 
Color changin lizard he's insane 
Ya womans missing then he's to blame 
Charge it to the game keep the change 
Most marriages blyossom and die... 
When its over I'm tellin her bye 
But she acts like I'm tellin a lie 
While you fallin in love with a she... 
I rather be dubblin a G 
Could you see me in a car that rhymes with rent me and starts with a be 
Could you see a Bentley 
Parked in the crunkest spot in ya hood 
Candy coat on top of the hood 
And my fist on top of the wood 
Sparkling good 
Say you ain't after my change I don't believe ya 
If a skeezer ask me to feed her 
With my visa then I'm gon leave her 
Koopa don't want ya koopa don't need ya 
{ But I Love You } that's sweet 
I rather be ridin on glass feet 
With leather up under my ass cheeks

Been actin like this since last week 
Better Ask P my money stretched like an athelete at a track meet 
Seen him last week in a Jag Jeep 
{ But they don't even make them yet 'causezin } 
Ok I'm lyin I don't know what it was 
But I swear that boi was sittin on buttons 
I know you want a relationship with a balla but no thanx Look

You must think this is a bank but it ain't 
Money increase and never would shink

You better respect the game 
See my gecko chain and correct ya brain 
I love my car like it was my girlfriend I like to carress the grain 
Followed the wheel and I got aroused 
Swung in the ditch and I wrecked the frame 
Broke up with my foreign car and fell in love with my cadillac 
The Ringling Brothers enquired to how my trunk turns flips like an acrobat 
I act a rat, 'cause I'm from the gutter 
Ya girl stutter when I pull up next to ya 
You been with the girl 6 months Paul Wall 
Is the reason she won't give sex to ya 
Why all that plex in ya 
'cause a german company made my rims 
My big body's pregant with twins I'm bout to induce a baby benz 
Ya car was fly in the hood but my candy paint just wet ya flames 
I'm sittin on 22 inch baby sitters babelous threatin ya name 
Forgot to change the diaper so when I crept in the lane I left a stain 
Everytime it rains, paint drips It makes a mess and I get the blame 
My TV's are the pet I train I can make em roll over and play dead 
My car was blue on the freeway 
But when I stopped at the light it changed to red 
You betta re arrange ya head thinkin I trick my cash to a broad... 
Go ahead and ask ya broad I got more green than the grass in a yard 
And that's so raw It ain't hard for me to get the class to applaud 
I shine like a blasting star, glass on a car more blacker than tar

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back

When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

I'm Mike Jones (who), Mike Jones Jones
That's been a baller, before I even grabbed a microphone
Swishahouse, Swishablast no more minimum wage
Independently paid, living lovely and laid
I never ever cheap talk, cause I got a platinum grill
I changed the game over, with Sprewells on my fifth wheel
My album Who Is Mike Jones, coming soon
My album Who Is Mike Jones, coming soon
Already, I pull up on Perellis with wood leather and grape jelly
T.V.'s falling down, watching DMX in Belly
Swishahouse Swishablast, we come first not last
Police pull me over, so they could play my Dreamcast
And my Xbox, I got stubborn rims
They keep going, even when I say stop (man)
Mike Jones in your ear, they gave me MVP
And this is just rookie year (Mike Jones)
Is a baller baby, shot caller baby
In the Lex having sex, twenties crawling baby
I stay balling, T.V.'s stay falling, 23's stay crawling
I'm the definition of balling playboy (man)

It's Magnificent, I'm acting bad with Slim and Mike
I'm that boy that you see, rolling them rims you like
I'm pimping dykes, either wearing Tim's or Nike's
Haters see I'm trying to shine, they want to dim my light
But can't do it, cause I shine too bright
(say man what kind of rims you got), whatever kind you like
And best believe, that twelve be in the trunk
Yo and if I'm in the Benz, it's a 12 with a V in the front
Wood grain, leather black seats
Magno with no cash flow, is like Luke without his gaped teeth
So forget, what my Porsche cost
Just realize I got enough do', to pay for R. Kelly's court costs

I played a lot of blocks, so my cash stack fast
I got a lot of rocks, and I ain't talking bout crack
Slim Thug's a high roller, and I ain't talking bout dice
See I got a lot of cars, and they ain't nothing nice
When it come to balling, I'm a vet in this shit
Every time I get a car, I'm wetting the bitch
Street rich young stunner, I don't play no games
I switch cars three times, and stay on swings
I'm respected, got the cost of a house on my necklace
That boy reckless, straight out of Texas
I ain't goin' talk about my Sprewells, why yall know I got em
I ain't goin' talk about my diamonds, cause I know why yall spot em
Why yall want to know what I claim, bitch read my piece
You want to know if we ball, bitch read my teeth
Ha, I'm Slim Thugger, that name ring bells
Everything Slim touch, guaranteed to sell, bitch I'm

Ain't you know we hit the do', 33 deep
And haters with plex, we put they whole block to sleep
Tre to the herb, stay with the syrup
Hitting the club, with big Burb's on the curb
Birds flying away, for fifteen-five a lick
Uncut, nigga the game is thick
With big ballas like me, DJ DMDeezie
Handcuff your broad, call the laws when you see me
Fa sheezie, we on the grind 25-8
And bitch ass niggaz, that get tossed out the state in the Dirty

This is how we do in the Dirty ha
Roll chrome twenty inch, blades in the Dirty ha
Candy paint dripping, Escalade in the Dirty ha
This is how we do the damn thang, in the Dirty ha
This is how we do in the Dirty ha
Get the thang crunk, down here in the Dirty ha
Act a damn fool, down here in the Dirty ha
Roll dime bows in the club, in the Dirty ha",Dirty,2003

Introducing from Houston, Slim Thug the Boss
The young Hogg out the North, that be running his mouth
Check my files, the Boss man do it G style
I live it write it, and spit it when I freestyle
I'm what them boys on the corner, pumping bumping
Or any hustler, trying to have something bumping
I keep the G's jumping, throwing up they set
And chicks and tricks in the club, po'ing up Moet
If you rich or broke, we gon ball tonight
From 10's to 24's, we goin' crawl tonight
Shot call tonight, you rolling with the Boss Hoggs
Everything free or V.I.P., with the Outlaws
So tell the bartenders, to put it on my tab
And tell the valet dude, to buck you right by my slab
And get what you can grab, from Grey Goose to Bacardi
I'm inviting the world, to my gangsta party

[Chorus: x8]
This for my gangsta niggas
This for my gangstas (jeah)

[Slim Thug]
I see the Northside thugs, G'd up on the wall
I see the Southside players, showing boys shake ball
I see the Eastside hustlers, pieced up thoed deck
I see the Westside G's, thoeing up they set
Ain't no plex, we all trying to take something home
It's three chicks to one, so no niggaz alone
Bunch of dime pieces in thongs, all on the dance flo'
Ain't no rules we all grown, baby anything go
What happened at the Hogg palace, stays at the palace
I got spots in every hot spot, from L.A. to Dallas
You can't miss me, it's my party you can't diss me
Turn off all your clocks people, let's make history
We gon drank till we faint, smoke till we choke
Dance till we can't baby, ball till you broke
I said drank till you faint, smoke till you choke
Dance till you can't baby, ball till you broke

[Chorus: x8]

[Slim Thug]
All the ballers getting green, get ya hands up (get ya hands up)
All the hustlers riding clean, get ya hands up (get ya hands up)
All the independent women, get ya hands up (get ya hands up)
All the chicks looking fly, get ya hands up (get ya hands up) [Repeat: x2]

If you smoke (smoke something)
If you drank (po' something)
If you ball (show something)
You got bank (blow something) [Repeat: x2]

I know you see me at the do', I'm in a Coupe on dubs
You in the lot, trying to pop it your hoop on hubs
You and your group at the club, trying to shoot your slugs
You think a nigga won't box you, or shoot your mug

I just came here to party baby, drank and roam blocks
Get a thicky thick chick, and get a quick dome shot
Got a sick chrome glock, and it cough at niggaz
I came here to fuck with women, I talk to niggaz

I'm here often nigga (doing what), buying the bar
Getting crunk with my click, might be eyeing a star
I see white eyeing a bar, while I sip my Belve
Walked over (grabbed her hand), and with her lips she tells me

(get thoed) hell yeah boo, I'm one of the ones
So I pull her close to me, hands under her buns
But it's one thing about her, I just got to know
If she cutting tonight shorty, then I got to go

This for them ballas in the back of the club
Niggaz that don't know, how to act in the club
And them 600's, and the them 'Lacs at the club

Get fucked up, chunk up your hood in the club

Now Daily pull up to the spot, at 12 o'clock on the dot
Looking for a chickenhead, bopper to bop
Twenty inches spinning slow, as I crawl in the lot
Gold diggers flag me down, trying to get me to stop

But oh no, a nigga recognized disguise
I looked past that thick ass, and them big ol' thighs
I'm A G, I peep game constantly
So tell me what the fuck, do you want from me

I'm at the bar, taking shots to the head
Trying to find a yellow bone, that give shots to the head
I see a fine looking dime, and she rocking some red
Spit a line and she mine, while she drop in my bed

It's guaranteed, to put a young bitch on her knees
Blue Boyz on the rise, with a mission to see

We party all night, till six in the morn' ha

[Slim Thug]
I'm V.I.P., in the back of the club
Slim Thee, they call me the best dressed thug
Your misses trying to get a Boss, kisses and hugs
But your misses get nothing, but diss and mugs

I don't give dick to chicks, that give it up to scrubs
Trying to find the finest bitch, up in the club
Make her up that thing, get in her ear
And fill her up, with game

Ten times out of ten, I'ma cut that thang
Got the broad giving up the brain, like it ain't nothing mayn
I'm a P-I-M-P, simple to me
And talk hoes out they clothes, so easily

I rock platinum rings, platinum piece and platinum car
And I'm bout to be, a platinum star
V.I.P. by the bar, is where you'll see me staying
With the Roley on my wrist, and the Crys in hand man

Slim Thug,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Slim Thug,"My life
My life, really feelin hard times

Lookin' out my window, holdin' my weapon like Malcolm X and
And it seems I'm over-stressin', feelin' like hatin' is your profession
And I know a couple Texans that got killed for over-reppin'
So I never be oversteppin' boundaries bounded to my weapon
When they ask me how I'm doin, I just tell 'em ""I'm doin' super""
I got a date with Destiny, allow me to introduce ya
Her little sister Fate told me I'm gon' be the future
And legacy's everything to a Martin Luther King Koopa
This recession is so pathetic, got me feelin' like I'm athletic
And success tryna get away from me and I ain't tryna let it
When they told that Pimp was gone, my reply was ""I don't get it""
And I'm still havin trouble believin' it happened the way they said it
Had to cut some partners off, swear to y'all it ain't my fault
I've been grown since I was seven and I was born to be a boss
But I know there's a bunch of haters tryna see me take a loss
So I be sleepin' with one eye open and put cameras in my vault
I've been thinkin' and gettin' deep and they tryna tell I been preachin'
But I know that they can't see how much of the world that I be reachin'
So stop reachin, stop leachin, I'm a fade 'em out like bleach and
In the spots where they can't get out to is the spots I visit frequent
Europe to UK and Germany, travellin' currently
Made so much in millions that I could cash out in eternity
Accustomed to hittin' customs with that duffle full of currency
When God created hustle, looked at the world and he inserted me, Koopa

[Chorus: x4]
I'm just livin' my life, so cold
In the streets so I'm takin' it slow

Uh, yeah
I'll tell you my story, I only speak the truth homie

It a terrible situation, throwed on the curb within the hands of time
But since I'm blistery breathing I guess a nigga livin' fine
I live a life that's filled with dramatistic people cryin'
And since the hood depend on me, they'll never lose a hand of mine (I gotcha)
I'm paralysis when it come to the good times, I'm used to the pain
Feelin' like a bum under the bridge, I'm so used to the rain
Anything I do is from the heart so it reflect my name
Forgive me for my sins father, I feel like I'm goin' insane
Media criticizing me for checking niggas, fuck it, oh well
I just wasn't raised a little pussy disrespected nigga
I'm tryna live on my own by the ways of a gangster
So every time I leave out I pray so I'm prayin' for a gangster
It's bad enough the world we livin in all about money
Since we runnin' out I choose to believe it ain't nothin funny
I've been stabbed in my back so much I deal with it
I'm tryna kick it with my life before heaven come chill with it

[Chorus: x4]

Last year was a hard one but life goes on
Thinkin' bout my nigga Pimp while I write this song
And the list goes on, all my niggas is gone
I'm tired of hearin' bad news, scared to pick up my phone
Got a call, my nigga Eddy died from Acres home
Just seen him at my video shoot, now that shit wrong
Kelvo, Arborea, even my girl Shantz
I just heard word she got stabbed to death today
Dear Lord, I pray that you take away the pain
From their family and their friends, please help us change
Still warm my niggas sleep dog, stessle and stank
My girl Dee Dee, they got me pourin' out my drank
It's fucked up, all my friends is dead or in the pen
Seem like soon as your life begin it's beginning to end
I'm frustrated, but you gotta smile, your time is dated
You never know when showin' your love might be related, ha ha

[Chorus: x4]",My Life,2003
Slim Thug,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge",Outro,2003
Slim Thug,"This is ghetto reality in Texas

You see I am what I am, and it is what it is 
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been 
Live what I live, see what I see 
So get out my ear, and just let me be 

I'm a survivor of the struggle, I lived life hard 
Single mama with half a job, I was raised by God 
No dad, the only role model I had 
Was a ounce of that white powder, in a Ziplock bag 
I don't brag about the struggles, I endured as a child 
You don't know the pain I went through, to create this smile 
I got one life to live, know I'm tal'n bout 
So I enjoy it, cause I earned everything that I got 
They hate what I got, I hear em with they cape talk 
They thinking that my life, was a cake walk 
I'm a man of principles, I live by my word 
So it's obscured, when I hear sour words 
They gon get what they deserve, but I don't wish no harm 
What goes around comes around, so partna you been warned 
In the midst of all the trouble, I still remain calm 
Cause sunny days, will follow the storm man, just let me be 

You see I am what I am, and it is what it is 
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been 
Live what I live, see what I see 
So get out my ear, and just let me be 

You see I am what I am, and it is what it is 
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been 
Live what I live, see what I see 
So get out my ear, and just let me be 

Somebody questioned, if I got the right to recite what I spit 
'Cause I've never been indicted, or divided a brick 
But my life is grit, all types of crisis and shit 
I decided to risk it all, to try to slide in the mix 
And get what I can get, see I'm fighting negative bars 
I knew it wouldn't be easy, but no one said it be hard 
As it is, I mean the evil in the heart of these men 
Got me wondering, if I'll ever see the reward 
At the end of the road, it's kind of hard to remember your goals 
When you grow where, not many live to get old 
I played the cards that I was given, and never listen to those

Hit a weenie nigga, with a combination flury
Left-right-right-left, overhand with a quitter
Make room in this bitch, when DSR enter
Headed straight to the bar, to get about a bub
After that hit VIP, and fire up some drugs
Tell judge they didn't pay the deposit, I ain't going up
Rapping is tailored for us, so the game I'm sewing up
Tum Tum and San T, Southside and the 3
Putting it down from Tayhouse, all the way to Mississippi
All the gangstas in the place, all the hustlers in the place
All the thugs in the place, put your hood in his face
I ain't scared of no nigga, I ain't scared of no bitch
I don't bar no squad, and I ain't afraid of no click
It's the million dollar man, I get it popping in this bitch
Better watch what you say, 'fore shit start dropping round this bitch

[Chorus: x2]

I'm a do something bad to ya, disrespect your set talk trash to ya
And if you get out of line, I'ma bring it quick fast to ya
Smash your head, in the concrete
And H-Town Stomp, your bitch ass to the beat
Till they see the white meat, for playing games with my gang
My Hoggs off the chain, they'll dance on your brain
In the middle of the club, like fuck it
The laws see me, and act like they ain't seen nothing
You niggas bluffing, talking hard acting like you want beef
But when I see you on the streets, you hollin' bout you want peace
One or one hundred deep, I'm crush you and them busters
Straight smash on you suckas, you punks don't wanna tussle
My nigga Tuck, say we ready to ride
The whole Southside Dallas, waiting on the Southside
H-Town to the D, we connect in the Tex'
D-S-R and Boss Hogg, don't bar no plex we'll tussle with ya

Top down at Maxi's wit a big glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade

With big ass and titties, on the scale a dime
But if I'm out of time, I might settle for a nine

I keep a all star team, that love to lick me clean

What would I be without this rap, without a mic life
Or will I die young, like my partna Mike like
Won't get to see my girl grow, and see what a wife's like
But my life's alright, no I ain't finished yet

I just started having money, I ain't got a chance to spend it yet

My ticket out this ghetto, is for me to write rhymes
I know I can get this money, if I write rhymes
Opportunity knocked for me, at the right time

Losing my faith, not listening to preachers and bull pits
God pulled my card quick, nope no more pain mayn

[Slim Thug]
I grew up around a bunch of gang bangers, and caine slangers
Stayed in danger, cause I played with strangers
Was born and raised by gangstas, taught by the hood
Proud of my block, everyday fought for the hood
Stand up kid, ain't too many did what I did
Saw half the shit I saw, or lived like I lived
When my mama went to work, my brother went to work
In the kitchen, pyrex shifting till it hurt
I watched him grind, fascinated by the cash
Patiently waiting, for my time to mash
Never tagged along, see I had my own gang
We had our own ideas, on how to get this change
We did our own thang, small time hustling
Some young niggaz, never asking for nothing
It ain't take us long, to peep what's going on
The broke niggaz was weak, while the rich was strong we got it on

By all means I had to get it, I'm a hustler black
This rap thing what I dreamed, don't want to fuck with crack
But damn, being broke I can't fuck with that
And being po' ain't what I hoped, so I hustled stack
Have nuts have money, that's the code in these streets
And when my money got low, I was holding the heat
I'm just a young nigga living, trying to sip and ball
And even though these streets wet, I can't slip and fall
I ran with killas pull triggas, up out they stacks fo'
And if they broke, they hitting your back do' with the Mackno
Fuck worrying bout haters, cause that'll freeze em up
That's what the heat is for, guaranteed to heat em up
These streets bad and yeah lil' daddy, from has-fect
A young nigga could lose his life, over a glass set
It'll take a cell in a jail, for us to do some mad thinking

You gotta know, that you can't take your life for granted
Cause it's a loaded game, out here on this lifeless planet
Smoke till my eyes get slanted, just to focus better
Thinking over pass times, when I wrote this letter
I just hope it gets better, for the future's sake
Trying not to make the mistakes, that I use to make
Been out in the streets, since the age of 17
And witnessed all type of bullshit, most have never seen
Damn near homeless, I slept on flo's slept in cars
Been through all kind of battles, nigga just check my scars
My backgrounds my resume, and my repitwa
That's why I walk the way I talk nigga, and wreck this hard

You either got it or you don't, and I refuse to choose

24/7-3/65, my time to hustle
I'd be a dealer out here, I got dimes and shuffles
Kyleon, is what really defines the hustle, just listen mayn

[Chorus: x2]

You need to quit talking so much, for a minute and hush
Stop trying to throw down boy, why you in such a rush
You play the game, as if you got a royal flush
But if you don't cool off, you just might get touched

I grind against the grain, and your brain like a crush
'Cause for me to get mine, is a plus and a must
But listen, hustling ain't for everybody
Especially if you ain't got the heart, and you's a scary body

Oh but I know, you don't hear me boy
It's goin' take something bad to happen, for you to feel me boy
But I'm so sick and tired, of teaching and preaching
You ain't even meet me half way, it's like I'm the only one that's reaching

While you keep leaching, you goin' find yourself smashed
Pumped up, wrecked and crashed
You must of forgot my nigger, your future's my past
You oughtta listen, 'fore you wind up on your ass

[Chorus: x2]

On how, I got this cash
I sold zones bled mics, moved rocks and hash
I click pro long, had to get on these blocks and mash
You want your do' long, try to hit these blocks and mash

Be careful though, you got niggers that watch your stash
And the second you slip get off his hip, goin' pop your ass
Get a connect cop a Tech, take your prize in the dash
We balling now, hit the lot put your ride on glass

You hard headed not heated, when you ride on glass
Left it at home, but you need it when you ride on glass
Knocked off your feet you looking weak, your boys slide on past
Had a high class bitch, now you collide with trash

Now you the hood rat plumber, pushing hood rat lil' mama
Laid up with the slut, and caught the high five from her
Now you lying like a plumber, sick broke and in drama
Should of listened",Listen,2004

Like it don't cost shit, that's why I'm Tha Boss bitch
Got a million worth of cars, bought a million dollar house
From making words rhyme out my million dollar mouth

You can see the watch gloss when you see Tha Boss walk
I keep my lips closed cause it cost when I talk
I'm so flashy, rims so glassy
Pull the dropper out, we gon show them boys nasty

Hood rats harrass me, I don't want the drama
They wanna get put up so they could be me baby mama
But I'm a chill, I'd rather work wood wheel
And throw them vogues and grills on candy automobiles

I'm still tipping on vogues, closing candy blue doors
From the old caddy coupe to the new blue Rolls
I'm from the hood living good, so I'm pimping

Let the ladies in here do what they gon do
Seem like my wrist been dipped in diamond fondue
It's not just me, my man got one too

I got my mind on cash and my grind on smash
Nowadays I gotta count my money by the bags
I done ran through the rags, now I get to see riches
Went from having rats to the superstar bitches

Used to never leave out them Northside blocks
Now I'm going to parties in Miami on yachts

Slim Thug,"That's right

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now, I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you see me now, a nigga pocket so swoll
They can't stand to see a young nigga home, ballin' outta control

Started out a little young nigga, 'bout 15
Tryin' to figure out ways to get big green
Had dreams of rock gleams, top down on the old school
'Cause the hustla's ridin' clean looked so cool

You know the rules, I got in where I fit in
Why not hit the block, all my other brothers did it
Had to get out there and get it on my own
'Cause when you turn 16, nowadays you grown

Mama did her best, 'cause I never missed a meal
But I'm tired of takin' money that shit needed for bills, you feel me?
I'm tryin' to take a little weight up off her back
So I'm takin' up the slack, thanks to feens wantin' crack

A 50 pack, to a half, to a whole
To be 15 nigga, my pockets on swoll', huh
I'm finally 'bout to get my chance to go pro
And let the city know Slim thug gettin' dough

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now, I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you see me now, a nigga pocket so swoll
They can't stand to see a young nigga home, ballin' outta control

Now I'm the one ridin' clean, just made 17
But I ain't' satisfied with the cash the block bring
And them law snatchin' niggas off the block every night
'Cause boys treatin' this shit 'cause it's a normal 9 to 5

Instead of trying to put their paper in a row
These niggas on the block hustlin' till they get caught
But a, my mama didn't ain't no fool
I had to chill for a minute and just focus on school

And if I wasn't in the hall gettin' ho's
I was chillin' wit' my niggas spittin' flows
Next thing you know I'm at the club doin' shows
And gettin' bank rolls when I step through the doors

My pussy rate at an all-time high
And ain't too much shit that I want I can't buy
I'm livin' good, everyday stay fly
I guess that's why the niggas in the hood say hi

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now, I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you see me now, a nigga pocket so swoll
They can't stand to see a young nigga home, ballin' outta control

Nowadays I'm a made man
And word is Slim Thug is a very well paid man
I'm Ray Banned up, top down, mashing
Lookin' in the rearview at the haters that I'm passin'

So please stop with them questions you askin'
I'm a hustla, I'ma stay smashing
Quarter million dollar cars, I'm livin' like a star
VIP with the bar, players buyin' out the bar

And even though a nigga didn't shoot hoops
I still found ways to make NBA loot
A young nigga got his pockets on swoll'
They can't stand to see a young nigga home, ballin' outta control

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now, I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car, you can't pass me
Haters can you see me now, a nigga pocket so swoll

I never seen Corn and Sha, look so alone

That day, it felt like the world came to a stop
We lost a major dude, one of our click team captains

I dedicate this to my niggaz gone

We had to wait crying, our dog a victim of a hate crime
These haters hate, cause he shined at all times
Seeing the way Sleep Dog ball, made a nigga chase paper
Remember the day you gave me your chain, at my show at The Maker
Get your shine on youngster, we love to see that
When I put candy on the Excursion, he loved to see that
We showed up, Sleep part of the reason I blowed up
When them haters saw how hard we ball, they fold up
He lived life to the fullest, everything to the extreme
Done so much, I think my nigga ran out of dreams
From cars clothes to hoes, competition is none

Slim Thug,"I love ya Miss Mary
I love ya Miss Mary
I love ya Miss Mary
This ain't a love song
This a thug song

I'm so in love with you Miss Mary (Miss Mary!)
I can't picture my life without you cause it gets scary (Gets scary!)
When I'm down I need you around in a hurry (In a hurry!)
And calm me down from my hard times and my worries (Miss Mary!)
I'll hold you close to me late at night
Face to face we meet and greet and everythangs iight
Ya nothing less then a dime when you in my sight
And through the dark days you know how to bring the light
I remember the first time I kissed ya
My first experience with love is when I finally hit ya
And I'm a thug but fuck it I ain't gon lie I miss ya
I wanna spend everyday of the rest of my life with ya
We break up to make up but we can't stay apart (No!)
It feel like forever when we spend a day apart (Fa show!)
So begging you to come back as I play my part (Oh!)
It's a shame how you just had your way with my heart
I love ya Miss Mary

And when we out in crowds, I still hold you like I'm proud
You make me feel like I'm in heavin walking on clouds
You stay fresh new tags I keep you with new bags
You make a nigga feel good I can't help but brag
And I know my so called friends trinna hit you whyle I'm gone
Play with you whyle I'm gone, split you whyle I'm gone
But you always stay faithfull cause this is ya home
And you know your man, I never treat you wrong
And my moms gets pissed off when I bring you around
She always hit us with, "" Ya'll get up out my house right now! ""
If she only knew how I was shacked up back when I was a kid
And how late nights I was sneaky went in and out of the crib
To my nose your scent is just as sweet as a rose
I wasn't impressed by them others so you the one I chose
To roll with, settle down and go with
I love you Miss Mary and I show it and make sure she knows it

You take away all my bad times
Put a smile on my face through my sad times
Been down with me way before I had shine
I feel like I owe you half the cash from my rhymes
(I wasn't gonna talk about this here man but uhhh)
I used to abuse ya and try to missuse ya
We exchanged a bunch of blows back when I was a loser
You used to trip when I sang won't no more seeds
I had enough stress on my life please believe
I lost a lot of paper when I moved you to Philly
Broke you off a bunch of green you had me trippin' but still we
Maintained to stick together through the ups and downs
And when I ain't have nobody else, you was around
It all worked out in the end you payed me back times ten
When I was broke on my ass you gave me cash to spend
And hit that highway with the pack of gin
And put me on my feet with the stacks of benze (Miss Mary)
I want you in my life 'till death do us part (Miss Mary)
Cause you've been down with a nigga from the start (Miss Mary)
You're the only thing that can claim my heart
Miss Mary Jane you deserve more fame for your art",Miss Mary,2005

Push weight and keep fate and the money that I make I'ma break

That's me, I'm a g, from the southside of the T
You and me, baby, let's get a room for the hour
Get high as a tower, bust a nut and hit the showers
You gone with the wind, after while it's on again
This time bring a friend, a couple corners we gone bend
Let's pretend that this sin, ain't even been committed
Once I split it then I hit it, you in love, go'on admit it
It's goin' down, yeah I'm talking to you
H-Town, smoked out jammin' Screw
Tell your crew it's '97, it ain't no refusin'
We got 'em to the bottom now they all lovin' Houston

It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
All these playas comin' up out that H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
Throw your hands in the air for that H-Town
It's goin' down, and they can't really see
Herschelwood my hood, this is Lil' to Keke

Reporter:
""Keke yours sure have been the Cinderella story
you've been shooting to the top of the bullet, but
how do you feel about the East Coast West Coast situation?""

Lil' Keke:
""You know, I'ma keep my comments about that, but
due to representation, it's Something About The Southside""",It's Goin Down,2005

This - is a Jazze Phazelle, Slim Thugga
Slim Thug! Collaborinzale!
Oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!

It's such an incredible feeling
In this past year I done made a few million
I tried to hide it, but ain't no concealing
Stacking my paper, up to the ceiling
(I pimp) pimping since pimping been pimping
Macking since macking been macking
Y'all niggaz talking, but me and my niggaz make it happen (I pimp)
Y'all niggaz talking, but me and my niggaz make it happen
Y'all niggaz talking, but me and my niggaz make it happen

Slim having major change man, and it ain't no secret
With them diamonds chains and rings, it ain't hard to peep it
You can catch me in the shopping mall, ridiculous bash
Check my restroom trash, all I do is pop tags (pop tags)
And drop rags off of show room floors
Fa sho, I change loads like ho's change clothes
The whole industry knows, how we roll down in texas
Phantom Rolls on 24s, rose gold diamond necklace
Slim shows and tell, so these ho's know me well
I been closing candy doors since Pac was in jail
Hell, I can't complain it's a beautiful feeling
From being broke on ya ass to having cash to the ceiling

I was a mill plus before this record deal stuff
You niggaz talking but we walking shit, for real wit us
They think we country and ain't up on game
Until they see them different colors in the Boss Hogg chain
Or the blue spray Bentley valeted outside of the club
Is that 50 or Jay-Z? naw baby it's Thug
And I ain't playing in no league, or on teams with Steve
I ain't get this from no settlement that I didn't receive
Please believe, the world ain't seen too many me's
I don't think the lord created a lot of these G's
Cause these days I just sit back enjoying the feeling
I was broke on my ass now my cash to the ceiling

Pimping ain't dead! these ho's just scared!
You see it everywhere, but it starts in ya head
Next comes the bread, shit's sweet like Jiffy
Used to do beats for a G, but now a nigga get fifty
It's my time to shine, hard times behind me (bling!)
Forty gold and platinum plaques! and still climbing
And if I lose money, then the paper come find me
Said I was through with rapping, till Sho Nuff signed me
Thank God for the change, cause errbody ain't able
Made a mill slanging beats, that's not including my label

Before you say it's cheaper to keep her
We consider and read her
Man, she might be the type that want P to feed her
She wants a little cheaper, a little margarita
Mane, them draws comin' off when she see the two-seater
So put your Porche up, (uh)
Get your divorce up, (uh)
I'm sure she'll sign it when she seen me put my doors up
Mane, them niggas only wanna mother-fucker here
She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill
The trunk is still, hopin' there's something between ya
Now she laughin' how she took your ass to the cleaners
Mane, I'm on your side, not tryna inconvient
Just know we got them mean keys in them plastic meaners
So keep it player dawg,
Don't make me say it, naw
Do something drastic, know that plastic heavy weighing, dawg
If it ain't music, or this money, I don't play at all
And she ain't either, so that means she doesn't weight at all

[Chorus]
Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane
And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane
Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane
Or you can scram cocksuck if you a hater mane
I keep 'em ladies going uh-uh-uh,

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I'm a grown mane, Thug ain't the one to play no games with ya
Thug the one to call and come get out the chain with ya
And hang with ya, when ya full of Patrone
And oh yeah, brang one of ya cute partnas along
Because I'm only 25, and still going live
I got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside
I wake up and gotta pick which car I'ma drive
The Doubble R 760, or the 645, I'm
Havin' thangs, mane, check out the chain
Money aint never been a thang
You see watch and the rang (the watch and the rang)
Rocks the nicest, never seen nuthin' like this
I'ma Boss I on' ask what it cost, my life priceless
Baby girl you might just
Get the shatter shine
Long as you not selfish or learn to share sometimes
And of course I'm still you'res and you're still mine
But you can't be a hater, mane
You gotta keep it playa, mane

They say JLo shouldn't show her ass and all
Knowin' the worst thing could happen is a nigga could palm
Now my angent sayin' the only way that he could be calm
I put a hundred mil on each song, like my name was LaBron (whaa)
Not the ice, my beat is worth more
Attractive like a whole damn Jacob store
See niggas hate you more when you take they broad
But his girl looked in my ear and seen her matrix door
Dude's is foolish, they hues us to chew us
I mean, the smirfs, the green, the rocks is so bluish
You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me
You ain't got no vibe, you can go and ask MiMi

A yo, for years I been buyin' my coke from the same cat
Dominican nigga who look black (that's right)
This summer I heard that (ha!)
I see me always swerve wit a (give it up!) where the bird at (yeah)
Apocalyptic, I pop biscuits (apocalypse), my bitch is topless
Not too excited I skeet skeet my own boxes
Drama King got the drama goods (bluh, bluh, bluh!)
Same place as the Domin' Osama Hood
Shoot up the thug and still puttin' the dame on it
The pimps had to give me a cup wit my name on it
I was ""Gordito""
I'm still Gordo or ""Gito""
Still know how to get the raw dough for cheap-o (cheap)
I'm lastin' all palm wit the connect of a ""perico"" (parakeet)
N.O.R.E. got no manners (no manners!)
I take a picture of ya ""culo"" wit the phone cameras
Go into ya own banners (ha!), they say my ballin' so hot like lone candles
And port or part of Santiago wit my own hammers (oh!)

[Jaheim] Believe me when I tell ya!
[Left Gunz] We drama kings nigga we don't play
[Jaheim] You don't want the drama

[Verse 2: Nature]
Nature, alright, the year 2000 and 4 the War Report (port)
Niggaz make it out the hood, it's a small reward (ward)
We all fucked up and mauled cause that's all we saw (alright)
Tryin' to rob from the the rich and let the poor get poor (poor)
Or rob the poor cause niggaz be the hungriest (my niggaz)
I'm on the Internet - catch me on your Buddy List (I'll be in trouble, ha!)
Catch me where the money is, megas and millions (megas)
And the barrel got the kick of 11 guerillas (shout!)
Seen niggaz get hit and lose a whole lot of blood (what?)
When a nigga legit, a nigga knowin' how to stunt (stunt)
Uptown, Downtown, go wherever he at (wherever he at)
Nigga make it implication, shit better be fat (shit better)
Nigga small talk, it's all talk - let it be that (let it be that)
I get pussy from my friends (pussy!) give my enemies clap (ha ha!)
You don't want me on ya block (you don't want me) niggaz better be strapped
So relax nigga

Far from the type of cat that pay a bitch's rent
I got a +Fox+ like +Vivica+ and never gave her +50 Cent+ (ha ha!)
And I bet you ain't ready for war yet (uh)
My niggaz got stripes, who walk around like the Barbershop Quartet? (ooh!)
It's no way to harm this nigga
I don't need no bitch to pump eye until my arms get bigger
Still a problem in this the rap game, problem in the street
Yo Slay, they havin' problems, we can solve em wit the heat

That's when ya whole shit splattered all across the front porch in momma crib
And wit a couple hot slugs get behind ya ribs (ooh!)

Then I switched up, posted on palleysay
The denali stay, smellin' like cali grade

Osama rich, that's the hard to find shirt
Ya rocks keep 2 they selves, well mines flirt
They 2 clean, board of health couldn't find dirt

So you couldn't judge me if you was holdon gavels

They goin' in June, it's comin' back with grand-daughters
So homie if you got a weapon tote it
You can't jump ship, niggas won't accept you boated
When I was doin' it 4 t.v, I kept it loaded
Cause these hatin' niggas try 2 find it and webisode it

OJ Simpson, you don't want it with me pimping
I'll stop pop the clip in, start pop until you dripping
Mayn you sucker niggaz tripping, Boss Hogg got it locked
You got a problem with that, I'll bring it to your block nigga

[Hook]

[Slim Thug]
You can't see me nigga, you can't be me nigga
You can buy till you broke, you can't beat me nigga
You can't buy real niggaz, real niggaz get raised
And fuck being broke, real niggaz get paid
I don't break under pressure, real niggaz stay brave
And stay chose by hoes, cause real niggaz got it made
I'm a H-Town nigga, stay down nigga
You small time, I'm a heavyweight pound nigga
Don't hate clown nigga, I got cake now nigga
While you sleep, them Hoggs still awake clown nigga
On great pine niggaz, working late clown nigga
I'm feeling you great, you better get it shape round nigga

You niggaz is really hustlin' wrong
You niggaz got your grind wrong, mayne

To sit back in the front of the class, nigga
Right over the blackboard

If you gon' get money, bitch

Now all my hustlers, grinders and ballers, open up your mind
A lot of niggaz hustlin' backwards, need to press rewind
There's some niggaz playin' dirty pool, bad Cali bandits
They crossin' up the Trill and man, ya boy just can't stand it

Motherfuckers need to be reprimanded and straight jacked
These boys is givin' the wrong niggaz out here respect
Break ya neck to fuck wit a nigga that compromise yo? hood
Yo? doin' shit you know it cool until the good

Got kids movin' work, hustlin' by the school
Using youngsters, they hits states, this whole shit on the cool
Matter fact, fuck the cool, you niggaz need to hear me
Breakin' bread with certified snitches, don't come near me

You niggaz givin' these canaries all these passes

Got yo? bitch lookin' mad while them Fingaz so full
I drank hard while you niggaz drank Bull
But the boy like Diddy fed, Bam got pulled

And I was taught to hold my own
Picture spider lock ya down, brother burna zone, nigga
Hell yeah, I'm bout dat, shirt slacks all black
Come through sunny side and leave yo' house flat

Yeah, I grind for the paper, fuck small towns, go major
Fuck a cell phones, goin' pagers

And every shot hit, I don't throw no grazer

A thousand-eight grams, enough to get yo? ass right
You smart wit it, get caught wit it, enough to get yo? ass life
From out here in these trenches
Ain't no fuckn' love or second chance
Small-time offender, lose yo? ass, you get enhanced

Speak not, keep yo' mouth shut, investigate the whole place
Make 'em think it's cool, follow that nigga round the whole day
The game ain't the same at all, changed for the worst
Nigga got the less time ?cause he came wit it first

See I disperse to dope, the most convicted felon, strictly G's
No more Glock shit, rock shit, strictly ki?s
I gets my paper, I was taught by older niggaz
Cold blooded killas, dope dealers, Sodom niggaz

I'm alert, I'm aware, I'm focused, I'm on top of shit
I show you how to stop that bitch
Get ig'nant wit this choppa bitch
Tomorrow ain't promised, snitch today, die tonight
We know your spot, me and my niggaz gon' ride tonight

I'm takin' back the streets, thang on the see
On parole but I'm cold wit the heat
Candy coated rock baller, twenty-chop crawler
Bitches tryna steal my dick, I ain't ?bout to call her

There's a lotta niggaz rappin', playin' games
I don't see none of the shit that you name
Where the car at? Where the bread at?
Where the girl you say that got that 'Five head' at?

Where the rocks at? Where the glocks at?
In yo' mind and on the mic, the only place it's at
That's my lifestyle you rappin' 'bout
I'm havin' everythin? you pussy niggaz yappin' 'bout

When you see some cocaine
You say you got it, nigga, bring me ten thangs
He gotta call his connect and shit
And he ain't got you co-na-vict nigga, I'm takin' my hood back

Niggaz gettin' knocked goin' fed and six months ya back?

Yeah Jay-z I'm callin you out, you suck, you hang out wit 50 cent 'cause you're not worth a dollar buck. And for chammillionaire you horrible and even worse, you similar to Jay-z's album, God gave me the GIFT, and gave you the CURSE.
