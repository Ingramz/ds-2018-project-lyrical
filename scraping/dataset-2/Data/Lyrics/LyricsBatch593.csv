Lewis Nash,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2000
Lewis Nash,"You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very
To ever be, to ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, tell you that you're marvelous
Tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words",Too Marvelous for Words,2001
Lewis Nash,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues [*],2002
Lewis Nash,"Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways
Just because you're caught in your social maze
I think it's 'bout time that you realize
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Educated lady with your college degree
Amazes me why you just can't see
Learned everything from your books on the shelf
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea, sweet thing
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Sophisticated lady take a lesson from me
I can help you be what you want to be
Together we'll see many brighter days
If it takes forever, gonna change your ways

Pretty lady, get back

Lewis Nash,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away.",After You've Gone,2007
Lewis Nash,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,2008
Lewis Parker,"For a long time I felt without style or grace
Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather
I knew my heart was in the right place
I knew I'd be able to do these things.

And as we watch him digging his own grave
It is important to know that was where he's at
He can't afford to stop
That is what he believe
He'll keep on digging for a thousand years.

I'm walking a line
I'm thinking about empty motion
I'm walking a line
Just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way
No time to begin
This isn't the time
So nothing was done
Not talking about
Not many at all
I'm turning around
No trouble at all
You notice there's nothing around you, around you
I'm walking a line
Divide and dissolve.

Never get to say much, never get to talk
Tell us a little bit, but not too much
Right about then, is where she give up
She has closed her eyes, she has give up hope

I'm walking a line
I hate to be dreaming in motion
I'm walking a line
Just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way
No time to begin
This isn't the time
So nothing was done
Not talking about
Not many at all
I'm turning around
No trouble at all
I'm keeping my fingers behind me, 'hind me
I'm walking a line
Divide and dissolve.

I turn myself around, I'm moving backwards and forwards
I'm moving twice as much as I was before
I'll keep on digging to the center of the Earth
I'll be down in there moving the in the room...

I'm walking a line
Visiting houses in motion
I'm walking a line
Just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way
No time to begin
This isn't the time
So nothing was done
Not talking about
Not many at all
I'm turning around
No trouble at all
Two different houses surround you, 'round you
I'm walking a line
Divide and dissolve.",Houses in Motion,1999
Lewis Porter,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,2007
Lewis Ross,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1990
Lewis Ross,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1990
Lewis Ross,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,1992
Lewis Ross,"Why should I feel discouraged?
And why should the shadows come?
Why should my heart be lonely
And long for Heaven and home?

When Jesus is my captain
My constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
Oh, His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
He watches me

",His Eye Is on the Sparrow,2007
Lewis Taylor,"(Did it again)

What am I supposed to do
To keep from goin' under?
Now you're making holes in my heart
And yes it's starting to show
I've been holding back
Is it any wonder?
Since you walked right into my life
And interrupted my flow

[Chorus]
And I wanna know
Baby when you're with me
Who do you think you're fooling?
Making me feel so sure
Turnin' your love light down again
Why don't you let me be?
You don't know what you're doing
Making me feel so sure
Turning your love light down again

(Did it again, did it again)

Baby I've got to know
Are we gonna make it?
Laying down beside me tonight
Do whatever you feel
Baby you're in control
Where you gonna take it?
Don't you think that I do you right?
You know darn well that I will

[Chorus]

Baby you turn the lovelight down
And I don't know
Just how long I can stick around
Girl I need more
And it ain't just easy girl
But I don't know what I can do
Cause I found
It ain't love this time around

Keep turning down your lovelight

Lewis Taylor,"(gotta get this message through yeah
What my mind is going through
Oh baby yeah, listen yeah
You got me reeling alright, alright yeah)

And don't you know it's you
Positively beautiful
And everything you do
Positively beautiful

Baby you know I never believed in anything
I was cold, nothing deep inside
Never shed any tears for nobody
I was weak if I was made to cry
(hey hey hey)
Do you remember? I know you do
Must've been a doggone fool
(hey hey hey)
Like a blind man I needed you
Somebody to help me through

I say it with my heart and soul that you move me

That I prided myself on my ability
To shut out my heart (ooh)
As I'm sure you was aware
Just from meeting me from the very start
(hey hey hey)
But you showed me you know you did
To open up my heart and say
(hey hey hey)
That I love you you know you did
I owe you more than I can say

I say it with my heart and soul that you move me

Don't you know it's you
Positively beautiful (oh yes you are)

Still in love with you
All this time, still be getting through
You're beautiful baby",Positively Beautiful,2004
Lewis Watson,"Even if I apologise
I know,
There's still a hill to climb
And I know,
That I'll never quite convince you

Even if I apologise
I know,
That's not enough sometimes
Although
It's all I have to give you

It's called a big mistake
It's called a bad choice made
Then comes the slippery slide
To no kiss goodbye

Even if I apologise
I know,
I got a hill to climb
And I know,
That I'll never quite convince you

Even if I apologise
I know,
That's not enough sometimes
Although
It's all I have to give you

And every thought of her
Makes my regret grow worse
And I'd smash the whole thing down
If I could turn it round

Even if I apologise
I know,
I got a hill to climb
And I know,
That I'll never quite convince you

Even if I apologise
I know,
That's not enough sometimes
Although
It's all I have to give you

So I'll just stand here broken
'cause I haven't had any sleep
And I'm forcing my eyes open
To see reality
And the colours that I'm made of
Are pouring out of me

But I can't run away
From a big mistake
No I can't run away
From a big mistake

Even if I apologise
I know,

Lewis Watson,"If you want, I could say your name
Hold our breath, so we'll feel again
I don't know if I could sacrifice, the weeks that I spent
Holding on by a single thread

But I've been spending all sleepless nights
On the floor
And now I don't even close my eyes
Anymore
And I don't want it to happen twice
Cause we've been here once before

It was you, said it all went wrong
Well we were just fine yesterday
Now today you're gone
But now in a second glance
You only need a second chance
But I can't
I'm afraid that I'm not that strong

But I've been spending all sleepless nights
On the floor
And now I don't even close my eyes
Anymore
And I don't want it to happen twice
Cause we've been here once before

Lewis Watson,"Sink or swim, hold your breath and just dive right in.
Ride the wave, just ride the wave far from where we came.
Don't be scared, who cares if we lose again'

Down and out, don't throw the towel we can win this race.

Lewis Watson,"I'm leaving you
Not sure if that's what I should do
It hurts so bad
I'm wanting you but can't go back

Trying for find, find
That, oh, illusive piece of mind
Stuck here, somehow
Shrouded beneath my fear
And I, I don't need it

I'm walking down this world alone
And I figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you
Is you, my love

And my head is in a cloud of rain
And the world it seems so far away
And I'm just waiting for the droplets
The drops

So you left a mark
And I wear it proudly on my chest
Above my heart
To remind me that I feel the best

When I'm with you
And everything is effortless
You know it's true
My eyes are painted with regret
And I don't need it

'Cause I'm wondering down this road alone
And I figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you
Is you, my love

'Cause my head is in a cloud of rain
And the world it seems so far away
And I'm just waiting for you to sink into your skin

You are like the raindrops, the raindrops
Falling down on me

Lewis Watson,"Take my hand and let go
I just want you to know
You're the only one that pulls me in
You changed everything

Like one small shaft of light
Flooding into my eyes
I will never see things just the same
But I'm not afraid

And all I have doesn't seem so significant
And at the drop of a hat, 
I could leave almost everything that I've ever known
So here we go

Step out into the wild
There's a beautiful storm in your eyes
We're perfectly intertwined
And if it's quite alright, you could be my way of life

Sea salt sits on your lips
Birds fall earthwards from cliffs
Thought I couldn't do this
But I'm fine 'cause you're by my side

And all I have, it doesn't seem so significant
And at the drop of a hat, 
My whole world's getting different
So here we go, off the road

Step out into the wild
There's a beautiful storm in your eyes
We're perfectly intertwined
And if it's quite alright, maybe it's time to

Step out into the wild
There's a beautiful storm in your eyes
We're perfectly intertwined
And if it's quite alright, you could be my way of life

And we take another step into the truly unknown
Don't know why but it's somewhere that we have to go
And it's dangerously wonderful
So come on, come on, come on, come on

Lewis Watson,"Well this ain't no home, it's hardly a house
And when you're not around, I'm hardly myself
You had to leave just like everyone else
I'll get on my knees

Taking shortcuts away from it all
Where am I heading? I'm still unsure
You said you'd catch me, or at least break my fall
But now you're gone, oh

Now I'm sat here, taking the blame
Maybe if I had said something different, 
Your mind would've changed
I couldn't have been more wrong, 
Because you left as soon as you came
You left as soon as you came

Close my eyes, wish you were here
I miss your presence, my dear
But now that you've gone, 

I can see crystal clear that I can't go on, no

Now I'm sat here, taking the blame
Maybe if I had said something different, 
Your mind would've changed
I couldn't have been more wrong, 
Because you left as soon as you came
You left as soon as you came

So that's that, there ain't nothing I can do, or say
Well, it's a long way back so I guess I'll be on my way
Am I three words too late and is it goodbye to me and us?
Whilst I love you and leave you, you just leave me to love

This ain't no home, it's hardly a house
And when you're not around, I'm hardly myself",#3 [Demo],2014
Lewis Watson,"Maybe you're lost,
Maybe you're scared
Maybe you're lonely
Or you haven't got there yet

You're falling apart,
Come away at the seams
Even when you're wide awake,
You're drowning in your dreams

It's a wonder you don't know,
How wonderful you are
So maybe I should show you now

That you have a halo
You have a halo
You have a halo
But maybe you don't know

You have a halo
You have a halo
You have a halo
But maybe you don't know

What is the use of just giving in?
You know that if you keep this up
You'll be more scars than skin

Maybe once in a while
I could help you
Because they say a problem shared
Is a problem cut in two

It's a wonder you don't know,
How wonderful you are
So maybe I should show you now

That you have a halo
You have a halo
You have a halo
But maybe you don't know",Halo,2014
Lewis Watson,"When I close my eyes, I hear you singing
Singing me a song
That I’ll forget, I always forget

I try to trick myself back to sleeping
You pick me up, but I let you down

It was so clear, but now it’s gone
I couldn’t keep my eyelids shut
Why can’t you stay
Stay, stay

If only I could dream, we could start again
If only I could dream, we could start again

When I close my eyes I see you dancing
Dancing me a song,
Just out of reach, just out of reach

I need you in a day when I’m not dreaming
You pick me up, I don’t wanna let you down

It was so clear, but now it’s gone
I couldn’t keep my eyelids shut
Why can’t you stay
Stay, stay

If only I could dream, we could start again
If only I could dream, we could start again

It was so clear, but now it’s gone
I couldn’t keep my eyelids shut

Lewis Watson,"Love had spiralled down
That sighing sound was too loud
War was breaking out
You found your crowd, and I turned round

Where did you go?
I looked away, and you were gone
You didn't say, where did you go?
I don't know

Where did you go?
I looked away, and you were gone
You didn't say, where did you go?
I don't know

When you pull back, pull back far enough
We are only stones around the sun
When you pull back, pull back far enough
We are only stones around the sun

Life came tumbling down
You know I tried, to fight my way out
Somewhere in this cloud
A piece of sky, I heard about

Where did you go?
I looked away, and you were gone
You didn't say, where did you go?
I don't know

Lewis Watson,"When your hair spills light on my shoulders
And your eyes wide emerald green
You are the love warm when it gets colder
The silver sunset onto the sea
And as the gray notes sing through the windows
Where do you go?
Why do you leave?
And as the waves grow
Harder the days go
Darling I'm folding
I'm on my knees

You give me nothing
When there's nothing else
So deep the water
But you're hiding in the shallows
Then you come running
When you're running out
So deep the water
So deep the water
And I'm left here drowning out

When your heart weighs down on my shoulders
And your eyes wide lose me at sea
and your words make a fire and smolder
You are the moon pulling tides over me
Giving me gray notes that sing through the windows
Where do you go?
Why do you leave?
And as the waves grow
Harder the days go
Darling I'm folding
I'm on my knees

You give me nothing
When there's nothing else
So deep the water
But you're hiding in the shallows
Then you come running
When you're running out
So deep the water 
So deep the water
And I'm left here drowning out

Losing light
Beneath the silent sky
We're losing light
Above the ocean wide
Losing light
I'm sinking slowly
As we're losing light my love

You give me nothing

Break down the wall if you don't flip frames
I'm new to you but I got practice at this
Every day it's an impression of Atlas
And the fact is, I never gave up, gave in, or tapped out
Got too much pride for that
And it's an uphill climb, I get so tired that I pass out
But I ain't slidin' back, I've
Lost hope, watched it come out of nothing
Heard a lot of talk, seen a lot of bluffing and
I learned somthin' man, every day I stay breathin'

Lexy & K-Paul,"There's no solution for any our problems
Our living room, just turns into a battlefield
I try to duck down but it feels like I'm falling
Losing round by the way you're shooting back at me

Why don't you see that I'm dying, see that I'm dying
Do you really want me, to die for you
Why don't you see that I'm dying, see that I'm dying
Do you really want me, to die for you?

And every word you say
Feels like a knife in my head, like a bullet in my back
You're just killing me
You're just killing me

And every word you say
Feels like a knife in my head, like a bullet in my back
You're just killing me
You're just killing me

This is how it started, and this is how it ends
It's getting quiet, I'm walking out the door
I'm so tired, no reason to pretend
We lost the fire, we froze into the core

Now I see that you're crying, see that you're crying
But it doesn't feel like you're crying over me
You would know that I'm lying, know that I'm lying
If I would tell you that I still believe

And every word you say
Feels like a knife in my head, like a bullet in my back
You're just killing me
You're just killing me

And every word you say
Feels like a knife in my head, like a bullet in my back

Cuando al fin la luz te llama
Abandonas tu palpitar
Cuando vuele con mis alas
Volaré hacia ti

el vacío en tu mirar
donde ardía aquel incendio

y que todo sea culpa
de mi estupidez.

She goes to the ball games and thinks the Yankees are fine
Why she reads Walter Winchell and understands every line
That's why the lady is a tramp, now
She likes do to go rowing down Central Park Lake
She digs a price fight, that isn't fake
Why she even goes to the opera, and stays wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp, now
I like the green grass, under my shoes
Now what can I lose
She's flat, and that's that
She's all alone when I lower my lamp

I wished for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind
In the warm sunshine
She's from the city of angels
Like Bette Davis, James Dean and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

Met her at a gala affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt outta place as she looked into my eyes
Shook her hand around 9pm and now
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never have to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams
Shoobie-do-wop and scooby snacks
Met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me
If they could only see me
At the risk of sounding cheesy
I think I fell for the girl on TV

Everybody knows her name
Want to take her picture and they're glad she came
But I just want to be there when she's down, down 
(Be there when she's down)
I don't want her autograph
I just want to call her up and make her laugh
Never had to be on the movie screen

Wondering where you are

Yeah, so I wished for you on a bright, shining star 
Everywhere I look, there you are
It's the girl in the green dress
She took my breath away
And now I look to the sky for the better day

Stop by in the summer
Do you remember?

Wear Abercrombie and Fitch

Met you one summer
And it all began
You're the best girl
That I ever did see
The great Larry Byrd, jersey thirty-three
When you take a sip
You buzz like a hornet

A whole bunch of sonnets
Call me when you miss me
'Cause I can't speak baby
Something in your eyes
Really drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you
And it makes me mad
You left one day
And never came back
Stayed all summer
Then went back home
Macualay Culkin wasn't home alone
Fell deep in love but
Now we ain't speaking
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton

Cherry pants Coke
Crushed rocks till I boogie
Used to hate school
So I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the b ball style
Known to act wild and
Make a girl smile
Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Remind me of you
Because you rock my world
You come from Georgia
Where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade
And speak real slow
You love hip-hop
And rock 'n' roll
Dad took off when
You were four years old
There was a good man
Named Paul Revere
I feel much better baby
When you're near
You love Fun Dip and Cherry Coke

Why we gotta argue all the time
You got your life and I got mine

Stop when the red lights flashes

Sippin on purple passion

I was at a party with my mind in the gutter
She walked in behind me with her friend and her brother
Stepped onto the dance floor shakin' her hips
I thought I might bust when she licked her lips 
Sometimes I wish I was someone like Brad Pitt
She'd walk right over to me and then say 
""Hey we should split"" 
Sometimes I wish I had a girlie that looked that fine 
Not thinking 'bout forever, just six minutes of her time

One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's got me on my knees
Five minutes and she's got me beggin' please
Another minute and she shows me somethin' new
I need six minutes with you, six minutes

I was at work with my mind in the gutter
She was in a magazine her face on the cover
Lying in a room that was lit by a candle 
That's the type of girl
That I wish that I could handle

'Cause in a crowded room would I be the one she would choose?
Sometimes I wish a girl like that could be mine

LFO,"Saw her on a Friday outside someones dance saloon
She was crying over someone that she felt love much too soon
I said: ""Hey girl don't you cry tonight, let me take you out on this town""
She looked at me and smiled as one last tear splashed of the ground
With half a wink she asked me ""What are you some kind of creep?""
I told her ""No I guess I just feel your vibe is kinda deep""
The moon hung over Soho and I counted 16 stars
I pointed at the brightest one and said ""Now that one's ours""

She's a dandelion up on her hill, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, hold on hold on hold on

I just might be poison but he took me to his roof top
He said ""Are you affraid of hights?"" I said ""No I am not""
He said ""Hey girl don't you lie to me, tell me everythin you feel""
We danced around in circles, he said ""I think we felt somethin real""

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, and I hold on hold on hold on

Down in Union Square I saw her walking all alone
I walked a little slower just so I remain unknown
She met someone on 17 think she knew him all to well
My little piece of heaven has a secret she won't tell
Without the smile she took his hand and then they walked away
I realised I wouldn't see my girl after today
I fell in love with a dandelion and she's all I ever had
At first she looked so sweet but in the end she tastes so bad

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, and I hold on hold on hold on
And I tell myself hold on hold on hold on, and hold on hold on hold on

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be

With some big expensive car

Would you give me just one chance

Because you rock my world
You come from Georgia
Where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade
And speak real slow
You love hip-hop
And rock 'n' roll

You were four years old
There was a good man
Named Paul Revere

Everything is side to side is alright
Listen, if we can't break the fool baby, act crazy, make waves like a pool, baby
Ooh maybe
We can shake the dawn breaks

Clap your hands

Let's take a little walk out in boston
You can teach them freak on landsdowne street
Around ten, lay low like brasco, let's spend a few tens
And I rhyme for you, do time for you
Calculate and carry out the perfect crime for you
Let me shine with you, true you won't regret it
But if it's not you than forget it

I don't want nobody else but you
Something bout those freaky things you do

It was a full moon in the beginnin' of March
'Bout the end of Winter '74
The gangsta was born, introduced to sinnin' and spinnin' women
Cats with big hats slammin' Cadillac doors
Who choosin' hoes, you losin' hoes, you niggaz loose witcha hoes
You motherfucker y'all ain't used to no hoes
Niggaz want to lojack, track your bitches, shack your bitches
I pimps up, smack my bitches
You want to fuck trick your bitches
I duck flip my bitches, get that cash with that extra ass bitch
Plus I keep a gat at arm reach 
You ain't no hustler youse a car thief, nigga where your car keys
Crack topic, back block it
Thirty-one long black top it, you can't stop it, gat top it
Black Mack, black glock it, blast rocket

Straight gangsta nigga, yeah
They call me, Hov' the hustler, dough doubler
Drove customers crazy in the late 80's, early 90's
Now you can find me, girlie behind me, holdin' my mink up
Ice pinkie ring in the air, drinkin' my drink up
Top down, 'dro in the air, blowin' that stink up
It's seldom that I smoke, but it helps my thinker
Makes me a mathematician about my math
Get celebrity ass, I'm a statistician, rap with precision
Nigga, your hoe chose Hov', that's rapid division
Now divide yourself and slide
I, young Vito, voice of the young people
Mouthpiece for hustlers, ventriloquist for jugglers
Took it where few went, made a few cents
Don't call me Hov' no more, call me The Blueprint

Bought Bentley's, bought 'em back, nigga can you buy that

Purpose of my son, raise him to do the same

Benz Coupes, Jags and trucks when we roll out
Man it ain't no lie, it's real as this four-five
And real as these five salaats, whether we Deen or not
Our kids gotta eat, red Beamer stops
Where your connects gotta meet, interrupt your cop
Dependin' on the dope size, we slide it from size
With hammers with hollows you feel we follow we're both risin
They killed your cousin you strapped and you won't ride and don't think cause I rap that I won't
Play O-Dog in Menace and drive-by men
Real gangsters keep a bitch in the wheel, workin' the gas tank
Hoes on the strip, bringin' that cash in

Ask me how I know, cause I'm a girl watcher!
[Big Daddy Kane]
Now I must admit that I'm a sensitive guy
cause I cried on Cooley High when Cochise died
But then again at times I may be a mean fellow
Cause I didn't give a damn about the dog Old Yeller
But I love my brother (and I love him back)
I wish people of the world could be like that
So shake shake why'all (shake why'all) shake why'all (shake why'all)

I'm just a teen titan, that does some mean fightin
against any sucker MC that's seen bitin
[Big Daddy Kane]
I been through Different World's, gave them all a try
Kadeem is my man, but Jasmine's not my Guy
I wonder if the Kane ever Dawns on Lewis
It's a sin to be bad, but somebody's gotta do it
[Little Daddy Shane]
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust (uh-huh)
I can make a nun feel the need for lust (true)
I can make a new car start to rust (uh-huh)
and outrun the dog on the Greyhound bus
[Big Daddy Kane]
For an MC to try to battle me freestylin
his mind must be somewhere in Fantasy Island
But I guarantee that by the time I'm through
I make him feel about the size of the midget Tattoo
Cause I love my brother (and I love him back)
And more people of the world should be like that
So swing swing why'all (swing why'all) swing why'all (swing why'all)
CHECK OUT HOW WE DO OUR THING why'ALL

[Little Daddy Shane]
Rhymes that I write generate much juice
Not like Dr. Seuss or even Mother Goose
They said I was a child, but then I hit em hard
Yeah it's good to send a boy to do a man's job
[Big Daddy Kane]
Well I'm the Biggest Daddy of the macks and dons
I keep a fleet of women, probably one of them's your moms
A voice so choice that my lips should be bronzed
You got ta give me thumbs up just like the Fonz
[Little Daddy Shane]
Well I'm a new jack from the new school, too cool
But some of the times I get bizarre (word?)
And grab the microphone and catch a spell from Melle Mel
and start to yell, BRRRRAHHHHH!
[Big Daddy Kane]
While I'm up on stage I feel that it's my duty
to do somethin fly, to make you shake your booty
Because I add the flavor just like an onion
The type of guy that grows on ya, just like a bunion
But I love you Shane (and I love you Kane)
That's somethin that the whole world needs to gain
So love love why'all (love why'all) love why'all (love why'all)

A bad mother..

Chill Shane, respect your elders 
My younger one, uhh, tall and yellow 
Aiyyo, I got you covered like an umbrella 

[Shane] 
Well, I got a little rap thing I want to breeze through 

[Kane] 
So may I release you? 

[Shane] 
Oh oh, please do 

[Kane] 
So Lil' Daddy, my ace, my brother 
Get on the mic and let's rock with one another 

[Shane] 
And, here comes the six foot four, the rough and raw 
To blow up the mic with rhymes you like 
I strike the stage in a rage and burn just like a twelve gauge 
Shotgun, 'cause son, the Shane is not the one 
The noise bringer, humdinger, funky rhyme stinger 
Bring your girl to my show and I'ma swing her 
The Lil' Daddy got it down pat, yeah 
I'm like the name Heavy D, I sound fat 
Word for word, line for line, uh
I gets mine and show I'm poetically inclined 
If rap was made by (?) then redeemed because 
You ain't got no ice cream 
So take a seat in the rear 
Don't dare to compare, cause I swear, you gets nothin here 
The way you see me knock out the next brother 
You'd think my moms had a talk with LL's mother, huh 
Aiy-yi-yi-yah, momma Mia 
Man I burn the next MC like gonorrhea 
Knock the boots on a girl named Althea 
Then pull her friend by the name of Maria 

[Kane] 
Well I got a little rap thing I want to breeze through 

[Shane] 
So may I release you? 

[Kane] 
Oh oh, please do 

[Shane] 
So Big Daddy, my ace, my brother 
Get on the mic, and let's rap with one another 

[Kane] 
When I grab the microphone and shout 
You gotta spread out, spread out, spread out, spread out 
I'm ready to rip it apart, I hit em with one of the rhymes 
I'm rough in a flash, trash, bash, crash, smash slash mash 
Run for shelter, no one can help ya 
You pushed up on a heavyweight, 
When your rhymes are welterweight that's right, 
Wait, because you're not fitted 
You're never gonna get it, never gonna get it 
Uhh, I'm what you call a rap legend 
And definitely the last MC to be present 
Don't even try to take mines 
You fuckin new jack, you still got price tags on your rhymes 
Yo what's that sayin that Hammer says uhh 
U Can't Touch This, just like a pimple yo I'ma bust this 
I'm like Steven Segall, ""Out for Justice""
As for competition, pssh, what's this? 
You're not prepared to, rappers are scared too 
Confront this, 'cause you know damn well you don't want this 
Some good advice is just break out 
Before I treat you like a fast food restaurant and take-out 
As soon as I see the microphone yo I'ma, seize that 
Squeeze that, a battle, you better, freeze that 
Cause if you go through the Wrath of Kane, uhh 
Not even Lisa Fisher can ease the pain, so 

[Kane] Brother man, brother.. man 
[Shane] Uh-huh, brother man, brother.. man 
[Kane] Yo, brother man, brother mega-man, uhh!

With the whole Wolf Pack in the place to be. 
Better known as the Chocolate City. 
So Scoob Lover, huh, are ya with me...? 


[Scoob Lover:]
Yo, I break punks up like a fight. Give me the mic, I'm hype. 
(Damn kid, you're starvin' for life) 
'Cause people be tellin' me, brothers be gellin' me, 
Tryin' to get fame from my name but they chumps and they but soft. 
They know I'm wilder than a dog with hot sauce. 
A mic, a stage, a crowd, and I won't stop: 
I set it off and get live like an alarm clock. 
People thought Scoob and Scrap was just a nickname; 
Now that we rap, we sell more records than cocaine. 
Awww, shucks, now I'm back from the down-low, 
Here comes Scoob with the curly afro. 
No chemical reaction, no need for askin', pure satisfaction, 
My last name's Jackson. 
You slip up, I get ill - my boot to your grill, 
My nine kills, I'm Big Scoob from Brownsville.

Who's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!)
Who's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!)

Scrap Lover are ya with me? 

[Scrap Lover:]
Yo, I drop science kinda like a pigeon
Over rough tracks I tax any midget with a small digit. 
Smooth and mild but complicated, 
I put the crowd to to smashed like a driver that's intoxicated. 
Rappers write rhymes, and talk about guns and jail, 
But wouldn't squeeze a lemon in a cocktail. 
Don't say ""huh?"" or ""what?"", and don't ask who, 
'Cause if you hear me, I must be talkin' to you. 
You probably thought I couldn't steal it, 'cause I was a dancer, 
I didn't have a chance, but ya'll can kill it. 
You gotta be off your rocker, 
I'm lettin' suckers know that Scrap got more soul than Foot Locker. 
And if you heard I got skills, believe it's true; 
Suggest for Pete Rock, for reminiscin' over you. 
It's not a threat, it's a bet, 'cause hey, 
The last sucker who tried woulda been 25 today. 

[Chorus x3] 

Big Daddy are ya with me? 

[Big Daddy Kane:]
Yo-yo-yo-yo, look out, get out the way! 
Here comes the K the A the N the E - huh, ya better flee. 
'Cause I don't need no hoodie to be hard, shoot: 
I'll kill a nigga in a three-piece suit. 
I don't be havin' it so the rear I'll attack, 
A size-15 to the buttocks, a-matter-fact. 
A hard-core blow to the face I'll provide, 
To give you a Crooked eye, just like St. Ides. 
Leave you home and you must be screamin' and yellin'; 
Not even cool Moe Dee shades can hide your swellin'. 
I bring it rough, tough; 
I said that I was Browner than Bobby, so you know that it's good enough. 
I'm untouchable to rappers my size. 
You dreamed of beatin' me, you better wake up an apologize. 
Some claim to be a Daddy or Poppa, 
But with me, you'd have no Ranks if your name was Shabba. 

[Chorus x3] 

Now you know you'd too like to be with it... 

[Li'l Daddy Shane:]
Shane, I cause pain, I make it rain. 
I'm wearin' and tearin' down to the last grain. 
Ha, I'm not a chocolate brother, but I don't' mourn, 
'Cause I swear this vanilla kid got it goin' on. 
So don't even step to me if you're worth nothin', 
Because I just might hurt somethin'. 
My competition thinks twice, 'cause yo, for a young nigga, I'm kinda nice...

Got no fixed abode, with nomads I am numbered.
Country lanes and byways were always my ways;
I've never fancied bein' longer.


Oh, we knew the woods and the restin' places;
And the small birds sang when winter days were over.
Then we'd pack our load and be on the road
Those were good old days for a rover.


There was open ground where a man could linger
For a week or two, for time was not our master.
Then away you'd jog with your horse and dog,
Nice and easy, no need to go faster.


Well, I've known life hard and I've known it easy;
And I've cursed the life when winter's days were dawning;
But I've laughed and sung through the whole night long;
Seen the summer sunrise in the morning.


All you freeborn men of the travelin' people
Every tinker, rolling stone, or gypsy rover;
Winds of change are blowin', old ways are going;
Your travelin' days will soon be over.
Your travelin' days will soon be over.

and they both sat down together, love, to hear the nightingale sing.  
Then out of his knapsack he drew a fine fiddle.  
And he played her such merry tunes that you ever did hear. 
And he played her such merry tunes that the valleys did ring. 
""Oh"",softly cried the fair maide,""hear the Nightingale sing.""

""Now I'm off to India for several long years,"" 
""Drinkin' Wine and strong whiskey instead of pale beer."" 
""But if ever I return again, it will be in the spring,"" 
""And we'll both sit down together,Love, to hear the Nightingale sing.

""Oh"",then said the fair maide,""won't you merry me?"" 
""Oh no"", said the soldier, ""however can that be?"" 
""For I've me own wife at home in the old country,"" 
""And she is the fairest little thing that you ever did see.""

Liam Clancy,"While in  the merry month of May from me home I started,
Left the girls of Tuam so sad and broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born,
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;
Bought a pair of brogues rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

Well the boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in,
With a load ""hurray !"" joined in the affray.
We quitely cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down
the rocky road and all the way to Dublin,
Whack follol de rah !",The Rocky Road to Dublin,1965
Liam Clancy,"He was stranded in a tiny town on Fair Prince Edward's Island
Waiting for a ship to come and find him
A one horse place, a friendly face
Some coffee and a tiny trace of fiddling in the distance far behind him
A dime across the counter there, a shy hello, a brand new friend
And a walk along the street in wintry weather
A yellow light, and open door
A welcome friend there's room for more
And then they're standing there inside together
He said, ""I've heard that tune before somewhere 
But I can't remember when
Was it on some other friendly shore, or did I hear it on the wind?
Was it written on the sky above, think I heard it from someone I loved
I never heard a sound so sweet since then""

And now his feet begin to tap, a little boy says, ""I'll take your hat""
And he's caught up in the magic of her smile
Leap, the heart inside him went, and off across the floor he sent
His clumsy body graceful as a child
He said, ""There's magic in the fiddler's arm, and there's magic in this town
There's magic in the dancers' feet and the way they put them down 
People smiling everywhere, boots and ribbons, locks of hair
And laughter and old blue suits and Easter gowns

The sailor's gone, the room is bare, the old piano's sitting there
Someone's hat's left hanging on the rack
Empty chairs and the wooden floor, that feels the touch of shoes no more
A waiting for the dancers to come back
The fiddle's in the closet of some daughter of the town
The strings are broke, the bow is gone, and the cover's buttoned down
But sometimes on December nights, when the air is cold and the wind is right
There's a melody that passes through the town",Ballad of St. Anne's Reel,1986
Liam Clancy,"Oh, me name is Dick Darby, I'm a cobbler
I served my time at ould camp
Some call me an old agitator
But now I'm resolved to repent

With me ing-twing of an ing-thing of an i-doe
With me ing-twing of an ing-thing of an i-day
With me roo-boo-boo roo-boo-boo randy
And me lab stone keeps beating away

Now, my father was hung for sheep stealing
My mother was burned for a witch
My sister's a dandy house-keeper
And I'm a mechanical switch

It's forty long years I have traveled
All by the contents of me pack
Me hammers, me awls and me pinchers
I carry them all on me back

Oh, my wife she is humpy, she's lumpy
Me wife she's the devil, she's cracked
And no matter what I may do with her
Her tongue, it goes clickety-clack

It was early one fine summer's morning
A little before it was day
I dipped her three times in the river
And carelessly bade her ""Good day""",The Cobbler,1986
Liam Clancy,"Inch by inch, row by row,
Gonna make this garden grow,
All it takes is a rake and a hoe,
And a piece of fertile ground.

Inch by inch, row by row,
Someone bless these seeds I sow,
Someone warm them from below,
'Till the rain comes tumblin' down.

Pullin' weeds and pickin' stones,
Man is made of dreams and bones,
Feel the need to grow my own,
'Cause the time is close at hand.

Grain for grain, sun and rain,
Find my way in Nature's chain,
Tune my body and my brain
To the music from the land.

Plant your rows straight and long,
Temper them with prayer and song,
Mother Earth will make you strong
If you give her loving care.

From his perch in yonder tree,
In my garden I'm as free
As that feathered thief up there.",The Garden Song,1986
Liam Clancy,"I am a little beggarman and begging I have been
For three score or more in this little isle of green
I'm known from the Liffey down to Segue
And I'm known by the name of old Johnny Dhu
Of all the trade's that's going, sure begging is the best
For when a man is tired, he can sit down and rest
He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
Only cut around the corner with his old rig-a-doo

I slept in the barn, down at Caurabawn
A wet night came on and I slept 'till the dawn
With holes in the roof and the rain coming through
And the rats and the cats, they were playing peek-a-boo
When who did I waken but the woman of the house
With her white spotty apron and her calico blouse
She began to frighten and I said ""boo
Aarah, don't be afraid mam it's only Johnny Dhu""

I met a little flaxy-haired girl one day
""Good morning little flaxy-haired girl"" I did say
""Good morning little beggarman, a how do you do
With your rags and you tags and you old rig-a-doo""
I'll buy a pair of leggings, a collar and a tie
And a nice young lady I'll fetch by and by
I'll buy a pair of goggles and I'll colour them blue
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too

Over the road with my pack on my back
Over the fields with my great heavy sack
With holes in my shoes and my toes peeping through
Singing skinny-me-rink a doodle o and old Johnny Dhu
I must be going to bed for it's getting late at night
The fire's all raked and out goes the light
So now you've heard the story of my old rig-a-doo
It's good-bye and God be with you says old Johnny Dhu",Little Beggarman,1991
Liam Clancy,"At the end of the day, 
I like a little drink 
To raise up me voice and sing 
And an hour or two with a fine, 
Brown brew and I'm ready for anything
At the Cross Keys Inn 
There were sisters four, 
The landlord's daughters fair
And every night when 
They'd turn out the light 
I would tiptoe up the stair...singin' 

[Chorus:]
One for the morning glory, 
Two for the early dew
Three for the man who will stand his round
And four for the love of you, me girl, 
Four for the love of you

I got the call from a foreign shore 
To go and fight the foe 
And I thought no more 
Of the sisters four, 
But still I was sad to go
I sailed away on a ship, 
The Morning Glory was her name
And we'd all fall down 
When the rum went 'round, 
Then get up and start again

[Chorus]

I bore once more for 
My native shore, 
Farewell to the raging seas
And the Cross Keys Inn, 
It was beckonin', 
And me heart was filled with glee
For there on the shore 
Were the sisters four 
With a bundle upon each knee
There were three little girls 
And a bouncing boy, 
And they all looked just like me... 

[Chorus]",Morning Glory,1992
Liam Clancy,"In Yarmouth town there lived a man
He had a little tavern by the strand
And the landlord had a daughter fair
Pretty little thing with golden hair 

[Chorus:]
Won't you come down
Won't you come down
Won't you come down to Yarmouth town 

One night there came a sailor man
He asked the daughter for her hand
Well I won't marry you she said
I have all I want without being wed 


[Chorus 2x]

But if with me you'd like to linger
I'll tie some string all around my finger
As you walk by, pull on my string
I'll come down and let you in 

[Chorus 2x]

Well the very next day at closing time
The sailor man goes off to the strand
And as he walks by pulls on that string
And she came down and let him right in 

[Chorus 2x]

Well he's never such a sight before
A string on her finger was all she wore 

[Chorus 2x]

So all you men who to Yarmouth go
If ya see those girls with their hair hung low
All ya gotta do is pull their strings
And they'll come down and let you right in

Liam Clancy,"The Lowlands of Holland
The love that I have chosen was to my heart's content.
The salt sea shall be frozen before that I repent.
Repent it I shall never until the day I die
But the lowlands of Holland have parted my love and I.
The very night we got married and lay upon our bed
A pressgang came to my bedside and stood at my bedhead
Saying, Arise arise you new married man and come along with me,
To the lowlands of Holland to face your (fight the) enemy.
But Holland is a cold place, a place where grows no green
But Holland is a cold place for my love to wander in *
Though money had been so plentiful as leaves grow on the tree
Yet before I'd time to turn myself my love was stolen from me
Be still, be still, my daughter what makes you to lament
Is there ne'er a lad in our town can give your heart content?
There's lads enough in our town but ne'er a one for me
For I never had but one true love and he was pressed from me
*or (It's a wild inhabitation for my true love to be in)
There shall no mantle cross my back, no comb go through my hair
No firelight nor candlelight shall ease my heart's despair
And I will never married be until the day I die
For the lowlands of Holland have parted my love and me

I've spent it in good company

And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
If I had money enough to spend
And leisure to sit awhile

That sorely has my heart beguiled

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled

They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had

And the boat that we boarded will 
Unboard us all
There we will part to our homes we return

Liam Neeson,"The hammering from the pit and the pounding of guns grew louder. My fear rose at the sound of someone creeping into the house. Then I saw it was a young artilleryman, weary, streaked with blood and dirt.

      Artilleryman: Anyone here?
      Journalist: Come in. Here, drink this.
      Artilleryman: Thank you.
      Journalist: What's happened?
      Artilleryman: They wiped us out. Hundreds dead, maybe thousands.
      Journalist: The heat ray?
      Artilleryman: The Martians. They were inside the hoods of machines they'd made, massive metal things on legs. Giant machines that walked. They attacked us. They wiped us out.
      Journalist: Machines?
      Artilleryman: Fighting machines, picking up men and bashing them against trees. Just hunks of metal, but they knew exactly what they were doing.
      Journalist: Hmm. There was another cylinder came last night.
      Artilleryman: Yes. Yes, it looked bound for London.

London! Carrie! I hadn't dreamed there could be danger to Carrie and her father, so many miles away.

      Journalist: I must go to London at once.
      Artilleryman: And me, got to report to headquarters, if there's anything left of it.

At Byfleet, we came upon an inn, but it was deserted.

      Artilleryman: Is everybody dead?
      Journalist: Not everybody, look... 

Six cannons with gunners standing by.

      Artilleryman: Bows and arrows against the lightning.
      Journalist: Hmm.
      Artilleryman: They haven't seen the heat ray yet. 

We hurried along the road to Weybridge. Suddenly, there was a heavy explosion and gusts of smoke erupted into the air.

      Artilleryman: Look! There they are! What did I tell you!

Quickly, one after the other, four of the fighting machines appeared. Monstrous tripods, higher than the tallest steeple, striding over the pine trees and smashing them, walking tripods of glittering metal. Each carried a huge funnel and I realized with horror that I'd seen this awful thing before.
A fifth machine appeared on the far bank. It raised itself to full height, flourished the funnel high in the air, and the ghostly terrible heat ray struck the town.
As it struck, all five fighting machines exulted, emitting deafening howls which roared like thunder:

      Martians: Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla!

The six guns we had seen now fired simultaneously, decapitating a fighting machine. The Martian inside the hood was slain, splashed to the four winds, and the body, nothing now but an intricate device of metal, went whirling to destruction. As the other monsters advanced, people ran away blindly, the artilleryman among them, but I jumped into the water and hid until forced up to breathe. Now the guns spoke again, but this time the heat ray sent them to oblivion.
With a white flash the heat ray swept across the river. Scalded, half blinded and agonized, I staggered through leaping, hissing water towards the shore. I fell in full sight of the Martians, expecting nothing but death. The foot of a fighting machine came down close to my head, then lifted again as the four Martians carried away the debris of their fallen comrade, and I realized that by a miracle, I had escaped.

Liam Neeson,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

Brave New World

      Artilleryman
      Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
      Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start... we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP! Our turn to do some wiping out! WHOOSH! With our heat ray! Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game, man on top again!

      Artilleryman
      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,
      And out of the confusion a chance has come at last,
      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people life alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      And it's going to have to start with me and you... YES!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people left alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      Yes and we will have to be the chosen few...

      Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies,
      And imagine the destruction of all that you despise,
      Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men
      We'll start all over again!

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

Liam Neeson,"The torment was ended
The people scattered over the country
desperate, leaderless, starved
the thousands who had fled by sea 
including the one most dear to me
all would return the pulse of life 
growing stronger and stronger would beat again

As life returns to normal, 
the question of another attack from Mars 
causes universal concern
Is our planet safe? 
or is this time of peace merely a reprieve? 
It may be that across the immensity of space, 
they have learned their lessons
and even now await their opportunity
Perhaps the future belongs not to us
but to the Martians","Epilogue, Pt. 1",2012
Liam Neeson,"For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, 
The homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. 
All that was of value to me was in London. 
By the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone.

Forever Autumn

Journalist
The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,
The winter winds will be much colder,
Now you're not here.

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear,
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here.
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here 

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. 
The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

Journalist
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on the breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn,
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, 
More and more people joined the painful exodus. 
Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, 
Their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. 

Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, 
And here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, 
Cutting through bridges as though they were paper. 
Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

Ulla! 

Never before in the history of the world, 
Had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. 
This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, 
Without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong. 

It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.
A vast crowd buffeted me towards the already packed steamer. 
I looked up enviously at those safely on board... straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie. 
At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. 
At that very moment, it was raised, 
And I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

Liam Neeson,"It seems totally incredible to me now that everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other. From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. It all seemed so safe and tranquil.
Next morning a crowd gathered on the common, hypnotized by the unscrewing of the cylinder. Two feet of shining screw projected when suddenly, the lid fell off. Two luminous, disk-like eyes appeared above the rim. A huge rounded bulk, larger than a bear, rose up slowly, glistening like wet leather. Its lipless mouth quivered and slathered, and snakelike tentacles writhed as the clumsy body heaved and pulsated.
A few young men crept closer to the pit. A tall funnel rose and an invisible ray of heat leapt from man to man, and there was a bright glare as each was instantly turned to fire. Every tree and bush became a mass of flames at the touch of this savage, unearthly heat.
People clawed their way off the common, and I ran too. I felt I was being toyed with, that when I was on the very verge of safety this mysterious death would leap after me and strike me down. At last I reached Maybury Hill, and in the dim coolness of my home I wrote an account for my newspaper before I sank into a restless, haunted sleep.
I awoke to alien sounds of hammering from the pit and hurried to the railway station to buy the paper. Around me, the daily routine of life, working eating, sleeping, was continuing serenely as it had for countless years. On Horsell Common, the Martians continued hammering and stirring, sleepless, indefatigable, at work on the machines they were making. Now and again a light like the beam of a warship's searchlight would sweep the common, and the heat ray was ready to follow.
In the afternoon, a company of soldiers came through and deployed along the common to form a cordon.
That evening, there was a violent crash and I realized with horror that my home was within reach of the heat ray.
At dawn, a falling star with a trail of green mist landed with a flash like summer lightning. This was the second cylinder.",Horsell Common and the Heat Ray,2012
Liam Neeson,"It's looking good, it's going good
We're getting great pictures
Hhere at NASA Control, Pasadena
The landing craft touched down on Mars
Twenty eight kilometers from the aim point

We're looking at a remarkable landscape
Littered with different kinds of rocks
Red, purple, how 'bout that, Bermuda?

Fantastic, look at the dune field

Hey, wait. I'm getting a no go signal
Now I'm losing on of the craft
Hey, Bermuda, you getting it?

No, I lost contact
There's a lot of dust blowing up there
Now I've lost the second craft
We got problems
All contact lost, Pasadena
Maybe the antenna's

What's that flare? A green flare, coming from Mars
Kind of a green mist behind it
It's getting closer, you see it, Bermuda?
Come in, Bermuda, Houston, come in, what's going on?

Tracking station 43, Canberra, come in, Canberra
Tracking station 63, can you hear me, Madrid?
Can anybody hear me? Come in, come in

","The Red Weed, Pt. 2",2012
Liam Neeson,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

As time passed in our dark and dusty prison
The Parson wrestled endlessly with his doubts
His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him",The Spirit of Man,2012
Liam Neeson,"There were ships of shapes and sizes
Scatter out along the bay
And I thought I heard her calling
As the steamer pulled away
The Invaders must have seen them
As across the coast they filed
Standing firm between them
There lay Thunder Child

Moving swiftly through the waters
Cannons blazing as she came
Brought a might metal war-lord
Crashing down in sheets of flame

Sensing victory was nearing
Thinking fortune must have smiled
People started cheering
""Come on Thunder Child""
""Come on Thunder Child""

The Martians released their black smoke, but the ship sped on, 
Cutting down one of the tripod figures 
Instantly, the others raised their Heat Rays 
And melted the Thunder Child's valiant heart

Lashing ropes and smashing timbers
Flashing Heat Rays pierced the deck
Dashing hopes for our deliverance
As we watched the sinking wreck
With the smoke of battle clearing
Over graves in waves defiled
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child!
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child! [Repeat x 2]

When the smoke had cleared, the little steamer had reached the misty horizon, 
And Carrie was safe
But the Thunder Child had vanished forever, 
Taking with her man's last hope of victory
The leaden sky was lit by green flashes, cylinder following cylinder, 
And no one and nothing was left now to fight them
The Earth belong to the Martians.

Ulla!",Thunder Child,2012
Liam Neeson,"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century 
That human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space 
No one could have dreamed that we were being scrutinized
As someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water
Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets 
And yet, across the gulf of space
Minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this Earth with envious eyes
And slowly and surely
They drew their plans against us

At midnight, on the 12th of August
A huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth
Across two hundred million miles of void 
Invisibly hurtling towards us
Came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth

As I watched, there was another jet of gas
It was another missile, starting on its way

And that's how it was for the next ten nights
A flare, spurting out from Mars
Bright green, drawing a green mist behind it
A beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight 
Ogilvy, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger
He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote
Forbidding planet

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Then came the night the first missile approached Earth 
It was thought to be an ordinary falling star
But next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the common
And Ogilvy came to examine what lay there

A cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot 
With faint sounds of movement coming from within 
Suddenly the top began moving, rotating, unscrewing
And Ogilvy feared there was a man inside trying to escape 
He rushed to the cylinder but the intense heat stopped him
Before he could burn himself on the metal

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Yes, the chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

To soak up all the bright light
To turn myself on
Just to try and feel alright

I didn't want to meet you there
I didn't think I had to
I just didn't want to see your face
And now I’m thinking ‘bout you

Every night I lie awake
Everything's about you now

You could be the one who loves me
You could be the one who moves me
You could be the one who holds me tight

You could be the one who loves me
You could be the one who moves me
You could be the one who makes it right, hold me tight

I feel like dancing
Even though my feet are in the past
I feel like laughing
Even though my heart is overcast

Waiting on forever
Been standing ‘round these streets
I've been waiting here, to get it right
Now I'm thinking ‘bout you

Every corner that I turn
Everything's about you now

You could be the one who loves me
You could be the one who moves me
You could be the one who holds me tight

You could be the one who loves me
You could be the one who moves me
You could be the one who makes it right

You know it when it hits you, yeah
All this waiting is driving me crazy

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Quand la lune change de quartier
Dans sa robe vermeille
Elle nous glisse des mots de passe à l'oreille

Ailleurs au fin fond du sommeil
On aperçoit des trésors démons et des merveilles

Des solutions données à nos problèmes

Et les plages de sucre roux brûlantes au soleil
Et les traces que je suis pas à pas
Pour sortir du tunnel

Qui ne parle que de toi, et toi qui m'ensorcelle

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

Would I wander through this wonderland alone

My hat from my glove

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

Liberace,"'Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hopes that St. Nicholas would soon be there

The children were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads
And mama in her kerchief and I in my cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
Away to the window I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash

The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
Gave a luster of midday to objects below
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer

With a little old driver so lively and quick
I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came
And he whistled and shouted and called them by name

Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer and Vixen
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
Now dash away, dash away, dash away all

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky
So up to the house top the coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too

And then in a twinkle I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof
As I drew in my head and was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack

His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim 'ere he drove out of sight
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night

",'Twas the Night Before Christmas,1996

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And then in a twinkle I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof
As I drew in my head and was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack

His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim 'ere he drove out of sight
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night

que pobladas de recuerdos
encadenen mi sonar

Pero el viajero que huye
tarde o temprano
detiene su andar

Y aunque el olvido
que todo destruye
haya matado mi vieja ilusion

guardo escondida
una esperanza humilde
que es toda la fortuna
de mi corazon

Volver
con la frente marchita
las nieves del tiempo
platearon mi sien

Sentir
que es un soplo la vida
que veinte anos no es nada
que febril la mirada
errante en las sombras
te busca y te nombra

Vivir
con el alma aferrada
a un dulce recuerdo
que lloro otra vez",Volver,1997
Libertine,"Here I come 
My mind is set 
Get ready for love 
You're my ten second pet 

Touch my gun 
But don't pull my trigger

In the elevator 
Or lock the door 
Shine my pistol some more 
Here I cum 
Just ten seconds more

Ten seconds to love 
Ten seconds to love 
Pull my trigger 
My guns loaded with your love 

Ten seconds to love 
Ten seconds to love 
Just wait honey 
Till I tell the boys about you 

Bring a girlfriend 
Maybe bring two 

I got my camera 
Make a star outta you 
Let's inject it 
Photograph it 
Down to the subway 
Let the boys have it

Reach down low 
Slide it in real slow 
I want to hear your engines roar 
Before I'm in the door

Do you want some more 
I got one more shot 
Before I'm out the door

this dope shit done got a lot of my niggas 

taken out the game 

And to my brother Kevin Miller  rest in peace fool 



Verse 1 



Growing up in the Calliope  New Orleans to be exact g 

I had to pack a gat I thought somebody was out to kill me 

I'm paranoid I toss and turn in my sleep g 

My best friend done turned into my motherfucking enemy 

19 years old gold fronts and a mean mug 

I hooked up with my little cousin Jimmy 

learned to slang drugs 

A lot of shit done changed in my fucking neighborhood 

This fast cash got the P living no good 

I'm deep up in this shit and ain't no turning back 

Me and my cousin ?? say I got him for a fucking sack 

I told him check his bitch, but he didn't here me though 

He didn't believe that his bitch was out smoking dope 

Now I gotta stand on my own 2 

I came in this world by myself 

that's the way I'm gone die fool 

One year later and my cousin doing life on a case 

I moved to Richmond California just to fucking get away 

Bumped into my partner King from New Orleans 

He couldn't find a job and I'm back to slanging amphetamines 

And everything was cool for a fucking while g 

Til I went to this club and this fool tried me 

We in the back with some bitches counting hundreds 

Til these suckers walked up and said jack 

these niggas from the country 

We didn't have no gats, I had to make a g move 

Connects and head butting, that's how I did this fool 

King G hit this boy with a upper cut 

30 days in the county, but we didn't give a fuck 



(Chorus) 



Anything goes 

Life's a trip, but that's how the game goes 



Hood riding, homicide 4 deep with them gats cocked 

Ready to put some fools on they back 



1, 2, 3 a nigga slanging keys 

but why you have to mess with P 



Hood riding, homicide 4 deep with them gats cocked 

Ready to put some fools on they biggety back 



Verse 2 



Released from the county on a PO 

The only way to get back on my feet is slang that diggety dope 

Hooked up with my partner, my cutty mac 

Two days later I'm back rolling motherfucking black 

Lexus coup with a droptop Benz 

And in the glove compartment you'll find about 33,000 ends 

I ain't tripping cause the game get deep though 

Got a phone call, couldn't sleep bro 

They say my little brother died back in New Orleans 

Pop pop boom and it killed him, here him scream 

But I ain't tripping cause mama still here a cry 

In Richmond one day the P is gonna die 

And if I do I guess I'm going out like a g though 

Like the movie on the motherfucking Untouchables 

So when I go out, I know I'm fucking living wrong

I've played around but I want something more 
Not gonna pressure you to let me know

I need some time so I can think things through 
But not tonight, not with you

Licking your lips cause it taste so sweet
I'll make your day, I'll make your whole damn week

Gimme a feeling like I've never known
No limitations you can make your own
And when it's over don't look over your shoulder
Get up and go?..
Pick me up on every innuendo
Play me like the new nintendo
When you're done, it's around we go
Back to the start

Load me up pull the trigger just like a pistol
And then? there goes the whistle
It's all over now

I just want to go...all night long

I just want to be with you
Won't ask you any questions
Don't care where you take me to
Just don't make me your possession
No matter what goes down tonight
We'll go our separate ways by the mornin' light
But till then you gotta do me right
But I don't need, don't need

You know exactly what to do

Talkin' in the warm sunshine

I think I lost myself right then
Never wanted to be found again no

Summer's over, clouds appear and all that's left
Are memories
The sands of time rush by oh

Can't even believe that this has been 
More than a daydream
In the silence as the waves crash
We can run from our uncertainties

There's only you and I
As the dawn is breaking and the darknesss
Turns to daylight, we release one
Another from the warmth that kept us

Safe at night, there's nowhere left to run
Wish that I could stay a while lost in
You forever, maybe I'm not strong enough
To face alone the threat of stormy weather

Blinded by the sun

So I've had my cry, no more tears
Tonight, 'cause the stars are shining brightly
In the sky, so lay down with me
I want to touch ya like the breeze
This could be our last goodbye

Anytime that you need somebody
By your side, 
I'll be there
Anywhere that you leave , 
you leave a piece of you behind, 
this I swear

You've made a better person out of me
For knowing you there's nowhere left to hide
But while we're outta sight
There's no right or wrong tonight

Hardly can believe the time has come

Made believe that it was yours
You seduced me with those words
And I couldn't help but fall

I fell in love with you that night
I let the lyrics speak to me
They cast a spell upon my heart
With their sensuality

The truth is you were faking it
That beautiful verse was counterfeit
Caught you doin' a de Bergerac
You may be cute, yeah
But I need deeper than that

If writing on paper can steal my heart away
Just imagine what his lips on my body would say
If words were kisses, he'd be making love to me
Arousing my emotions, touching me with poetry
(I want the poet)

Take my eyes, my heart, my soul
For without you, girl, I'm incomplete, un-whole
Baby, you were well rehearsed
With your borrowed pick-up lines
Your pretty eyes gave you away
Body language doesn't lie

The truth is I'm not faking it
He stole my words, he's counterfeit
('Cause I'm the poet)
I'm not doing a de Bergerac

Just imagine what my lips on your body would say
If words were kisses, you'd be making love with me

The rivers flood, the dam breaks
I gotta hear his voice, I gotta touch his skin
Gonna search the world till I find him

Shall there be no reason yet to breathe
And if your heart is spoken for
Condemned am I forever more

I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place

I just knew too much

Liege Lord,"Do you suspect your brother, was something done to you?
We all trust one another, we know this isn't true
For the people's minds are cluttered
With the word we call dislike
When our backs are turned in friendship
Our brothers they will strike

Across the seas in another land
Fists are clenched in every hand
Step across the boundary line
My choice to live is no longer mine
Suspicion drill inside their heads
And the will to live is what we dread
Man's trust has surely died
On the sword's point suspicion glides

[Chorus]
Can you control the feeling that you hold
The others you neglect, feel your own suspect

Between two fires we collect our thoughts
Are we all just liars? And our truth is only bought
For it's suspicion that turns it's back on you
Suspicion in the masses down to the very few
You cannot trust your brother
For the fear he's after you

[Chorus]

Between two fires we collect our thoughts
Are we all just liars? And our truth is only bought
For it's suspicion that turns it's back on you
They close their eyes to their own demise
And pray that it's not true",Suspicion,1990

I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park

I have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know tomorrow is their future
But for me just another day

They all gather â??round me, huh
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain

I know I can't hide from a memory
Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I've lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her

Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her

Did she have to leave and go away

Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fuckin' projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outside as I'm stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were dere
You know hoods robbers snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fuckin' lights
Gunshots, shatter first floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether broke callisthetic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Destruction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hangin' from his Farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas layin' on roof tops
For his CREAM he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashin' checks again
Back to the motherfuckin' spot on Lexington

Babies cryin' brothers dyin' and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

We be runnin' from the cops, bustin' off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

Yo, no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Clicks control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scramblin' for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learnin' fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
'Cause niggas main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed a kid
And hit a twelve year old girl in the head and then fled
Tactical narcotic, task force, back off fast
'Cause the crime boss is passin' off cash
Extortions, for portions of streets, causes beef
Havin' followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script, I'm not a actor but the author
Of a modern day opera, where the main character
Is presidential paper, the dominant, factor

I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw
In my old dreams were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

'Cause in my dreams 
It's always there 
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair 
Yeah

The night was black was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or some kind of hell
Six six six the number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released4

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
Six six six the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize me can't avoid their eyes?
Six six six the number of the Beast
Six six six the one for you and me

And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn

Life After Death,"Ive been looking so long for you
Now you wont get away from my grasp.
Youve been living so long in hiding
In hiding behind that false mask.
And you know and I know that
You aint got long now to last.
Your looks and your feelings
Are just the remains of your past.

Youre standing in the wings,
There you wait for the curtain to fall.
Knowing the terror and holding
You have on us all.
Yeah, I know that youre gonna
Scratch me, maim me and maul.
You know Im helpless from
Your mesmerising cat call.

Keep your distance, walk away,
Dont take his bait.
Dont you stray, dont fade away.
Watch your step, hes out to get you,
Come what may.
Dont you stray, from the narrow way.

Im running and hiding in my
Dreams youre always there.
Youre the phantom of the opera,
Youre the devil, youre just out to scare.
You damaged my mind
And my soul it just floats through the air.
Haunt me, you taunt me,
You torture me back at your lair.

Tell me why I had to be a power slave
I don't want to die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid to waste.
And in my last hour,
I'm a slave to the power of death.

When I was living this lie-fear was my game
People would worship and fall-drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me
For he is a man and a god-and he will die too.

[Chorus]

Now I am cold but a ghost lives in  my veins,
Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone
Shell of a man God preserved-a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell-I will strike from the grave.

Life After Death,"""O God of Earth and Altar,
Bow down and hear our cry,
Our earthly rulers falter,
Our people drift and die,
The walls of gold entomb us,
The swords of scorn divide,
Take not thy thunder from us,
But take away our pride.""
(G. K. Chesterton  English Hymnal)

Just a babe in the black abyss,
No reason for a place like this,
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
An easy way for the blind to go,
A clever path for the fools who know
the Secret of the Hanged Man-the smile on his lips.
The light of the Blind-you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.

She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
As the Eye of the Sun Rose on her lips,
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
So we lay in the black embrace,
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn.

The light of the Blind-you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.

Bind all of us together,
Ablaze with Hope and Free,
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.

And still the wind and rain,

But many came too much for cree

And as the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow

Call it suicide

And I watched, the ripple grew

You think I'm running out of bases
Must think I'm running out of aces
But I got a few left that I've been saving, saving, saving

I told her, ""if I was a rich man""
""I'd spread my riches underneath your feet""
But being poor, I've only my dreams
So watch how you step on me, oh
Watch how you step on my dreams [x3]
Watch how you step on me, oh

Lifehouse,"I'm finding my way back to sanity again 
Though I don't really know what I'm gonna do when I get there 
I take a breath and hold on tight 
Spin around one more time 
And gracefully fall back to the arms of grace 

'Cause I am hanging on every word you're saying 
Even if you don't wanna speak tonight 
That's alright, alright with me 
'Cause I want nothing more than to sit outside heaven's door 
And listen to you breathing 
It's where I wanna be, yeah 
Where I wanna be 

I'm looking past the shadows in my mind into the truth 
And I'm trying to identify the voices in my head 
God wish won't you 
Let me feel one more time what if feels like to feel 
And break these calluses off me one more time 

'Cause I am hanging on every word you're saying 
Even if you don't wanna speak tonight 
That's alright, alright with me 
'Cause I want nothing more than to sit outside of your door

Oh I don't want a thing from you 
Bet you're tired of me waiting for 
The scraps to fall off of your table to the ground

'Til I find you, 'til you found me 
Somehow I always knew that you would 
And I am contemplating matters 

All this cling and clatter 
In my head, and what you said 
Is ringing, ringing faster 
And it's all good if you would 

Stop the world from making sense 
And if I could just realize 
It doesn't really matter 
It doesn't really matter 

It doesn't really matter 
If I could touch 
The sound of silence now 
You know I would if I knew how 

To make these intentions 
Come around 
I'm hearing without listening 
And believing every word

You are the life to my soul
You are my purpose
You're everything
And how can I stand here with you
And not be moved by you
Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?

You calm the storms and you give me rest
You hold me in your hands
You won't let me fall
You steal my heart and you take my breath away
Would you take me in, take me deeper now
And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
Would you tell me how could it be any better than this

We never change faces
I guess you're the only one that's still doing

Doesn't mean it has to be in mine
Don't believe what you said still can't get it out of my mind
I've tried to find myself in approval
I've already been there already done that
It got me no where it brought me nothing

Your cage the only place where they will leave you alone 'cause the weak will
Seek the weaker until they've broken them could you get it back again
Would it be the same fulfillment to their lack of strength
At your expense left you with no defense they tore it down and i have
Felt the same as you, I've felt the same as you, I've felt the same
Locked inside the only place where you feel sheltered where you feel safe
You lost yourself in your search to find something else to hide behind
The fearful always preyed upon your confidence

Did they see the consequence when they pushed you around
The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones
Breaking them 'til they've become just another crown
Refuse to feel, Anything at all refuse to slip, Refuse to
Fall can't be weak, Can't stand still you watch your back,
'Cause no one will you don't know why they had to go

No I can't
And now I cannot stop pacing
Give me a few hours
I'll have this all sorted out
If my mind would just stop racing

I can be this unsturdy
This cannot be happening

This is over my head
But underneath my feet
Cause by tomorrow morning I'll have this thing beat
And everything will be back to the way that it was
I wish that it was just that easy

Cause I'm waiting for tonight
Been waiting for tomorrow
I'm somewhere in between
What is real, just a dream [Repeat: x2]

don't be surprised if I collapse down at your feet again
