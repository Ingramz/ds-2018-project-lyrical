"Buller, Balzer and Aichele","I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold,
I'd rather be His than have riches untold
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land,
Yes, I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand.

Than to be the king of a vast domain
And be held in sin's dread sway
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today.

I'd rather have Jesus than worldly applause,
I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause
I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame,
I'd rather be true to His holy name.

Than to be the king of a vast domain
And be held in sin's dread sway
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today",I'd Rather Have Jesus,2007

It's squeezing me, it's getting harder to breathe in
My communication's lost all frequencies

And I don't wanna be the last to know this time

Talk to me please

Don't try to force thought tonight if you've changed your mind
I know it's hard cause it looked hard today
Don't hide behind those eyes if you're worried
I'm not there yet but I am on my way

I see her lips sealed tight and I can feel
Her heart freezing me through her body
I'm having doubts that you are not having doubts
Cause it's feeling like you're giving up on me again

Watch it all crash and fall through
So when you feel like shit you've gotta

You've gotta sit, back, and, hold tight

There's Forces working in our heads
But we don't understand them

We've become

The more I think
The more I wish I would stop, and hit rewind
What I would give to have or take back then,
When no-one really cares
I remember when we all used to
Kick back, and take days off school

So many times I'd smile
Many times I've cried,
But never did we try
Never did we try

Bullet for My Valentine,"Agony is the price
That you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you
Then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel
And manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget
When there's nothing else
Left to destroy
It's a useless ploy

The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall
It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination a now blacked heart
Is reaching out divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of you life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
Till your end forcing you to bend

Throwing down like water, I saw her as she hit the ground

Proof, when they tear you up
When they start to fuck
When they start to piss down on my scars (to come home)

What I'm thinking now
When I stumble down
We can never say that you are gone till it comes

These rebel ways to show you
I just can't take no more
The thought of me inside you
Just makes me sick you're going down

But now it's over I'm calmer like crimson
Throwing down like water, I saw her as she hit the ground
Now it's over, I'm calmer like crimson.
Throwing down like water, I saw her as she hit the ground

Hate, when you thought you knew
Do you hear me shout ?
Bleeding through my ribbon on my eyes (to come home)

What I'm thinking now
When I take you out
We can always start to havoc death till it comes

These rebel ways to show you
I just can't take no more
The thought of me inside you
Just makes me sick you're going down.

These rebel ways to show you
I wanna fuck you now.

I'm a head that spins in a congregation of sin
Know you can't but you wanna
Raise your hands for all this lost religion
You suffer endlessly while the preacher preaches
Digging his fingers in me
His message molesting me
All along so strong so wrong
But I kind of like it

Bow our heads, forgive me in this moment of silence
If I die before I wake this faith means nothing really at all.

Such a Saturday night lover
And in the early morning
There's a Sunday's forgiveness
Repentance over and over to a safe secure place
Your heavenly disgrace now
Wink your eye to your altar boy's thighs
Is that your choice of toys
Hey father, hail Mary said 1, 2, 3

Bow our heads, forgive me in this moment of silence
If I die before I wake this faith means nothing really at all.

Do we all stand in the right hand of your heavenly father
While the left one creates me to poison everyone
Say it ain't so, but it is
Do we stand up, sit down, kneel for the one true creator
While the preacher has his hand with a boy saying you've been saved

Quick to shoot a motherfucker, to keep they face from sweating
But when the laws come to bang one, snitching and telling
Be these ol' buster ass niggaz, killing all in they music
Showing a four pound around town, but never gon use it
I'm registered by my gangsta, you barely touching me G
Now feel you got the edasity, to come and see me
Fuck it whoever want to get some, can come and get dropped
I'm a grown man I don't get people sued, I get people shot
If you ain't shot, I wonder who gon be standing behind the trigga
Z-Ro the Crooked, cause ain't no love for none of these niggaz
Straight Profit to Presidential, trying to scandalize my name
They can't sell records without me, that's a god damn shame
I ain't to blame, why these niggaz ain't selling and losing weight
But I'm to blame, when I go off and get the bruising they face

[Chorus]

Make a nigga hot, yeeeah
Why you want to hate me, S.U.C.
You niggaz can't be meeee
My nigga T-are-A-E
And that's the way it's gonna be
Until a motherfucker take me
Me, and the M double A-be	
We gon be thugging
Until we see you niggaz to see

Been killing them Kanye tracks before Jigga
Hooked with no ID when Kanye moved to NY
I was in the hundreds running around totaled semis

Left Cash Money and started my own empire
And we don't do no bird call, bitch, we been fly
And we won't kiss another man in the mouth, we gangsta
But we will run up in your house and stain ya

Close range murder remain ya
Empty the whole clip plus what's in the chamber
And if this won't help you, Joe, you know what we aim for
Lower that ice, boy, you know what we came for, nigga

Act like it we gon' put you to sleep
We'll own everything worth something, even your teeth
And beef, you don't want it, I promise that
This is south homicide of Chicago, honor that

Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, and we some cold hard killas
Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, we came to get that scrilla

You could never hold this block like I do
You grew up with a house full of women
And let your momma pussify you
Started gang banging in high school
Got your ass whipped and you stopped gangbanging in high school

This is something to ride to, bitch, ho wonderful
Twista, Common and Kanye look real comfortable
Bump, Fest and Mikkey finta snatch it from under you
I'll help a nigga bag depending on how my numbers do

Huh, and this ain't talking greasy, greasy
This is Jeffrey mannerisms and they need me, need me
I'm a gremlin after 12 ho feed me, feed me
Girls, we got, it's too hot for TV, TV

That's right, naw, it ain't Jeezy, Jeezy
Them Chicago-Rillas gon' snatch ya freebie
Wear it around the hood, believe me
And when you want it back the price moved up

Like George and Weezie, I will never sit
I will never tell when the heat is on, I will never bail
I will, never, let a stud extort me
I'll run up in your house with Malik

And we ain't finna spit poetry
I'll put a punk head with a floor beat
I'm like bullets flying through the hood
You can't ignore me, bitch

Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, and we some cold hard killas
Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, we came to get that scrilla

My crew is thorough, I see life through a barrel
I'm clean 'cause I make green like blue and yellow
I got a deal, I ain't flash, you'll ball out
I went in cops with crates of guns and passed 'em all out

I'm that hood, make rappers call it quits
I've been good, Atlantic just made it all legit
It's all real, y'all rappers just act hard
And we spend money like it grows in our backyard

The MAC-11 is with me, I'm going well over 80
In that navy blue 760
And I'm headed towards the hundreds, the king of the city
Going to get this money

Put it on your head like some headphones

I knock your punk ass out, wake you up, and I show you 
What I look like, who's that MC, that thinks that he can fuck with 
F-are-E-D-D-I-E, excuse me, Bumpy Knucks 
I don't give a fuck, if it's friend or foe 
This shit is my job to let you niggaz know so don't take it personal 
When I stick this verse in you, I don't know what you gon' do 
Even if you get your crew I'll walk through the stage 
Like it's Hoe Stroll Avenue, tappin on them pockets 
Puttin tabs on your revenue, now dig this 
It's mad niggaz that be thinkin they nice with they flow 
It's mad niggaz that be frontin like they holdin some dough 
It's mad niggaz that'll challenge me and after the show 
They Don't want to Be Players no mo', like Joe 
Niggaz try and come at me, with contemporary gangsta 
Fusion I'm smashin with the simple shit I'm usin 
Bashin and bruisin, who's in charge, BUMPY 
Step up in my face I leave your forehead LUMPY 

[Chorus] 

I bring the pain like a slice to your vein, fuck your fame 
Platinum and gold plate, don't hold no weight 
I be that, prophetic soul drainer, ain't a motherfucker 
In his right mind steppin in my cipher tryin to take mine 
From West coast to East I'm full-fledged 
Bust the science, niggaz better know the ledge 
O see all, I G off, enemy I spot you 
Two rhymes to my one verse, you go first 
You tasteless face it, I engrave my name in your scalp 
Like Damien, out for world domination 
Don't get me wrong, I don't represent 666 figures 
I'm just out to make figures 
Who holds the threshold, to be the best 
I crunch niggaz with my gold teeth like, vegetables 
Carnivorous deliverance, murder one nemesis 
Like a virgin, I snatch your innocence 
Talkin bank robberies when you rhyme, hold up 
You turn pussy on the mic when I roll up 
Coca-Cola, a fission like soda 
While you say butter, I'ma say Mazola 
Money folder hold a grudge cold like a polar bear 
Thug niggaz what? Blowin up spots like a SCUD 

Win the G, win the G 
Win the G, RRRRAHHHH! 

Who's that New York nigga left, that be nice like B.I. 
G.I., niggaz can't see I, see why? 
You new poppin niggaz, and you crew hoppin niggaz 
Step up in my face, and Bumpy be, 2Pa-cin niggaz 
If this bitch up in yo' heart, I'ma find it 
If you think I'm talkin to you, then just rewind it 
I got six shots behind this, even with a vest on 
Ya yellin, because I aim for the melon 
I'm a felon, and I bet you never, been in a fight 
Kinda like you really, never said shit on this mic 
So if I diss a nigga hustlin that makes me a displayer 
And if you buy my record twice, that makes you a two-payer/toupee-er 
And if your girl like Donna Karan, that makes her a DK-er 
And cause I hate your punk ass, that don't make you no playa 
Without this record business shit you niggaz is broke as fuck 
Smokin weed smokin woolies while I smoke your luck 
And while your flow needs, medical aid 
I just appear on niggaz shit, and I still get paid 
Now where's my G nigga? 

What niggaz'll think they made of steel and want to play brave? 
Bitch MC's will find theyself in the grave 
I make slaves of niggaz in ways never made 
Voice like an Ox or better yet sharp as a blade 
Intense the moment like sex when I'm bonin 
Iller than Caligula brainwashed the Romans 
I set it, let it be known, better beware, better be careful 
Who dared to oppose my phenomenal flows, how dare you? 
I smite your ass quick fast like Flash runnin past your ass 
Niggaz'll end up with whiplash 
But for the moment, I'm zonin, any opponents 
I'ma cut it short right now, because this rap shit we own it 

Come up off that cash nigga",Win the G,1997
Bumpy Knuckles,"Let me tell you
Who's the real divine?
You like that

Let me tell you

I be all in you like you disrespected space in my lyric zone
I'm like a pit, with a leg in his mouth, I bring it home
Bumpy ripping everything known, block every blow zone
I make you sit your ho ass down, turn off your microphone
Cause after me its un-rippable
I slap you in your mouth, your drinks'll be unsippable
I got miles of styles, you must be out your motherfuckin' brain
To think I'm not the nicest in the game
Disconnected from your mainframe, punched cocked
Twirl your nose up Murray the cop, to the beat down you don't stop
When Fox and Bumpy keep it hot
End the whole beef with just one shot, niggaz I fear not
This piece of steel with the screen on top
Projects uncut chyna white dope
Leave a freeze in a nigga throat
I fight for this like the right to vote
The poison I spit, they'll never be an antecdote
You niggaz thought I put my mic down
Cause the industry's scared cause I put my fight down
Before I do that, I sell it out the trunk and make a mill
Now that's a real rap nigga deal
In 99 I'm droppin niggaz like flies
Fuck flowin, I'm turning niggaz into Jesse Owens
Cock the four pound, keep it going, I'm in your dresser room layin
You bitch ass niggaz just start prayin baby

Rhymin is a part of my life
I'ma die with rhymin kids and a rhymin wife

I don't let nobody judge me that don't know how to do what I do
So if you don't like it then fuck you!

I watch niggaz get hyped up with one single and get gassed
Then fall like a bad pass
Niggaz run outta New York, to live in other places
Hopin somebody remember old rap faces
Fuck that, I'ma five borough thorough MC
Where I go, New York goes, keepin New York flows
Niggaz be switchin cause they not sure
Your style is played out soft shit like Valure
In red and black living rooms when the system booms
He's a nice little diss to whomever whom
Come against me and I give you one of three picks:
Get shot, get stuck up, get your ass kicked
Bring your whole unit, and I be lyrically gunning em
Cause Freddie Foxxx be the illest thing since Run and em
I be running through you like a Hummer, you don't want none o'
So hot I turn December 25 into summer
I scrutinize niggaz and bring em down to size
My lyrical body slam will leave you paralized
Fuck what you memorize, I take you out of drive
And leave you neutralized and black in both your eyes
My rise is your demise, shut down your enterprise
Fox and Primo, we stay close like thighs
Bumpy got nine lives, like a cat
With a full gat, keep it underground fuck that!

For every verse I ever spit, for every mic I ever rip
I still got a full clip of unstoppable shit
You mean to tell me motherfuckers never knew
That I be bustin' niggaz in the head with beer bottles like Guru
Check the mic one, two make sure its on
When I bring it to your headquarters, word is bond
Heads up, eyes and ears open
I got you hopin'
That you could catch rec like me
You got a better chance at kickin' down a tree
With no legs, doing a handstand on two eggs
Motherfucker, I got lyrical instinct, fuck what you write
I'm The Source like magazine, on the cover with the Ruger 16
I ain't scared to diss a MC, but ask him if he scared to diss me
I bet he won't disagree, he'll probably start sayin his throat
Hurt, his mom's is sick with a bad knee
Or start screamin' he's about dough
He's just a faggot with a whack flow
Don't walk up on me talkin' freestyles and off the top of the dome
I beat you down and send your ass home
I'm on my own time, I write my own rhymes
You wanna be the nominee? you brave now?
I carve my rhyme in your back and bury you face down
Just remember nigga:
I'm Freddie the Foxxx I break his back and buck em buck em down

[Freddie Foxxx]
When I was small I made pause tapes for ""Super Sperm""
Rappin in high school, drinkin forties, smokin sherm
Listen to Cold Crush and Grandmaster Caz spittin
Gettin somethin in that niggaz ain't now gettin; feel me
Remember everybody wanted to be ""Peace, God, Divine""
Real niggaz kept they attributes, right through '99
Peace to the god Taheem, watching over me
White chariots and horses, get me over rough courses
While I silence those voices that doubted my ability
to rip, through these young ass niggaz
When I walk into the Lyricist Lounge, lyricists lounge
cause niggaz know that Bumpy Knucks'll tear this mutha down
Cause the rawest most illest shit, make up my sound
That's why I stay gettin money, like them niggaz uptown
I'm in your face - nigga whassup now
Fuck all that peacemakin bullshit
I heard you spit you like to pull shit
That's all bullshit, you keep your nine on some full shit
You say you bust it, that's BULLSHIT!
You know the illest MC that ever did it
The rawest nigga that ever chewed up rhymes and spit it
In the new millenium cities, watch what I do
I'm bout to save hip-hop like Ghost did the Wu

Chorus: Freddie Foxxx (repeat 2X)

For the DJ's, the rappers, the writers, the breakers
The movers, the shakers, the beat, the makers
What's stronger than hip-hop niggaz they can't take us
if we deal with the real, and shut down the fakers

[Freddie Foxxx]
I'm proud to be a black man in my existence, so fuck the Klan
I ain't blinded by your jewels and your million dollar checks
I'm always ready for whatever's next
My road in life ain't easy cause I'm complex
You know the real, nigga turnin these fake hard niggaz to grasshoppers
cause f'real here comes the realest, when I cock the manstoppers
I remember talkin to Big Poppa; he said ""Foxxx, you the illest,"" 
(uhh) I make the realest nigga feel it
Got a little mob of niggaz I send to rob niggaz
Take all that fly jewelry, and give it to my moms
I keep the industry up in arms like Zack La Roche
cause they hate to see me comin, with this too black approach
Through the hardest time in hip-hop, I stayed afloat
So let me give the media some fly shit to quote
I'ma always be a nigga, lookin through your eyes
So nothin that you do to me should come as no surprise
I continue bein raw dog, puttin in work
I drown a bitch and get away, like my name was Captain Kirk
Motherfuckers wanna hear it raw, Bumpy make it hurt
Step on stage, rip the whole shit down and merc'

Chorus

[Freddie Foxxx]
What fucked you up is that I'm so nice and don't rehearse
On any record I'm the king of the third verse
It's +Strictly Business+, if it's +Personal+ I let you know
I hold your heart until the Lord tell me let you go
Don't need advice from no corny ass A&R that never filled a milk crate
with breakbeats, I keep it raw nigga straight street
To my comrades in L.A, L.A., L.A.
I still got the bulletproof - Pelle, Pelle, Pelle
Keep the music underground as I reiterate twice
Tell niggaz to they face, I thought you wasn't nice
Kick my ass?  Nah, not likely; out mic me? 
Not likely, stay on the sidelines like Spike Lee
Niggas know Bumpy like to flow all out
Microphone, gun in hands nigga, go all out
No exceptions to females I ride 'em giddyup
How bad I wanna fuck Brat, since she pushed them titties up
It's the underground sound that designs the street
Freddie Foxxx designed the rhyme, Premier designed the beat

Uh, Refugee, one time, one time
Uh, M.O.P., two time, two time, one time

Because the block knows hot
You're a masquerade
You're livin in a uh
You're livin in a masquerade

So, this ain't a rap verse

So when you die the kids'll throw rocks at ya hearse
Cause you lie too much
You don't got no gat
At your arm reach is ink
At your headpiece now you pissin in your briefs
Hold up
We just saw you on your BET and MTV, a public access channel
Talkin bout I'ma thug
You're an animal, a canibal, you even scare hannibal
But when the blackout came no light for your candle
So welcome to the real world where a spade is a spade
And I'ma call it like I see it 
Ay, why'all living in a masquerade
Even though Jacob iced you out wit the baguettes
Money wit no respect ? that makes you a suspect
So you can't ride through Brownsville
You want peace you better call Churchill
If not, feel Clef when he connects wit M.O.P. family and plays guitar at your eulogy
You want to claim you run da block
You're a masquerade
Givin information to the cops

I mean you never seen a rock
You're livin in a uh
You're livin in a masquerade

First and foremost...
Flow easy, yo
Yo, yo, for the hood (for the hood)
Everybody flow easy, ha ha, so easy
Yo, listen
For the corrupt mob, John Cena, Trademarc, listen

I embarrass MC's who touch the mic with me
That's why they never holla when it's showtime - gimme
I spit poison like a black snake bit me
Guns up in the E-Class, D's can't get me
My foot is a 13, 12's don't fit me
My heart is cold and hard like Jack Frost bit me
So many new flows old flows start to panic
It's time they got built by the mic mechanic
y'all heard, I stay in hood streets like curbs
And never forget, where I come from, word
I ain't goin broke, fuck you, I'll cop me a brick
And take it straight to the block, forget rap quick
Don't trip, Bump got a speed zone sign
For suckers who move too fast against mine
I'm pressed, pushin it full speed ahead
You left, bullet in chest, meet the dead, so

[Chorus]
Flow easy, turn up the mic it's time
to flow easy, whenever I spit my rhyme
I flow easy, the underground pound and grime
Flow easy, but yours don't sound like mine
I flow easy, turn up the mic it's time
I flow easy, whenever I spit my rhyme
I flow easy, the underground pound and grime
Flow easy, so yours don't sound like mine I flow easy

[Tha Trademarc]
Philosopher first, rapper second
Manifest the message, lessons involved
It all but hits you, aviate your crew and lift you
So what's the issue? Trademarc has got it locked before he meet you
Greet your mind before we even greet you
Won't mislead you, I ain't trustin people, cause I defeat you
Take it down a notch, slow your roll
Cause we crush spirits, like we stole your soul
I set styles off dog, y'all are fuckin mimics
Man I talk more shit than pro-lifers in abortion clinics
Run my mouth off like high school rumors
Man and grab microphones like pedophiles gropin late bloomers
Flow easy like your first day with white sneakers
You just a face in the crowd like packed bleachers
Huh, you better rock a sleeveless
Freddie Foxxx, Trademarc, John Cena breeze through
y'all are fuckin divas

[Chorus]

[John Cena]
First and foremost I sure post potential like Carmelo
Turn a hard MC to jello
Make their skin yellow with fear while stayin mellow and clear
Man, we in for one hell of a year, yeah
Curse a fool like the Red Sox, we tighter than headlocks
I'm flowin easy with Freddie Foxxx
Known to hang it low like dreadlocks and y'all are too slow
Like wearing a weight vest and lead socks
I'm a fat kid, you feed me? I'm still hungry
Never let a bitch take a bill from me
Like Jordan in the 4th quarter, I'm still money
Best believe the flow water, we still runny
Make your stomach feel funny, I'm so sick
With 16 bars twice the value of gold brick
Make it known quick that I'm greedy, we got the rats and the cheese be	
So believe me

when I pu-pu-pull the pin out, keep frontin
I'ma try-try-try ya chin out
I knocked a lot-lot-lot-lot out of men out
Keep frontin, I'ma try-try-try ya chin out
I knocked a lot-lot
I knocked a lot-lot-lot out of men out
Keep frontin, keep frontin, keep frontin, keep frontin

Right now
I want to teach all you MC's out there
How to be
Effective
Let's ride


Do y'all know what time it is when everybody game
is everybody else's hustle and everybody's shame
is somebody else's blame, whatever I became
I did it with hot rhymes and a lung full of flame
I never refrain, from loadin up and takin aim
Like chicks flows are different, I never cum/come the same
My mic will be the dame, written or off the brain
I show up with my chest pumpin hard like Notre Dame
I lose then I regain, hustle is in the vein
I'm drinkin protein shakes to muscle up the brain
In the black Chevy Suburban sippin champagne
with champagne, dick out doin the damn thang
We movin in the fast lane, with them black thangs
On the way to the Bronx, to do the ski-mask thang
I don't know what's so funny cause I ain't laughing
The part is for a dead body, guess who's casting

Alright bro, I'm hearin you
I'ma see what I can do
See how I can rip it
And be, effective
Follow this

(John Cena)
Cena spittin with the Bump Bump Bump for the Knux
Your whole crew gettin dumped dumped dumped with the chumps
We rollin like Donald Trump Trump Trump with the bucks
Your bitch-ass gettin jump jump jumped cause you suck
Follow me, you stick around round round when it's hot
You claimin that you down down down but you not
You try to offer me a pound pound pound you get got
I can't wait to hear the sound sound sound of you shot
You hearin me, it's time to show show show I got plans
That's all you brought you bettter go go go get your mans
A legal hustle, ain't no no fuckin with grams
Stash the heat cause I can throw throw throw with my hands

My camou' colors dog they be beige and brown
That shit was all love 'til you cowards came around
With the same ol' sound that's why your payroll down
That's how the game go now that's why you ain't gain ground
Cause you stuck on then dog, you ain't on now
And that's how it's been baby cause you ain't know how
You move your pen lazy maybe or your beats don't pound
I move quicker than the word on the street go 'round
I write down every lesson that my peeps hold down
You let your heat go blaow if you ain't speak profound
I write sixteens down 'til I hit green now
Makin up slang, ain't know what shit mean now
Trademarc, Marc Predka, jot the real name down
You can catch it on every marquee in town
Sayin Trademarc, ain't nobody like you now
Probably sweatin this track dog, go wipe your brow

(Chorus - 2X)

You see, that's all it takes

Maserati for the watch, that's that foolish cash 
Penitentiary chances, '6's on a muscle car

First Verse: [Juvenile] 



Scraped my elbow jumpin' the fence 

Creepin' through the grass camoflauged lookin' for them 

Cowards, non-believers, contradictors, I'm comin' to get ya 

You try to frame me without the picture 

Shit, I'm obligated, to be a Juvenile for life 

It don't change robbin' shit in this game 

I know you heard about that 7th ward, 9th and the rest 

But who's down to knock a head off and wear a vest? 

Take a flight through that Nolia and then see who represent 

Not with them thugs ridin' wearin' them black reebok tennis 

Niggas fifteen, sixteen, seventeen 

Slangin' iron from that Josephine through that Melphanine 

And would do almost anything to prove himself relentless 

Like, a murder job and forgettin' the consequences 

Hustlin' through the brick walls avoidin' the feds 

Pushin' the dope steady duckin' blue eyes and curly heads 

And he got caught and then start, runnin' with yo peers 

Got swole and been home and now you back out chea 

And that boyd that cha shot, brothas hangin' on the block 

You don't know him but he know ya look you bout to get got 

BOW!!!!!! Laid out in cold blood on the Ave. 

Here comes the paramedics media and crime lab 

Understand this is all he know and it's all he see

Bun B,"[Baby]
Now since I live in these motherfucking projects
Police don't want to see us in Cadillacs
I bought a woman on gold to match my goals
And I don't have to drop one of my hoes
I got a Lexus and a Benz
Expedition on chrome partner
With 20 inch rims
A hummer and a Rolls Royce
I got a candy helicopter in the lake front nigga
I'm a ball till I fall
Talk shit till I fuck
I'ma fly till I die
Shake till I break
I'ma bake these cakes and drink Alize
And fuck a different bitch every night of the week
I'ma shop till pop and keep a high price partner
Range and rove, got a mouth full a gold
And I love these hoes
Niggas wearing Rolexes
Spending 50 or better till coming back from Texas
Busting leafs and leather
Got a hummer full of bricks
Cause I know I'm the shit, you can believe that nigga
Got diamonds and golds so I can blind these hoes
I'ma ball till fall, spending g's at the mall
Have a big balling party, inviting all y'all
10 G's around my neck, 50 G's on my Rolex
100 G's on my Benz, 20 G's on my rims
5 G's just laying on the floor
I party, hit the dope and give you 5 G's son
The old man never seen that much cash before
700 G's stashed away for my son
I hit it harder and get some cold rum
Downstairs has 2 million just in case I die
Baby we ain't gonna ride
The little BC gonna ball till I die
Playboy, tell me how you love that?

[Mannie Fresh]
I got so many cars I don't know what to do
I got so many hoes I'll give one to you
Lexus laying wit the TV playing, that my CO
Projects swallow me, 'cause I'm negro
The cornrows don't got a hummer man
The broads too I keep the hurricane
Nigga raw street, that's the bubblied Benz
Nigga raw folks, wit the Batman Benz, come on
Put your eyes on this nigga Baby
Papa, I got a diamond ring for you maybe
I slam Cadillac bowls me and Baby gram
Out of state hoes wit diamond rings
7 nigga teens
Look at the fucking karats on your triple beam
How you love that?
Lexus wit the blue stripe
Can you take that Apollo with the white ass pipes
100's, 1000's, millions, damn
Like from 6 till noon, I buy a whole building man

[Bun B]
Bitch we top of the line
Never fuck wit niggas that drop a dime
Thinking we balling I'll fuck if you mine
Your talks is too high. there's some diamonds bout to be blind
Stop some time, then you can possibly climb
I got Cash Money to prove it
Walking and talking like I'm all cute and
Refreshing and reuse it
With cars you can't purchase
While you struggling for 2 G's at churches
Nobody searching, they just find and drop the bitch
Probably looking for the boy, so we can get out this bitch
Now the drink is on us, for the fights no fuck
I'm visiting a whore, hoes only got butts, get naked
And show cunts
I need fucking sucking ass blowing
Now just back up and show us your butt
Blow up when you see us 
Go down the beach and get some Reese's
If don't believe it, ask Jesus

It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let 'em hang to the flo', snot on the snow

And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city
'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll
So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution

I be workin' and twerkin' my portable digital
Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter
Kind of like a see-saw, up and down
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that

There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, ""Who's sack is dat?""
All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya
I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'

I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one

I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution

Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport

Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath

On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong

Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'

Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

The dream of Huey Newton that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend, has just begun

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

The color and the price
From canary yellow, ruby red to baby blue
One stone or maybe two
Fuck it cause we all can't be babies fool
Some of its jazzy
Some of it can't be real
Nigga say its sitting platinum
Knowing its stainless steel shit
I seen all kinds of medallions
On the necks of rappers
Drug dealers, Marks, ball players and stallions
? shit they buy them hoes by the dozen
O.G. nigga get a new piece
Pass the old down to his cousin
Spell out your name, your corner, your clique

You get some grade A rocks and in 20years they still shining
No need to worry, women will find em
But if they gaze at yo carrots for to long it will blind em
Cubic Zirconia helped the whole hood fine
Now that everybody can bling we having good times
I'm writing clever rhymes feeling like forever grinding
A diamond in the rough
Buff me up and hear me shine
I used to hit these streets and slang
Hustling in these peoples game
Now its just for piece n' thang
I ain't tryin' to preach you man
I ain't tryin' to heat your flame
I just wanna teach your brain

Bun B,"I chose to live this life, I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes
'Til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggaz

Niggaz trippin' and for what?
Why must he think he 'posed to change her
When she'll give the pussy up, even to a total stranger?
And, I'm just one of 'em, you can't trust none of them
They'll say they love you while they wipin' your cum on them

Then they'll run and tell her friends how she found another sucker
To pay a fee for pussy but not me, motherfuckah
I move quick with my pool stick, slicker than Willie
Slicker than Kelly, slicker than KY Jelly

But really this dick has got me in a lot of trouble recently
I bend 'em and go in 'em and don't even have the decency
To call her, my balls have been leaked of most of their fluids
I used to put the rubber on and skeet straight through it

And it seems, that I always keep my pipe in these hoes
Keep my mic at these shows, 'cause that's the life that I chose
Pimp life, I chose to live the pimp life

Come talk a walk up in my shoes, pay a couple of my dues
Roll my boulevard on trues, while your lady sings the blues
Got everythang to lose, not a damn thang to gain
I be tryin' to cross the line but with that I gotta bring the pain

Now I tried to compromise, see the other side of the story
But that's easier said that done
When it comes to your pride and your glory
I'm a pimp with a glide in my worries, limp pimp I'ma step when I wreck
But my armor's on at all times, 'cause I gots me a rep to protect

Now I mights be known for this and maybe recognized for that
But they be high beamin' me and I be like where my visors at?
Nowadays I'm a wiser cat, after what I been through I better be
Back then I woulda broke ya broad, nowadays I just let her be

'Cause through seconds, minutes, hours, days
Weeks, months and years
Man I reckon that it's power fuckin' freaks, blunts and beers
That ain't what I'm supposed to be, pimp life that's the life I chose for me

I be stickin' this dick up in these hoes hoes
'Til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggaz
Niggaz trippin', I chose to live the pimp life

Yeah I have menage-a-trois with superstars, one night stands, quickies
Booty calls, it ain't nuttin for her to just stick around here and lick me
'Cause I run through broads and never get enough, maybe I'm too selfish
But I can't help it, can't stay witchu girl
'Cause I can't tell if it's official or just another ritual

It's hard for me to find a wife, it's nothin' for me to get a hoe
I know it sounds pitiful, sometimes I'm blessed, sometimes I'm cursed
If it's supposed to be the best then tell me, what's the worst?
I'll be a PFL 'til I'm a old nigga

'Cause I never spend my life with groupies or gold diggers
I see these bitches now, shake it naked tryin' to make it
If you spendin' all his money, take it bitch, you can't fake it
When it's real, I'm cappin' like the snub-nosed, they pay me

I love hoes, never go home when the club close
I do shows, ride new vogues and keep two hoes
I'm all about this money girl, that's why I chose
To live the pimp life, pimp life, I chose to live this life
Pimp life, pimp life, I chose to live the pimp life

People ask me question 'bout this
People ask me question 'bout that, say what?
I'm a handsome John motherfucker
Independent of the nasty ass cuts

Young Gipp, still around the corner in the hood
Gipp, still runnin' down in the wood, Gipp, still ridin' out like vogues
Gipp, still cruise hundred spokes, straight from the 80's ladies
Grew up in nuttin' but dem Grady babies

Pimpin' the game since ninety-six
Can't sell a big ol' pimp no box of bricks
Gipp put it down for the A-Town to the Bay to the Oakland foothill strip
Too Short, Bun be, Devin and Big Gipp, yo we all some pimps
Gettin' money out the sexual industries
At the same, tryin' to get our slice
Never lookin' back twice, livin' in the pimp life

You don't wanna get involved with this here, nigga!
Is you a bitch nigga?, you a bitch nigga!
Look at yourself and then analyze me!

I can see the flaws in you, you got girl drawers in you
Girl flaws in you, a broad nigga!
I peeped your whole hand when you came in
I'm a man and I hang men
Play the game to win
All men should play on ten
Scarface 'finna do it again
Mash you nigga, smash through niggas
Don't make me upstrap and blast you niggas
Once again, it's only, its a must that I do it
Lock you in my scope and blast your ass through it

The image and the style that you used to
'cause you don't keep it real like you used to

So niggas slow your motherfucking roll

Bitch Nigga, when you steal cash from your kin
You'z a Snitch Nigga, running when the drama go down
You was bumpin at first what happened to the manly sound
You a Snitch Nigga, specializin' at bumpin' ya gums
Bitch Nigga, countin' all your bricks but all I see is crumbs
Snitch Nigga, ain't you tired of running your mouth
Can't even go home, cause a jacker might run in your house

Now snitch fellas get up under my skin
That's why I don't mess with friends
Unless it's my Mac-10
I'm the king of the ghetto, Z-Ro the crooked in the flesh
Looking for head shots, 'cause snitch fellas get the bullet-proof vests
What you scared for?
What happened to all the tough ass talk
The way you was bumpin', I thought you had a taste for asphalt
Look at momma's baby out here starvin' for an ass-
Whippin', beefin', with a magician then drippin' now his ass missin
I'll be damned if I pull a rabbit out a hat
Well pull my 40 out of holster, and put a snitch fella on his back
WHOA!, look how I handled this .44
My conscience be screaming Z-Ro Murder Mo!, Murder Mo!
And these snitch fellas on ""How I'm Living"" try snitchin' on ""BET""
But got a restraining order against ""Murder I-N-see""
This how we ride, and ain't never gon' make a switch dude

Put this pistol in your mouth, you'll never need them trees again

Me and me and myself, you niggaz bad for my health
Now I'm pumped up like Superman, with a uppercut to be felt
I ain't playing with what I'm saying, you cats better start praying
For Deebo commits to spraying, and everybody be staying

[Chorus]
Why, these fellas talking down
Don't they know, why we'll ride
And make somebody slide, beware
Why, these fellas talking down
Don't they know, why we'll ride
And make these bustsas hot, beware

I'm chilling in my 1's, chopping game on my celly
My iced out cross, hanging down to my belly
Got your lil mama, butt naked shake her jelly
I'ma put her on a tape, and play it back on the telly
Boys hate to love the street show, when we showing up
I give me back the same middle finger, they be throwing up
They can't afford the pints, by the case that we po'ing up
Young in the game, it's time to start growing up
Get you some hustle, get you some grind
Show me some muscle, show me some shine
Fuck trying to crime, off another nigga name
It's just a matter of time, 'fore I run you out the game
Because I can't believe the nerve, of these hoes
Trying to use my nigga Pimp name, for benefit shows
Fin to start kicking in do's, with the macks
Trying to let that shit pass, now I'm coming for your ass fool

[Chorus]

It's the return of the mad rapper, industry nigga subtracter
That be greed up in the fists, that be clinched like a black panther
I'm sick and tired of you fakers, that try to twist up the game
So now you gotta see me, like the 84's that I swang
My glock I cock and I aim, my name you fin to respect it
You let me off in your world, then I swear to God I'ma wreck it
You must of thought I forgot about you, acting sue a crowd'll watch you
I gotta get that up out you, your people gon be without you
On top of that, niggaz be using my homie name
Saying the Screwed Up Click, so they can get them a little change
Hopping from dick to dick, and I ain't even gon say no name
I feel like I want to click, so now you gon feel my pain
I'm Trae, and I ain't bar nan nigga in this drama
Or mama, I weave and I swang sending em through a trauma
They tell me to let em make it, but really I ain't the one
Them bitches did it, so now they gotta see me when I come

Where the real niggaz at, cause I can't find none
Everybody be talking shit, when they be packing they guns
Quick to shoot a motherfucker, to keep they face from sweating
But when the laws come to bang one, snitching and telling
Be these ol' buster ass niggaz, killing all in they music
Showing a four pound around town, but never gon use it
I'm registered by my gangsta, you barely touching me G
Now feel you got the edasity, to come and see me
Fuck it whoever want to get some, can come and get dropped
I'm a grown man I don't get people sued, I get people shot
If you ain't shot, I wonder who gon be standing behind the trigga
Z-Ro the Crooked, cause ain't no love for none of these niggaz
Straight Profit to Presidential, trying to scandalize my name
They can't sell records without me, that's a god damn shame
I ain't to blame, why these niggaz ain't selling and losing weight
But I'm to blame, when I go off and get the bruising they face

[Chorus]

Make a nigga hot, yeeeah
Why you want to hate me, S.U.C.
You niggaz can't be meeee
My nigga T-are-A-E
And that's the way it's gonna be
Until a motherfucker take me
Me, and the M double A-be	
We gon be thugging
Until we see you niggaz to see

Straight up, it's my cousin Trae nigga
These bitch ass niggaz can't fuck with you

[Verse 1: David Banner]
Roll up on that tour bus, smokin' a blunt
Then heard a (dunn dunn dunn dunn dunn!) what yo' baby momma want?
Nothin' but good fuckin' dick suckin' train runnin'
She lickin' on my nuts, talk to her if she hear me comin'
Watchin' me go
She swallowed cum, you kissed a hoe
Tongue and lip, all
Man you really lickin' my balls
Heard you for my baby momma last night nigga, nah
But she did bring weed, no seeds, sticks all
I'm lyin' when she come over, cock lyin' in her jaw
Niggaz all up in her drawers
And that's yo' baby mother
If it makes you feel better, she's a good dick sucker (sucker)

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
My Job takes me out of town on all-expense paid
Wakin' up with a hangover 2,000 miles away
It seems easy: weed, women, and wine
Four hours of sleep is all you get - now it's time
To tally hoe to the show, a yo, yo let it go
Bust through the do' (door), rag & flow and grab my hoe
And get back in the van with some titties in hand
Let her meet ya new friend, who's willing to spend
The whole night? Another flight another gig another city
Touchin' on somebody's baby momma's titties
Niggaz in the lobby wonderin' where their women are
Third floor havin' a ""Let's Become a Bitch Seminar""
Can't get attached, I got a plane to catch
I wish I could a hit that but I'll be back

Yo, (huh) ain't no tellin' where I'm a be at
But you know, out the do' (door) uh huh

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Yeeah, man this the king of the chillin' circuit, I'm aight, ten in it
I'm paper chasin' and rap hustlin' it ain't no synonym
My money ain't a game so I ain't worried bout winnin' it
I'm worried bout makin' it, stackin' it and spendin' it (and spendin' it)
Ain't no pretendin' it don't make the world move
Same way you can't pretend my shit don't make yo' girl groove
See, God work in myterious ways but I don't (don't)
And the devil will make a deal wit yo' ass but I won't (won't)
Now you can have the cleanest paint job on ya trucks
Six T.V.s, wood wit leather seats, stitched and tucked
The biggest chrome rims, playa, I don't give a fuck
If I holla at yo' bitch, guarantee she gettin' buck
You can yell and you can scream and you can fuss and you can fight
Like it's the worst night in yo' life, to me it's just another night
I ain't carin' bout ya drama (uh uh), or breakin' up ya home
You just a joke for the crew and material for a song, main

This is the set-off

Take it to the streets nigga
Word up
Sauce Money
Uh, uh
Proper set-off

Don't get it fucked up 'cause Sauce calm wit his grandma
'cause I'm like baking soda bitch, I'm armed with a hammer
And when I'm strapped fool, fuck your brother
'cause like Jimmy Ivene in Virginia you in the scope like a muthafucka
Fine, niggas don't wanna let him shine
Niggas hate that fact Sauce don't give a fuckin' nine
Soon as he ran his mouth, one tre pound seven to nine
Guess who's the odd man out
I guess we got something in common
I'm just a little more calm when
I'm about to split your arm in
Put a hole so big in your noggin
That if you God body, you can fit the whole sun, moon and star in
You starvin' for more lyrics I know
Steady robbin' all them lyrics I flow
I'm Sadam-ing all you niggas fo sho
You betta know I'm a true nigga, please do nigga
Betta inquire from a few niggas
'cause bitch, I done shit on quite a few and quieted a few niggas
Get a grip, dead four-fifth in the hip
Slip, never picture me fallin' nigga don't trip

[Killer Mike]
Stoned is the way of my walk
In a mini-mack eleven, the tone when I talk
When I spray niggas pray, lay on the sidewalk
Color blood red, body outlined in chalk
My rhymes, two zigs all nines
Hard hit when they spit, split wigs double time
This eightball's a strict nine
Tear apart body parts when I spark nine
At they head hard lodged in they damn spine
Leaves emcee's like Christopher Reeves, crippled and cryin'
Shittin' in a bag and a breath away from dyin'
Nigga I'm - the epitomy of raw rhymes
The epitomy of rap rock
I make a block party bop to the sounds of a hot glock
From New York down to Georgia it don't stop
Killer Kill from Addamsville with a hot glock
Blaaat!

[Bun B]
They say murder is the case they wanna throw me
I guess these muthafuckas don't know me
O.G. rock called a yay slanger
VA's finest
Underground muthafuckin' king call me ""Your Highness""
I tear your sinus with this gun powder
Wipe your tears with the steal, no fear this is real niggas
Here is the deal: you clear in this field
And ain't stoppin' until every hater here is revealed
'cause we don't need no fuckin' clearance to peel
Or shortstoppers runnin' and the fear is revealed
So - get off this block homie handle your corner
Keep all your heroin, rocks and you mariju-wana
I'm like a - character on the Sopranos or the Wire
You'se a - big pussy lil' man, it's over, retire
'cause the - clock's tickin', your days is done
But we know all them lil' different fuckin' ways you slum
But it's trill downtown, your momma's all free
Your house is sugar-layin' with your wife and your seed
Yes indeed, Big Bun is on a home invasion
You gon' bleed on my gun from your dome abrasions
'cause my chrome is blazin', I'm naughty crunk
Got the bop gun like Sir Nose D'Voiddoffunk
Bitch, I pull a sawed-off from under the waist
Open your eyes muthafucka, you got thunder to face
Fuck rest, we gon' lay these muthafuckas to waste
You bit the pully nigga tell me, how the fuck did it taste
From my gun...
Big guns, big power
M. Woods, sixth hour
Berettas, Tauruses, Rugers
Smith and Wesson's, glocks and lugers
AK's, are 15's
Mack elevens and M-16's
High caliber, so why try it?
You live by it, so you die by it
A muthafuckin' gun...

[WC]
Who's the man with the strap in his hand
Homie's stolen semi-autos and contrabands
All day every day, crossin' my hood in day
In a six-trey with my nigga Kay Slay
Dub the law scan, the infrared scanner
Hangin' out the window, hittin' em up with the bandana
And I can't stand a snitch so I - clean the lid
Just in case them bitch niggas wanna sing with this
I stay on the trigger, 'cause lames hate me nigga
They can't pay me nigga, where my lay dates nigga
Where AK one-on-one so thirty shot
Nine millimeter Melindas aimed ready to send ya
So put your can on your vest like a Bible and pray slowly
'cause this'll leave your teflon holey
With the forty glock ready to ring, bring the trauma to the scene
It's the Ghetto Heisman and the Drama King

[Joe Buddens]
It's about that time nine-milli clappin'
Dude, what's really crackin'?
I been gettin' it since 'Paid In Full' was really happenin'
I gotta do it like that to keep my street name
And pride made me kill Wayne Growe when the heat came
I don't smut but stimulation is good
I keep the hammer with me, Joey's renovatin' the hood
Difference between us, I'm gettin' loot on tours
Good shoes on the Beem, you got a boot on yours
Dudes with no names wanna put an end to me
But doggs, I'm readin' between the lines, the whole game's in parenthesis
Talk about models and how you with somethin'
When you really shootin' air balls, you ain't hittin' nothin'
Nathan, through the strip, O.G.'s blazin'
Street niggas slowly hatin' on Joey so amazin'
And hood niggas knowin' what up
Either holdin' you down or holdin' you up, throwin' it up
Oh!

[Hak Ditty]
Aiiyo, fuck the dumb shit, when the guns spit
One clip'll have your whole strip laid down
Thirty-two shots to your block, I had that shit caged down
And before you blink, I let off eight rounds
This the ro-yal I ain't playin'
I'm takin' this over, so y'all either layin' or dying
And I won't hesitate to blaze the iron
You cocksuckers is chillin' with a ragin' lion
I see them dudes every day, when I'm racin' by 'em
Or on the curb poppin' bottles while they hatin' and eyein'
Uh, whether the slider or the highrider
I keep my block rocker, glock under the blue dosser
Far as Philly, it's no question to who's liver
I'm hotter, Hak Ditty, block locker
Fully prepared
I hope y'all fully aware that y'all niggas got a problem this year

Get off the bus and pay your dues, you don't belong on this ride 
I'm a full time playa, all about my hustle 
Demonstrating my muscle, if I get in a tussle 
If you got plex, I suggest you keep it hush-hush 
Cause boys wet up on that water, and you might get bust 
I got to stay up on my note, so my game is sharper 
I can't be wiped out, I'm like a permanent marker 
Boys mean mugging in the club, repping they hood 
It's understood but cross that line, homie it ain't good 
It's survival of the fittest, I'm the last one breathing 
While you in your bed sleeping, I'm still out here creeping

Get the nine to spit it in, leave him smelling like chit-lens

Bun B,"""yeah! (yeah!) 
It's been a long journey getting' to
This motherfuckin' point of this crunk juice shit. (what?!)
But we done got to the last motherfuckin' song niggas
(last shit niggas!) and I got five of the hottest motherfuckin'
Emcees in the world, givin' you that gangsta shit!
It's the motherfuckin' grand finale!

We growin' doja in the basement in that underwater garden (okay)
When hereon in the bank shed, dry it 'til it harden
Make it hash up in the oven (man), put yayo in the hot plate
Drain and dry in the freeser, it's obvious we got weight
I said hard work, that's soft work even with wet work
Built-in clientele so we ain't gotta network (let's go)
We always got work, so we ain't gotta get work
And if you ain't gettin' your work from us you bound to get jerked
We yayo experts, we been whippin' the yola since the crackas decided to
Take the coke from coca-cola
Hold the rollers, the king of the trill
The underground as well, you can step in the ring when you feel
Nigga just sound the bell
Can't sound the heaters in this game, but the grind I'm lovin'
Nigga we passed all that pushin', man it's time for shovin'
I got the mask, I got the strap, soon as I find the gloves
We gonna start exposin' off like farhrenheit 9/11

I'm a speak clearly 'cause I don't think they hearin' me
A nigga only fear's gettin' charged with conspiracy
I'ma get it right to ya, sticky green white to ya
Wear whatever you want, bullets goin' right through ya
If you stressin' to get buried
My niggas'll send you back to the essence in a hurry
Sippin' crunk juice, blowin' dutchies in the chevy
Try to figure me out dawg, I'm light but I'm heavy
Yellow lemonheads in the bessie of the presi'
And yeah, anybody can rock but d-block rock steady (d-block!)
Fed's don't need no warrants 'cause y'all all informants
So I get higher than new york insurance
Try to keep shit clean like florence
Moved on up on the east side 'cause I never lost endurance
And it's all real niggas, if I ever get a license to carry
Shit, that's a license to kill niggas

I refuse to lose, I rather give these weak dudes the blues
And separate them from they jewels, teach 'em don'ts and do's
I raise tools, make crews make decisions confused
All spectators can say is, ""this lil' nigga's a fool""
A short fuse with some loose screws, some unscrewed
Better prove, you niggas pussy as the moulan rouge
So who guardin' who, you know who to you know what
To you know where, goin' 'gainst 'em's too unfair
'cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
Now you know I ain't no ?, I got ten folk there
They ain't powerful as the one at the end of your prayer
Got you runnin' for your life without a minute to spare
Catch you dead to the granite, melt the grease in your hair
When I go, them boys is gonna be indecent affair
Guarantee you nah a real nigga breathin' accounted
At your funeral, just your parents and the preacher was there
Hollow, television name-dropper reachin' for help
So I ain't gotta say a word, pimp you beatin' ya'self
You gon' get what you deserve for disrespectin' the game
Any nigga with the nerve to say another man name
When that other man ain't even present
And deny it when somebody ask him about it
That nigga's a lame, you like to lie on the mic
Hide behind fame, I was a g when I came
That's the way I remain

Who besides the egyptian-walker, fuckers have a conniption
My existence persistent to bring foes misfortune
I dassle 'em, like the alderman, billy dee in mahogany, minus the perm
From the tiniest sperm that the mightiest the almighty can muster
Project prophet, chronic blockage gives alzheimer's to youngsters
Amongst them is me, can't remembers my beefs
With who? for what? they screw-face me up, my boo laced me up
Bolinsiaga, flimsy condo with bimbos in south of kalan gro in pimp mode
The inf' glow on his clothes and you know it's over
Hammer hit pin, pin hit shell, from the shell the slug gonna chew ya
Try not to lose me, I try not to lose'ya
Mama say mama sa mu makasa, fly to cuba
To chill with some politi-kill niggas who ill
'cause y'all niggas are losers, don't get comfortable nigga
Say hello to mr. bad guy, get that cash par, I'm the last don
You'll ever know so, here you go y'all can take these thoughts
Anyway I'm chargin' emcees a late fee cost
So when y'all done with my style, please break me off
But never make nas mad just in case cross
'cause ah, lately y'all don't make me happy
To calm my nerve I need the herb gnc don't carry

Who the fuck is that? it's ice cube motherfucka'
He's a maniac, no I'm a fool motherfucka'
Old school motherfucka', blow through a motherfucka'
What you heard about a nigga so true motherfucka'
See I'm ugly and prettay, I'm polished and grittay
Shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50
See, niggas get shittay when I come to their cittay
When I hit the spot that bitch they like, she cummin' with me
Cause I got an ego big as to, but I'm not an eagle
Bitch, I roll with rigo 'cause gangstas don't dance we boogie
I told you motherfuckas kobe didn't take that pussy
Get money, get paid, you can beat that shit
Even if the da is a piece'a shit
Colorado got movatos, don't eat that shit
Another white bitch lyin' on thee black dick
I keep it flippin' like flapjacks, pimpin' like black 'lacs
Give niggas flashbacks, they sweaty as ass cracks
When I hit the tar mat, it feel like a carjack
Niggas get out and vanish like star treks
So fuckin' incredible, I'm so fuckin' credible
No matter what happen, I'll never turn federal
And that's my report comin' straight from cali
Ice cube is the shit on this motherfuckin' grand finale",Grand Finale,2004

You can make a hundred calls and won't get 'em back pimpin
Try everything you know; its the ""L"" and the ""O"". Its the ""V"" and the ""E""
I can tell she a pro. She must have had a lot of practice
Kept her back on the mattress. Either I'm fuckin her good, or she's a damn good actress
All that screamin and hollerin, man she need to go home
I told her cum, take ya slutty ass and leave me alone. Punk bitch!

I put that dick in her mouth, you put love in ya heart
Throw somethin at ya boy in tha clique

Shot cum in her mouth, a nigga ask her for a kiss
The golden shower is the only time that yo bitch get this
Got (?) got da gat, head to ya crib
I done wrecked yo car, man them probably my kids
(on the other hand they not...man she swallowed that shit)
Man the truth is ya girl like to swallow dat dick!
So bow down to a pimp when a nigga come through
And you betta hide ya grandma 'cause I'll fuck her too

Man I love a dirty ass, 'cause you never see me comin' dumb bitch!

I thought it was da ""5-0"", sweatin us for that endo
But naw, it was ya wife, da neighborhood Bimbo
She lookin right, not too thick or too slim though
""What you ova here fo'? I don't understand
I don't know you from (?), is you lookin for yo man?

Bun B,"Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here
'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
To the haters that hate you the most
(Your heart's beatin')
And the friends that pretend to be your folks
(Your heart's beatin')
This is what revenge sounds like
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin'
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
Just make sure they learn the name
(You're not breathin')
That's about to be runnin' the game
(You're not breathin')
Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side

See I'm stunning for my niggas with this chromed out pipes
This swish interry foreign german life's (bitch)
And I keep this big toolie just protect my ice (holla at me nigga)

Cause in they mind, ain't no dyin, niggaz flip to get flopped
Shootin more than 50 shots and my heart catch not
When the gunfire a-start it ain't no callin the cops
Besides, you started beef, I'm just bringin it back
All my niggaz you hunt around so what you packin a gat?
Just leave that where it's at, or leave here on your back
Make one move like you're reachin and I'm leavin you flat
Warnings I'm givin you, but you never did listen
So I'm spittin Smith & Wessons 'til they out of ammunition
I'm clip totin, holdin rollin with my cousin Priest
I'm back, and ridin in the candy painted 'llac
We max, and gettin all these hoes for they cheese
We jack, and gettin all these ballers for they ki's

Didn't think that I would make it this far, throwin rocks at the pen
Left niggaz layin dead and I did it in sin
And I'd do it again, thugged out 'til the end

When the coast is cleared that's when I plan my escape
Wanted in 50 states, my first shot is debate
Don't be late, Buck we got hits to make
50 is you with me, if they really want me they'd come and get me
Now I'm a fugitive on the run, killers don't leave home
Without the gun, blaze one
They got me nationwide all over the world they tryin to turn me in
But the pearls, I think ahead on that
Fuck the pen, I'm tryin to see my money stacks
If you lookin for me I'm where the ballers at
Drinkin Cristal gettin smoked out
Try not to take the bar out, but they done, tapped my house
I'm goin all out, got me on some major shit
Dressed in black, when I attack, please believe that

I need to get my hands on somethin, I suggest you play it low
Get your last words in when the soldier's rag over my nose
Look the anger done build up, I'm damn near about to blow
Tryin to unhook a time bomb when I'm right at zero
Fuck a stolen vehicle, we gon' pull up in luxury
Bubbilize somethin, survive nigga you're lucky
When shit get ugly, bustin e'rythang that rush me
Swingin this fuckin chopper 'til my arms get musty
This occasion calls for military issue buddy
My fetti took a slight fall now y'all gon' be bloody

Ain't fakin none to DT's, you got it then come and get me

Nigga don't blow my high, don't blow my high
When I'm tippin' that purple rain
I know it makes em crazy, it keeps me lazy

When back in 94 as bruce steel had his gate up
He called me over to his house and he poured me a 8 up
I asked him what it was he said bun get ya weight up
This is lean, them white folks call it pearl methosine
Shit but we gonna probably drink dog cause that's what we be doin' to it
Now take this big red and pour about a 2 into it
I did 2's and 8's, what the fuck is you trippin' on?
He said man that's the ounces of cough syrup that you sippin' on
So shit I poured it I sipped it, then I sipped some mo
I fired up a green monster, and I hit that house
Started relaxin', shit and to my surprise
I was noddin' out lookin' at the back of my eyes
They tried to wake me up but shit I just kept yawnin'
I fell out of my chair and woke up there the next mornin'
God bless my nigga, cause its then I been spawned
On my white muddy go but cant taste a seed at all

Please don't blow my high
(blow my high)
When I'm sippin' that purple rain
(don't blow my high
Trust me you don't know my life)
Nigga don't blow my high, dont blow my high
When I'm tippin' that purple rain
I know it makes em crazy, it keeps me lazy


I roll it back, crack a dutch, have a sisip
Get introduced to this leaf in my splisiff
No stems, no seeds, no stissicks
The ultimate, experience like jimmy hendrix
I like to roll up, cowboy tradition
Or burn a peace pipe, and cythe like the injins
Or burn a big spliff, bob marley stile
Buffalo soldier, rosta farey stile
Smokes on pisurp
(we sips on sysurp)
Get it by the 8, by the pint
(or by the kisurp)
Some might take ya high, or a down
(or a bisurp)
Whatever you can stand, floats ur boat
(makes ya twisurp)
Yes I fucks wit you if you smoke on green
(or sip on lean)
Yea whatever, click or teen
(strip for a scene)
Nigga burn a spliff one time
(take me and swing ya big body Benz and I'm a swing mine)

Please don't blow my high
(blow my high)
When I'm sippin' that purple rain
(don't blow my high
Trust me you don't know my life)
Nigga don't blow my high, don't blow my high
When I'm tippin' that purple rain
I know it makes em crazy, it keeps me lazy

Trill is when you're hustlin', trill is when you're grindin'
Trill is when you punch in that clock overtimin'

Trill is when you hustle so you go out there and get it

Yeah, I'm all about the cheese baby, all about the cheddar
When it come to ghetto grindin' can't nobody do it better
A real go-getter, never hesitate to hit a lick
I don't have to even make a phone cal to get a brick
Ya find lieutenant on ya Sidewalk Two
At code fo'-twenty-'fo, he know just what to do
Bring me two turkeys back like it's Thanksgiving
That's how we do in Texas my nigga, so how you livin'
Up in the game since the early 90's
Never sleep to keep them haters one step behind me
Ain't nothin' changed but the time that they hand out
But even without the cars and the ice, we stand out
Cause everybody know us in the streets, we like royalty

I'm a survivor of the struggle, I live by the code
In the city where greed and envy make ya heart turn cold
At 17 years old I was ahead of my time
I had to roll with the punches and keep my ducks in a line
I keep my mind on my money, I keep my mind on my paper
I keep a glock inside my pocket for all these jealous haters
I trained for chess moves, I'm five steaps ahead
I keep my mind focused, make money, break bread
I'm rollin' 5 9, it's the home of the crack sales
That South Lee block got more cookies than Snackwells
I snatch you up like eatin shrimp, don't contest do not attempt
You crossed the line no turnin' back, we'll leave you naked like Larry Flynt
With young ghetto stars, certified with ghetto scars
Intoxicated by weed cigars, we eat stress by sippin' barre
Fancy cars and diamond ice, I'm intrigued by fancy things
We always keep it trill, in the hood we look like kings

This is for my gangstas, real niggas, ballas, trill niggas 
East side, West side, chunk ya deuce up 

Plenty niggas get they head turned red for da bread 
Start off with da information, load it up in ya head 
Couldnt hold it, so it turned out its somethin' he said 
Wut he tell da FEDS (he need someone to call) 
Your decision was to snitchin' and they was there to listen 
When he told what he know, said they barely was trippin' 
Less time, now da niggas in a better position 
Unless you count the fact that the streets know he was snitchin' 
He was lookin' at a 30 but he only did 10, 
How your years turn to months, can he tell you dat, and 
He ain't really gotta answer, just the sweat in his hands 
Will he make it out to make it, mm well it depends 
Everybody know the info you was tellin ya friends 
Plus the streets know the deals that you made with the pen 
Russian Roulette, yep nigga bet the barrel will spin 
You hear that, yea nigga that's the sound of revenge 

Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold
You betta take ya life slow or you'll miss it

You live life like a pussy then dats prolly what you die like

Rat snakes, yea mayne the game is full of wild-life 
Don't wanna do no time right? 
You wanna live that high life 
Like go withdrawal, have a hundred thousand in ya eye sight 
Enter ya crib, see the clouds peepin through ya skylight 
You be a copycat, (cat), 'cause mine right 
That's what he told me but I didn't listen 
Doin' crime for a dime wasn't my intention 
You insane, think his name sumin' I will mention 
Only snitches need someone to tell 
Alotta niggas in the game, hustlin' doin' they thing 
Usin' codes on the phone with they usual slang 
If you know what he know then you won't say a thing 
You wouldn't need someone to tell 
Careful bout the life you lead, ain't smart with ya life, 
You plead, the streets will ignite ya T, like you ain't got the right to breathe 
To choke on da realness, reality is what the fake don't know how to deal with 
Words leak from the teeth, but he'll say seal it 
Then go get a undercover brother he can chill with 
Find a nigga that be hustlin to make a deal with 
But the streets will hold court for him and'll deal with it 

Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold
You betta' take ya life slow or you'll miss it

This for the G's, street jugglin', move da fire 
When you talkin what you talkin' it ain't through the wire 
Police pull you over, now they callin' you a liar 
You got amnesia, don't even know the dude beside ya 
You don't know, you ain't sayin', you ain't heard what he said 
Told you a closed mouth ain't gon neva' get fed 
A open mouth'll get you county instead of the F-E-D-S 
Some scared niggas speak up so they'll be less in the red 
Niggas can't deal with no 95 so they day-to-day budgeters 
Its the hustlers that get put away by the customers 
You upstate, niggas use to be southerners 
Here the streets make the laws and don't answer the governors 
We the niggas that's too real to snitch on a snitch 
But make a snitch turn to puff with a flick of the wrist 
That ain't goin' get in arguments, just go get you a clip 
And they goin' think about the consequences, let em repent 

Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold
You betta take ya life slow or you'll miss it 
Listen to da G-Code, if you know what I know,

You peeping me take a picture, (you should take a photograph) - [2x]

Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback

Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph)

[Chamillionaire]
Introducing the truest voice of the South, it's who else but me fool
Don't let all that foolishness they feed you, on T.V. mislead you
Don't let all the magazines, and them papers out there deceive you
The cups that be used to sip, but Caucasian kinda like my tee do
You see that hand be glistening, you see the Sedans we flipping
The hundreds of grands we getting, these units of scans we shipping
You see that Caddy tipping, them thangs on that Caddy twisting
That paint and that candy dripping, that drank and that can is missing
That ain't a Cola, though dry and you feeling sober
Boys trying to switch it over, apply it up in a soda
Home of the Houston hustlers, who grinding and hit the quota
Who fire and hit the doja, you high when you sniff the odor
Told ya you gotta have, a foreign or buy your slab
Afford it then buy it that's, important without it now
You ain't gotta take college class, to see that we bout our cash
You not if you gotta ask, let's take a pic by the slab hol' up

You see my slab, you see my candy slab
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph
You see my chick, you see my chick is bad
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph

Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph

When I'm tipping they'll probably watch me, the cops'll be paparazzi
And try to patrol my posse, we shining and glowing glossy
The jealous will try to top me, we keep it too real to copy
What I'm listening to ain't a floppy, that disc gon be Screwed and Chop-pied
All the ballers will ride to this, deposit deposit slips
Buy the car and apply the fifth, raise the trunk an entire lift
Use to go to that Kappa, but Kappa ain't been as crunk
So I'm popping up at Daytona, on chrome and I'm popping trunk
Jamming that ""Ridin' Dirty"", while riding beside the laws
And they staring over at me, trying to scare me like I'ma pause
Tell 'em naw they know I'ma crawl, all day in the robber cause
I'm trying to go wash the ride, till them tires have whiter walls
You peeping him take a picture, that chrome and that paint official
You smoking then take a swisha, there's plenty just take 'em wit ya
You chilling you ain't a sipper, then I'ma be hanging wit ya
Take a hold of the grain and grip a, handful and smile for the pictures nigga

You see the bling up on my bracelet, and the shine on my chest
Syrup in my styrofoam, it's sweet with doja no cess
You done put it down with the rest, time to roll with the best
Cause when you ride with the original, you ain't gotta guess
I'm the connection that you need, when they say it's a drought
Cause it's not really a drought, them other niggaz just out
And I'm the plug you gotta have, when they say the river's dry
Cause it's not really dry, they just ran out of supply
I'm too fly for the clouds, too down for the green grass
Better wear tinted lenses, if you look at my clean ass
Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback
Candy still dripping, 4's is still tipping
Wood grain grass, steering wheel I'm still gripping
Repping for P.A.T., the West and the East
And I'm repping for Pimp C, till he get back on the streets it never cease

My life is real baby, ain't just a song (ain't just a song)

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Lately he been flippin' and, stayin' on the grind
Tellin' you that you fine, but he ain't spendin' no time
I be pourin' wine, tryin' to, knock out your spine
Make you mine, from behind, to some slowed down ""Bump n' Grind""
His thang like a dirty Sweet, from off the street
My thang like a O' of indo, from Sacramento
Lately y'all been monkeyin', he, call you a bitch
Keep me all up in yo' shit, try'na dig you a new ditch
Now I admit, that he rich, and that his money is good
Got my dicked sucked in his 'Six, I'm fuckin' on leather and wood
I'm just a yougin' from the hood, with some dick if ya good
With him, you know that you shouldn't
With me, you know that you should
Go pussy thug, like a glove when I push and I shove
Knock a dime out the climb, cause I ain't makin' love
See yo' man the type of guy, to get jealous and hit'cha
But me, I lick ya where he don't, and suck real hard on yo' nipple
My game is sharp as a cicle, she love my pickle
And if you gave her a dime, nigga she gave me a nickel
So while you thinkin', she done jet, she got my dick on her mind
Keep on neglectin' yo' gal, young Pimp C be spendin' yo' time

Is'a playa
Is'a mack
I love gettin to this ladies
But not more than these paper stacks
Now rule one, get your cash on m.o.b.
Keep paper in my pocket my nigga p.i.m.p
Don't hate me major
Just hate the game
The only reason your woman diggin' me 
Is cause I play with things
Don't take it personal my nigga
I dont love I'ma playa
She just gon' keep me company
While I get lifted and I lay her

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well naturally, I have to be, dead serious, maybe not
Let me tell a tale about this broad that thought she played me out
Yes, I was impressed, by the sex in her ass
W-U-I-S her, Versacci, down like Fran, dress her, bless her heart
She was a sweet-tart, but'cha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin' smart wit' all that ""you know"", comin' wit' he-say, she-say
From what she heard at the club, bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch, you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off, but the bitch was wrong, and you
You gon' let these messy ho's fuck yo' world off
I tried to love her man, but see love is one thang, and dumb is anotha'
Brotha', I'd be dumb to let her run thangs
I should've passed, but I was gassed, super-unleaded
And her nappy-headed ass gon' regret it, remember I said it
Cause I'm, in a sublime, new state and frame of mind
Cause it'd be a crime, for me to waste my time
My time

[Chorus]

(Verse 3, Twista]
Did you ever think about who's ass ya girl's was
Before the booty had became yours?
If a nigga's sane flows, you know everything goes
Fuckin' in it til' it's colorful as rainbows
Sportin' furry Kango's, she can't go, rockin' paid shows
Paper hard to fold, plus I roll slick, keep talkin' shit
If you don't like me, it's most like-ly, cause I done holla'd at yo bitch
Why she so thick? Tellin' lies and ya said to be believin' 'em
But I make her feel like ""Uh-huh"", can you do it? ""Uh-huh""
But when I scoop her up, she know that I'm the one to make a slut-cum
Gotta man, he a lame anyway, mother-fuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love, baby don't bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud, so we can fuck
So wassup? Now we in the Suburb', submerged, watch a movie
Or bumpin' U-G, K shit, scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man, yea I knew g, but she don't usually, say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka' wanna ball up and cry
Chicka-pow-pow, I love them thighs when I'm rollin' aside
I ain't gon' up and die, like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits, two blows
She heard my new shit, it was new clothes
New golds, carefully Herringbones, and cell-phones
But her friend home, now I'm freakin' two ho's
If ya girl be wit' me, somethin' nifty, she prob'ly wanna lick me
I'm the Twista, I flame a ho pissy drunk and drippy
Damn skippy, gamin' it from a shot of Mississippi, now pimp on

My butter seats reclined, cherry oak is grip
With see to blow, and purple rain to sip

Now straight up off the rip, I'm letting boys know
I've never been a bitch, don't plan to be a hoe
So if you got some plex, you better keep it low
I bring it to your chest, soon as you hit the do'

You know me as a pro, respect me as a vet
I put it down befo', you ain't seen nothing yet
My candy still glossy, my four's still flossy
My rocks real icey, I'm looking kinda bossy

And feeling real saucy, it's time to get it crunk
Now watch me pop it fly, just like I'm popping trunk
The leader of the pack, the star of the show
When Bun is in the building, you already know

I'm the man, he's a wimp
If you wanna get ahead, get a pimp
Dope boy shoes, big rings
And only bad bitches say my name, hoe

Bitch you wanna roll with a pimp, then have it on your mind
It's all about this bread, so you gon' have to grind
I gotta stay on shine, so you know what that means
You gotta hit that track, and bring me back that green

Cause daddy need his ice, and daddy need his chain
We gotta keep it G, so rec' him as the game
A hoe need a pimp, a pimp need a hoe
And tricks need us both, so let's go get that do'

In case you didn't know, I haven't been told
But pussy on the corner, and it's as good as sold
It's tricks on the prowl, so stay out on that stroll
Cause I'ma sell your cot, and you gon' sell your soul

My pimping way too cold, but it's gon' keep me warm
With minks up on my back, and rocks up in my charm
So bitch ring the alarm, and tell 'em I've arrived
The greatest ever born, that's dead or alive

Bun B,"Ladies and gentlemen of the southern States of America
We are gathered here today to bring you the beginning of a new era
And now the speaker of the South, Jay Prince

Ahh, yeah, rap a lot back in the house, once again
With the trillest of the Trill, Bun be
The new president of the South
Yo Bun, it's yo time, and we dedicate
This one to all our brothers and sisters
Who suffer at the hands of the innocent

It's been a long time comin' but it finally came
For Bun be to get his mutha fuckin' shot at the game
I put mo' work in than the average trill nigga can put
And I'm a gangsta from my head to my foot, blacker than soot

I got the hood behind me, the streets co-signed me
Head puttin' in the ghetto, man, you know where to find me?
The mission is laid out and the vision is clear
From this moment, I run the South and everything down here

That go from corners to cuts, trap spots to blocks
Whether it's rappin' or work, I got the shit on lock
I ain't all with that back talkin', sneak this in a plexion
I'ma tell ya how I feel 'cause I'm a goddamn Texan

'Bout time for me to start eliminatin' the frauds
'Cause it's a White House of cards, and it's filled with broads
We gone run them hoes out and bring them Trill niggas in
'Cause what happened in New Orleans should never happen again

They be sittin' on they ass doin' much about nothing
For too goddamn long and I'm tired of the frontin'
I'ma instigate a change from the mutha fuckin' top
'Cause this bullshit they pullin' on my people, gotta stop

So I'm here to make a stand and take up the slack
Dirty South rest easy, I gotcha mutha fuckin' back
It's a new king on the throne and his crown is a hat
That say, free Pimp see, now what's fuckin' with that?

Say, Nigga you can't run, nigga you can't hide
Know that we got guns, know that we gon' ride
Blow out your insides and leave you to rot
Cause when we give it to you bitch we give you all that we've got
Now all it takes is one shot to put your ass in a ditch
But you gon' get the other 49 for bein' a bitch
Go to war with the big men when it makes no sense to
Repercussions get extreme when we ride against you
Ain't no movie, your baby mama, teachers and your kids
Everybody finna get it for the shit that you did
So when I get to your crib, better come out swingin
Cause the devil ain't even ready for this hell I'm bringin
We don't want no dope
We don't want no cash
We don't want no excuses
We just want your ass
So when that front door crash, and you see them soldiers
When that gun go blast, don't say Bun didn't told ya

Fuck beef I got a K for niggas

Show ya how to get cha overs up and lock the grams
Boys know me in the hood, but not for rappin'
Back street trappin', front line, ya boys a captain
First nigga to shot, I ain't tryna talk,
Bring the heat to the hospital and finish you off
No life is a come up, when I'm rollin with my gun up
Don't get ya bitch gun, but nigga what you want, what?
And ain't shit to get ya family touched
Catch auntie on the bus, and pop her ass like a clutch nigga
I'm in the game cause I love the rush,
Love to bust
This fans money never enough nigga

Gave us the word, said we keep the bird
Leavin is for nerds, I put your brain on the curb, fucka
Pull ya piece nigga, and watch ya rest it
Come to this clip game, bitch I'm the best in it
The white flag you wavin, now it's on bitch please

Tried to let your ass make it, but your ass act a fool
Now the HK, the AK and the are is the tools

So tell ya mom and your sister break out the black dress

",Retaliation Is a Must,2005
Bun B,"Say, this is the realist shit I ever wrote or I said
Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed
Hurting my heart and hanging over my head
'Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred

see L Butler better known as Chad or Pimp see
The closest homeboy that I ever had
Now when we first met, we wasn't on the same page
From pettiness understandings that got cleared up with age

Two young boys who was ready to mash
Put P A on the map and maybe make a little cash
Jumped down with Big Tyme, put down a few songs
Everybody co-signed saying that we could do no wrong

Then hit the streets with a big ass bang
Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang
Dropped, ""Tell Me Something Good"" took off and went live
Shit, next thing you know we was signing to Jive

Dropped, ""Too Hard to Swallow"" ""A Pocket Full of Stones""
Put the remix on ""Menace"" shit we had it going on
Got, love in the streets and played on the air
But the homey putting us out, wasn't playing too fair

Had to separate ourself, bring in a new team
But sometimes the other side ain't always what it seems
We dropped ""Super Tight"" a album full of killer flows
But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes

We didn't realize what was happening on the real
And new management was cutting back room deals
Hiding different money and concealing the price
He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice

Took a while to catch on, to what homey was doing
But by the time we did, all the paperwork was in ruins
Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldn't file taxes
The next thing you know, IRS hitting us with axes

Pimp you owe seven figures, Bun you owe six
Better get your paper together, get this shit fixed
Remixed the management team and tried it ourself
Cussed out the GM, almost got put on the shelf

Fuck it, dropped ""Ridin' Dirty"" instant classic in the South
Reclaimed the southern title, shut everybody's mouth
Got some clout in the game, boys calling us the greatest
But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters

The old manager calling and say he fina' sue
And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do
Put a call out to the Prince, this nigga still hating
We got heat for the streets, and we can't keep the people waiting

He made a call to [Incomprehensible] and folks, telling the man
You gotta cut UGK some slack understand
Young Pimp got the plan, Bun got the drawl
Rap-A-Lot had our back and we just waiting on Jive

We got the big bosses on the same page
So me and young Pimp went hit 'em from center stage
Next thing you know we got this call from the N.Y.
It's Jay-Z saying y'all niggaz getting fly

He doing ""Volume 3"" and got a track from Timb
And wondered could some trill niggaz rock it with him
Shit big Bun was all for it, but Pimp wasn't sure
But ""Big Pimpin"" hit 'em 187-Pure

Number one song on every station you turn on
MTV and BET we getting our burn on
Grammy nominated can't believe that we made it
And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded

And it stated, that due to the success of the track
We here at Jive records, would like to piggy back
Get another beat from Timb, then get a verse from Jay
Let Hype shoot the video and we'll be on the way

Shit it sounded okay, but me I had to ask
If we don't do Big Pimpin 2, would you still put us on blast
A song like that might take a nigga to the top
But my true fan base, might think a nigga flop

They got mad and put niggaz on hold
For damn near a year till the buzz got cold
So we said fuck 'em and went back to the basics
Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix

We put ""Dirty Money"" together and it was aces
But that's around the time that Pimp caught two cases
He got probation, said, ""Fuck you hoes""
We finish the album, got ready to do a couple shows

And then he violated, one month before we dropped
And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped
Now 30 days done, we back to the nitty-gritty
Album got released, big showdown in Chocolate City

Niggaz with masks on, vests and all black
It's Christmas 2000 and 1, bitch we was all that
Strongest on the block, nobody could budge
And then he violated, now we right back before the judge

They calling him a nuisance, put my dog behind a fence
It was January 28th, he ain't been home since
Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses
Standing cold, CEO, now I'm the fucking boss

Had the devil on my back, got to drinking and drugging
Had to make a choice, get back to rapping or thugging
So I walked into my bedroom, got down on my knees
Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please

Let me get past this bridge over water that's trouble
And get back up on my grind on the double
He said son don't worry 'cause it's not really hard as it seem
And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams

You just got to stay true to yourself and succeed
Then push away from the devil and get closer to me
And every since that night man I promise I been on it
Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it
Pimp the pen like never before, I'm breaking 'em G

Not to mention I got the world screaming free Pimp see
So soon as you make parole and they open the doors
You ain't gotta worry about nothing, the world is yours
Ain't no mo' struggles my nigga and no mo' stripe
I kept it real because to me it's UGK for life

Raised in project apartments, with no front yard
Had to share their clothes and shoes with cousins and brothers
Never had they own shit, they had to share it with others

I wasn't born with a silver spoon sticking out my grill
I was raised in the middle of the struggle on the real

You got money, doing good, and they be all in your face

Soon as they think the party's over, everybody bails
Could a sworn they was your friends when your world was on shine
But soon as you get some time, outta sight, outta mind

It's a shame that some real ass niggaz took a fall
It's a shame how they treat you when you locked behind the wall
When your woman won't visit and your homie won't send you no flicks
Or come and see you, that's some cold ass shit

Before I pull up to the valet, and hop out of the car
It's already understood, that we buying out the bar
It's a line around the corner, people trying to get inside
But a playa like myself, is finna walk right by it
Now move the velvet rope, and keep the scanner
You don't wanna see us angry, like we David Banner
2000 and 5, Tony Montana haters
Ain't no need for you to knock us, just congratulate us
We done made it out the ghetto, by staying on the grind
We focused on the paper chase, with money on our mind
Now we just wanna shine, buy some bottles and pop em
So if you see niggas out there, playa hating then stop em
Cause we don't really wanna have, to bust a motherfucker's head
We just wanna holla at bad bitches, and spend this bread
We buying everybody drinks, and making it rain
Cause I'mma rep, like a motherfucking underground king

Before they hid it in the gas tank or the tire
Before a motherfucker even knew about a stash box
We just put work in the back of the car and mashed out

On the Interstate in a rental car you can find me
Suitcase is stuffed like a holiday Turkey
Chopper right beside in case a nigga try to jerk me

Bun B,"Ladies and gentlemen of the southern States of America
We are gathered here today to bring you the beginning of a new era
And now the speaker of the South, Jay Prince

Ahh, yeah, rap a lot back in the house, once again
With the trillest of the Trill, Bun be
The new president of the South
Yo Bun, it's yo time, and we dedicate
This one to all our brothers and sisters
Who suffer at the hands of the innocent

It's been a long time comin' but it finally came
For Bun be to get his mutha fuckin' shot at the game
I put mo' work in than the average trill nigga can put
And I'm a gangsta from my head to my foot, blacker than soot

I got the hood behind me, the streets co-signed me
Head puttin' in the ghetto, man, you know where to find me?
The mission is laid out and the vision is clear
From this moment, I run the South and everything down here

That go from corners to cuts, trap spots to blocks
Whether it's rappin' or work, I got the shit on lock
I ain't all with that back talkin', sneak this in a plexion
I'ma tell ya how I feel 'cause I'm a goddamn Texan

'Bout time for me to start eliminatin' the frauds
'Cause it's a White House of cards, and it's filled with broads
We gone run them hoes out and bring them Trill niggas in
'Cause what happened in New Orleans should never happen again

They be sittin' on they ass doin' much about nothing
For too goddamn long and I'm tired of the frontin'
I'ma instigate a change from the mutha fuckin' top
'Cause this bullshit they pullin' on my people, gotta stop

So I'm here to make a stand and take up the slack
Dirty South rest easy, I gotcha mutha fuckin' back
It's a new king on the throne and his crown is a hat
That say, free Pimp see, now what's fuckin' with that?

Hail to the chief",The Inauguration [Edited] [Edit],2005
Bun B,"Say, this is the realist shit I ever wrote or I said
Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed
Hurting my heart and hanging over my head
'Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred

See L Butler better known as Chad or Pimp see
The closest homeboy that I ever had
Now when we first met, we wasn't on the same page
From pettiness understandings that got cleared up with age

Two young boys who was ready to mash
Put P A on the map and maybe make a little cash
Jumped down with Big Tyme, put down a few songs
Everybody co-signed saying that we could do no wrong

Then hit the streets with a big ass bang
Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang
Dropped, ""Tell Me Something Good"" took off and went live
Shit, next thing you know we was signing to Jive

Dropped, ""Too Hard to Swallow"" ""A Pocket Full of Stones""
Put the remix on ""Menace"" shit we had it going on
Got, love in the streets and played on the air
But the homey putting us out, wasn't playing too fair

Had to separate ourself, bring in a new team
But sometimes the other side ain't always what it seems
We dropped ""Super Tight"" a album full of killer flows
But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes

We didn't realize what was happening on the real
And new management was cutting back room deals
Hiding different money and concealing the price
He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice

Took a while to catch on, to what homey was doing
But by the time we did, all the paperwork was in ruins
Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldn't file taxes
The next thing you know, IRS hitting us with axes

Pimp you owe seven figures, Bun you owe six
Better get your paper together, get this shit fixed
Remixed the management team and tried it ourself
Cussed out the GM, almost got put on the shelf

Fuck it, dropped ""Ridin' Dirty"" instant classic in the South
Reclaimed the southern title, shut everybody's mouth
Got some clout in the game, boys calling us the greatest
But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters

The old manager calling and say he fina' sue
And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do
Put a call out to the Prince, this nigga still hating
We got heat for the streets, and we can't keep the people waiting

He made a call to [Incomprehensible] and folks, telling the man
You gotta cut UGK some slack understand
Young Pimp got the plan, Bun got the drawl
Rap-A-Lot had our back and we just waiting on Jive

We got the big bosses on the same page
So me and young Pimp went hit 'em from center stage
Next thing you know we got this call from the N.Y.
It's Jay-Z saying y'all niggaz getting fly

He doing ""Volume 3"" and got a track from Timb
And wondered could some trill niggaz rock it with him
Shit big Bun was all for it, but Pimp wasn't sure
But ""Big Pimpin"" hit 'em 187-Pure

Number one song on every station you turn on
MTV and BET we getting our burn on
Grammy nominated can't believe that we made it
And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded

And it stated, that due to the success of the track
We here at Jive records, would like to piggy back
Get another beat from Timb, then get a verse from Jay
Let Hype shoot the video and we'll be on the way

Shit it sounded okay, but me I had to ask
If we don't do Big Pimpin 2, would you still put us on blast
A song like that might take a nigga to the top
But my true fan base, might think a nigga flop

They got mad and put niggaz on hold
For damn near a year till the buzz got cold
So we said fuck 'em and went back to the basics
Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix

We put ""Dirty Money"" together and it was aces
But that's around the time that Pimp caught two cases
He got probation, said, ""Fuck you hoes""
We finish the album, got ready to do a couple shows

And then he violated, one month before we dropped
And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped
Now 30 days done, we back to the nitty-gritty
Album got released, big showdown in Chocolate City

Niggaz with masks on, vests and all black
It's Christmas 2000 and 1, bitch we was all that
Strongest on the block, nobody could budge
And then he violated, now we right back before the judge

They calling him a nuisance, put my dog behind a fence
It was January 28th, he ain't been home since
Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses
Standing cold, CEO, now I'm the fucking boss

Had the devil on my back, got to drinking and drugging
Had to make a choice, get back to rapping or thugging
So I walked into my bedroom, got down on my knees
Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please

Let me get past this bridge over water that's trouble
And get back up on my grind on the double
He said son don't worry 'cause it's not really hard as it seem
And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams

You just got to stay true to yourself and succeed
Then push away from the devil and get closer to me
And every since that night man I promise I been on it
Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it
Pimp the pen like never before, I'm breaking 'em G

Not to mention I got the world screaming free Pimp see
So soon as you make parole and they open the doors
You ain't gotta worry about nothing, the world is yours
Ain't no mo' struggles my nigga and no mo' stripe
I kept it real because to me it's UGK for life",The Story [Edited] [Edit],2005

And all my gangsta niggas wild for me

This for them big, thick fine girls, diamond-studded belly ring
Niggas who be flippin' that work, screamin' money ain't no thing
Car clean, mouth full of gold with the princess cut rocks in it
Back pockets hangin' low because I got a glock in it
Straight out of that Memphis, Tenn Orangemound for y'all niggas don't know
Come flip with a pimp, let me show ya how to nuke that swing like I was Nino
Premro, Fat Boy, Eightball whatever y'all niggas wanna call me
Call me for a hot sixteen I'ma shine in the booth like a brand new bling
But I don't sing I bust them flows that go so tight with the track
Bitches get freaky niggas get crunk and don't know how to act
I got the sack roll something, pop that 'gnac and po' it
Ya fine bitches pop that puss like ya know it

[Chorus: x2]

I was movin' 'caine just doin' my thang
Down here in Memphis where we off the chain
Now, turn the top on my sixty-seven class then I'm switchin' lanes
I done served a fiend, sipped the lean, twenty-four inches don't cloud my screen
Roll candy paint, blowin' purple dank, they claim grip grain but I know they ain't
I'm posted in the club, we can get it poppin'
Ya violate my gangsta partner then it's bodies droppin'
I just come to party, get at shorty head
Do my thang, spit some game you know how Gotti play it
I'm like all these hoes gon' get it man
One of these hoes gon' get it man
From the 'Mound to the west to the north to the south
Yo Gotti gon' represent it man
No fitted man just a head band, Polo shirt and some Birdmans
Still thugged out and it ain't no secret
I got my paper out the drug zones
I got my paper out the gutter man
Sellin' bud man with my brother man
If you a North Memphis raised during my D Boy days
You'd see why Gotti still love the game
My wrist, my neck, my ear, my hand, my mouth look like a light show
Yo bitch, my bitch, his bitch, her bitch just hit the flo' and get it low

[Chorus: x2]

This for all my street niggas and bitches
From M Town to H-Town
Free Pimp C, shit

Here we come, we keepin' it trill
Ain't no need to ask if you see
Ain't nobody gon' keep it triller than me
Myself and I that's Bun B
I'm a G, I'm a boss, I grip grain and I sip lean
I'm ball all out with the biggest G's and spit and throw the sixteen
When it come down to the south you know that I'm holdin' the key
I be in the Caddy rollin' on women damn near older than me
Them screens six inches or better, the stitches in the leather
If the trunk is popped it'll show in neon get it together
Cause when I pull up at the valet man
Eyes is wide and them jaws is droppin'
Steppin' out the freshest clothes, brightest ice man the show is stoppin'
People start oohin' me eyein' soon as they see us
Women wanna be with us and fellas they wanna be us
We the G's and don't try to fight it, got dro and we fixin' light it
Laid back and that thang up on us we startin' to get excited
I'm ballin' with Yo Gotti and Eightball two of Memphis tightest
Cause we havin' a gangsta party man everyone's invited

No job, all they wanna do is smoke swishas
Get some money, ho; why you wanna watch mine?
Ain't no tellin' what I'm gon' be drivin' next time
Seven-figga, nigga; we don't buy the bar no mo'
Pull up the paper work, tell the owner he can go
Walk like a pimp, bitch
Talk like a soldier
I got New York niggas candy paintin' up they rovers
It say two hundred, but it go a little over
Not the Corvette, the Ferrari Testarossa
We can bet on any point on the dice
Pick 'em up, shake 'em twice, get 'em, girl
Look, I'm nice; I'm so clean with my G-Unit kicks on
I might be goin' in when pimp C get home
If you don't like me, say it to my face
Just because I caught a case don't mean you can't be erased

[Chorus]
It must be the ice or the money that I make
They talk behind my back, but they won't say it to my face
Ho, say it to my face (yeah), say it to my face (yeah)
They talk behind my back, but they won't say it to my face
It gotta be the cars or the trips that I take
That make 'em wanna hate; won't you say it in my face, bitch?
Ho, say it to my face (yeah), say it to my face (yeah)
They talk behind my back, but they won't say it to my face

[Bun B]
You can go anywhere cross the U.S.
From north to the south, east mid to the west
Walk up in the hardest hood, ask a nigga 'bout me
Bet they tell ya Bun B is straight mothafuckin' G
A gangsta from his toes to the top of his fitted
Trillest nigga in the flesh; you can't fuck wit' it
Got the German hand guns - they shoot two, two, three
Bust through ya condo and rip open ya knees (rip open ya knees)
My nigga, please, you don't want it; save your breath
By myself I'm a ride till no enemy is left
When the middle finger niggas hit your block like insurgents
There's no deterrence from us cleanin' your clock like detergents
Buck, they don't think I am nigga, please
Why, this pimp - I bet they die before they reach their first
Mothafuckin' sale
I rep' them underground kings; fuck boy pimp and bun
If it's action that you want, my nigga, come get you some

[Chorus]

[MJG]
They call me M-dot, MJG I mean
I'm packin' some weight
They ain't talkin' 'bout trill jeans
'Cause they like to talk shit in they uniform
Guess what, them niggas still phony as the unicorn
And I'll be damned if I run you bust though
They run outta guns; man, you so dumb
You faker than a bitch snitchen' on the track
I'm about to pull a bun
And bust a fuckin' cap

[8 Ball]
All Ball do is smoke weed and get bad bitches
And if y'all mad at me for that, then y'all niggas some bitches
Undercover groupie niggas want them stop and plead
For the last time I don't smoke regular weed
It don't matter where we at, man
We fire in it up
Security don't stop the weed from findin' us
Industry dick suckas, keep runnin' ya mouth
And I'm a give ya motherfuckers something to talk about

Damn, it can't get no worse than this cause I done hit rock bottom
I'mma get up on a muthafuckin' sack and a big ass bottle to solve all my problems
I'm goin' in circles man, goin' in circles man
Sometimes I feel like, feel like I'm goin' in circles man

Damn, if you a man put some muthafuckin' food on the table
That's what she said but still a nigga wasn't able
To get up some bread for the rent, lights, and cable
The gas and water
She actin like I'm tryna starve her
And I know the baby growin' and her belly gotta eat too
Only thing I got left is this gun on my belt, If I can't feed myself how I'mma feed you?
How I'mma ride with this tank on empty, sellin yola hoping that the jakes dont get me
Cause when I leave the crib man that thang go wit' me
My nigga from the jets got stained for a 50
Sack of the hard
Tryna match you a broad
Got 'em shot up in his car by a muthafuckin' dope fiend
A bitch tryna get a fix, put my nigga in a ditch, we been hittin them licks since we was 14
Now they say you in a calmer place
I couldn't tell by the looks on yo' momma face
Now everytime she look at me I see a look of disgrace
She disappointed by the dreams we was lookin' to chase
Cause we was cookin' the base and we was flippin' the spinach
And if a nigga violated then we handled our business
We never knew one day the street shit would catch up with us
And I don't roll with many niggas, you was one of the realest
I'm like

Shit kinda slow ain't no real money be comin' in but yo, I still got ten on the kil'
Ten on the drank, a nigga be on ten when I'm sober to get me over keep me full of the poison
My nigga Rich doin' a bid they sent the boys in, to get him if I would've been wit' him I woulda joined him
And now I'm out here lurkin' the streets wit' no work feelin' like my throat been cut wit' no plug
You know just what I mean if you ever done sold drugs, finna rob me a nigga cause I ain't got no love
And I ain't got no qualification for no career move, people up in corporate america probably fear dude
Gettin' shine off of my rhyme for like a year or two, still got the police lights up in my rearview
Damn, as I sit behind a tint, in a car full of smoke
Hopin' this officer don't do nothin' to make me have to hurt him cause it's over if I get caught up with this dope
Give me a coal, might aswell hang me from a rope
Cause the government lynchin' niggas more than ever before
Sort of like the slavery days but if we ? the change, then how the fuck is we supposed to grow?
They got a nigga like damn

All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut

Grippin' grain, switchin' lanes, sellin' cocaine outta' candy thang
Jammin' Lil' Wayne, gotta trunk of bang, 'cause I'ma ""Hot Boy"", gotta hot flame
And my hoes pay me, just like Baby, that's the only way they can lay me
Niggas shoot slugs but they ain't graze me, they want Sweet Jones be pushin daisies
But you slow and lazy, you can't fade me, that's the reason I knock ya lady
How you gon' pimp wit'cha dick up in her? I told the pimp God that you was a sinner
You takin' these square hoes out to dinner, the bitch chose me 'cause she want a winner
I mix her whole head up like a blender, hoe need a daddy, you see pretender
I used to be a young drug dealer, now I'ma young girl stealer
I hit the streets like just like Steve Jackson, nigga say my name watch the priest reaction
Sweet Jones or Sweet James? Switched my name and finger fucked the game
The nigga fell off 'cause his raps are shitty, plus a nigga need to move up out the city
The game gritty but the bitch pretty, lemme snatch the white girl up off ya titty
Ya heard me right, I play wit' what I knows
Wear platinum piece and wit' the Gucci clothes
Paid my dues, I ain't came to lose, I wear Marvin Blackman tennis shoes
In the winter time, mink coat to match and they on the floor wit' my candy 'Lac

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
Uh! I'm comin' out in that candy thang, 8 carats in my pinky rang
Drop the top in the parking lot so y'all can see where the deserts swang
Candy paint what I'm flippin' on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin' on
Momo wood grain I'm grippin' on, grippin' on
I said! Candy paint what I'm flippin' on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin' on
Momo wood grain I'm grippin' on, codeine in cup I'm sippin' on
I hog the lane in that candy train, swangin' left and right then I turn up the bang
I'ma say it for those who don't know my name, know my name
They call me Mike Jones and I blew up quick, Ice Age the name you can't tell by the wrists?
I sit on buck in that candy 6, and I keep that thing real handy bitch!
I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!
I said! I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!
I said! I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!

When I pull the slab out and hit the block, wit' them 4's and vogues they clankin' out
When they trunks pop, drop the top, don't be surprised you can go in shock
Wit' them neon lights, candy paint, belts and buckles across the back
Don't disrespect or call this a Cadi', maybe this more than just a 'Lac
Some like it white but I'ma go to green, purple dro up in the swisha
Horny ladies sittin' on the grill, wood grain to grip it's hard to miss us
We ""G"" so don't dismiss us, been here before gon' be here later
Down wit' that you understand the G Code and if you don't then you see hater
Insult, I can't roll wit'cha, it ain't how I do it man
I'm from Texas, P.A. to be exact where we screw it man {*screwed*}
U.G.K. for life is the family, that's how we get down
Bring them trill niggas to ya hood and shut ya shit down
Playa you need to sit down, you outta' ya league
Tryna keep up wit' the trill, you just might die of fatigue
You can't carry the load, you can't handle the weight

[Z-Ro:]
Remember me, when I use to write my rhymes in class
At Dick Dall Middle School, all them niggaz would laugh
Telling me I would never make it, cause I rap too fast
I was desperately trying to find out, how to go from scraps to cash
Remember, how y'all use to chase me home from school
Just cause I sported corduroy britches, and Pro Wing shoes
I use to have a lunch card, cause them times was hard
Since the seven people living in one house, with no cars in the yard
I remember stressing so hard, I couldn't keep my focus
My only love was for extras, and overs
Fuck all you niggaz, don't make me slap the fuck out all you niggaz
If it ain't related to making paper, I ain't calling you niggaz
I bet Mo City remember, when I took it over with rapping
51-11 Ridgevan, moving that crack bitch I was stacking
Residuals redeemingly, I was raw mayn raw caine
Rapidly running my neighborhood, I was the law mayn
'Member when I dropped my first album, in '98
Fucking with Herman Fisher, but now that nigga hate me he's a cake
Suppose to be mad at me, tal'n bout I owe him some change
Nigga just mad cause they can't eat with me, I eat with Lil' James
Rap-A-Lot Mafia my man, y'all remember the Maab
This isn't Den-Den and Z-Ro, y'all better remember the squad
Two different labels but the same cable, remember we connected
Woodfair to Missouri City, two block of Screwed Up Texas

[Hook: x2]
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes
They use to rank on my low budget clothes, and my glasses
Remember me, the same one they use to call egghead
Now I play with fed bread, and sleep on Gucci bed spreads

[P.O.P.:]
I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights
No gas no lights, a ghetto low life
So my flow twice as strong, from the memories
I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies
See niggaz tend to be, down when your bread up
But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck
Yeah I remember that, so you remember this
Hard times be my fuel, so I ain't finna quit
I vividly, R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R
Craig up in the E-R, bloody getting CPR
So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory
I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me
Me P.O.P., so many forgot bout
But not I, this for those who remember little Popeye
And I remember hot guys, ridiculed the flow
Now I'm front and center nigga, haters finna do me so

[Hook x2]

[Bun B:]
Shit I remember back in the game, it was tough
No matter what a nigga had, it was never enough
See if I had five I wanted ten, and if I had ten I wanted twenty
Fuck having some, shit I wanted plenty
Back in the gap, when I first hit the block
With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks
Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch
Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch
I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college
And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge
That broke her heart, and for that I had to go
So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show
Everything came slow, and nothing came fast
Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass
But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G
I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B

Young Pimp, know what we doin'? (Texas!)

Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut

[Pimp C]
Grippin' grain, switchin' lanes, sellin' cocaine outta' candy thang
Jammin' Lil' Wayne, gotta trunk of bang, 'cause I'ma ""Hot Boy"", gotta hot flame
And my hoes pay me, just like Baby, that's the only way they can lay me
Niggas shoot slugs but they ain't graze me, they want Sweet Jones be pushin daisies
But you slow and lazy, you can't fade me, that's the reason I knock ya lady
How you gon' pimp wit'cha dick up in her? I told the pimp God that you was a sinner
You takin' these square hoes out to dinner, the bitch chose me 'cause she want a winner
I mix her whole head up like a blender, hoe need a daddy, you see pretender
I used to be a young drug dealer, now I'ma young girl stealer
I hit the streets like just like Steve Jackson, nigga say my name watch the priest reaction
Sweet Jones or Sweet James? Switched my name and finger fucked the game
The nigga fell off 'cause his raps are shitty, plus a nigga need to move up out the city
The game gritty but the bitch pretty, lemme snatch the white girl up off ya titty
Ya heard me right, I play wit' what I knows
Wear platinum piece and wit' the Gucci clothes
Paid my dues, I ain't came to lose, I wear Marvin Blackman tennis shoes
In the winter time, mink coat to match and they on the floor wit' my candy 'Lac

Uh! I'm comin' out in that candy thang, 8 carats in my pinky rang
Drop the top in the parking lot so y'all can see where the deserts swang
Candy paint what I'm flippin' on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin' on
Momo wood grain I'm grippin' on, grippin' on
I said! Candy paint what I'm flippin' on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin' on
Momo wood grain I'm grippin' on, codeine in cup I'm sippin' on
I hog the lane in that candy train, swangin' left and right then I turn up the bang
I'ma say it for those who don't know my name, know my name
They call me Mike Jones and I blew up quick, Ice Age the name you can't tell by the wrists?
I sit on buck in that candy 6, and I keep that thing real handy bitch!
I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!
I said! I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!
I said! I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run

When I pull the slab out and hit the block, wit' them 4's and vogues they clankin' out
When they trunks pop, drop the top, don't be surprised you can go in shock
Wit' them neon lights, candy paint, belts and buckles across the back
Don't disrespect or call this a Cadi', maybe this more than just a 'Lac
Some like it white but I'ma go to green, purple dro up in the swisha
Horny ladies sittin' on the grill, wood grain to grip it's hard to miss us

Down wit' that you understand the G Code and if you don't then you see hater

I'm from Texas, P.A. to be exact where we screw it man {*screwed*}

Bring them trill niggas to ya hood and shut ya shit down
Playa you need to sit down, you outta' ya league

Bun B,"You,T, P, in the buildin'
Sinista on the' track

I'm ridin' dirty, way low to the grass
Whole hood payin' attention to me showin'
I just cooked up and the tube was fulled up
I sold my whole thang 'cause my dude and them pulled up

They talkin' about a nigga like a hurricane forecast
Boy kinda ignorant but he could move the fast
To hell with the talkin', we could go do it
The package right here, let's roll through it

I'm down South bred, that's what my mamma and my daddy say
Acts like New York and smoke the Cali way
Gutter, I hustled the corner, cuts and alleyways
Word mean nothin' to me, I'm goin' that-a-way

I got a dynasty and I ain't throwin' that away
I've been investin' my rhyme up on my strategy
And I don't feel that it's time to put the strap away
It's either that or just I'm full of that Alizae

We rock like that 'cause we rock like that
These you, T, P, we rock like that
We rock like that 'cause we rock like that
These Magnolia, we rock like that

You can get it quick to your head, homeboy
I don't think you wanna fuck with me
You can get it quick to your head, lil' mama
I don't think you wanna fuck with me

I don't cut no corners to jip for no figures
I ain't kissin' no ass to live with no nigga
I don't need this rap, bitch I'm in these streets
When Cash Money didn't pay me, I still got sleep

Get capped, you're on the phone, tell her I need the teeth
To set the nigga up to get his Jesus piece
She used to run it with Nate Dean, now she's a beast
Got her daughter sellin' for a 'G' at least

I move a lil' work, ain't nothin' to brag on
Somethin' to keep me nice and my homie to tag on
Twenty-four inch shoes on the rag on
I got poppin' in my hood and I'm that strong

Fiends keep smokin', please don't quit
You want another ?, Fiend on this
But watch it, the gun is under the shirt now
Me lead love and me will keep sendin' the work down

We rock like that 'cause we rock like that
These you, T, P niggaz we rock like that
We rock like that 'cause we rock like that
These Magnolia, we rock like that

You can get it quick to your head, homeboy
I don't think you wanna fuck with me
You can get it quick to your head, lil' mama
I don't think you wanna fuck with me

Keep it trill, keep it gangsta, pimpin' keep it hundred
Before a nigga be done got killed
And I'm the one who done it
I'm in H-Town baby, the home of the hoe sale
Where niggaz don't just give you a brick
They give you the whole deal

Drug deals goin' down at ten dollar motels
Keep it on the down-low
'Cause somebody might go tell
Like it, get you what you need, just have yo' mail
And send your people 'round here
So I can get some more sale

Know that I got more yayo that most niggaz goin'
I'm gettin' it from the same bringin' all the in
I'm 'bout to get it dropped off, I'ma let you know when
(Shit, I'm tryin' to spend like fifty wit ya, dog)
Shit, fo' sho' then

Bring your money with you, counted and wrapped up
And move like you 'sposed to be movin' because we strapped up
Don't get yourself clapped up for no reason
'Cause we won't hesitate
When it come down to the squeezin'

We rock like that 'cause we rock like that
These Third Coast, we rock like that
'Cause we rock like that 'cause we rock like that
These rap, a, lot, we rock like that

You can get it quick to your head, homeboy
I don't think you wanna fuck with me
You can get it quick to your head, lil' mama
I don't think you wanna fuck with me

And my motherfucking nigga Trae, asshole by nature

Black Chevrolet, with the paint still wet
J's on my toes, locs on my eyes
Crawling on fours, every time I slide by
Nothing less than the truth, on the streets of the South
Hos on my swag 'cause the diamonds in my mouth
But I move low key, posted in the trap
Raw with the rap, to put my hood on the map
I'm a do this one for H.A.W.K., and his brother named Pat
And my partna named Screw, so I let the trunk crack
What they know about that, haters better chill
Plus I'm packing something, that they classify steel

Screwed up click, I'm a let the world know

Moving so slow, banging my screw
Moving so slow, banging my screw

It's eat what you kill, that's the motto off top
Yeah, it's the A-Town, and the H-Town
Tell 'em this the shake down, lay face down

Split it down the middle, 50-50 that's the break down
Baby, keep your face down, and don't talk back

My guns go off, when my fists is hard
Mobbed up 'cause nigga pistols'll scar
You got your knife on you, homie, that's for twisting cigars
I got my knife on me, homie, that's for twisting your guards

It's going down, motherfuckers drizzown when they playing it deep
I do the damn thang, niggaz talking about it
I'm a problem run into it, you ain't walking up out it
Sensei'll fade the pack, I get mean
Lean on you with this beam, till you fade to black
Cuffing broads, cause I mack on chicks

Niggaz old school, still jacking my swag'
Y'all concerned about a playa, since the day of my birth
Grab a couple mill, and I can show you what I'm worth
Sitting so low, every time I come down
Trunk just popped, so I'm showing my surround
84's got me tipping, so low to the ground
Still hitting licks, moving off the Greyhound
Watching for the laws, I ain't fucking with the time
Bitch I'm in my prime, ain't no stopping my shine

I'm better than the average, I want her, I can have the chick
Doing the same pose as Paris Hilton in them camera flicks (haha)
The mathematics get big cause I'm demanding it
Raping the rap game while these other suckers is romancing it
They worried about its feelings, they don't wanna take a chance with it

You know the Feds are my biggest fans
I got to watch what the little one's saying, man
They see my momma and they wanna pull her over
Cause she ain't got no number on the back of the Rover
And yep, I'm locing
There's cooler ways to die but I'm smoking
There's cooler ways to ride but I'm soaring
Might do the young G5 or G4
Ay, you never know, when your boy might touring
Just trynna get me some air on Mike Jordan
Of this whole thing right here, I'm staring
Y'all boys just appear, I'm here, the Tardis
So applaud him, yeah
Chinky eyes, keep faring
Look like Keith Moorer, street aura, uh
Still I hustled in the street like he poorer
Run up on him you sleep and eat aura
Decent Christians, he owes momma, those
Gucci seatbelts will look better with the barker
Sit up in my office, you need to rebound
You got a box out, get up put a baller on

My ace boom coom, man we closer than ken
We've been on the grind, holdin it down
Till he got caught up in some bullshit, that got him some time
Almost lost my mind, started drinkin a fifth a day
Couldn't understand why they was takin a pimp away (Why?)
We right on the edge, we bout to blow
?? Need to go
Sittin in the cell watchin time go pass
Lookin at your kids and your momma through a glass
If I could turn back time I would of told him keep the glock down
But now I pray for the day he may get out 23 hour lock down

I got nothing to lose 

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin wealthy 
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Ever'day there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin'
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin' sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well

Me against the world
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Ooh yeah, ooh-ooh
It's just me against the world baby
Me against the world
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
Oh oh
Ha ha
It's just me against the world baby
Ha-ah, ha ah!
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world baby
Me against the world, ho ah
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world baby
Ha-hahh (hehe) heyy! 

With all this extra stressin'''
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest? Through this suppression
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game
It's just me against the world

Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
Oh ah
I'd be ashamed to lose
It's just me against the world baby
Me against the world 

Heh, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it

You can have the tail way from the shovel so we can pop the trunk

Let me talk to your boss man, the nigga wit the pies,
And back yo ass up and don't act so surprised,
When pistols start to cock, hands start to rise,
Nobody move too fast I advise,
Or you can catch a hot one right between ya eyes,
Recognize I done set me sights on the prize,
And put lights out with boom fifty bye, bye's,
I'm labeling my life off of rap and weed highs,
And ask my agent bout my fucking shoe size.,

Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there, cold, shooting some hoops

Cruising down the street in my 6 4, jocking a bitch jocking a bitch
Cruising down the street in my (who), jocking a (Mike Jones, Jones, Jones)

Well I'm cruising down the street in my candy painted low (low)
Bouncing like a door, with 4 on my 6 4's
I pull up wood gripping, doors tipping sitting low
I'm hitting sixteen switches watch it stop and hit the floor

I'm leaning on the curb sipping syrup blowing dro
The girls show me love when they panties hit the floor
I said I'm leaning on the curb sipping syrup blowing dro
I got the 6 4 hopping, watch it stop and do a show

First I lean wit it, then I rock wit it
I got a candy apple drop wit a glock in it
First I lean wit it, then I rock wit it

Coming down on that candy
With them swanger and them 4's
But I got love for the west coast (all day)

So I suppose I'm-a head out to Cali
The land of the low lows
Touchdown to L-A-X and I don't need no car
Robbie Chino pick me up with the bud and the bar

In the hood I'm-a star
So to the hood I'm-a go
With mike Jones and Snoop Dogg
And they already know

Then I get love from the B's
Love from the C's
Mexican, Asian that's a more of O G's
Throw it up when they see me

And holler hey Bun
When I'm coming out as soon as ansy gray one
You might see me at long beach
Or maybe Pasadena

Inglewood I e or West Covina

Car hopping, top dropping
The getting get good when I'm

With two girlies in the back in they Crip blue bikinis

Cold as the ice age

And take four tows

Bun B,"See when I got Mercedes money I went and got a Mercedes
When I got that Bentley money I went and got that Bentley
Now if you ain't help me get it don't tell me how to spend it
And yes I know the rules, never marry Robin Givens
Mozzarella over bitches
So we call me them bitches cheese heads
Lambo leap in that pussy like them green bay
Lambo sweet look like sugar on the freeway
And I'm riding dirty cause I'm so UGK
One, two, three way four an' four makes eight
Nine times outta' ten its an eleven or a twelve gauge
Friday the 13th that's the day that hell raised
But y'all boys too weak like fourteen days
I'm so clean why wouldn't I be
I be with Ben Frank so much he startin' to look like me
I'm a smoke my weed cause I don't wanna smoke yours
And I pour four every time I pour
Like, was you saying something bitch
If you talkin' bout us then you ain't talkin' bout shit!

I wake up this mornin' eyes half closed
And looked in the mirror and say damn I'm cold
Damn I'm cold and my hoes
Pimp shit nigga keep payin' my hoes
Damn I'm cold man I'm cold
I say damn I'm cold
Hot damn I'm cold

When I got that slab money I put the Remy on blades
When I got that lac money
I candied the Escalade
Gotta screw on my deck
A house or two on my neck
A couple cars on my wrist
And bitch I'm ready to wreck
We bout to this for Pimp C
So pass me a bottle
I'm bout to pop the top on em
Like a slab or a model
Turn it upside down
And pour it out for my lil' bro
And pass me another one so I can pour out a little mo'
Fresher than osmium
Cleaner than wax floors
I'm slick as aluminum
Swingin' my lac doors
The Franklin's you foldin' them
We tryin' to stack those
Before you play the role
You gotta learn how to act, hoes!
Swingers and crank foes
And tippin' trunks of pain
Hangers give neck and hoes
And flip with nuts and hang
It ain't a thang
It never was and never will
I put that on my life
Bun B forever trill

Fuck you right all right
Going at your neck like a fuckin' dog bites
I woke up this morning eyes half closed
Looked into the mirror and said damn I'm cold
Damn I'm cold and my hoe
Pimp shit nigga keep paying my hoe
Damn I'm cold man I'm throwed
I said damn I'm cold, hot damn I'm cold

Is it the ice in the piece or the ice in the chains?
Is it the ice in the watch or the ice in the rings?
Or the bracelet, face you feel the chill in yo veins
Could it be from Bun B or that boy Lil' Wayne

Or could it be the two-seater on them thangs
Got on a couple gold chains so dang it dang
I swang a thang, from lane to lane
Yeah, its getting hot and you starting to feel the flame
Bun

It's getting brick and you starting to feel a breeze
And the temperature's going down
Best'a get you some sleeves
And you best'a get you some G's
Fore you lose your control
And we turn your whole neighborhood into the north pole

Like brr
Machine gun brr
I am a beast grr
Money machine brr

I say I know when they say freeze
Yeah!

Ok you already knew
No pussies, no rats, no Tom and Jerry show

I say damn I'm cold

Jockin? a bitch, jockin' a bitch

Yeah man, let me explain somethin' to you one time, man
Low ridin' is not a sport, it's a way of life
It?s like buildin' a car from scratch, you understand me

You gotta put the fresh paint on it
You gotta put the mustard and mayonnaise
That's the tires, you understand me
You gotta put the chrome on it
A little gold on it, you understand me
It?s gotta be a hundred spokes or better, ya dig?

An' you gotta drop the top
You gotta put the switches on the motherfucker
You definitely got to have a beat
And when you hit the streets you gotta have a freak
You know what I'm sayin'
One of the side, two on the be-sack
That's how it's gotta go down man
That's real lowridin?, you understand me

From a West Coast motherfuckin' G man
We bouncin', we schlippin', we tippin', we dippin'
We dodgin' motherfuckin' pigs all the while
While we doin' this motherfuckin' gangsta style
You understand what I'm sayin', yeah I'm just cruisin'

Cruisin? down the street in my 64
Jockin? a bitch, jockin? a bitch
Cruisin? down the street in my 64
Jockin? a bitch, jockin? a bitch

Cruisin? down the street in my 64
Jockin? a bitch, jockin? a bitch

Stomping, the harder I march, the ground will break

Yeah, I run this shit, but I'll tackle it
You want me to break it down, I'm a fracture it
My mind is wanderin', I can't find it
But ten times outta ten, my mind on the money

Bun B,"Man f'real I love bein' from the Dirty South man
It made me the G I am today, made me the hustler I am today
The grinder, the baller, the gangster I am today man
Lot of people got opinions and, issues and, problems with
What they see comin from the South and who doin what in the South man
But I'mma tell you like this
Fuck you dawg, this the South nigga
We gon' be here, we been here, and ain't goin' no-motherfuckin'-where
Take it how you like it, hate it or love it ho!

It's that candy paint, 84's, belts and buckles, chrome and grill
Leather seats, stitch and tuck, TV screens and wooden wheels
Suede roof, neon lights, Vogue tire swang and bang
Tops drop, blades chop, fifth wheel just hangin' man
White T's, fitted hats, Jordans under dickies (Dickies)
That Swisher sweet, cigarillos filled up with the sticky (Sticky)
The fifteens bam'n and the bass kick-kickin'
Cadillac do's slammin' on them po'-po's tippin'
We ain't trippin' just flippin these haters dip when they see us (When they see us)
'Cause they could never beat us best us or be us
I'm a G that's a genius, best to just respect my thuggin' man
It's the South, ain't nothin' above it and that's why I love it man, f'real

You're everything I knew! (Oh yeah)
Do what you want me to (I will do anything)
Get on my knees for you (Oh baby)
What else is there to do (I don't know, I don't know, but I'll cry)

Pray at night when you sellin' white, got one ki' tryin' to sell it twice
Yellow stones all in my shit, yellow bones all on my dick
Honeycomb I call my crib, money long that's on my kids
R.I.P. to my Uncle Chad, UGK you can't fuck wit that
Niggas fake, they hate candy paint, and all the paper that your partner make
Shakin' dice like a face of life, champagne just ain't tastin' right
Haterade they Gatorade, look at these seats they gator made
Friend or foe niggas never know (Know) never know when you fin' to blow

Dude scrapin' the curb, dippin' sippin' some syrup
Fingers blistered twisted Swishers, Pimp died and it hurt
But I handle my issue, I got several pistols
That won't whistle, missles knockin' gristle from fatty tissue
Mississippi's my home, 'til I'm die and I'm gone
I know I put it on my back, held that bitch up alone
With no label backin', pride split into fractions
I hit the ocean on peggy bustin' back at the crackin' (Y'all scared)

You're everything I knew! (Oh yeah)
Do what you want me to (I will do anything)
Get on my knees for you (Oh baby)

You say door, we say do', you say four, we say fo'
You say whore, we say ho, you want more, but we want mo'
What else is there left for me to do?
This the dedication from me to you
The South, I know you gonna see, me through
So until I die I wanna be, wit'chu, you're everything

You're everything I knew! (Oh yeah)

There's an angel in the sky watching over me 

[Verse 1:]
They say its always darkest before the dawn 
And that you don't know what you had until it's gone 
I thought I knew what I had but I was wrong 
And thats why I gots to write this song now 
Come on now come on say man I thought it would of been a long time for us 
And many more years on the grind for us 
I thought the future held a lot for us both 
And it was brighter we were super tight 
But finna' be super tighter 
I guess I just assumed we had more time for us to make more music 
And write more rhymes 
But never in my life could I ever have seen 
That I would ever have to lose the other half of my team (for real) 
And take away the glitter the gold and the gleam 
Say man I wonder to myself what does it all really mean 
Nothing without the people you love say man I miss my brother 
But I know he's looking down from above 
And thats an angel

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2:]
It all began on Shreveport Ave sittin' off in the den 
Making beats and puttin' paper to pen 
We was determined to win 
And you couldn't tell us different 
Mama West was cool with it 
But Monroe kept trippin'
It seems just like yesterday sometimes 
Sittin' in ya bedroom writing dumb rhymes 
Man you makin' beats on the insonic 
And we was smokin' dirt weed cause it wasn't no chronic 
I still remember when we started the crew 
It was me Mitchell Queen Jamal Jackson and you 
Started out as 4BM but then we ended with two 
Thats when we introduced the world to the U 
To the G tot the K Underground Kings DJ Byrd Pimp C 
And Bun B we kept it G say word 
Who would'a known back in 92 in 2008 
I'd have to write this song sayin' I miss you but its true

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3:]
Just for the record let me go ahead and say 
I love my brother Pimp C 
And man I miss him everyday 
Yeah my heart still hurts 
And the pain still fresh 
But I'ma put God first 
To keep that pressure off my chest 
And remind me that I'm blessed to have had him as a friend 
A ride or die homie that was with me till the end 
Real talk man we was closer than kin 
And I know that I'll never have a partner like that again 
So Chad Butler I just want you to know I keep ya memory close I'm never lettin' it go 
And they gon' always remember that you was here mayne 
Cause I'ma make'em remember thats why I'm here mayne yeah it's still hard 
And I still cry but you and God keep me strong so I'ma still try 
Reppin' this UGK now won't I 
Cause through your music you live forever so, trill don't die

I know your watching over me
Last night I saw you in my dreams
At the crossroads ill see you there [x2]

Cant wait to see you again

Since 92 and slangin' it still 
So bring who you feel bring who you feeling 
Bring em around and I'ma lay them down its just another sound boy killin'. 
Rude boy wanna test better make sure rude boy got on his vest 
Walk with a bunch of bananas on his chest. 
These monkey niggas on that monkey shit. 
Best keep a revolver I boss like a gorilla and kill 'em with a revolver. 
So go on pimpin you's a chimp and I'ma do that 
You ain't ready for the blow-back 
DJ you already do that 
So bring who you wanna bring on I'ma go King Kong

But every time they gave me my mic he told them hoes to let me go.

In Americas most wanted I missed that Pimpin' and Pac 
So it seems that me and Bun B is the realest people you got 
My paper chase gettin' faster I'm even beaten the clock. 
When it comes to gs the tick tock is gonna get beat to the dock. 
Gave birth to the hustle so let my fetus be shown 
When I pull out them baby Benjamin's and I skeet on your dome. 
I'm secreetin' the dough so don't leave your women alone 
Ill turn my dick to a dollar and give your women a loan 
My presence on the Texas streets is somethin' easy to spot 
I'll assassinate concrete for the G's I'm bleedin' the block. 
Boys'll see me on swingers and think its easy to plot 
But I bet them boys behind me wont be beamin' up Scott.

This is where we take a journey called karma
What goes around comes back round
Especially in the rules of these streets
Its a bloody war in the rules of engagement
Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth
Justice in the eyes of a gangster

Hey, Mr. Preacher man what do you say, 
See you out here tryin' to save yourself some people today
You got the good book in your and a robe on your back
Steppin' out your 2008 Escalade Cadillac
You standin' up in the pulpit lookin' out at the peau
Preachin' the good word and tellin' Christian folks what to do 
You talkin' bout the sinners and sinnnin' but lets keep it true
Ain't nobody in this church a bigger sinner than you
Lets chapter this, first pact, pass the plate, pay your ties
Puttin' rings on your fingers and rims on your ride
You don't need a thousand dollar suit just pray in 
Or a million dollar house for you to stay in 
Marriage counseling but cheating on your own wife
Undercover pedifiler even in your own right
Let the door knob hit'cha where the good lord split'cha
You's a dirty motherfucker so its time to get cha issue c'mon

The good book say, he who is without sin cast the first stone
Man everytime I walk in the church house 
The preacher cuttin' his eyes at me
For that though, he cant throw nothin' my way
He dirtier than I am
Ridin' down the street shinin', ballin'
Hollerin' at broads, hollerin' dudes on the cool
Thats why niggas dont go to church now
It ain't the message its the motherfuckin' messenger, 
Let us move on

Hey Mr. Policeman what do you say
I see you out here tryin' to save yourself some people today
You got the knight stick in your and the walkin' your beat
Or in the blue and white car drivin' down my street
You say you hear to help the people and do us some good
Protect and serve and try to keep some peace in the hood
Claim you crackin' down on the crime but lets keep it true
Cause the biggest criminals in my city is you
You know police brutality is at a all tiem high
Pumpin' 61 slugs into an unarmed guy
Try to say that he was sellin', had a motherfuckin' hand gun
When you couldn't find one, you motherfuckers plant one
Rampart scandal Tupac Shakur Christopher Wallace, you got me sick
But who got the cure,
If the PD went M-I-A we wouldnt miss you, 
You some dirty motherfuckers and its time to get cha issue c'mon

Look at this shit manj
I'ma do dewalla, Sean Bell, Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G
Motherfuckers is dieing out here man
And if the poilice aint killin 'em
They don't give a fuck about the weak, 
Nobody tryin' to figure out who killed these people
Fat Pack, Big Hawk, the shit ain't right man'
Good cop, bad cop, the line blurring everyday, let us move on

Hey Mr. Politician what do you say?
I see yourself tryin' to save some people today
You tellin' us its time for a change people is dieing
And the current administration is doing nothing but lieing
You come down to my community and tell us your goals
To clean the system up and get the crisis under control
Claiming you get us on track but lets keep it true
The man motherfuckers keepin' us off track is you
Damn near everybody runnin' is a member of the senate
And voted to send us to war, so yall gotta send it
Now the shit done hit the fan and now you tryin to say
You wasn't down from the jump, man this shit wont play
Yall some liars, stealer's, vallanderers and all
Got senate to suck your dick inside the bathroom stalls
Now elected officials lettin the dick kiss you
You's a dirty motherfucker so its time to get cha issue c'mon

Motherfuckers overseas dying in that war, 
We jsut got rid of a prison and 
Now he just wanna sit back and get his dick suck all damn day 
Now we got motherfuckin' elected people in office
In airport bathrooms suck dick,
Tappin' people on they feet and shit

We survived but most of us die for some bullshit
Go to church but the devil's standin' on the pulpit (damn)
Niggas lied just to kick it (what) swear to God they got a meal ticket
Then they call you and they bout to get evicted (I know)
A Underground King, I've been one ever since I was sixteen (c'mon)
Pimp and Bun'll tell you just what Buck mean (what's up)
A street nigga livin' the street dream, I seen (for sho')
My whole team go to the feds or get a hole in the head
This what I said (yeah)

[Chorus: x2]",If I Die II Night,2008
Bun B,"I hear we livin' in the last days
Its revelation and you best get right with god
Or else is waitin', the world is comin' to an end
Everyday is a storm or a flood, tsunamis, this shit ain't the norm
We got Katrina and Rita minds keep collapsing
With the fires and mud slides, I'm like whats happenin'
Got the kids in the school gettin' raped and molested
Under-funded, unprotected no wonder they tested
And the lowest percentage rate, 
In my city damn near the lowest in the state
You can equate that to the state funds 
That ain't breakin' down right,
Rich districts get more and poor ones less, and it just don't sound right
So I'm fittin' to pound right on the doors of my city hall
And kick them doors down, they killin' my city yall
We need to get my people back to where they should be
And since nobody else is gonna do it its gonna have to be me

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
If it was up to me, 
No gun, no crack, or whore could of comin' in our community
If it was up to me,
You couldn't have no war between Tupac and B.I.G
If it was up to me, 
They couldn't lock up Shyne and they couldn't lock up Emcee
If it was up to me, 
You wouldn't have no aids and you wouldn't have no H.I.V

First of all the projects is fucked up
And it ain't just with the drugs, 
We got more problems than just the dealers and thugs
They using lead based paint, and investments is killing us
We tell 'em to fix it up but they just ain't feelin' us
They rather kicks us out and tear it down to the ground
So they can put up a parking lot, a mall, or some condos
Condemn the whole place cause if you sell crack 
Shit the rest ain't do nothin' wrong, what the fucks up with that
They say one rotten apple can spoil the whole bunch 
But we talkin' bout some people not apples, this ain't lunch
Make me wanna punch a politician dead in his face
You say you represent my district, get your ass on the case
Development is good for the hood yeah thats what you tellin' us
But bitch you on the pay roll of the builders and developers
Fuck what you sellin' us, pipe dreams for suckers
You can take that around the corner to them other motherfuckers man

So much youth they sacrifice
Just to live in paradise
Play they tricks and tell they lies I know
Its hurting to see how they treat the poor
They have so much and still they still want more
I see my people everyday on the floor

[Chorus]

Its time to educate the people man, free school and college
So everybody cross the border can get the same knowledge
 education leads to jobs and jobs kill poverty
And no more poverty means we makin' money obviously
Everybody makin' money everybody smilin'
Motherfuckers ain't eatin', them motherfuckers wildin'
Matter fact speakin' of eatin' lets feed the homeless in America
Let these motherfuckers handle their own shit
How am I gonna clean your house, and mine still dirty
How am I gonna feed your kids, and mine still thirsty
And speakin' of the kids we need to spend some more time with 'em
Cant turn 'em loose in the streets, cause they dying in 'em
And all this naked ass sex man you trippin', fuck love 
Im livin life you aint gonna catch your boy slippin'
You say your boy trippin', I'm just keepin' in it G
Cause you could see how good the world would be if it was up to me

[Chorus]
 
So much youth they sacrifice
Just to live in paradise
Play they tricks and tell they lies I know",If It Was Up II Me,2008
Bun B,"There's an angel in the sky watchin? over me
There's an angel in the sky watchin? over me

They say it's always darkest before the dawn
And that you don't know what you got until it's gone
I thought I knew what I had but I was wrong
And that's why I gots to write this song
Now, come on, now, come on

Say man, I thought it would?ve been a long time for us
And many more years on the grind for us
I thought the future held a lot for us both and it was brighter
We were super tight but finna be super tighter

I guess I just assumed we had more time for us
To make more music and write more rhymes
But never in my life could I ever have seen
That I would ever have to lose the other half of my team

And take away the glitter the gold and the gleam
Say man, I wonder to myself what does it all really mean?
Nothing without the people you love, say man I miss my brother
But I know he's looking down from above and there's an angel

There's an angel in the sky watchin? over me
There's an angel in the sky watchin? over me

It all began on Shreveport Ave sittin? off in the den
Making beats and puttin? paper to pen
We was determined to win and you couldn't tell us different
Mama West was cool with it but Monroe kept trippin?

It seems just like yesterday sometime
Sittin? in your bedroom writing dumb rhymes
Man, you makin? beats on the Ensoniq
And we was smokin? dirt weed ?cause it wasn't no chronic

I still remember when we started the crew
It was me, Mitchell Queen, Jamal Jackson and you
Started out as 4BM but then we ended with two
That's when we introduced the world to the you

To the G to the K, Underground Kings, DJ Byrd
Pimp see and Bun be we kept it G, say word
Who would?a known back in ?92, in 2008 I'd have to
Write this song sayin?, ?I miss you? but it's true

There's an angel in the sky watchin? over me
There's an angel in the sky watchin? over me

Just for the record let me go ahead and say
I love my brother Pimp see and man, I miss him everyday
Yeah, my heart still hurts and the pain?s still fresh
But I'ma put God first to keep that pressure off my chest

And remind me that I'm blessed to have had him as a friend
A ride or die homie that was with me till the end
Real talk man, we was closer than kin
And I know that I'll never have a partner like that again

So Chad Butler I just want you to know
I keep your memory close, I'm never lettin? it go
And they gon? always remember that you was here, mayne
?Cause I'ma make 'em remember, that's why I'm here, mayne

Yeah, it's still hard and I still cry
But you and God keep me strong, so I'ma still try
Reppin? this UGK, now won't I?
?Cause through your music you live forever, so Trill don't die

I know you're watchin' over me, last night I saw you in my dream
At the crossroads, I'll see you there
My friend, my brother till the end can't wait to see you again
Save a place in heaven for me

there's an angel in the sky watching over me
There's an angel in the sky watching over me

No tint fishbowl it ain't hard to spot him
Think we got a problem, weed got too much
Only thing damn I'm down to my last dutch
Think we got a problem, but really it ain't dough
There's one of me, and these bitches I count about three four
Think we got a problem, the homey just all talk
He ain't gon' pop a balloon with a pitch fork
Think we got a problem in the club with this dogg

Dominican chick ridin' shotty all strapped in
Customize the dash on my shotgun strapped in

Time to fade to black cause I ain't pullin' ova
The engine is a problem, that ain't no question
Pop the trunk see the speakers kickin' like Beckham

Think we got a problem, Sheek know I'm hot
Kiss and Styles should make me a member of the Lox
I take all the beats, I remember how to box
If I ever get knocked out, I remember how to pop
Remember how to load everything inside my glock
Ask the niggas in the hood 'cause they remember who I shot
Think we got a problem, I snitched on myself
And I hate rats so I dugg a ditch for myself, what

You see me one deep in the spot, think I'm slippin', try ya luck
'Cause I got sixteen homeys with me, that stay ready to buck
You can duck dodge or dive, but it won't do diddley squat
But leave ya with a leaky liver and both ya kidneys shot
But you may not pimpin' I ain't fin to ask for it

So I pack and tote my thump

And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can to your target
Nothing can save you know

See you dun push the wrong button
And cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka, it was mine

Time and time
They get me out the tandem
Me are da true, I traded mine in
For caveman king

You don't wanna fuck with
The Southside Gotcha boys
Y'all ain't know trill ass niggas
Y'all some boxy boys

And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet, I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks, I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the street life

Homie, I live, wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top, east to the west
All I gotta say is Khaled, nigga we the best

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Yo, bdah, bdah, bdah
Khaled, go let me see 'em
Hand me the fucking clever
'Cause I got a fucking fever
For all the evil Kinevel people
Who try to stunt

Call me Danny Glover
I'm lethal this ain't no sequel
Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Nothing can save you now

Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon' shoot a hundred rounds
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old Chevy and Figaro
Blood shed apart my feet

And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me, I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye

Ring the alarm, tell 'em people come, come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun, yeah
It's the final warning

Khaled, these niggas talking
I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one, ain't golfin'
I'ma put his whole unit in a coffin

'Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'ma open his ass off, like suicide doors
Any badass niggas, y'all scared of that lake
I'ma tell you once don't be scared of the Dre

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who your calling
Nothing can save you now

I'm usually cool, but know I gotta bet back
I tried telling ya, ain't wit'cha death threats
I let my nigga know, tell 'em go hammer that
And it ain't gon' take all day
We know where you live at

I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep 'em mad shawty
That's how we kill 'em babies
Holla Khaled, and tell him I'm on the way now
I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town

Look at me it's shawty
So bossy, and I don't feel like that
Can't stop me now, now, now
You see what's happening?
Big shit dun popped off
I'm the best nigga, you can ask Khaled
I'm the best nigga

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you're calling
Nothing can save you know

Say man she don't stop, she get it get it 
Baby girl the way she did it 
Way she works her body Makes a playa wanna hit it 
Did it up and down, then she shook it all around 
Shorty look at that and then she dropped it to the ground 
Now I'm thinking I done found her panties roaming in the town 
This girl was cuchie down, backside wasn't leaving ground 
I was on it like a hound 
Got at her on the double 
But been all up on her bubble 
Say man this girl is trouble 

Baby girl you know your sexy 
The way you move your body 
Hope the music never stops 
I like the way you wind 
Don't pay me no Attention 
I'm just admiring that body 
I'm enjoying my view, strickly from behind 
Your back, your cold, your good at what you do 
Don't stop, its working on the pole 
You don't know what you bout to get into 
Do you girl, you better watch yourself

C-could I be that nigga rejuvinatin' l-lovers 
D-d-d-did I stutter the missing piece of the puzzle 
Feel like the only rapper that look at you with no trouble 
Its easy on TV make them believe what they be seeing 
M-mirrors never lie so they keep eyes up on they re-runs 
For fear of what you show them, reality is golden 
Real recognize real, you need some IV's to be noticed tho 
One of the coldest to mix pro-tools with your vocals 
What the fans can't see that mm-mirror gon' notice back

Mirror mirror on the wall, Is it right, is it wrong? 
It ain't hard, swear to God. These niggas ain't real at all 

Say there Mr. Mirror, put yourself up to yourself and in 
Just take a look at the reflection that's reflectin' in 
Your own physical, superficial not spiritual 
All the possessions you possess, and they can't keep your spirit full 
You need to hear it fool, but you dont want to listen 'cause
You so f-full of your-s-self and you just sit and judge 
You point em out, and call em up, and then s-sit em down 
Then you put fertilizer, lyin', spread the shit around 
But if you took a second Mr. Mirror, you would see 
That you just mad at you man, you aint really mad at me 
You took the hatred of yourself and just projected out 
No disrespect, you can't respect yourself then just get out 
For real, you need to go away just like the rain song 
'Cause you f-frontin' and f-fakin' its just plain wrong 
So Mr. Mirror, man I'm just gon' keep it G 
If you can't look up at yourself, 
How the fuck you lookin' at me, mane.

M-m-mirror, t-t-tell me she the realest. 
I met her in the club and she wouldn't let me in it 
S-seen her in a video, seen her in a magazine 
See me I ain't frontin', we ain't see them titties last week 
So far you nasty, ff-fuck you call that? 
I call that insecure, sh-sh-shawty think she all that.

Fearin' what it show you, reality is gold

And all my D-C girls getting them ass shots,
Got em for a reason shortie, go ahead buss it open,

The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

Yeh this the city that's slow, the city that's thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
Where they sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)

Believe it you can playa hate but take it easy
We done got the streets me and jeezy learned from the game
How to stack the breezes got love from the hood
So it's all good er both goin eat me
And jeezy riding down the highway (zoom, zoom)

She roller coaster ride me in the projects
Where ya find I got the whole hood behind
Me my records selling out the stores
Now my money on 4s now you best believe it
They feeling me from Alaska to Tennessee
From the east to the west coast I smoke
What the best smoke we pushing Lambos, Phantoms,
And Bentley coupes now people hollerin' out
The window ay boosie you got the juice now

Brick on top of brick laid my foundation
And I built my house and it was mixtape after mixtapes
And next thang you know I was running the south streets
Introduced me to the trap see that wasn't enough
I wanted the world that was round time my album dropped
And the next thang you know I was running
The world it it what it was was one of the girls
Jeezy wanted one of the girls ima super nigga need a cape
For me real street niggas can relate to me it
Would be a big disappointment
I would hate to be at the wrong place at the wrong time wrong line,
Wrong name, right car but the wrong thang, can't tell me shit
I'ma grown mane 16 years ols wit a old thang didn't eat for days
And months 2 A.K's and a box of blunts if money you want
Then it's money you get hanging wit blow it's money you get ever
Believe that I'd ever believe that I'd ever achieve what I ever achieve

Stop this bitch let me tell the world some
From the bottom to the top shoulda seen that shit me
And my lil' thug gotta it from the mud every thang
I spit I really mean that shit it's crazy
Ain't it hard to explain it I done got famous
All I did was brang it savage life behind the mic now
Everybody hollerin' bout trill entertainment rest in peace
Pimp C I scream that shit every time I do shows you put me on
And I ain't forget so for my nigga
I gotta fuck 2 hoes whateva y'all mean I ain't got cream
You see me in the hood don't thank I can't leave
When I was 19 already and deal y'all other lil' niggas
Y'all jus' selling y'all dreams I ain't through yet
I done done it all got a lot of stuff I been through yet
I fucked up I ain't make it through school
Wanna see if my kids gon' make it
Through that from Miami to L.A. back to Manhattan
Where the big cake from Baton Rouge I done did it gon' ahead admit it
I'ma the shit hey and ion care what a bitch say
I'ma be like this til I get gray
And I ain't puttin' no rims on it
When it's 500 hundred it ride factory

Lie to you, say that you gonna die tomorrow
So why pay? That's not logical, see the bullshit that they try to pull?

Who the enemy? Who the friend in need?
How do you choose your target, who you aim for, what you aim for?

Then I really don't feel how I'm supposed to feel
Because I feel like blowin' blunts back to back
With no shame, keep a pack and a sack to wrap(?)

With my nigga lil rone you can ask him that
My homeboy Kendell roll thin ass blunts
So we can smoke at least 20 every day of the month
And keep at least 5 pounds of the hay in the trunk

Uh
I got 16 zones of death and you can hit it at your own risk
When I travel I ain't lookin' for the local weed man
I be gone on the zone on my own shit
Got a stick or a seed in ya muhfuckin' weed

And they wonder how the kid stay blowed, eyes halfway closed

Keep a gold pack of the Trojans
I let a nigga rap to a bitch while I'm wrappin' it up
My thang off in yo main dame
I come straight through and get straight brain
She blow straight kill and make straight change
To make sure my pockets stay straight man
Cuz this pimp shit is in my veins, it's in my blood
I was born with it and I'mma die smokin' this fire bud
In my old school with my chrome spinnin' like
Uh
And my niggas in the bay got the kush for the 27 hundo
I'mma get 'em and sell 'em for 55, you get it for 48

Ship it to the Chi, ship it to the D

Ask me how I did it, I tell them clientele
Now everybody hating on me, that why the hell he ain't in jail

Sting 'em for 300K and now I got to ride it back (so what ya doin'?)
I'm lookin' for the laws, where ya hidin' at? (I see 'em)
Pull me over, I'm the decoy, fly for that (let's go)

Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix, man
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with PA so you know what it is (what it is)

Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps no holding back, let's go!

Look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry VIII
Guillotine to ya neck bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied cowards and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate or like my nigga Drake say
""We ain't got time to respond to niggas""

I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood gang, five
It's that Blood gang five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fight
They actin' like they ain't gon' die until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroin, it's no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it's the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!

They say I'm underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' ""there he goes again!""
See now they nominated a nigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain't no fakin', ain't no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin'
Up everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (DAMN!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!

Hoes go to jump in and can't find the handles on my doors
So much twerking and working in here, I should install a pole
For them strippers that love to suck and fuck and get, get down on the floor
Transformers can't fuck with this, not the way my doors flip
Skyscraper tall when I creep and crawl, is that Krit or a solar eclipse
Rise of the apes in my trunk, while my chariot swang down
Make a poke head go when my old school come around

Say bitch I pulled up on the curb, straight peeled off with yo girl
Said she wanna ride with a pimp, wanna get that dick that she deserves
Said my back seat softer than a pillow top, paint so wet that it hit the spot
And I'ma quench ya thirst, that little nigga should've did it first
You was holding hands and I was in her purse
I'm getting throwed up under city lights
She right side checking lipstick, tryna make sure that her titties right
We in the parking lot with the trunk open and sipping
Sitting outside the whip with the wood grain wheel like it's 1996
Yea trick I'm riding dirty, Big Sant bitch I know you heard me
Tryna get the 'Lac with the '84s, tag just gon' say “beg for mercy”
I just swerve and swang and bang it, but ? 'cause a ho might leave you hanging
Better let 'em know I'm forever ho, they kicking doors open, pay what you owe me
I told 'em

See pimping is what pimping is and macking do what it feels like
Drip the drape with that chuck it stitching and 4s and vogues so I feel right
Candy paint on that body mane, chrome the grill and that woman
Them belts and bucks and 5th wheel on the trunk, you'll hear beat knock when I'm coming
That bass so hard that it's numbing, that chrome so shiny it's blinding
Them seats so soft that I'm sinking in and so it's no need to recline 'em
I drop the top and you see me, got different shit on each TV
Got one with Sopranos, one with The Wire, the one up front is Boardwalk Empire
Wood grain wheel so goddamn new, that sap come out when I grip it
I represent for that PAT and that H so hard, I'm still tipping
I chunk the deuce when I flip it, for my city I put on
RIP to the Pimp, this UGK for life for real and I'm gone

Bun B,"Hardcore G shit, homie, I don't play around
Ain't shit sweet bout the peach this Atlanta, clown
Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs, though
Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub, ho
Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers
Welcome to Atlanta up your jewelry, motherfucker!
These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine
And all a nigga found was a Ruger and some pain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! Come up off the chain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! One off in the brain
We some money-hungry wolves, and we down to eat the rich
Your bodyguard ain't shit, we strip him like a stripper bitch
These real-ass killers move in silence with violence
The minute it set off, we the motherfucking wildest
How you from Atlanta that they never speak upon
Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

Once upon a time in the projects
An O.G. saw a young Bun B as a prospect
Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age
So he opened up the G code to the front page
He sat me on the porch, said, ""This where little dogs sit""
Pointed at the yard, said, ""That's where big dogs shit""
He said, ""Don't leave til your ass get growed
And don't come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet, like they soaking in some salve
When you step out on the ave, make sure they wanna see ya
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G, a hater wanna catch you slipping
Try to be a Jordan, but settle for a Pippen""
Player, I ain't even tripping, but I don't really care
Cause my pistol's in your face, so put your hands in the air

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

In a six, I'm riding with a pistol grip, banana clip
From Simpson Road to Adamsville, I'm repping this Atlanta shit
Nigga trying to handle up, let's see can they handle this
A hundred round at em, that ain't no Louisiana shit
Drinking on that Hennessey, blowing on that cannabis
Amerikkka's nightmare, trap nigga fantasy
A record full of felonies, searching for a better me
But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq, Cuba, Tel Aviv
Pretty nigga, let him be fuck him, shorty
Sucker nigga I'll never be, don't give a fuck about it
Quick to round up on that Audi, make em get the fuck up out it
Nigga better be about it, he deserve it he allow it
What's a coward to a kamikaze?
He ain't robbed a man, ain't predator or prey, the law of nature where I stay
I catch you slipping with that K, ain't no illusion, no confusion
Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you're snoozing

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

Wha-da-da-dang, wha-da-da-da-da-dang
Listen to my clip before that five go bang
Bang bang, guap time, rep game
We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks
Predators, we eyeballing all of y'all lames
Let me fall off, I'm taking all of y'all chains
All of y'all watches and all of y'all cars
Well, who you talking to? All of y'all stars
All of y'all rappers and producers and such
No homo promo, homie, you might get your ass touched
Like Def Jam circa '83, you get rushed
If you rolling with some winners, then you rolling with us
I know some dope country niggas, but them niggas ain't weak
Know they dressing looking hard, but them niggas ain't cheap
I don't make dance music, this is R.A.P
Opposite of the sucker shit they play on T.V

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect",Big Beast,2012

Gun that a just main Twitter, follow the leader though
Up in the hood, homie askin, I got my Nina on
Just stood his eyes on some niggas that he needed gone
It’s like that recorder, life ain’t normal
If you die to shine then ice ain’t for you
If the sky fall then the sky can’t warn you
When your head crack the base don’t warn you
Lightin up weed, pour that sour

So keep yo mouth shut when the OG talkin
If I want your opinion then nigga I’ll beat it out of you
I’m real for the gunners bitch, I do on what I gotta do
And that’s got a lot to do with where I was raised
Reach and old man in the trill where they roamin with K’s
Always round with the gauge and they lurkin with meaners
Who will serve to get paid, committing more than misdemeanors
Once the while the shit you see my nigga do in his life
The average shit, there’s no one on here every night
You can go to PA, til they beam all the yonkers

Best thing I could do right now is pray for you

Feelin like Martin Luther, I’m standin out on the balcony
Niggas used to be tough but I cut em off, call em equities
Niggas was in the fam with me, only niggas that dance with me
Bitches ain’t wanna fuck, now they on and this for a chance with me
If you knew what that bass meant this is my fuckin rhapsody
Feel like I’m a rhapsody, killin it with my faculty
High up above the ground, I swear I’m defying gravity
Yea I be younger but when I grow up I’mma buy me something
I always knew I’m like the psyche bluffin
Miss clear where the hustle, watch where I could see the future
We got bigger guns than dreams, little niggas will shoot ya
For no reason other than colors, he looked up to his brother
Now we layin beside him, too many tears for a mother
Too many story of hunger but fuck ya

Pussy and lit up match shots now in the air
Motherfucker beware 'til I retire or expire
It's eying eying, them know that we are coming with more fire

Turn my enemies to dust, burn them up with fire

Big belly man, big belly man man
Big belly man, I'm that big belly man
Big black benz, 20 percent tints
100 niggas on my team, 20 percent friends
After four or five lines you know this organized crime
Me still buying jewels, I got on more than last time
This not a past time, this a landslide
And I'm bringing more fire, better get your hands up
Get out my beamer, you know I like my trigga finger crew
Get with a boss and maybe you could get a beamer too
Burning down the strip from Texas to Kingston
As a dime stand in line just dying to squeeze in

Money so tall she gotta count it in Giuseppe
Balling like the ESPY's
Drinking on that Texas
Sexting. texting, aggravated flexing
Did it for the money and the fame came with it
Connect from the island and the cane came with her
Rode through the block in a cherry colored drop
Jim Carrey, Mariah Carey, you get carried off
They got a stretcher with your name on
Shoot a nigga and I’ll dash like Damon
Insane in the membrane
2 Chainz, but today I got on three chainz

I'm bringing real rap back and
Taking the faking out
I'm clearing all the bullshit out the way
To make a vacant route
OK, now let the real niggas roll through
It's going for you new niggas and the old too
It was some bullshit then and it's some bullshit now
So I'm just tryna keep the bullshit down
They say the rap game needs balance to keep it level
Just like the EQ with the bass, mid, and treble
And yeah that's true but if you wanna point blame
Just be careful about the motherfucking way you aim
You blame radio, internet, and politics
But see, we all really know it's just a pile of shit
You not playing cause your music ain't hitting
The people don't like you, stop hating, start quitting muthafucka

You saying you the man, that's the key to you
Because we knowing what you did and what you didn't do
It's not the shit you say, It's the shit you not saying
You know better, show better, step it up and stop playing

Once I see him, they be more like Justin Bieber
Leave it, my rivals underground like SkyZoo's how I do
I have em laying on the ground bleeding
Butt naked with a bullet in his motherfucking head like Erykah Badu
I find irony in being in the place where
I'm wearing Gucci mane, getting white boy wasted
I tell a nigga break bread or take lead
I'm trying to get rid of this weight, K-Fed
Me and Bun got the gangsta bond
We like that once-in-a-lifetime fame, to you that ain't the prom
I'm not a fan of no man, I'm not Stan
Flow like Viagra, that's why they go, God damn
I whip it up in the kitchen like pots and pans

For giving me another day so I can go hard
Never been fraud, always kept it true
Get dressed, hit the street try ta' see what it do
Cut a few corners, chunk a few dubs
Get 'em, jump back, trill niggas show love
Some try to hate, I don't pay it no mind
Either get with me or get like me, that's on the grind

Sitting sidelines, want to quarterback the game
