Lloyd Banks,"We, we don't give a fuck about you
Your homey on the block can get it too
Y'all lil' motherfuckers ain't gang-ster, save your
crew, before I put a hit out on you
Before I let my niggaz come through
Y'all lil' motherfuckers ain't gang-ster, gang-ster

Yeah!
I come creepin through your hood in the dead of the night boy
It's good that you ain't scared to die cause you might boy
Nigga cross the line, and my wolves'll jump on you
The beef escalate, they'll be back to dump on you
They follow orders, I tell 'em to let off that pump at you
Before you snitch, yeah see I know what you chumps'll do
Sunny day, hot fudge, vanilla banana split
Four niggaz in a whip, AK banana clip
War time, frontline, nigga ride or run and hide
Everything alive dies, why ask why? Why cry
Man up, chump, worryin is for the weak
You could hold your own or get left for dead in the street

Yeah, yeah
In the hood when I pop up, minked up and rocked up
Niggaz ice grill cause these O.G.'s is washed up
I got a left like, Winky Wright
My pinky bright, my bank card'll end your life
Niggaz scheme but they sweeter than, cookies'n'cream
Homey I got more blocks than Hakeem the Dream
That ain't taskforce money, that's real police
I got my ratchet in the alley with that fiend Denise
Cruise the streets, stuntin in that Maybach sixty-two
Nigga what my dope goin fo', 62, c'mon! A gram
By man, my plan's to expand
Try to jux and you hoods get catscans

Uhh, Banks
I got a crew of schitzos behind me, I give 'em the word
They'll wet your whole block up, like the tsunami
Try me, and your mami'll be right in the lobby
And they'll be feedin you Jello, like you're Bill Cosby
Yeah everybody yellin yeah, so the beef cook
Then somebody gets hit in the melon, then they tellin
Don't go tongue lashin we pull it
Niggaz'll put stabs in your boy like Brad Pitt in Troy
Be shakin like a cutty, with his last bit of boy
And I'll be calm cause there's bulletproof glass in the toy
Yeah I'm flashy as fuck, mashin with Buck
Windows up blowin big cause there's stash in the truck, what?",We Don't Give a Fuck,2005
Lloyd Banks,"Wooh, yeah, you can get with this or you can get with that
I don't got to tell you hoe, you know I got that crack
Three for the price of one, you know I have you comin' back
You can have me a P.O. absolute and it's a rap

It's a fact, niggaz know, fuck with us you gettin' clapped
No, I won't say your name 'cause it just put you on the map
And I ain't, into lettin' niggaz eat, no never that
Shorty love the way I swing my game, I got a better bat

Know I'm lethal with this rap shit, c'mon baby holla back
Cut that juggler, you bleedin', no there ain't no stoppin' that
I don't sleep, my eyes open, maybe a good powernap
Spit a verse,then I eventually watch the cheddar stack

I'm shittin' on niggaz, shittin' like it's a got to get slack
This a standin' ovation for homey with a Tek clap
F that, we takin' over baby and that's that
Catch me fuckin' with a bitch that can't stand rap

I get at niggaz like the stole from me, stole from me
Their bank account lookin' like no money, no money
There go police, shorty just hold for me, hold for me
You want to work? Then pump this O for me, O for me

I get at niggaz like the stole from me, stole from me
Their bank account lookin' like no money, no money
There go police, shorty just hold for me, hold for me
You want to work? Then pump this O for me, O for me

Yeah, gun powder resi' on the sleeve of my Pele
I had to burn my leather and toss 'My Buddy'
Two hundred calls comin' in on my celly
I had to cut the ringer like, ""Fuck e'rybody""

Drive the bulletproof all the way to Cali
Lay low for a month or so gettin' very high
Where I'm goin' it gets my mind of the bones
Back on the East Coast I bury now I'm partyin' with Halle Berry

This Hollywood shit'll catch you slippin' if you let it
So niggaz started grillin' me
Like they was gon' take my things
So I assumed I had to set it

Now it's blood splashed all on the ice in my jewelery
They don't know who did it 'cause I did it smoothly
Take my ass back to Queens, it's not like I look for trouble
It seems trouble always finds me, then

I get at niggaz like the stole from me, stole from me
Their bank account lookin' like no money, no money
There go police, shorty just hold for me, hold for me
You want to work? Then pump this O for me, O for me

I get at niggaz like the stole from me, stole from me
Their bank account lookin' like no money, no money
There go police, shorty just hold for me, hold for me
You want to work? Then pump this O for me, O for me

Look, I got tons of old beef and a brand new forty
A hardcore groupie that would take a bullet for me
A high-priced lawyer just in case a nigga snap
And can't take a joke, and pop a nigga over rap

A horrible splatter in a matter of a second
Dead over a record, shit he sound like he meant it
My crew greater, yeah, I'm talkin' to you hater
I'm too major, two-tone blue gator

New blazer, big gun, little razor
So raise up, that ain't how your momma raised ya
They wire-tappin' to hear somethin', they ear-hustlin'
They won't bust him, why they came in and handcuffed him

It's nothin', there's more 'mati's at the spot
One flat tire's gon' matter if they pop
I pop up tomorrow with the wagon off the lot
Stash box, with the nine magnum with a wop

I get at niggaz like the stole from me, stole from me
Their bank account lookin' like no money, no money
There go police, shorty just hold for me, hold for me
You want to work? Then pump this O for me, O for me

I get at niggaz like the stole from me, stole from me
Their bank account lookin' like no money, no money
There go police, shorty just hold for me, hold for me
You want to work? Then pump this O for me, O for me",Stole Something,2006
Lloyd Banks,"We don't need a videotape or a camera to make this ghetto love scene

Was like a dream when I first met
Your face and your stature
The way you carry yourself
It really turned me on
Control myself, had me in the zone
Caught staring in your eyes
Feeling like when doves cry
And that smile on your face that you had for me
To let me know you couldn't wait to get next to me

Give you all of this (girl you know)
Nothing is better than (the way I do it)
Girl you know what it is (you know what it is)
The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive
Give you all of this (girl you know)
Nothing is better than (the way I do it)
Girl you know what it is (you know what it is)
The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive

Paper, denim, Cris chillin' (check)
Purple label, ice, glistenin'
They say diamonds are a girls best friend
I can see it in your eyes that you're down to ride
The way you move your body made me want you more
I can envision me hitting it, that's what I'm getting that
That fire, up in here
Whoo!
Let me hit that, hit that, spit that
Wanna rush that, bust that, crush that
Oh I ain't playing no games wanna tear it out the frame
We can start in the Range

Give you all of this (girl you know)
Nothing is better than (the way I do it)
Girl you know what it is (you know what it is)
The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive
Give you all of this (girl you know)
Nothing is better than (the way I do it)
Girl you know what it is (you know what it is)
The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive

You know the kid keep something in the whip
Green rock dripping off me I'm stuntin' in my fit
They give me the same thing you handcuffin' them to get
Cause I'm so fly
That's why its nothing to get lick
I'm a pride a good a hood, the pride of south side
This is a Lamborghini that's why your mouths wide
We can lamp in the villa my hands on the strilla
And you're bad enough to turn a jealous man to a killa
My lifestyles Cristal and chinchilla
Mansions, luxury cars and 4 wheelers
I can four weight anything except for my time
She came to give me that ass but I left with her mind
I'm on the hunt for the right one
Starting in the morning and ain't done till the night come
Either you're riding with me or in somebody's way
Cause all I need is a night and you gonna think about it every day

Give you all of this (girl you know)
Nothing is better than (the way I do it)
Girl you know what it is (you know what it is)

Lloyd Banks,"Shady! Yeah
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, you do know but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, you do know but you actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

Now homie I say I run (it run) it 'cause I'm in control
Hypnotic, Hennessey, a couple shots of Patron
I have you feelin' aight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin' shorty said she's comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga you front you gon' get it, ok now maybe I said it
'cause I want you triddip, yeah I be on that shiddit
You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones that be wantin'
Push the whip see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know The Units the game
I got my grimy Shady with me
You front you'll have to get me off your ass
I pay the lawsuit and laugh, it's not a big deal
It's nuttin' but some cash

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

When me and Fif' got together to do this music then move it
We became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady After-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass
Come hizzon what kinda fizz-uckin' position is that

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', JFK
HK to your chest plate
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'm a be a Shady 7-4 Gangster
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me

Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin'' G
I'm a hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

Who wants to be ridin' around in that car
Two in the front and the back got the plasma
This ain't a free ride you gotta have the gas ma
I wouldn't buy a chick a pump that got asthma
And I'm busy so I move a bit faster
You can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya
Ha ha I'm a bastard
Damn near showin' his hand over the plastic

I cruise through the strip
22's on the whip
New rule: gonna hit
Thousand dollar outfit
Never snooze never slip
Follow rules or get whip
Nigga move or get hit
I don't care who's on the strip
It ain't only the Ferrari now the jewels got him sick
Now it's 2006 I need a new bottom miss
It's aight they can talk I'm amused by the pricks
I'm the news out the bricks nigga who's hot as this
I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed
I ain't a cuddler I fuck the drool outta chick
My niggas ice grill but it ain't the same
They don't see the faces they just see the chains
Like Oh when you get 'em they don't know you with me
They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me
This is regular shit the everyday mentality
They charged up don't make me put in the battery

Hands up shorty when you party with me, we goin' way past quarter to three (I said Hands Up!)

G-unit don't play
We rap but we strapped
Buck got the shotgun
50 got the mack
Spida got the streeper
And you bound to hear it clap
You won't have another birthday cake after that
'cause yayo got a temper and he don't know how to act
And I've been gone for the winter
But now a nigga back
To get the money the money the money the money the cake
And you motherfuckers looking like steak
Food on the plate for the wolves
Follow wolves
Don't get moved by the tools
Battle wounds on you shoes wait
Control you hate
You ain't riding in them 6's
(why?) 'cause you spending all your cake on them bitches
I need the bread lil' niggas need Christmas
Banks don't rap with a back pack
I'm in it for the money the money the money the money the cake

You heard banks said so I know I got the mag
I pull up pull out spray hollows at your back
I don't give a fuck
It's going down like that
I done been through every hood
Dead niggas gone rap
In the heart of a victim murder is monumental
I don't complicate shit, yea I keep it simple
My bullet wounds will tell you a story bout what I been through
South side trauma drama with gallamas
I conversate with killers it's usually about life
Politic with lawness it's usually about white
I'm the poster child of violence
I'm the boy on the poster
When the shots start to rang out I'm the boy with the toaster

Yeah listen up chicko
I hustle I get dough
You fucking with a sicko
I spazz let a clip go
Cannon out the rental
Beam to you temple
I squeeze blow your mental
All over you friends

Me I'm from the street
We ain't nothing sweet
The home of the homies
There's a body every week
Now I don't hear the sirens
But they probably gonna creep
Plotting to pull me over
Plant the cake in my jeep
So I'll be skipping cities 7 states in a week
Can't a muthafucker breathing tell me I can't eat
Show me the money the money the money the money the cake
Niggas slow down pump you breaks

No mistakes
Cause the jakes
Run the plates
Then you headed up state
For rolling round with a steak
Niggas start up the beef
And run straight to the cops

Any nigga disrespect the click getting shot
Round here niggas get found upside down

And this is a Timbaland track

This is my house, you 'goin do what I tell you to do

A little Armor and that's at least a hundred proof

She can't stop stealin', so she trippin' off the stoop
And I'm a beware of mine, no tellin' the truth

See y'all can go swim, while I get in
I'll show you how to make a million dollars with a pen
I drink champagne and pop bottles when I spin

I can't complain a top model's in the Benz
Her wheels is shinnin' like it's diamonds in the rims
Just gimme a day or two, I'm climbin' in her friends
I do what I do 'cause

This is my house, you 'gon do what I tell you to do
When your in my house, under my roof, you follow my rules
This is my house
(Put ya hands up, put ya, put ya, put ya, put ya, put ya hands up)
This is my house
(I'll house you, girl, you in my house now)

Hey, watch how you speak
'Cause I don't slip or squeak I got the heat
If you get outta line, you'll be in the street
Ambulance man tryin' to cover up the leak

And nobody to care if they get you in a week
I rather go there split a swisher with a freak
And get a lap dance while I listen to the beat
She's a beauty and petite, I can lift her off her feet

If she gets in a spur, we don't fuck in here
I'm iced out, so she don't see nothin' but a blur
Be careful where you rub, don't get nothin' on the fur
You know we got them things, so the drama don't occur

You front 'cause you drunk, yo' ass gettin' jumped
I'm high off the funk, dro, hash and the skunk
Don't make them niggaz dump yo' ass in the trunk
They remembers a black mask and a pump
Them niggaz should have told you

This is my house, you 'gon do what I tell you to do
When your in my house, under my roof, you follow my rules

Its one way or the either
You comin or you gonna watch another bitch leave wit me
The way this shit go, ima fuckin rap star

[Verse]
Fresh off of the plane I jets off in the Range
First class seat but this west coast ain't the same
The rap game will put stress, fortune, and fame
A slow drive-by when they aired out Kane
S55 all cleared out chain
They body me, you body them, support there out prayin
My only wish is to find ya catcher
Lay ya ass on a stretcher, betcha, getcha, ass out the hood
All I got is rap for that, I spazz out for good
That's my income, it keeps me in Paz and Hollywood
I'm hardly home, when I leave the club the party gone
And I'm pissy off patrone, tryna get ma home
My name Banks baby, I'm top rank lady
I gotta go, grab ya coat, bitch you ain't crazy
I speed off, gainin and rushin, and bend her over somethin
And I'm pumpin, devyin till the macs and I'm frontin
All of a sudden she down on the humble for a feel
And I'm driftin in and out of lane, fumblin the wheel
A couple of miles later I be cummin on her grill
Then its back to the hotel and chill

[Chorus]
Ma I give you the rush
Damn ma, ya lil outfit got my third hand high
And I need ya to understand I
Ain't really got a lot of time, bitch out ya mind its me
Damn blood, don't you wanna get up out them handcuffs
I ain't gonna love you like ya man does
I ain't got a lot of time, bitch out ya mind

Uh, the whip shine like there's baby oil on it
I honk the airhorn at them bitches in the street
Ayy, remember me, the on you called a creep
Now my weed so sweet, I hit it and fall asleep
Wake up, roll up again, I get it and bought it cheap
Now you showin' off jewelry and couldn't afford to keep
And he won't show his face so ima hook him on the beat
Ima animal too, I put the hammer a do
Make you feel like you need one so I ran with it too
In blue, now all of a sudden I'm back and my shit buzzin
The broads the kids the bloods and the crips love em
Causin' we got the city on smash
When I'm at the stop like they put titties on the glass
I'm the leader of the class, the heat is in the stash
I don't read up on a pass, I dictate the future
Millenium boy, you just can't get rid of ya boy
I chuck em the deuce and get a new toy
These niggas better start actin' right, I ain't rap too tight
I'll leave ya head red and white like a apple bite
Come nigga, I got a fat niggas appetite
Pass thru the traffic light, smash on the coppers light (voom)
The punchline kid is back nigga, look what my punchlines did for rap
Inspired the new jacks that's why they sound like that
Where they chained down ear to the ground like that
The games in now, shot me cause he's the punk
I'm two niggas in one like shock g and humpty hump
Its on now, you got to pop me to shut me up
Slugs missed ya, we ain't mad at ya, boy he ducked
We can go hole for hole or cut for cut
It won't be the first time yall better toughen up
Radio is all messed up now what the fuck is that
It gave em all of the spins and got nothin' back
Save ya self studio time and pump it back
I punch a car, you scream help when you see the sarg
I'll go upside ya head, you'll see a bunch of stars
And yellow moons, I'm ballin' with a plus garage
I'm Hugh Heffner all over when it come to broads
Even the ones that don't fit in hump the cars(yeah)

I'm back, I can't wait to see you niggas in the street

I ain't your friend boy, I'll fuck your wife man
Look at my left, now look at my right hand
Every time I move it looks like a strike of lightning
My name is Banks, but you can call me Igloo
There's white rocks on my neck, and my wrist's blue
So don't trip, cause you know I got my pistol
You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

Yeah, Louie introduced me to jewelry, now I'm lovin' it
Tell Jacob the shinin's so good, them hoes love the shit
Diamond after diamond, and I climbed up out the bottom
So holla if it's a problem, I got 'em just like you got 'em
I'm stylin' they grillin' cause my whip can buy a skyscraper
Roll down the windows stick my hand out, ""Hi hater!""
I'm on my way to L.A., I'll see you guys later
You'll be here when I get back, ain't got no time to drink that
Now all I do is sit back, hop on the plane and sip 'gnac
Hop in the Range and whip that, came in the game with this crap
You say my name you get smacked, right on your brain with the gat
Know who you playin with Black, then holla back

My name is Buck, but you can call me Icey
I keep spillin' Cristal on my white T
Don't give a fuck, bitch you ain't gotta like me
I pop my trunk and have you runnin' in your Nike's
Look what I just bought, this white mink I got it in New York
And this bright link I put it on and walk right out the store
Where's my car keys? What am I gon' drive?
My Phantom got the steering wheel on the wrong side
Pocket full of cash, Ferrari with the drive-out tags
Them hoes followin' us, let me stop and get some gas
Liberace, the cops watch me
I'm ice skatin' like a nigga playin' hockey ? holla back

Canary yellow princess cut, rocks when I smile
Fat boy kept it gritty since I was a chubby child
Look at me now, hat cocked up, wristwatch rocked up
When I put my hand up to my mouth and hit that sticky stuff
The light, hit the ice, on my eight-ways piece
In the streets, I'm a G; on the mic, I'm a beast
Keep a bitch, on her knees, nigga please, I'm a pimp
Purge first, ask last, I'm a shark, you a shrimp
Check a deuce, Chevrolet, rims taller than my son
Gun, on the seat with a extra clip cause I ain't fin' to run
In my brand new, shell toe, three stripe, all white
In other words, come my way with that shit you gon' lose your life

What the fuck are they yellin'
Dope man, anybody killa in the hood, fuck the homeboy sellin'
I've got a problem with him - if I can't touch it
Then he can't slang it, and these streets get dangerous
Corny niggas pull up in cargo vans
Palms sweaty, icky's out with they masks all mad
I gave 'em the order, and that's all bad
Born into flossin' flashin' got his mark-ass, smashed
The Iceman is in the buildin' chillin'
Big game huntin' and this lame's, stuntin'
Got an addiction that's deeper than a prescription
He's sleepin' I'm on a mission to beat him in my position
It's fucked

Uh man I think I'm addicted to the life that I had
So I risk it runnin' the street with the heat boy
Three deep in the S-U-V the bigger you blow the less you see
The more you hear a real nigga lost his life right there
Its hard to believe a flippers the reason he's not here
Damn and still get killed over somethin' that ain't his
And jeapordize the well bein of him and his kids

Cause my money green n blue like monopoly
Yea I left a name all around the globe
Yet still south side I was brought up by the code (south side)
N I was told everything ain't gold its cause the glitter
And had to drown the pain with the liquer

Like a rib shot

Don't cha, this ain't the typical story
Therefore I don't fall in the category

I'm cool calm and collective
You con'in a Lexus
Blew chronic for breakfast
It match with the necklace

Reckless, born treacherous warn specialist
Especially if you rest next to me

More out of left s***, trailers all around the coast
To places you get around by boat, I get a pound I smoke
I put 'em down them dope

I'm real scope when I pass the block, I make traffic stop
A prodigal wave thing that make the apple rot

The Pro Tools and the wax

Take a step back 'fore you catch a contact
The flows like an M-16 with an arm-strap

'Cause you ain't gettin' nothin' from me, you grown more
You fuelin' up the fire when you hate
So I'ma lean on ya' til' you make a mistake, I can't wait

Until the curtains close
It's just me and Tony, in them purple O's
Indoor overload, drive like I own the roads
These n****z is p*** that's why my shoulders cold

M by the toted bow, I'm ridin' filthy in the Beamer
'Cause I can have Lamina Calina bring to a mister meaner
You drown in deep water, any n**** around come
From the street corner, where you need your heat on ya

I'm on the climb while my next CD climbs South side
Greedy Dine, red wine, DB9, NYPD grind
Why? It ain't an easy grind
A n**** try to get mine, I'ma feed him nine

And it's graffiti time, n****az sprayin' ya mural
For try'na by a motherf***in' hero
I'm fresh, fly and flashy, best guy if you ask me

I'm comin' through swingin' like they do in H-Town
And I roll down the window and spin ya b**** face around

I'm a stunna, hoggin' up the lane like the Hummer
Till the wheel run dry like the rain in the summer
Even the broke n**** can't afford to go to sleep
F*** around and get ya head p****** all over the street

And I ain't got nuthin' for 'em but the heat
My lil' brother want jewelry and Jordan's on his feet
Now, they recognize if ya slaughterin' the beat
And if it wasn't for rappin', I'd have ya daughter on the street

I been the same since Kane and Slick Rick had it
Now n****s die in the car, my whole whip had it
I worked too hard to let a n**** have it
So I pack the A******** for the sideline static, yeah

You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

Yeah, Louie introduced me to jewelry, now I'm lovin' it
Tell Jacob the shinin's so good, them h*** love the s***
Diamond after diamond and I climbed up out the bottom
So holla if it's a problem, I got 'em just like you got 'em

I'm stylin', they grillin' 'cause my whip can buy a skyscraper
Roll down the windows stick my hand out, ""Hi hater""
I'm on my way to L.A., I'll see you guys later
You'll be here when I get back, ain't got no time to drink that

Now all I do is sit back, hop on the plane and sip 'gnac
Hop in the Range and whip that, came in the game with this crap

Look what I just bought, this white mink I got it in New York
And this bright link I put it on and walk right out the store
Where's my car keys? What am I gon' drive?
My Phantom got the steering wheel on the wrong side

Pocket full of cash, Ferrari with the drive-out tags

Fat boy kept it gritty since I was a chubby child
Look at me now, hat cocked up, wristwatch rocked up
When I put my hand up to my mouth and hit that sticky stuff

The light, hit the ice, on my eight-ways piece
In the streets, I'm a G, on the mic, I'm a beast
Keep a b**** on her knees, n**** please, I'm a pimp
Purge first, ask last, I'm a shark, you a shrimp

Check a deuce, Chevrolet, rims taller than my son

Then he can't slang it and these streets get dangerous

Corny n****z pull up in cargo vans
Palms sweaty, icky's out with they masks all mad
I gave 'em the order and that's all bad
Born into flossin' flashin' got his mark-a**, smashed

The Iceman is in the buildin' chillin', big game huntin'

Buy a quarter mil on jewels so I ride around wit the ooze

My lifestyles to fast to take my time
I got to get in position to make her mind
'Cause I ain't leaving the club with out my nine

You know I got my nine
Think twice 'fore you cross that line
You needed must've lost your mind
Thinking you can off my shine

Shorty got it shaking, I'm waiting to take her home
It's hot as hell in here and I'm thinking of patron
I know a couple different ways I can make her moan
When I'm done wit her, she'll want to take a nigga to Rome

Give me a hour, I'll have her blowing up my phone
Like a stem to a stone and she won't leave me alone
Million dollar nigga, I get it and show off
Hit the dolga give me a minute wit your boss

I'll fold you, New York fitted and gold cross
To the Rover, holster, over the shoulder
I'm the sickest thing spitting in a while
Your plane ain't the same, it's different when I fly

South side playa, play around and get popped
24 hour stake out on your nigga block

VVS bling, my chain long as a swing
Boulevard King, but known in Beijing
Fully prepared for whatever the drama may bring

69 scrapper wit the up and down pumps
Murder is forever, don't fuck around once
Bottle after bottle, I down 'em until I'm drunk
If you ain't chipped in, don't come round my blunt

Grimy and gritty, New York City's top gun

She was rubbing it in like Noxzema
She real cute, big titties and hips
And she pretty convincing a video vixen

Chicks see him, take pictures and kiss him

Niggas apart in the dark
Or its day time its good with me
Just cool I brought the whole hood with me
We had a Gabriel right before MTV
So we can g him to give us that chain for cheap
We got David and Jacob for them bracelets and rings
Cause our verse in the hood makes their names ring
She take a picture with me on Bet
She the new talk of the hood it's PCP
One taste of the stick she hooked like fish
Me banks and have got this shit vice gripped

Lloyd Banks,"Uh, I'm doin' my thang, G-Unit's my gang
Ma, I gotta get mine, all the day all the time
N****, you know how we roll, twenty three's twenty four's
I'm holdin' my ground in case somethin' goes down

Uh, yeah don't fall for a big butt and a smile
They set ya up you f*** around have to buck in the crowd
Around my way, ain't sunshine ev'ryday
N****s'll cross ya, you should hear the slang they say

In a land of attitudes **'s and accidents
Where n****s split blunts eight ways and pack the b****
Mama spit me out with a spindle and I been mackin' since
And I'm stubborn, so I don't lean back and flinch

You're perpetratin', embarrasin' the crooks
Plus your frontin' they only seen Paris in the books
Whenever you leave the bricks watch the n****s you roll with
Before you know it n****s be shootin' up yo' s***

The clubs a fashion show, so n****s go get
And rev up all the broke n****s rockin' they old s***
Before the night is done they be another murder
So put your money to the side for another burner

Stranger, don't bring 'em 'round if I don't know 'em like that
I feel like it's targets all over my back
Because of these broads that's layin' over my lap
A n**** that young ain't 'sposed to live like that

I just saw the dealer and I'm goin' right back
Stashin' my g*** 'cause I know they might rat
I'm doin my thang, G-Unit's my gang

Uh, I'm frontin' in my G62's the yellow and royal blues
I'm better than all you dudes hot metal for all you fools
The one that n****s admire many study all my moves
And I'm focused 'cause I'm a end up bloody if I snooze

You a sucker for love or maybe I'm a bit different
If you ask me, is your baby mama's a pigeon?
I just bought the mansion and ma dukes pop the ribbon
And I'm out poppin' Cris b**** I'll show you how I'm livin'

I keep havin' them dreams 'bout n****s gettin' the drop on me
Lettin' them things fly up and down the block for me
True fear n****s don't feel ya they triflin'
But I adapt 'cause I used to think just like 'em

As soon as I hit the top I noticed the sudden change
It's probably the Maserati Ferrari, yeah the Range
This is South side street talk the hood slang
And my product, a open your nose like good Caine

Stranger, don't bring 'em 'round if I don't know 'em like that
I feel like it's targets all over my back
Because of these broads that's layin' over my lap
A n**** that young ain't 'sposed to live like that

Lloyd Banks,"So you say you a gangsta, right?
Are you really a rider, yeah?
You don't take shit from no one, no
And got your mind on your muthafuckin' dough, let's go

I'll be a South Side nigga till I rot
Even though I got the yacht in the million dollar bot
Superman armor on the 69 drop
Out of every 70 rappers 69 flop

I blowed a buck in the corner just to get the feel
So my head light smooth when I move the steering wheel
I ain't clubbing from nothing, its top dollar to chill
I pop bottles for real with pop artists that kill

I move to mill, my backyard is a field
I ain't tough for the tube, I'll smack y'all for real
Go head hate on me now, you'll miss a nigga later
I'm hood like butter holes and pissy elevators

I went from playing the same block to Bangkok
So I can get money between raindrops
And my piece so heavy I pop a chain a week
And get so much pussy I can't sleep

Poppa was a rollin' stone
Never came back home now I'm on my own
So I had to learn a few things 'bout survival
Like the ice pick done off the bottom

If you scared don't come around here
Guns ammunition don't run out here
As soon you get the paper to try it
A nigga try me, he won't see tomorrow

I ain't even got a license yet and got 7 cars, yep
TV the same size as Kevin Garnett
A brand new buzz, Mac 10 and a chopper
White fan base 'cause Eminem is my partner

I'm a Ferrari and Jag copper, you a glass shopper
I blow marijuana the color of grass hopper
I ain't a regular nigga, all the promoters pay 100 more
To bring your boy to Singapore

My dress code got the best hoes jumping on 'em
Elvis's and Red Monkey with the monkey on 'em
Shelves'll leave a niggaz food stamps blue
Like a full tube of acid in your shampoo

We don't tolerate the cock blocking out the bricks
We got fif's with the cop stoppers in the clips
Watch your mouth bitch there's rocks popping out the wrists
And my outfits, a eye stopper for the chicks

Poppa was a rollin' stone
Never came back home now I'm on my own
So I had to learn a few things 'bout survival
Like the ice pick done off the bottom

If you scared don't come 'round here
Guns ammunition don't run out here
As soon you get the paper to try it
A nigga try me, he won't see tomorrow

A nigga throw his hands up at me, I send a dummy harmed
And had money wrong shoot him in his underarm
Then pick up a shell, that'll be his lucky charm
I got a chunky arm, I'm a fucking Don

I burn big everyday, nothing but the bong
I don't cuddle, as soon as I get the nut I'm gone
I'm in a class all by myself
I'll whoop your ass all by myself

I got white gold, rose gold, yellow gold, platinum
Young hoes, old hoes, yellow ones and black ones
I've been patiently waiting to get on my shit again
So this is for the corner they cornered a nigga in

I wish you would try jump me, I'll wave the gat by you
And burn your eyelashes off like a crack lighter
Nigga you stupid riding by trying to blast me
'Cause my window got the glass from a taxi

Poppa was a rollin' stone
Never came back home now I'm on my own
So I had to learn a few things 'bout survival
Like the ice pick done off the bottom

If you scared don't come 'round here
Guns ammunition don't run out here
As soon you get the paper to try it
A nigga try me, he won't see tomorrow

Lloyd Banks,"Man I'm gonna do my thang, get up!
It's crazy in the club when I'm in there man, get up!
Trust me homie I'm not playin', get up!
Now get on the dance floor off the chain
I say get up!

I came to bring you that California love
And a lil' New York hatin' it's all of the above
I'm not playin' I'm sayin' I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow the instructions
I said get up!

I ball till I fall
I stunt till I drop
I'm off the show room floor
Not the used car lot
You buy a bottle
I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras

When I get in to it
I get in to it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it
I make it rain, rain
Till the sun come out
A nigga playin', playin'
We make the guns come out

Now, my question is
Who they gonna blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again
Shit, shift now the game done change
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain

I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And NWA made the West Coast bang
Nah it's just music, man it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!

I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands up in the air
I said get up!

Girl, you look good
I want to get to know you better
You look good in them jeans
And them red stilettos
You got a Bentley
Coupe booty baby
I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is
When I'm inside

I'ma take you for a spin
You know round and round
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return
If you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn
I got money to burn

While the Gap Band play
She dropped the bomb on me
It's up and down
And up and down
Gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
Or Fifty you should go home to see
What that bitch bout

I found out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up' get cha some
I know how to get you sprung
Tune you up' use your tongue
Under the hood it's so good
She said it's so good
Goddamn I'm so hood
Nigga wattup?

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!

I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands in the air
I said get up!

And get into it
You are now rocking with the Unit
I said get up!
And get into it
We gonna show you just how we do it
I said get up!

I said get up!

Victories my valentine, I'm in a different lane
Strong as cocaine
Long as I'm sane I won't be took for games
I can guarantee when it's over you won't look the same
Drownin' in shame, callin' my name's like callin' Candy Man
Suicide on a platter, splatter your brain, he banned

Use to punch the clock in jail, drove his mama car 'round
Now he got whatchu want for sale
See it, I bought it; it's official if I flaunt it
If ya diamonds really real then put the diamond tester on it
He don't want it
I'll run up on his shadow hit him proper
He bout real as a 4 dollar bill, Carol City Copper
Chop 'em down, one by one, two by two this what I do

I gotta eat dollar signs, feed my hunger pain
Music like Heroin, leave you numb the same
Play me like I'm something sweet
Be apart of summer slayin'
Most hate it most doubt it
That's what they shout it
I'm on top now, there's nothing they can do about it
Ya'll better have ya'll guns out
Cause where I'm from, there ain't no way around it
Home sweet home

I'm a fucking rap til you blue in the face
You'll probably turn into smurfs with the time that you waste
Throughout history they throwing shots at the greats
But I shoot back, the Lord ain't designed me for hate
I've never understood Martin Luther with the speech
With the whole World watching me, turn the other cheek?
Never, so there's one left to die in the streets
Cause his long arms happens to connect with his reach
Try to kill you then, them near misses was God's kisses
True Hollywood story, ghetto tie bridges
Different strokes that niggas broke the [?] reach
You only read about the cars that I paddle shift
You only dream about the [?] that I dabble with
Balcony views, postcard, imagine this
White stones, black steel cold chrome
This city's my doormat, them home sweet home

[Chorus]

See me where you see me
Always seen
Off the Queens magazines, pissy hallway scenes
Paying crowds, hunger screams, pressure crumbles teams
Fuck being humble in the jungle where they fumble dreams
Drugs for the living, Henny [?] for the body
Crosses for the power, ghetto for the smiley
Pitbull, I bit my way out the cage, what's happening
Competition got me on the Rampage, Jackson
Part of my reaction to they corny ass raps
Keep flirting with death and get your horny ass clapped
Back for more me, rat tat, kiss the ring, beat respect out them
Bloody heads, turn Timbalands to red bottoms
Fifty bottles just a start now that's how they do it
Carbon fiber through the Spyder playin' rider music
Ain't no question of my resume, I gotta prove it

Put my Ferrari in park, give them a running start

Couple vampire's and true bloods
Gambling in casino's, have a hundred handing me my c-notes
The modern day gambino

You the nigga walk up in a shootout with some pepper spray
That'd be the last mistake you ever make
Me I chop his head off from a rooftop
And race it downstairs just to see if I can catch his fade
Like groceries when I'm shooting at fags
Make sure the breads separated and put the fruits in a bag
Withstand the hatred
Dudes is falling off doing all they can to save it
But everybody's run stops ask Brandon Jacobs
What y'all call swag to me is all faggotry
Fours want blatt at me that'd equal more casualties
Abort the strategy
Or get attacked with that Duracell they put in your back
Now that's assault and battery
You can keep the bitching to yourself
There's beams on every burner
These lasers, a petition wouldn't help!
What good is having shooters if they the type that miss?
Where I'm from, better be careful when you drive that whip
Niggas put they life at risk for pies that flip

You beef like Lady Gaga and her stylist

Lloyd Banks,"Yeah, you got me
I’m up now, it’s your loss
Must suck to be you

History is like a quarter-note delay
It keeps repeating itself
And what else can I say?
You wondering why I act this way
Never should've gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now, eh?

There must've been a gust of wind
‘Cause you change your mind everytime it blows
And you just changed it a-motherfucking-gain
You just said you just wanted some dick 'fore I stuck it in
I wouldn't have been such a prick to you
Fucking men, you say you don't trust 'em
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushin'?
Some shit is going down
You must have just not have been truthful from the start
See, for me it’d be nothing
To say you never had my heart, but I’d be lying
Fucking see why they call this bullshit a ""relationship""
Ships sink, and you know it's love
As soon as you fall in it, ‘cause shit stinks
And it feels like everytime I fucking do I get jinxed
Cupid must have put a curse on me, six weeks
Have went by, and we only spoke twice
I’m sitting in your driveway, calling you from the car, suffice
I think it's safe to say you’re not at home
I’m calling your cell phone
You answer, but I can tell though that you're not alone
How was I to know? It should've been time to go
A long time ago; I kept holding on
It's comical when I think back now why I couldn't get the hint
And feel the draft you were throwing
I wasn't catching your drift
But there's a cold breeze blowing over me, I'm over you
Success is the best revenge to pay you back
And that payment is overdue
I overcame odds to get even
The sober me is shitting all over the un-sober you
And I hope they play this in every club that you're going to
I’m haunting you, bitch!
Everywhere you turn I'm following you
‘Cause I loved you with every ounce of me
You know it's true, it's killing you now
Yeah, I hope the ho dies slow in you
It's ‘cause of you now I don’t trust ‘em at all
Fuck 'em! Middle finger up
I’m gon' just keep grabbing my balls, cup 'em
I’ll never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up 'em
So, buttercup, don't try to come back
Knocking on my door all dolled up

‘Cause I’m moving on, don’t worry about me
‘Cause I’m gon' be just fine without you, you’ll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I’d much rather be
‘Cause, goddamn it, I’m glad that I’m me
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t, ‘cause you just feel like you

I’ve had it for the last time
Your actions got me hot as my last rhyme
You’re options are leave or put out; granted your ass fine
Fine just ain't gon' cut it
Drama is what you’re in love with
You and them bitches you run with
Lately I’m feeling smothered
You snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
Conceited with cover girl motives, I gotta rise above it
You thinking about who's loving me
I’m thinking about who doesn’t
Doesn’t really matter what you say, sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon' be splitting
You don’t think I mean it?
Left you with everything I got, fuck you!
Ain’t no secret, no apologies, you keep it
Now that I’m doing my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy, who needs it?
Every rumor you hear, you go believe it
Point out the times you’ve seen it
You stabbed me, should have leaned it
Revenge is mine, I need it, need a way out
It’s my fucking life, let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought I’d break, it ain't that easy
Bet you thought I'd need you
A million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you
Ain't no freebies, get your coat and go
The female Pinocchio, money hungry hopeless ho
You fucking with my focus, so
Go back to that chump that played the role before
Love is like a cancer when you don’t let go; I’ma blow fo sho
Unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I don’t need you sinking us, hope you float
Lying through my teeth, I hope you don’t (Drown! Drown!)
Not a sound out her be dope
Bottles pop out while he smoke
Hate we met, proud that we broke
Let them girls crowding me go
If they got something to show, let them show me
I don't love 'em, never lonely, never even left a scar
You fell hard, I’m laughing, ha ha ha ha ha
Tire smoke fancy car, nothing is what we are
No beginning, no tomorrow

‘Cause I’m moving on, don’t worry about me
‘Cause I’m gon' be just fine without you, you’ll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I’d much rather be
‘Cause, goddamn it, I’m glad that I’m me

Sky's the limit, up above and way beyond you haters
I'm coming at your head better duck
Out from under bushes like, ""surprise, remember us?""
My music is the most ominous shit you'll ever bump
Niggas wanna meet their maker I'm just here to hook it up
And when you get there just be sure to send him my regards
Lord forgive me for this shit these niggas got me on
I'm trying hard, so very hard
I pull you into beef that you can never squash

This the life we chose, dealing with the life we chose
It's a cold world homie and it's only getting colder
Motherfuckers get their whole life froze

This the life we chose, dealing with the life we chose
It's a cold world homie and it's only getting colder
Motherfuckers get their whole life froze

This ghetto giving out scars, we'll run the world in a year
I only figured out a plan and switched it, life sucked
Felt like I was tortured
Every day we had to climb through the dirt
Hell if I forfeit
Been around the world and back again, nigga, check out the portrait
No more selling me short shit, my will so strong
For my soul, if you came across it, time to reclaim my fortune
Big fleet, line up the horses, gotta stay on my feet
Fuck running, down with the fortress, M-O-B 'til I sleep, nigga
South Jamaica is my drive, watch your fucking own back
That's what it takes to stay alive
If fiends wild, I've got the crystal shiny with me now
A thousand and more styles, mine's like a clip of rounds
Watch for the shifty smiles, just push the bar higher
Done lifted the crowd
Building on tilt, fill up this bitch with loud
A temper on me and that click-and-pow
Holding on to all these memories
I've got to think about them just to smile

This the life we chose, dealing with the life we chose
It's a cold world homie and it's only getting colder

Catered dinners, finna have a pool party in the winter

Wake up and I smoke somethin’
After that, I poke somethin’
Bet she bad with a fat ass
Beat it up like she stole somethin’

Gettin’ energized off thin sleep

Pray to God, heard my number and I hit

Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

And I laughed at him and he got mad
The first day that he planted it it was just a twig

Then the first snow came and he ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited slipped and almost hurt himself and I laughed till I cried
He was always young at heart kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved him so
And I surprised him with a puppy kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass me

When he'd come in from working late cause he'd always know
If I'd been sittin' there and cryin' over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could
He wrecked the car and he was sad and so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be

Guess you could say he saw through me and hugged my neck
He came home unexpectedly and caught me crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robins sing he went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could
One day while I was not at home and he was there and all alone the angels came

Now all I have are memories of honey and I wake up nights and call his name
Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead and cries down on the flower bed that honey loved

What about love?
I don't let that stuff in my house
This is the glamorous life there's no time for fooling around

I don't need an alibi I need a fire escape and an open window
It's my problem it's nothing I can't deal with
I'm not chasing anything just jogging baby
What's your bag?
Hundred million dollar jam
Got some traffic yessir in my nose
Motorcycle speed cops burning up my dust roads
My baby left me heck ain`t that a shame
She's over in the corner with my new best friend
I'm doing fine with my whisky and wine
And meet me in the john john meet me in the john john
Lord have mercy
...What's your bag?
Spin spin whisky and gin I suffer for my art
Bartender I got wild mushrooms growing in my yard
Fix me a quart of petrol clams on the half shell

I'm too focused all around

I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path
I can read the sign
I can stay right with it
As the road unwinds
I can handle whatever
I stumble upon
I don't even notice that she's gone
Most of the time

Most of the time
It's well understood
Most of the time
I wouldn't change it if I could
I could make it all match up
I can hold my own?
I could deal with the situation
Right down to the bone
I could survive
I can endure
And I don't even think
'bout her
Most of the time

Most of the time
My head is on straight
Most of the time
I'm strong enough not to hate
I don't build up illusion until it makes me sick
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
I don't even remember how her lips felt on mine
Most of the time

Most of the time
She ain't even in my mind
Would I know her if I saw her
She's that far behind
Most of the time I can't even be sure
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her
Most of the time I'm halfways content
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went
I would cheat on myself
I don't run and hide
I won't hide from the feelings
That I buried inside
I don't compromise
And I don't pretend
And I don't even care
If I ever see her again

Of her family life, pretty weird at times

Rather than you, she said
I prefer solitude
Rather the company
I prefer cigarrettes

Even Los Angeles
Suffers occasionally
Do you have somewhere to stay?

But no more love songs
Not for me

I gave er whisky
And she gave me everything
There was a boy, she said
Beautiful, eloquent
He went to Spain
And where he went, she went

No Joan of Arc
She was broken discarded
And that was a long time ago

Still, no more love songs
No more love songs

I'll drink to harmony

I'll dance the victory waltz

Could you hold him in your arms

Would he have you go to hell?

Now wasn't she a woman too?

Lloyd Cole,"Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit. 
It was now Mid-August which meant he had
Been separated from Marsha for more than two months. 
Two months, and all he had to show was three dog-eared letters 
And two very expensive long-distance phone calls. 
True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin, 
And he to Locust, Pennsylvania, she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity. 
She would date occasionally, but merely as amusement. 
She would remain faithful.

But lately Waldo had begun to worry. 
He had trouble sleeping at night and when
He did, he had horrible dreams. 
He lay awake at night, tossing and turning
Underneath his pleated quilt protector, tears welling in his eyes as he
Pictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothing of
Some neanderthal, finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion.
It was more than the human mind could bear.

Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him. 
Daytime fantasies of sexual
Abandon permeated his thoughts. 
And the thing was, they wouldn't understand how she really was. 
He, Waldo, alone understood this. 
He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche. 
He had made her smile. She needed him, and he wasn't there (Aw)

The idea came to him on the Thursday 
Before the Mummers' Parade was scheduled to appear. 
He'd just finished mowing and etching the Edelsons lawn for a dollar
Fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from Marsha. 
There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company
Of America inquiring into his awing needs. 
At least they cared enough to write.

It was a New York company. 
You could go anywhere in the mails. 
Then it struck him. 
He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion,
True, but why not mail himself? 
It was absurdly simple. 
He would ship himself parcel post, special delivery.
The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to
Purchase the necessary equipment. 
He bought masking tape, a staple gun and a medium sized cardboard box 
Just right for a person of his build. 
He judged that with a minimum of jostling 
He could ride quite comfortably. A few airholes,
Some water, perhaps some midnight snacks, 
And it would probably be as good as going tourist.

By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set. 
He was thoroughly packed and the post
Office had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock. 
He'd marked the package
""Fragile"", and as he sat curled up inside, resting on the foam rubber
Cushioning he'd thoughtfully included, 
He tried to picture the look of awe 
And happiness on Marshas face as she opened her door, 
Saw the package, tipped the deliverer, 
And then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person. 
She would kiss him, and then maybe they could see a movie. 
If he'd only thought of this before. 
Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne up. 
He landed with a thud in a truck and was off.

Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair. 
It had been a very rough weekend. 
She had to remember not to drink like that. 
Bill had been nice about it though. 
After it was over he'd said he still respected her and, after all,
It was certainly the way of nature, 
And even though, no he didn't love her, 
He did feel an affection for her. 
And after all, they were grown adults. 
Oh, what Bill could teach Waldo, but that seemed many years ago.

Sheila Klein, her very, very best friend, walked in through the porch screen
Door and into the kitchen. ""Oh gawd, it's absolutely maudlin outside."" ""Ach, I
Know what you mean, I feel all icky!"" Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton
Robe with the silk outer edge. Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on
The kitchen table, licked her finger and made a face. ""I'm supposed to be
Taking these salt pills, but,"" she wrinkled her nose, ""they make me feel like
Throwing up."" Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an exercise she'd
Seen on television. ""God, don't even talk about that."" She got up from the
Table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue
Vitamins. ""Want one? Supposed to be better than steak,"" and then attempted to
Touch her knees. ""I don't think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again.""

She gave up and sat down, this time nearer the small table that supported the
Telephone. ""Maybe Bill'll call,"" she said to Sheila's glance. Sheila nibbled on
A cuticle. ""After last night, I thought maybe you'd be through with him."" ""I
Know what you mean. My God, he was like an octopus. Hands all over the place.""
She gestured, raising her arms upwards in defense. ""The thing is, after a
While, you get tired of fighting with him, you know, and after all I didn't
Really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him. You know
What I mean."" She started to scratch. Sheila was giggling with her hand over
Her mouth. ""I'll tell you, I felt the same way, and even after a while,"" here
She bent forward in a whisper, ""I wanted to!"" Now she was laughing very loudly.

It was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang
The doorbell of the large stucco colored frame house. When Marsha Bronson
Opened the door, he helped her carry the package in. He had his yellow and his
Green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had
Gotten out of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den. ""What do you
Think it is?"" Sheila asked. Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back.
She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living
Room. ""I dunno.""

Inside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the
Muffled voices. Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down
The center of the carton. ""Why don't you look at the return address and see who
It's from?"" Waldo felt his heart beating. He could feel the
Vibrating footsteps. It would be soon.

Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label. ""Ah, god,
It's from Waldo!"" ""That schmuck!"" said Sheila. Waldo trembled with expectation.
""Well, you might as well open it,"" said Sheila. Both of them tried to lift the
Staple flap. ""Ah sst,"" said Marsha, groaning, ""he must have nailed it shut.""
They tugged on the flap again. ""My God, you need a power drill to get this
Thing open!"" They pulled again. ""You can't get a grip."" They both stood still,
Breathing heavily.

""Why don't you get a scissor,"" said Sheila. Marsha ran into the kitchen, but
All she could find was a little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her
Father kept a collection of tools in the basement. She ran downstairs, and when
She came back up, she had a large sheet metal cutter
In her hand. ""This is the best I could find."" She was very out of breath.
""Here, you do it. I-I'm gonna die."" She sank into a large fluffy couch and
Exhaled noisily. Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the
End of the cardboard flap, but the blade was too big and there wasn't enough
Room. ""God damn this thing!"" she said feeling very exasperated. Then smiling,
""I got an idea."" ""What?"" said Marsha. ""Just watch,"" said Sheila, touching her
Finger to her head.

Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could
Barely breathe. His skin felt prickly from the heat, and he could feel his
Heart beating in his throat. It would be soon. Sheila stood quite upright and
Walked around to the other side of the package. Then she sank down to her
Knees, grasped the cutter by both handles, took a deep breath, and plunged the
Long blade through the middle of the package, through the masking tape, through
The cardboard, through the cushioning and (thud) right through the center of
Waldo Jeffers head, which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red
To pulsate gently in the morning sun.",A Gift,2007

To find your room swimming in blue and green
Should you awake to feel like you'd never slept
And feel so very old well don't you feel alone
I'm kind of blue blue for you again
I guess i`m a fool at least I'm not innocent
But what to do whatever I touch turns blue
And should you find yourself lost but in no need of sympathy
Calm down to the beach and watch the waves come in
I dream the ocean was in my house
I feel the surf against my skin
But I just can't keep the waves from dragging me down
But when you say
Oh baby you're my best friend
Then I lose I lose my common sense
I'm kind of blue it's the truth

So I have been told
I can easily believe it

You hang around backstreet bars
For what you wish you knew
You say give me something cheap
Something I won't want to keep
Love's not everything

Hell it's hard to say
I was hoping you might stick around

And double pneumonia in a single room
And the sickest joke was the price of the medicine
Are you laughing at me now, may I please laugh along with you?

This morning I woke up from a deep unquiet sleep
With ashtray clothes and miss lonelyheart's pen
With which I wrote for you a love song in tattoo
Upon my palm, 'twas stolen from me when Jesus took my hand

You see, I
I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it
Drop me and I'll fall to pieces so easily

I was a king bee with a head full of attitude
Wore my heart on my sleeve like a stain
And my aim was to taboo, you
Could we meet in the marketplace
Did I ever, hey please, did you wound my knees?

You see, I
I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it
Drop me and I'll fall to pieces, yes

I hang my head in a crying shame (shame)
There's nobody else to blame
Nobody else except my sweet self, oh

Twenty four gone years to conclude in tears
That the sickest joke was the price of the medicine
Are you laughing at me now, may I please laugh along, oh

Lloyd Green,"She looks in the mirror and stares at the wrinkles
That weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way?

She picks up her apron in little girl-fashion
As something comes into her mind
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet
And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age

She closes her eyes and
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

Devoted the heat of a spotlight in motion
With a face full of mud even though you were only joking

But now I feel I got a chance to kind of make things up to you a little bit
Heh, enough about you and me
How's my little son
Hmm, he ever ask about me
Just a little bit
Does he still like to go down by the supermarket
If I could just
If I could just see you
Can't really say what you mean or what you want over the phone
I swear I miss you
You done heard it ten times or more but
I swear I done changed 
I swear I done changed 

(Oh, I, oh, I) I miss you, baby
(Miss you, miss you)

If you don't know me by now 
You'll never, never, never know me 
All the things that we've been through 
You should understand me 
Like I understand you 

Now baby I know the difference 
Between right and wrong 
I ain't gonna do nothin' 
To upset our happy home 

Oh, don't get so excited 
When I comee home a little late at night 
Cause we only act like children 
When we argue, fuss and fight

We all got our own funny moods 
I've got mine 
Woman, you got yours too 
Just trust in me 

Like I trust in you

That should be so easy to do 
Just get yourself together

Yeah baby, let's do it

Oh shit, look at miss thing, you done grew into a stallion
Girl, and still don't got no ring?
Back then, you was a lot younger, now you older
Broke my heart, on what you had in the stroller
On the low, that could of been me, Huggie down
Fly and handsome, talk about little Starksky
With little Barkley's, little car seat
Two years later, here comes little Sharneese
I'm saying, are you involved, what's up with you?
And where homeboy at? Oh word, ya'll through?
Eff him, you know how I do, when I come through
Shut the whole block down like I got something to prove
But um, besides the lane, you look the same
Still blowing beauty marks, sitting under your bang
Ankle bracelets, that Donna Kay shit
I saw one rope for your throat, yo, it cost about 8 chips
Hoodrats, they be wearing that fake shit
Like her, she wear the same bag, like it ain't shit
Pardon me, excuse my French
Just read my lips, girl, everything's me

Yo, look around, everybody sipping on Rosette
All in our business, they wanna be nosy
He's with her, gonna be all in the streets, like a Jeep, tomorrow
Don't worry, let's breeze the bar
And in case I ain't tell you, those jeans is hard
And those is the snitches, mean mugging, can't fight
Run into the police, fuck them niggas
I pull out, like a tooth, when the back is rotten
Finish 'em off, like your menstrual, after you spotting
Ghost can't complain, 5'6"", swinging those hips
And my miss got me wanting to sing
Walking down the street, watching ladies
I got by watching you, watching you
I want you, like if I ain't got nothing to do

He's a goner, hey, you just say the word
Baby girl, I'm on that, hey, anything you need
Anything you want, want, hey, hey

Somebody better call the cops
'Cause if that thing cock back, it's gon' pop
Once me stop moving, it ain't gon' stop
Whatever that girl wants, you know she got shopping
Somebody better check the swag
We rack up and never check the tags
We just stuffed it all in the bag
Oh, you mad? Well, too bad

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Whatever fate may send
This is the tale that never will tire.
This is the song without end.

The oldest yet, the latest thing
I only hope that fate may bring
Love's story to you.",Love is the Sweetest Thing,2002
Lloyd Shaffer,"Love letters straight from your heart, 
Keep us so near while apart. 
I'm not alone in the night, 
When I can have all the love you write

I memorize every line, 
I kiss the name that you sign. 
And darling, then I read again right from the start, 
Love letters straight from your heart

Lloyd Shaffer,"Till the end of time, long as stars are in the blue
Long as there's a Spring of birds to sing I'll go on loving you
Till the end of time, long as roses bloom in May
My love for you will grow deeper with every passing day

Till the wells run dry and each mountain disappears
I'll be there for you to care for you through laughter and through tears
So take my heart in sweet surrender and tenderly say that I'm
The one you love and live for till the end of time

Till the wells run dry and each mountain disappears
I'll be there for you to care for you through laughter and through tears
So take my heart in sweet surrender and tenderly say that I'm

Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same

And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring

Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside

Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me

Only way you ever meet a girl like this.

We kinda have a way with words.
We even start a convo to get at her.

But with you it's not the same.
For you, I'm'ma ride.
I want you by my side,
I feel like them ghetto boys. (She playin with my mind)
I'm'ma tell you one more time. (She playin with my mind)
For you I'm'ma grind.
You were there through the pain.
You stood right by me, thanks to you I survived.
I guess it's true what they say,
Love is blind.
We together til the day that we die.
Until death do us part.

They can take all the houses and the cars.
But they'll never take my superstar.

Kept me a secret

You make my life bright 'cause you shine 
It's me and you baby, it's our time 
I'm living my dream, girl 'cause you mine 
You got me skippin down the street 
And singin love songs all out of key 
I didn't smoke nothin but I feel so high 
And I know why 
It's a love thing, it's got to be 
Your heart's all locked and I got the key 
It feels like I just won the lottery 
'cause I got my girl and she got me 

You my new obsession 
All I want to do

Oh, I can't get you out my mind 
Everything you do is feelin right 
Remember that way you caught my eye? 
I remember that way you was walkin by 
Ooh girl, watch out now 
You looked at me, turned around and smiled 
Gave me eyes, my heart went wild 
Hypnotized, this love starts now 
And how do I know you're real? 
It really doesn't matter, it's the way I feel 
You make me feel super like the man of steel 
Got me goin stupid, pickin daffodils

I caught her when she feel from heaven.
1 to 10, baby girl is an 11.
And I ain't trying to spit no game but I'm trying to figure out from where you came.
Because a star like her man it rarely occurs in a world like this.
Only will you ever meet a girl like this, get up in a spaceship and take that trip.
You gotta have a way with words.
Keep a short low convo to get at her.
Every other chick becomes a blur.
Be my misses I'll be your sir.
I love her, the way she is, the way she are, a shooting star.
And I pray that you never change, never ever change.

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane.
Na baby girl that's a shooting star with your name.
I ain't gon lie.
I told a lot of lies and played a lot of games.
But with you it's not the same, for you I'm a ride.
I want you by my side.
I feel like them ghetto boys, you're playing with my mind.
I'm a tell you one more time.
For you I'm a hustle, for you I'm a grine.
You were there through the pain, you stood right by me, thanks to you I survive.
I guess it's true what they say, love is blind.
We together till the day that we die, till death do us part.
Baby you my heart.
They can take all the houses and the cars.
But they'll never take my shooting star

I love just who you are, I ain't goin' try to change ya.

She never been in a limousine
And now she's living the life

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Could last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

Please don't let this be a simulation
(This better be real)
'Cause you a pretty thing
I hope it's not my imagination
(It better be real)

I'm dancing with you, girl
We spin it round and round
You spin me round and round
I'm falling for you girl
I'm falling in love

I know you want it
You know I want you too
I know you like it
I know you like my moves
On Saturday, on Saturday
Tonight be for free
Now that I got you
I won't ever leave you alone, alone, alone
Call your on my phone

I'm dancing with you
I wanna party with you, girl

And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

You never know how it's gonna go
When you bring a chick up in the limousine
Seeing things she never seen
And you walk up in the club, straight holding her hand, like you the man
But deep in your hear you know she's a fan
'Cause she's struck by the stars
And the stars find her striking
You try to play it off 'cause you see a sign of frightening
Will.I.Am is spittin' at her
T-pain is winking at her
Ludacris is with his chick but his homeboys gettin' at her

What's the matter? Oh nothing
I reply straight buffin' , grabbed the bottle started chuckin'
She grabbed my hand, pulled me to the dance floor
We dance close, and then she pulled my hands low

Oh, I know where this is gonna go
I've seen it in a dream before
I love it when you hold me tight
And then we kiss to the moonlight

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever

I used to play chess at the coffee bean.
And as my coffee steamed
I thought about my life and my lofty dreams.
It's so sick and I'm startin' to mix thanks to Anne
Rest in piece banana split
Was the place we all went Sundays,
To make people feel this way we would one day
And I remember when you gave me a secret,
Popped in the DVD and peeped it
And if you dreamin' you achivin',
After that it was a wrap
And now I walk in the club like a million times,
Spit on the mic like a million rhymes,
We party rock to a billion drops
And this shot makes one zillion shots
Yes I'm feelin' good, and we the best I'm feelin' good
And in your breast I'm feelin' good, haha lmfao
Ima pro with this party thang
I love cherry cheap cola and bacardi mang
Hey, I've been the same before it started, fame
You and I and the crew that I roll with,
It's gonna be the the same crew I roll old with

But the music that we make gonna last forever

On top of my game and I ain't even tryin'
Nowadays I'm stylin'
And when she make it I feel like cryin'
It's better than I hoped it'd be
I walk down the street and people notice me
No body was as broke as me
They say you never get nowhere smokin' weed
So I roll one up I stepped on a landmine blowin' up
And I ain't never growin' up
And if the party rocks and you know it's us
Me and foo in the club straight posted up
Back when I wasn't old enough
Now bottles all nice when you rollin' up
Cheers and toasts to us
Oh, we winnin' now
A whole lots changed since then and now
Fans show love and women shout
Make me feel like I'm the man
All of my friends n' my fans don't let em change you
Been from London to Japan and I'm still the same dude

No racial barrier can stop the holy ghost

Millions of dollars for millions of pains

But we do have the same soul locked in chains
We like to cry not far live not die
Knowing all the answers without asking why
Personal pursuit pass our loved ones by
Frustrated with god with our hands in the sky
We load those guns, pipes, records with lies
Standing stupid right behind foolish pride

All good to groovy

You coulda been bout three blocks down
Hittin' gates and gateways and all that
Kept all the cash, the yay, and the gat

Came back out and shot back up
See'mon, see'mon, and RUN

You must be one of them tight big niggaz that's old
But I'm from the bigger number with the rhythm and roll

I hit blocks, dip cops
Kept the knot, dropped the glock, ended up on Wilcox
It don't even matter now cause I done throwed them rocks
Went through a house that I don't know like I was Goldie Locks

I broke a sweat
Now I'm smokin' dro in a Lac
I'm throwin' a pack

'Yes. This is a cautionary tale. 
 You can ... take it any which way you wanna. 
 I mean no disrespect in part two. 
 As we just ... alright ... let me ...' (Ty's voice fades)

It was a sunny afternoon, somewhere between April, May or maybe June
The year had been quite busy 
and I was just taking a break from having to make a tune
I was chilling with my cousin rude boys undercover just ... 
watching the place
Sitting opposite the tube 
and this girl walked up and said 'I recognise your face.
Your name's Ty isn't it? I seen you in this and that magazine'
I was quite chuffed really, 
looked slightly at my cousin and we both said 'seen!'
One month later she phones me up
'I'm in the area, can I come up?' I'm like 'please!'
Turned to my brethren said 
'I love you like a brother, but BRUSH you got to leave!'

(Tee talking)
'You know what I'm saying? You got to leave! If you met this girl right,
you'd understand. You - have - got - to - go. Thank you.'

Check my reflection in the mirror, 
spray a little air fresh, splash a little brute
Answer the intercom, 'is Tee there?' Oh,, she sounds cute!
I take her jacket and she's left with a white dress going from here to here
I offer her a drink, but she only wants water, I'm like 'oh each!'
The conversation goes from vague adult chat to thinly veiled come on's
Blood leaves my brain, my whole body's a drum stick ... anxious to drum on
How shall I approach this? I'm virtually brain dead plus the line's busy
I begin with a little friendly WWF and touch the titty!

(Girl talking, Ty whistling in background)
'Hold on, what are you doing? What are you doing? Are you trying to touch
any of this? Who are you? Just because ...' (Girl's voice fades)

Felt so ashamed! Had to excuse myself by pretending to take the piss
Walked to the mirror, splashed water on my face and said 'man what is this?'
Get a grip Ben, just because the girl's here doesn't mean you're in
Ha, this sexy bullshit can mess up the play 
and make you think your love is king

(Ty talking)
'Ohhh boy. Listen ... 
 you know when you're in one of those predicaments where it's like, 
 just, oh what can I say, I can't say ...' (Ty's voice fades)

I left the bathroom with a clear head, 
expecting her to moan, apologetic in the worst way
She's butt naked on the sofa, 
smiling like a joker 'T-why it's your birthdayyy!'

(Ty talking)
'No, no, no, no, no, no, no, why'know, no! 
 You don't, listen, you don't have to ask me what happened next! 
 Anyway, lets just say ... mighty fun was had by all!
 Of course this is fictional, so. why'know.'",The Tale,2001

Invento o cais

Anche se il ministro era impegnato con il jazz 
Il presidente con le belle donne 
E il suo maggiordomo coi versi 
E i cattivi bastardi se ne sono andati 
Che volevano spiegarsi e non ci siamo parlati 
Che volevano traslocare e li abbiamo sistemati 
Che volevano volare e li abbiamo lanciati

Ma chissà se è vero il trambusto che si sente 
Quando un paese intero applaude con lo sfollagente 
E Federico se n'è andato via da solo

E Mario si presenta alle elezioni, che vuoi?

Sono arrivate le bottiglie, quelle le han portate 
Gli amici del sindacato 
Il governo ha sacrificato le vergini per pagare il locale 
Poi a un certo punto il capo ha detto 
""Adesso facciamo finta che siete voi a comandare 
Io faccio solo l'aguzzino"" 
Ma che infamia finire la guerra e non avanzare vino 
Far fuori chi ha fame e poi non avere pane 
Farsi concorrenza senza mai lavorare 
E andare affanculo perché non si sa dove andare

Si sta svegli finché non muore la speranza

E le dispiace pure che vai a fare il cameriere

Di chi si difende dai processi e non nei processi

Come ergastolani in turnee ma molti più sorridenti
Dei fascisti col culto del corpo

In cinque contro uno

Mentre I preti contestualizzano bestemmie
E nella guerra per la pace vince da sempre
Il voto moderato

La prossima volta che dite una stronzata
Ammazzatevi da soli

Che poi arrivo dopo tre giorni ed è secco ormai 
E va bene per i pomodori gratin

A unire l'utile col dilettevole
A prendere fischi per comprare fiaschi di vino che comunque non apprezzi

Preferirei fare l'opposto ed essere debole con te

Preferirei stare per ore a vederti piangere di felicità 
Perché hai capito il sistema che hai imposto
Perché hai compreso che non c'è posto per lamentarsi delle avversità 

E solo l'aria ci salverà

Lo Stato Sociale,"Il turno chiamato corta e quello più estremo della cortissima 
Sono due turni molto adatti a chi, come il babbo, 
Preferisce alzarsi presto, lavorare e staccare presto. 
Dice che così ha la giornata libera anche se poi alle 10 di sera si addormenta. 

L'azienda, chiamata così senza mai davvero nominarla, 
È uno di quei posti dove lavorare è quasi un piacere. 
Sicuramente quasi un titolo per gente che, 
Sicuramente di titoli non ne ha. 

Durante tutti gli anni 70 I dipendenti 
Dei servizi dei trasporti pubblici bolognesi 
Sono stati vestiti con uno stile invidiabile
Camicie azzurre, pantaloni a zampa, mocassini e libertà di barba, 
Baffi e capelli tipo George Harrison e Gianni Rivera

Il babbo di storie sulla guida te ne potrebbe raccontare per ore. 
Per 30 anni ha portato a spasso l'unità più varia con 
Il solo obbiettivo di finire il turno puntuale
Perché se sei puntuale finisci il turno in orario. 

L'Azienda era una roba fresca, giovane. 
Gli autisti avevano fatto un bel ricambio 
E non c'erano più quelli del Tramvai
Malgrado le rotaie di via Rizzoli 
Ti facciano ricordare di un'urbanistica di tempi andati

La linea 30 tagliava Bologna in direzione Nord-Sud, 
Da San Michele in Bosco alla Bolognina. 
Portava in centro gli impiegati degli uffici 
E gli operai della Casaralta alla Casaralta. 

Non è un caso che la squadra del quartiere si chiamasse Bo.CA 
Con il puntino fra Bo e Ca. 
Lo leggi come Bocajuniors, ma in realtà significa Bolognina Casaralta. 

Un giorno in via Marconi il babbo fa fermata, 
Dalla porta anteriore si affaccia uno tutto di corsa e chiede, questo va in stazione?
Scoprì poi di aver imbarcato un giornalista dell'odiatissimo Resto del Carlino. 
Il babbo è sempre stato uno di molte parole e buoni sentimenti, 
Ma con una freddezza che in molti punti 
Della mia vita ho scambiato per menefreghismo. 

Anche quel giorno aveva il solito obbiettivo di staccare il turno in orario, 
Andare a prendere mio fratello all'asilo e ritornare a casa da mia mamma. 
Il 2 Agosto 1980 la Linea 30, come al solito,
Scendeva da via Marconi verso Piazza dei Martiri, 
Dritto in via Amendola e poi a destra, 
Davanti alla stazione dei treni. 

Sembra distantissimo, ma se la fai a piedi in 5 minuti sei arrivato. 
Il tipo di corsa dice, è scoppiata una bomba

Uno, due, tre, 10, 20, 50, 76 alla prima conta e 85 al definitivo. 
Centinaia I feriti. 
Eppure la Linea 30 alle 10 e mezza passò per viale 
Pietramellara non sospettando nulla del genere. 

La stazione dei treni non era più una stazione dei treni. 
Era una cosa, una roba senza senso o forma. 
Polvere e macerie, gente ferita e grida. 
L'ambulanze per prime, la polizia. 

Una bomba in stazione il 2 di Agosto. 
Chi ci avrebbe mai pensato? 
Chi è stato? 

La B2, sicuramente lo Stato lo sa. 
Non lo sanno gli autisti degli autobus fra cui il babbo. 
Non lo sanno gli autisti dei taxi, 
I dipendenti della ferrovia, I lavoratori della CIGAR, 
Chi passava per caso, chi andava via, tornava, 
Se ne stava nella sala d'aspetto della seconda classe. 

Non lo so io nato nel 1985. 
Non lo sai tu. 
Nono lo sanno I vigili del fuoco, I medici. 
Non lo sa ancora nemmeno l'autobus 37 con Agide Melloni 
Che per 16 ore prestò servizio come soccorritore. 

La linea 30 oggi passa ancora dalla stazione dei treni di Bologna. 
Fa ancora quel percorso. 
In verità chiunque passi dalla stazione fa ancora quel percorso",Linea 30,2014

Passerò col vento, passerà il momento, passerai per sempre, passerà la gente

fuori bruciano le strade e i fumogeni negli occhi, 
la pancia delle camionette, 
le tue caviglie così strette, 
il buio in fondo alle tue cosce, 
il collo sbavato delle sigarette. 

Sbirri al telefono che brindano alla morte delle zecche, 
bottegai piangono nei calici delle loro tasche, 
ma anche tu eri ubriaca quando mi dicevi quella volta
Se non la posso ballare allora no, non è la rivolta

Tra una pantera insanguinata e una gazzella morta, 
tu portami a ballare tutto il resto è la rivolta. 

Non t'amerei senza perdere i denti, 
senza asfalti roventi o meritevoli agenti vivi ancora per poco,

gli spari sugli studenti, 
per te non fossero altro che un gioco.

che bruci nella fica ogni sua puttana

Lo Stato Sociale,"Parole parole parole
soltanto fiumi che vanno da sole
che non so afferrare
che è facile dirle senza pensare e guardare altrove
le luci del palco mi fanno sudore
il tuo sguardo vergognare forte
conosci un altro modo per fregare la morte a parte le brutte canzoni da parafrasare
Ho le gambe imbranate, il fumo alle tempie come un toro ubriaco 
di cocktail da tonici se ti avessi sfuggito non l'avrei fatto
sembrava ieri
sembrava adesso
sembrava lo stesso di quando bambino aggrappato 
alle nuvole chiedevo un passaggio per un mondo fragile
invece rimango inchiodato ai tuoi occhi, inediti,
infilzati nei miei come banderillas
come corde di rame che portano di ritorno la corrente

sbagliandosi lungo le corde tesissime elettriche

che io giuro che smetto di bere
che tua madre ti vorrebbe dal parrucchiere
che tu dici che hai solo i capelli crespi
che tanto lo sai di avere il potere di essere qualsiasi ma non lo usi
e ritorni a guardare ogni volta che mi tiri un baffo con il pensiero
e sei un maledetto chirurgo

mi porti a guardare il cielo cadere
a bruciare un contratto
a fumare la vertigine sui pali della luce

che sono vere anche se sono dei luoghi comuni
e allora capisco che non sono nei buoni
per nulla migliori di una serie televisiva adolescenziale
che il punto non è dire la verità ma dirla male
e allora te lo voglio dire
senza dirla per luogo comune

Che la violenza sulla violenza è una buona ragione
che più volte ho pensato di voler sparare
che il coraggio non ce l'ho altrimenti non sarei bravo a parole
che si scrive per non leggere e si parla per non ascoltare
e la democrazia è questa cosa qui, non un'altra ideale, 
e ha rotto i coglioni e odio cantare
e odio i cantanti che fingono di piangere e gli attori che fingono di arrossire

e se canti a squarciagola una mia canzonetta sospetto
che tu non abbia di meglio da dire, o da scopare
odio la musica balcanica ai capodanni
e quella giacchetta la odierei se avessi un po' di gusto, 
un po' di interesse per il vestire
ma forse sono solo stanco delle persone, dei cani, 
delle puttane che piangono sui giornali, dei giornalisti che ne fanno eroine,
dei referendum a ricatto nelle fabbriche dei padroni che esistono ancora

e pure gli operai, i proletari, i tiranni, le guerre, le stragi di stato, 
l'amianto, la repressione, lo squadrismo della nostra polizia statale
l'avresti mai detto per luogo comune che avresti 
vissuto nella stessa sbilenca mezza stagione

che ti ha portato in coda con altre persone 
a firmare un assegno di disoccupazione in mezzo al trionfo di un grande 
paese industriale

Ma tu torna a ballare bella come non esistesse alcuna speranza
come la luce di una bottiglia di notte nel mare, 
nuova stella polare per un battello etilico nella grazia tentennante e perduta
che mai giuro ci avevo pensato
che mai giuro mi sarebbe capitato
di avere paura del mare al punto da scegliere di annegarci
per togliermi il pensiero
che poi, la scelta la fai tu
tirandomi un baffo 
con un pensiero non sempre intelligente 
ma profondo come il relitto che 
è il mio ottimismo in alta stagione balneare

Ti ho toccato il culo e abbiamo riso
il tuo culo frega la morte al tavolo in trattative con la felicità
vorrei fosse il mio sindacato
vorrei non averti mai baciato
vorrei non aver detto questa cosa
vorrei averlo sempre fatto
tu vendi la droga
io neanche bevo il caffè
un matrimonio consumato tra un silografo e la principessa ballerina

Lo Stato Sociale,"Spero che ti possa tagliare con un foglio
Mentre firmi per la casa nuova

E che la penna si rompa
E ti sporchi il vestito che ti toglie un altro ogni sera
Spero che sia l’uomo perfetto
Ma non noti se ti tagli i capelli
E confonda il tuo compleanno con quello di sua madre

Vorrei che almeno un giorno a settimana
L’autobus arrivi tardi
Vorrei che nella pioggia un’auto nera
Schizzi la tua gonna corta
Che passavo più tempo con le mani perse là sotto
Piuttosto che attaccate al volante di un’auto nera
La mia auto nera

Buona, buona sfortuna
Buona, buona sfortuna
Come te non c’è nessuna
E per fortuna
Amore, buon viaggio e
Buona sfortuna

Spero che le cose non si mettano bene
Ci sia nebbia il giorno della tua festa
E il cane dei vicini abbai ogni sera
Ma solo quando guardi un film
E tutte le tue amiche facciano l’amore
Nelle notti in cui non sai dormire
E i resti della spesa siano tutti di rame

Vorrei non ti facessero mai male le gambe
Quando torni dal lavoro
Ma avessi una fitta al ginocchio mentre
Ti pieghi per fare l’amore
Vorrei non ti riuscisse il colore
Nuovo dei capelli
Ti facesse incazzare
Non ti facesse uscire per due giorni di casa

Buona, buona sfortuna

Se togli la ribalta, la radio, la musica, la fama e la voglia
Di riscrivere daccapo una storia irrisolta
Me lo chiedi e siamo dentro a un bar
E sei davvero stanca e hai perso gli occhi in una banca
E hai un contratto nuovo come protesi
Eri più bella quando non eri di nessuno, eri più bella quando eri gratis
Eri più bella quando rischiavi, eri più bella
Eri più bella come ipotesi

E non chiedevi altro alla vita che uscirne sudata e coi polsi tremanti
Le ginocchia sporche, una luce negli occhi
E non è piangere e non è urlare, ridere forte da spaccare i vetri
Rompere le cose finché ne hai, morire di vino e soste leggere
E a pochi passi dalla fine ubriacare le paure
E risorgere tramortiti il giorno dopo in un albergo
Con una vasca di squali nel cervello
Ed un'elica che ti solleva il petto
Stupidi come l'amore
Saggi come l'incoscienza
Senza più pensieri da gettare in mare
Senza più parole per abboccare e scoprire
Sempre dopo che per sempre non c'è tempo
Amarsi più forte di lavorare
Avere sempre meno ore
Che davvero non c'è tempo, non c'è tempo
E sei tu il tuo tempo migliore
Il tuo tempo migliore
Ah oh ah, oh ah oh

E mi chiedi cos'è questo bisogno di spingersi al limite
E fare sempre la scelta sbagliata per vedere che succederà
E non farsi mai andare bene quel poco di pace prima del buio
Dover lasciar vincere il vento
Mischiare la pelle ed esplodere il cuore e ancora
Ti cerco nei giorni migliori
Ti cerco nei sorrisi degli altri
Che non sorridono mai come te

Girl, candy must be yo name
'Cause yo sweetness is my weakness
And I'm damn sure nothing can beat this
 
Girl, I bet cha that since I met ya 
The sun just shines everyday
The dreariness of loneliness
Has done my own way
I never want it 'cause my heart has found us
Thinking when we're apart
That we must have hit the spot
Sending an arrow straight to my heart.
 
There's a little something that you should know
I'm in love, ooh ooh
I got a thang for ya baby.
 
Some folks are just old fashioned 
but I know that other folks just want some action
tell me who is looking for a in the heart
'cause you and I keep love alive 
and Baby, you know we should never ever let it die

Il reste pour moi tant de choses à faire
Je suis une femme qui court
Comme toutes les femmes qui courent

Au bout de tes mains
Si tu cherches à les tendre
Petite voix dans la nuit viens
M'apprendre à entendre

Ce cri qui te vient
L'écouter c'est rendre
A qui tu es celle que tu deviens
Et souffler les cendres

Loane,"Je dors je dors je dors vers mes petits matins
J'ai laissé mes idées dehors je pense plus à rien
La nuit c'est mon petit paradis
Ma récréation
Je mets sur pause la maladie de la réflexion

Je me lève je n'ai pas faim nourrie de questions
Qui me rejoignent au saut du lit comme une chanson
Ah! comment ça s'arrête
Ah! ce petit moulin dans ma tête

Alors voilà, moi je me sens jamais seule, non
Y a toujours du bruit chez moi, toujours un petit je-ne-sais quoi
Alors voilà, moi je me sens jamais seule, non
Un peu de vacances, tu vois, je voudrais me sortir de là

Je gamberge, je pense, j'oublie tout autour
Isolée du monde qui danse, je passe mon tour
Toujours à chercher des réponses, préoccupée
Dans ma petite bulle y a même plus de place pour m'amuser

Alors je dors je dors vers mes petits matins
Pour laisser mes idées dehors, plus penser à rien
Ah! pour que ça s'arrête
Ah! ce petit moulin dans ma tête

Alors voilà, moi je me sens jamais seule, non
Y a toujours du bruit chez moi, toujours un petit je-ne-sais quoi
Alors voilà, moi je me sens jamais seule, non
Un peu de vacances, tu vois, je voudrais me sortir de là

Ne plus toujours prendre au sérieux

Avant essentiels à mes yeux
Secondaires au final

Je n'aurais jamais pensé que tout m'est égal
Un peu moins bien ou un peu mieux

Et on saute tous de branche en branche
Si c'est comme ça c'est qu'à l'évidence

Ou depuis le temps il a laissé tomber

Et chaque fois on refait ses valises

De partir en laissant du chagrin

Enfermée dans la cage de l'amour

Quand je pense à tout ce que je vais devoir faire

Je vais m'imposer d'exister
Suivant les codes de société
Tant pis si je suis à côté des rails
Moi je veux juste un train à ma taille

We can talk of tomorrow, I'll tell her things that I want to do
But girl how can I tell her about you.

How can I tell her about you
Girl please tell me what to do
Everything seems right whenever I'm with you
So girl won't you tell me how to tell her about you.

How can I tell her I don't miss her whenever I'm away
How can I say it's you I think of every single night and day

Lobo,"I'm sure it might have grown old
Like most young things usually do
And dangling a line to try and find your mind
For that I can't blame you.
Now I'm not questioning your motives
For all the silly things you've done
Now you're coming round putting yourself down
Telling me I always was the one
It sure took a long time to miss me
A long time for you to come around
A long time to find what was wrong
It sure took a long, long time.

Seems so much stronger than before

Lobo,"I wore the clothes you liked
You said they gave me that look
I even tried to like the food
I know you like to cook
I parted my hair on the left
I carried your arm on the right

And I stayed out late at night.

I can't give any more of my soul away
And still look myself in the mirror everyday
I can't change any more
Of what makes me be myself
And still have enough left
Not to be somebody else
I'm not demanding as a man
Just asking you, love me for what I am.

I tried hard not to say
The things you don't like to hear
And when to you it was apropos

I know more about you than you do yourself
I know what you're feeling in your heart
Don't go jiving me with all your crying
I got loving you down to an art.

You can't take the stars out of the night sky
You can't wear love off a wedding ring
I can't separate your love from life now
To me they are one and the same thing.

Lobo,"I've seen a lot of things change in many ways
Since I was a boy back in the rock and roll days
Back when a bust was a six-pack of cold beer.
Marciano, he was champ the band all played through one amp
And the biggest thing was getting rubber in second gear

I love the rock and roll days
And I love all the good old ways
We used to do things in our crowd
I love the rock and roll days
And I love all the good old ways
We used to do the same things that we do now.

The only bikes back there were Schwinns
The only pigs were the bad wolf's friend
And going to the outdoor movie was something neat
Messing around then was not big
That's the one thing I did not dig
I was lucky to get as far as the back seat.",Rock & Roll Days,1973
Lobo,"You've been around for a long, long time
I've seen you here before

I ain't much to look at
But one of these nights you're going
Home with me, I'm gonna see to that.

Well I'm just waiting out my time
Standing at the end of the line
I got a lot of loving I'm saving inside for you
Yes I'm just waiting out my time
Standing at the end of the line
But you're gonna know that you've
Been loved when I get through loving you.

You look right at me and smiled
One time just last week
And what one look from you did to me
It kept me in my seat

But you picked another guy to entertain you that night
And I was left to entertain myself so I got into a fight",Standing at the End of the Line,1973
Lobo,"I've noticed since we both were kids
I recall the silly things we did
She would want to ride upon my back
To keep from stepping on a crack

I didn't think of it back then
But even when she did not win
She was happy just to play
Stoney liked to live out every day

[Chorus]
Stoney, happy all the time
Stoney, liked the summertime
The joy you find in living every day
Stoney, how I love your simple ways

The times when no one understood life
Seems that Stoney always would
We'd walk for hours in the sand
She would always try and hold my hand

You said you aren't home much anymore
I stopped dropping by without an appointment
'Cause I'd hear laughter coming through your door.

Sometimes late at night you'll still call me
Just before you close your eyes to sleep
You make me vow to try and stop by sometime
Baby that's a promise I can't keep.

I love you too much to ever start liking you
So let's just let the story kinda end
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So don't expect me to be your friend.

I don't walk down through the village or other places
That we used to go to all the time

So don't expect me to be your friend.

You always act so happy when I see you
You smile that way you take my hand and then
Introduce me to your latest lover

Lobo,"Where do butterflies go when it rains?
Who goes around & tucks in the trains?
What makes a teddy bear like to sleep?
Why do we all make promises that we can't keep?

Where do puppy dogs go when their sad?
And what do elephants say when their mad?
Who do you tell if you don't have a friend?
Why do we open our mouths and stick our foot in?

These are the things that bother me,
Not a lot of things across some sea,
I don't even have a master plan,
I guess that I am just a simple man.

Just come on home, baby, we'll laugh and sing
We'll make love, let the telephone ring
Ring, ring, doorbell ring, baby, come on in
Got James Taylor on the stereo
I'm glad you come around, I've been feelin' down
Just talkin' to Tony and Mario
You know they make good conversation
Still it ain't no consolation
Cause I got love, baby
I'll give you some and if somebody comes
We'll let the doorbell ring

Around your pretty finger

Anybody can be a singer

Lobo,"When I got back to Atlanta
A whole lot worse for the wear
I may have lost the world I love
But at least I had been there
Lonesome, hurt and worried
With not a lot to do
Driving down Stone Mountain Road
Trying not to think of you
The southern woods are warm
And still
They lay good on my mind
And surely but so slowly
I'm starting to unwind
Trying not to think of things
That you did or didn't do
Here I am once again
Trying not to think of you
But I all do is think of you
And where you might be now
What's new with you?
Do you still have Boo?
I gotta find a way some how
To stop thinking of you
I wonder who I'll find this time
To turn my head for awhile
Maybe I'll pick a Georgia peach
Or maybe walk a mile
Whichever way it
Don't much make a damn what I do
'Cause either way I'll spend my time
Trying not to think of you",Thinking of You,1975
Lobo,"When I was young I had a dream
That I would meet someone like you
And we would have a happy home
If the world would leave us alone

So it came to pass it all came true
You needed me like I needed you
But the world kept moving on
And our life was changed by a song

Sometimes I wonder and I worry too
If I did not know how to sing
Would I still have you?
That's the time I wished
I'd never bought that first guitar
I'd be out somewhere in Oklahoma
Fixing cars
But maybe after my hard working
Day was through
I'd still have you

With people lining up for it all the time
And the world I loved went floating by
How did I miss the hurt in your eyes",Would I Still Have You,1975
Lobo,"Lying there beside me
With your head resting on my arm

I'll ever like what you'll be saying

Don't tell me goodnight
It makes me feel so empty inside
And if only I could
I wouldn't sleep at all
Don't tell me goodnight
Just let me drift off slowly away
And dream of you

But I guess that you know it
You sure turn my head around
And I'm sure that I show it
If you'll take the chance on romance
When this dance is over
Maybe we could slide away
To a quieter place
This could be a day in the life of a love
That could last forever
How could we ever know until we try
This could be a day in the life of a love
That could last forever
We'll surly make it last till morning light

Does it so to crazy
Well I just had to say it
When my heart speaks to me

Sittin' way in the back

Grandma Ditty and her old
Hound dog named Gus
Grandma picks on a banjo
And Gus he kicks up a fuss

That dog can dance
He can dance
Ah he can dance
He can dance your troubles away
Yea, yea, yea, yea

But some say it's a case
Of the fleas
Some say it's because
He was raised on Granny's
Old home brew recipe

But he can two paw
Four paw
Tail wagging boogie
He can Rock an Roll it too
He can slip and slide
He can groove and glide

And cure your ills
He can dance","Gus, the Dancing Dog",1979

About our heart to heart

To face the music
And recognize the way I feel

That it's time for me
To start it all over again

To look my way.
Now it's a little too late.

Where were you

Where were you
When I was falling in love?
Looking for you, baby.
If I'd ever looked in those eyes before,
We'd be together tonight I'm sure.

When I was falling in love?
Where were you
Lost and looking for love?

If I'd have met you sooner,
I'd be talking to you and playing the game.

Por si acaso pillo alguno nebuliando

Y titubearon cuando la vieron de frente
Porque de noche a ella le cambia la mirada
Si dispara, probara como se siente

Que dispara fuego, cuando se pone ansiosa
Viciosa de la calle, que no da detalle
Y que me dice Ñengo apriétame apriétame hasta que estalle
Su vida siempre está loca
Es una demente, puede lastimar a la gente yo yo yo
Se van a quedar inconsciente, cuando
Mi mami se ponga fulete, en cona

Si ve que hace falta oh
Yo que tu no me juego esa carta
Si eso pasa, aquí nadie se salva

Mi nena no se tranca da cara por mi
Si ve que hace falta
Yo que tu no me juego esa carta
Si eso pasa, aquí nadie se salva

De un viaje para patricio, si te azoto con la nena
Siete pies, un poco de arena y tu nombre ya no suena
Explosiva, ella es mi diva
La que los los brinca para arriba y los asesina
Somos el unos para el otro y yo muero por mi mami
Ready anda conmigo, para forma el party
Donde sea, a la hora que sea y escucha bien
Si hay que pistolear, pistolea también

Con ella se te acaban las aventuras
Conocela y veras que no come cuento
Es como tener una corta en la cintura
Que te asegura, que el seguro esta puesto

Con ella se te acaban las aventuras
Un paso en falso y te dará un escarmiento
Es como sacarla corta de la cintura
Es una cura, cada vez que la aprieto

Por eso anda suelta por ahí

You hoped that we would rock
Knock it up a notch
Rockin' was nowhere in sight
And its never good when it goes bad

And it may be ok
But you won't wear our t-shirts now
Anymore
First the band looked wired
Then the band looked tired
Sluggish and a little slow
He's walking through the set
As drunk as he could get
And what the hell was wrong with joe?
And you could tell the crowd was fading fast
Every song we played looser than the last
And it may be ok
But you won't wear our t-shirts now
All the kids, they hold a grudge
Their minds are logged onto the net
And all the kids, they hold a grudge
You fail them and they won't forget it
All the kids, they're tired and turn away
They saw what you did
You're all wrong and all the kids are right
You heard that we were great
But now you know we're lame
Since you saw the show last night
You hoped that we would rock
You wished that we'd just stop
And finally we said ""good night""
When we had returned for the encore
You and half the room had headed for the door
No one wanted more

Their minds are logged onto the net

You fail them and they won't forget it

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing
