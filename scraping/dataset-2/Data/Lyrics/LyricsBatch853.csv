My Nigga Kaine, open it cut
Pouring it up, rolling it up
Holing it up, ain't her ass swollen or what?
Yes sir yes sir
Oh we gonna take it back like thieves and foes
Nasty as I wanna be
That must be too live for your crew hoe, get down get low
I'm crossing these mammas like tic tac toe
Let's ride lets go
Get loose get crunk get drunk get blown

All the lil' mamas, all around the world
Shake that ass if you a nasty girl
Back that ass up says juvenile
Show a nigga some titties, like ""Girls Gone Wild""
Tear off this clip of clothes, I want to see you in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down to yellow brick road, where niggas go to see naked hoe's
Shake that shit bitch
And be off in the club with a hard-ass dick, then drop like this bitch
If you wanna make the money shawty work that shit
Put a hump in your back and lift your rump
Do a three-point stance, put yo fist up her ass
You must be on that Kanye work-out plan, like head, shoulders, knees, hoes

Shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake, shake, just shake

Pitbull,"School ya?ll to somethin right quick
Sit down, open your ears, close your eyes, listen

Here?s a little story that I got to tell
About this Chico named Pit everyone knows so well
Illmatic like Nas but that ain?t hard to tell
Owes it all to Dade County and the ATL
Picked rap and skipped the triple beam scale
And it?s a known fact he gon? die before he fails
These boys rap about hustlin? but can't make bail
I call that hustling backwards and that?s real
Miami?s hot so I can vacation in hell
The way the game is shit, man, I mind as well
I look at these fools on camera flashin? they tools
They must?ve forgot the streets got codes and rules
But me, I?m confused
?Cause rappers wanna be gangstas
Gangstas wanna be rappers
Ballers wanna be rappers
And rappers wanna be ballers
The truth is its more sickening than Ebola
Until they handcuff then its over
Pop up no dandruff, no neck, just head and shoulders
Bust guns, sell drugs, that?s what the streets showed us
But corporate America, that?s what they sold us

I knew she was mine
The day I seen that guy
The big mouth bass
On the line
It's time for me to retrieve her
And go git her like a wild receiver
But we don't play no ball
See when we come through
We baby girl gon' BB don't play at all

On the real we need to nip this in the bud
'Cause we kept it real with everyone
So tell me why they hatin' (everybody's hatin')
It feels like they just waitin' (for us to grow apart)
It's just hard for me to do

I guess I gotta be your man
These men just gotta understand
Little girl, with curves and hips, luscious lips
Girl I can't front now
I'm nervous

Now a days is so crazy
Out here
You'd wanna be cuttin' me
If your daughter struts with me
Lucky me, and you'd be lucky too
No entourage, no crew
Just me ridin' with my boo
I got her
But don't think I'm replacin' you

Girl know you know what I do
And I know you made your mind up
It'll take days and days, and decades to find another
Dude that's gonna walk in my shoes
And girl keep it one with you
As long if you do the usual

Pitbull,"I know y'all listen to my music (red eyes) 
But what I'm a do know is try and describe my life to y'all

Sometimes I fell like I'm loosing it 
My life is upside down 
A gift and a curse that's my life now 
There is no looking or turning back 
I used to watch coke turn to crack that's what made me turn to rap
I fell like Keanu Reeves in the movie Devils Advocate 
Confused but blessed with extravagance 
I thank god for all the opportunities 
Given the opportunity dem boys would put two in me (bla bla bla)
We live in the land of the free, hustlers and thieves 
I made money now I got uncle Sam hustling 
Me for a quarter of what I make 
Hand a quarter sentence to a fake and watch them turn state (that's right)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Until the fed's step in (that's just the way it is) 
Most of these fools are characters 
Men with no character welcome to America 
Where we fight for freedom 
If ain't about oil than we don't need them 
Ain't that the truth? 
Pitbull I'm just tell y'all the way I fell 
Thank god that god made me to keep it real

[Chorus]
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is)
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)
Till that money step in (that's just the way it is)

Huh hun yo 
After the turf war the smoke clears 
All these years around these busta I'm convinced there ain't no hope here
In the past four years of my lifetime 
I witness leaders sacrifice freedom just to get this pipeline
Guess I'm chosen at the right time mama stress
Facing the table and she's snorting up white line 
Blood is thicker than water
In a few cases your daughter can have touched for the money that in dem suit case 
Tighten my shoelaces the fugitive running 
In fear of a criminal past 'cause dem folks is coming 
I've been wrongfully judged being from this environment 
The city gangs planning retirement 
I'm a a Dade nigga 
Voicing my set 'cause a spray quick 
Took some of the same steps through little Haiti 
As these main nigga (like who) hit man, big dog, and she hound 
Y'all predict it back then shit I see it know

[Chorus]

I escape poverty (poverty) 
I don't own jewelry motherfucker I own property 
You can send dem tsunamis that hit Indonesia (but but but) 
Ain't no motherfucking thing stopping me 
Like good coke I'm a good swimmer 
God knows I done lost but god dam I'm a good winner
It feels great to make something out of nothing 
Yea I'm humble but I tell y'all to push a chicos buttons 
And watch how them thing get to dumping 
Real estate New York game now you saying something 
I only talk about what I know about 
Illegal turn legal this year that's what I'm all about
I'm from the south and I ain't gonna lie 
At fist time I preach ye till god struck me with pride 
I was confused now I'm like let's ride 
Three o five till I die 
Three o five till I die

And those red and blue lights just keep our streets hot 

C'mon and ride with a nigga 
so I can show you what Dade County really got 
See don't be fooled by South Beach 
Thinking when you come to the Bottom 
You can just run these streets 
You and your jewels are like a menu 
And trust me nigga we intend to eat 

Fuck around and cross that I-Three Ninety Five 
You just run into a bunch of dead end streets 
Niggas with wife-beaters and bare feet 
That's right, I'm talking straight goon style 
Go beyond that about three miles 
and you're now entering the infamous Lil Havana 
Now I know yall studio gangsters be vibing off the movie Scarface 
But the wrong move in this place, 
you'll fuck around and meet the real Tony Montana 

So fuck them palm trees 
I got shit for you to really see 
Like there's a graveyard with bury sub
With niggas buried four generations deep 
And I aint even talking about sister lined next to brother 
I'm talking granddaddy to grandmother piled up on top of each other 
And all that rap about your Lil Haiti connections? 
Nigga you don't even know a real zoo 
But I can introduce you to one that'll kick in your door 
Put you faced down on the floor 
And have your whole family wiring money from Chicago 

But you a star, though 
Okay, nigga if you a real G 
This is where you tell your car to go 

Opa Locka 
Where there is continuous spotlight 
helicopters and a triangle full of choppers 
Carol City will make holes in you so big, 
They can't be plugged by doctors 

Nigga, this is the real Dade County 
Where we are soldiers from birth to the hearse 
That's why my childhood consisted of a bulletproof vest and a Pyrex 
Nigga, you haven't even seen the real Miami, yet 
So Welcome to Miami Dade County, the real Miami 
Where we live and die, for life",Intro,2006

Mamacita so nice to meet ya,
You drunk off that rum,
You shouldn't drive tonight,
Give me the key to that Beamer,
She looked at me and laughed,
Started shakin her ass,
She said her brother just came home

I'm in over my head, these women gone drown me.
Spike lee was definitely talkin bout me when he made that movie 'jungle fever'.
'cause I like em a little bit darker
Take it from the back to the front, rosa parkuh
But to tell you the truth, it makes no difference
As long as they know what they doin when it's time to get busy
We can take it from the floor to the bed from the bed to the kitchen
Coffee with no cream,
That's like a rock with no fiend
Martin Luther king with no dream,
John Lennon couldn't even imaging such a thing

That's cool 'cause I'll put the Spanish in ya,
And by the end of the night you'll say ay papa.
I'm that chico that got a fetish with women
Light skin red bones they blow my mind
I'm that chico that'll get em and hit em
Now all of a sudden they wanna be mine
Stop playin with me

Now what I'ma do is uh, explain this uh, jungle fever to yall,
This doesn't necessarily mean I like uh, dark women,
Doesn't necessarily mean I don't like dark women,
What it means is, uh
To get nasty
To get freaky
To do things you've never done before
To act like an animal straight out the jungle, that's jungle fever.

Pitbull,"A 1980 exodus of 125,000 dreams, a quest to find out what freedom really means at any cost. Boat loads of Cubans lost in a maze of red tape and hate, entered this country through the bottom of the united states and straight set up shop. As Arthur McDuffie was being beat to death by four white cops this world was about to face the music. Between the El Mariel and the 1980 riots, we as minorities Americans could no longer take our freedom for granted and misuse it because incase you haven?t notices we?ve gone from the El Mariel boatlift to the Hurricane Katrina bus lift with the same response. With America standing to help us with one hand on her hips and the other one on her guns. Like 9/11 some how made us all Americans but it took a tragedy to make us all feel like we were one. You see the El Mariel boatlift, Hurricane Katrina and the Oklahoma bombings, we all got something in common and that?s the desire to enjoy a freedom that can not be rearranged by fear. To let nothing stand in the way of the freedom of those who chose to live here so today is 1980 again and I?m that bus that crashed through the gates of the Peruvian embassy. I hope that when I spit this poem the whole world will remember me. I?m screaming like [something] give us us our free, me Pitbull and this industry.

This dedicated to everybody who lost somebody important in their life, 
Don't worry their in a better place now.

I fear not what the future holds
But more what the future unfolds
Cause I'm dying each time that I breathe in life without you (yeah)
Every hour solemn I need you
Undevoured I'm falling now what can I do
There's so much to give
If only I had my hands to fix what you did
So I hold it inside watch as it dies
I can't even look at the sky its burning my eyes
Similar to cigarette smoke I wish I could float far away from here

I hope one day that this pain stops (no no)

I hope one day that this pain stops

Washing me away

I miss you dad

Still dealing with my the death of my father
Still dealing with the death of my best friend
Eddie I'm a miss you dog
But you know that I'm a ride to the end (I love you)
I didn't cry when you died
But I'm a let my tears fall on the track
My brother yula just came home
And it feels good to have him back
(Welcome home dog)
See everything happens for a reason
You don't know what you had till its gone
That's why I'm a take advantage of the fact I'm breathin
And the words of this song are
Dedicated to Eddie and maria
But I know in the future I'm a see ya
I know your both looking down on me , proud
I know ya both love me

If it don't kill you its only goin' make you strong
So you must hold on
If everything was right then there's something wrong
Ironic ain't it that's just the way life is
That's why I thank god every chance that I get for blessing me
With beautiful kids

What's victory with no laws
What's smiling with no tears
Whats love with no hate
Whats courage with no fears
Just think about it and apply to your life
And no matter what the problem is
Don't worry baby keep your head up
Its goin' be alright

Pitbull,"[Chorus: x2]
Damn, it can't get no worse than this cause I done hit rock bottom
I'mma get up on a muthafuckin' sack and a big ass bottle to solve all my problems
I'm goin' in circles man, goin' in circles man
Sometimes I feel like, feel like I'm goin' in circles man

Damn, if you a man put some muthafuckin' food on the table
That's what she said but still a nigga wasn't able
To get up some bread for the rent, lights, and cable
The gas and water
She actin like I'm tryna starve her
And I know the baby growin' and her belly gotta eat too
Only thing I got left is this gun on my belt, If I can't feed myself how I'mma feed you?
How I'mma ride with this tank on empty, sellin yola hoping that the jakes dont get me
Cause when I leave the crib man that thang go wit' me
My nigga from the jets got stained for a 50
Sack of the hard
Tryna match you a broad
Got 'em shot up in his car by a muthafuckin' dope fiend
A bitch tryna get a fix, put my nigga in a ditch, we been hittin them licks since we was 14
Now they say you in a calmer place
I couldn't tell by the looks on yo' momma face
Now everytime she look at me I see a look of disgrace
She disappointed by the dreams we was lookin' to chase
Cause we was cookin' the base and we was flippin' the spinach
And if a nigga violated then we handled our business
We never knew one day the street shit would catch up with us
And I don't roll with many niggas, you was one of the realest
I'm like

[Chorus: x2]

Damn, open my mailbox and all I get to see is bill after bill
Shit kinda slow ain't no real money be comin' in but yo, I still got ten on the kil'
Ten on the drank, a nigga be on ten when I'm sober to get me over keep me full of the poison
My nigga Rich doin' a bid they sent the boys in, to get him if I would've been wit' him I woulda joined him
And now I'm out here lurkin' the streets wit' no work feelin' like my throat been cut wit' no plug
You know just what I mean if you ever done sold drugs, finna rob me a nigga cause I ain't got no love
And I ain't got no qualification for no career move, people up in corporate america probably fear dude
Gettin' shine off of my rhyme for like a year or two, still got the police lights up in my rearview
Damn, as I sit behind a tint, in a car full of smoke
Hopin' this officer don't do nothin' to make me have to hurt him cause it's over if I get caught up with this dope
Give me a coal, might aswell hang me from a rope
Cause the government lynchin' niggas more than ever before
Sort of like the slavery days but if we ? the change, then how the fuck is we supposed to grow?
They got a nigga like damn

Las mujeres no son las unicas que tienen sentimientos
Mamita te voy a hablar claro
Yo me siento mal, muy mal
Ken-why, explicales

Ayer me dijistes que me amabas
Que no habria quien nos separara
Que yo era tuyo why tu eras mia
Para nuestro amor no habian medidas
Pero de repente todo cambio
Ya no eras la misma cuando haciamos el amor
Hoy me pides que me vaya sin ninguna razon
Tu no sabes cuanto daño la hare a mi corazón, perderte

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no
(Que no me vaya no)
(Que no me vaya no) (no)
Que no ves que ya no puedo
Que sin ti me desespero
[Muñecatu eres la razon que yo hago]
[Todo esto es la razon qYo trabajo tan duro]
No me pidas que me vaya, no
[Yo te quiero dar una vida, diferente]

Yo te quiero con todo mi corazon
Pero no entiendo la razon
Porque siento como tu why yo no somos lo mismo, a lo mejor
Estamos acostumbrao'
Why no estamos enamorao'
O maybe es algo que da duro
Why viene why se va como un morao
Pero mami let's work it out
Es un daño profundo
Pensar en los años
Que tu why yo viviamos juntos
Why que, todos esos años se fueron por gusto? (No, no..)
No me digas eso mami
Eso yo no lo puedo aceptar
Un amor como el nuestro es real
Un amor tan profundo
Yo te apuesto el mundo
Que tu te sientes igual
Un amor que no se puede olvidar
Un amor que no se puede ocultar
Un amor tan rico why tan fuerte
Que no se puede dudar

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no

Si lo unico que hice fue amarte
Creo que merezco una, explicacion
Creeme, he tratado de olvidarte
Why lo unico que he logrado es recordarte
Dime, como aguantar tanto dolor
(No, no, no)

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no
(Que no me vaya no)
(Que no me vaya no) (no)
Que no ves que ya no puedo

[Pero, pero mamita tu no entiendes?]
No me pidas que me vaya, no
[Tu eres la mujer que yo quiero,
Yo te kiero dar el mundo, yo te adoro
Hazme el favor why escuchame mamita]

Dime mami que es lo que tu sientes
Dime mami que es lo que tu quieres
Mira mi hija, tu sabes que la vida mia
Esta en la boca de toda la gente
Chisme por aqui, chisme por alla
Yo lo vi por aqui, yo lo vi por alla
Yo lo vi con esta, yo lo vi con esa
Entonces yo te llamo why tu no contestas
Yo te amo, yo te quiero
Yo te adoro, mi cielo
Yo quiero, vivir, mi vida, contigo
Yo te quiero complacer
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime
Yo te quiero complacer
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime!

Dime que debo hacer si la verdad es que no puedo
Alejarme de ti, olvidarme de ti, mamita yo no quiero
No me pidas más que no, no te voy a complacer
Si todo estaba muy bien
Dime amor, en que falle!!?
En que falle?
En que falle?
En que falle?

Que ando con la trulla y con la espalda frio
Que no te pille en un carrito de piraguas
Abanza como, titichaguas por el área de caguas
Va haber lluvia de balas, cómprate un paraguas
Bobo, yo soy el capo, tu solo gritas ""agua! ""

Usted es una rata, siga cantando pa' las gatas
Que en esto de la calle, papi, puedes ser mi chata
Trata, pa meterme por la culata
Coge por la orilla o te vo'a sacar la guata (ajaja)
Quieres sentir la ronca, siga tirando balas locas
Soca', 'tas guerreando con el motha*fucka'
Te tengo en coca, salte del carril que va la truck'a
Mamabicho, yo a usted no le quepo por la boca

Te voy a dar con mis becerros
Yo los mato como el cerro
Mama*hierro, hagan planes pa' su entierro
Mucho guille pa' después llamar los perros
Yo no le temo a la muerte, a la vida nunca me aferro
Yo soy de calle cria'o, mucha vidas eh privau
Ando con una estrella en el pecho y la morena al la'o
Usted es un bobo cria'o, no sea tan caripela'o
Si no quiere que le vuele el pecho camine con cuida'o

Déjense ver que quiero saber quien va tumbarme el vuelo
Cada vez que salgo a to' estos viejos se les paran los pelos
Hipócritas, no me saluden, y rompan el hielo
Háblame claro y pal suelo, llego antes ok
El de la morena y me guille el que los trilla
En bolsa negra y camilla me fui a las millas
Como los cepilla, les da fuego y los levanta del piso
Y siempre fiel los pilla

(¡Ustedes son hijos míos!)
Raperos, calmen su brutality
Ustedes to's me pagan royalties
Tanto leido no me hablen de loyalty
Yo se que to's envidian mi flow y mi versatility
Y no pueden con mi productivity
Ustedes conmigo no tienen ni una opportunity
Pues, compárense con mis capacity
Sigan mascando lo que luny hace, el beat
Y don te batea un hit

Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil
Solo hay un intento, enemy
Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil
Solo hay un intento, enemy

Ustedes suenan bien pero a veces azaroso
Ninguno queda cabrón, como siempre, maravilloso
Llegó la habilidad de cantar y rapear
Versatilidad y estilo difícil de copiar
La maravilla, el bajo mundo me aclama
Y entiendo que 'toy prepara'o para el dinero y la fama
Me critican porque el mejor de los novatos me creo
No es que me creo, es que ninguno igual a mi palabreo
Yo me destaco por ser entre ellos el primero

Mamita, why we gotta keep going through this?
Talk to her, Frankie

Just yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That I was yours and you were mine
That there was no limits to our skies
But then you had to put our love on hold
When it came to making love, it wasn't you anymore
And now you're telling me to leave
I gotta walk out the door
Can't you see that this is killing me?
It's hurting my soul
Oh baby

Can't you see I'm slowly dying?
But I'm gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go

By telling you I love you with all my heart
But I can't understand the reason
When you tell me you're leaving

Now instead of being in love
It's like we are used to each other
How could we do this to each other?
We use to ride for each other
Die for each other
Cry for each other
Now, it's like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other

Look, baby, just tell me what you need

I know it's hard to deal with my life
I know it's hard to deal with all the gossip
I done seen 'em wit' this one
I done seen 'em wit' that one
But everything they say is monotonous
Can't you hear it in my voice?
Mami, you know you're my heart, my soul, my love
And I swear to you, baby
I just want to give you my heart, my soul, my love
I know we can work this out
I know we can
Baby, let's try
But one thing I won't do is let this love die
(Is let this love die...)

You don't know what you have until you lose it.

I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life.
I've had my ups, my downs,I paid my dues.
Learn my stride?
Love for the passion......?

All I know is the hustle and grind.
All you want is some quality time.
I can't give it to you due to the life that I choose.
My heart is so close to the point my blood had froze.
I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time.
But then again time is money and I need mine.
There I go again being selfish, 
And there you go again the love and helpless.
You mean the world to me baby you know its the truth.
But I don't know who I love more you or the booth.
These are just the things I need to get off my chest.
Sometimes I feel like all I can give you is sex.

Seen them fall, go broke and lose it all.

Sit down, open your ears, close your eyes, listen

Here's a little story that I got to tell
About this Chico named Pit everyone knows so well
Illmatic like Nas but that ain't hard to tell
Owes it all to Dade County and the ATL
Picked rap and skipped the triple beam scale
And it's a known fact he gon' die before he fails
These boys rap about hustlin' but can't make bail
I call that hustling backwards and that's real
Miami's hot so I can vacation in hell
The way the game is shit, man, I mind as well
I look at these fools on camera flashin' they tools
They must've forgot the streets got codes and rules
But me, I'm confused
'Cause rappers wanna be gangstas
Gangstas wanna be rappers
Ballers wanna be rappers
And rappers wanna be ballers
The truth is it's more sickening than Ebola
Until they handcuff then it's over

I'm one of the best, one of the rawest
Nah I ain't perfect but bitch I'm flawless
Nah I ain't stupid but the flow is retarded
Barely made high school, the streets was my college
Rappin here for years, workin and grindin
On the streets if you copped it, I supplied it
I've worked everything, every drug you name it
I've seen families get tied up for missin payments
Keep thinking that this thing is just entertainment

Pitbull,"Drop that beat, it's the truth
You don't know what you have until you lose it

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
In my life, in my life

I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
But nothing compares to the love
I have for you, have for you

All I know is the hustle and grind
And all you want is some quality time
But I can't give it to you due to the life that I chose
My heart?s so cold to the point my blood it froze

I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time
But then again time is money and I needs mine
There I go again being selfish
And here you go again in love and helpless

You mean the world to me, baby you know it's the truth
But I don't know who I love more, you or the booth
These are just some things I need to get off my chest
Sometimes I feel all I can give you is sex, I'm sorry

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
In my life, in my life

I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
But nothing compares to the love
I have for you, have for you

I ain't gon' lie baby, this life is addicting
The fame, the money, especially these bitches
I've been around it all, I've seen 'em ball
I've seen 'em fall, go broke and lose it all

That's why I work hard 365, 24/7 baby, this my life
I breathe, I bleed, I eat, I sleep, I shit this
I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list

Baby, I know it's hard to understand
But it's out of my hands, baby this is God's plan
I came, I saw, I conquered
I apologize but this game made me a monster, I'm sorry

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
In my life, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
In my life, in my life

I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
But nothing compares to the love
I have for you, have for you

In my life, I done some wrong
I done some right

You don't know the half of it
I found you out last Friday
Thought I was out to get you
At the club I met Peaches
She said she knew your secret
I asked if you were hookin' or creepin'
I had a quick lap dance
Damn near skeed in my pants (Whoa)
Look how bitches got me sweatin' in my white-T
Lovin' how she do me
Then I saw you in stilettos and a thong
Shaking that booty to the ""Do the Brown"" song (Do the Brown)
Shorty gots to go ooh oh...

Ain't never gonna trust you no

Let go, make it drop
Make it clap, don't stop
One check at a time don't stop
I've been waiting all night to see you take it off
I got some paper baby you can take it all
What you wanna do?
We can go to the back boom, boom fo' sho

Just yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That I was yours and you were mine
But the words don't image you to fine
But then you had put our love on hold
When it came to making love it wasn't you anymore
Now your telling me to leave I got walk out the door
Cant you see that this is killing me its hurting my soul (oh baby)

How am I supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to Let you Go
(No I just cant let you go)
Cant you see I'm slowly dyin
But Im gunna keep on tryin
Please dont ask of me to let you go

But I cant understand the reason

Now instead of being in love like we used to eachother
How could we do this to eachother
We used to ride for eachother
Die for eachother
Cry for eachother
Now its like all of us wanna say bye to eachother
I cant let this happen
I refuse to lose you
I love you baby
It's the truth as usual
I wanna make you happy
Girl its hard to see
That your the world to me
We've been through it all
Thick and Thin

They could take it its worthless

But everything you said was a manotness
Cant you hear my voice

And I swear to you baby

Hoe getter, gorilla, fuck chuffers I went and got mo' killas, boss
I rock with niggas like Fabolous
'Cause he tell the truth baby like fabulous
But you make it look glamorous
Here's spaghetti strapped heels not for amateurs

Risk quite rocky, talk like foxy, job like Roxy, spark that broccoli
Walk quite aky, let me sexy, I will save you if you let me
Fly with me, get high as me I love the alphabet, girl I'm a G
Time will tell, Rolex watches, we show stoppas, hoes just watchin'

I got a bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right he ain't acting right

Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, whoa, back it up, now let me see your hips swing
Now drop it low and let me see your hips swing
Down to the floor now let me see your hips swing
Down to the floor now let me see your hips swing

Uh oh, lean back, girl you got some mean racks
You got a mean ass and I really mean that
But can't you see, that I need a girl, that can move
Make her hips swing, and, look, just like you
But come to think about it, I think this club is crowded
It's kinda hard to do your thing when everyone's surrounding
So let me form a circle everybody step back
I heard somebody yell ""savage where the chorus at?!""

[Chorus]

Uh oh, let it pop, ladies drop it like it's hot
Hell yeah, that's the spot, now bring it back to the top
Stop! woah, now back it up, now back it up
Let it rise then watch it dump, shaking your junk in the trunk
And, I, like, the way you move it smoothly
Now why, don't, you move that booty, to, me
I'm tryna come up with some thoughts of attack,
Until I heard somebody yellin' out ""savage where the chorus at?!""

[Chorus]

[Repeat x2]
Knees bent, ass out, come on push your ass out
(Let me see your hips swing)
Bring it up then back down, bring it up then back down
(Let me see your hips swing)
All my ladies on the floor, all my ladies on the floor
(Let me see your hips swing)
Pick it up then dip it low, pick it up then dip it low

Ya whole career is worth one of them diamonds in my ear
And if you don't eat pussy
Get the f**k out of here

And all my girls in the club working fa a dub
Work that pole and let them hoes know whats sup ummmm

Keep disrespecting, in the the everglades they'll find ya,
I'm not from San Fransisco, but the chopper of forty ninya.
I grew up listening to Lou, and, and, and pumping Trick
Them boys done open doors, so respect is owed.
I got love for Rick, and congrats you made it,
I was a fan from the mix tape you sold me at Foxy Ladies.
I seen them trying to bring you down, but f**k that dog you one of the greatest!
Khaled mix 96er, but even back then though you had haters.
I remember the Temple at Oynx, I was too drunk to get in,
I was still outsider selling Chronic you know gettin it in.
I remember Ump beating the rape mistrial, celebrating the win.
Yall can try to stop Miami but this shit will never end.

One time TS, two times Fat Joe.
I remember them boys in Wynnwood hood stack short.
I remember them Cash Money Boys in Little Haiti, all running with zozs.
Banana Azuri, soft drop top that's for sure.
Flo Rida, Groundhogs always show love before.
Dammit been paying dues, now its my time to blow.
Even when 50 come through, he don't roll no less than 50 zozs!
Cause they will push your shit back, way back to trues and vows.
My dog Nose shaker, come through the block on something clean.
Sounding like an earthquake, he is what these dope boys dream.
Hit a lick, flip a brick, snatch a Brinks truck.
That's them Miami boys don't get it mixed up.

[Chorus]

I'm Mr. 305, I'm a part of Miami's Heat.
I grew up in all types of neighborhoods, I am Miami's street.
Low key and stay quiet, that's how these chicos in Miami eat.
I love it when these boys come from out of town and thinking Miamis sweet.
All of them down looking for pussy , trying to Miami skeet.
That's when they run up in they hotel room and give them a Miami treat.
When the choppers start a raining, its hard to stop a Miami leak.
That's what they get for thinking Miamis just Miami Beach.

[Chorus]

Ha, You know how this ain't a neighborhood right?
Don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't cash
If the moneys on the wood, its all good.
But if the moneys out of sight it going to be a fight.
And the last thing you want is a fight with the 305,",Defend Dade,2008

And put on my shades
And threw on my headphones

That made me move my feet
Boy that thang' was sticky

And then I heard this (melody)
The dopest one I've ever seen
Something out the usual

Fighting in the club
For just sayin' somethin'
Now my passports full
I'm outta pages
New places, new faces
New fans, all ages
Black, pink, purple, orange,
Caucasians
Latinos European and
Asian, Anabaenas'
Knew all my lyrics, it was Amazing!
They spoke Spanish...
I guess its true what they say
Music is the universal language
It's a true blessing you know
To travel the globe

Now I'm taken over
Fuck who with it.

Try ta stay not guilty bitch
They said they used ta handle bricks
I believe them when they projects are brick
All they rap about is crack n coke
Knowing they ain't never dealt crack or coke
Yea its a joke

That have been stripped of their innocence

A women made me a man,
Its just to bad that a man,
Took her innocence.
And god knows that I,
I would finish him,
Diminish him,
End up killing him.
Blame it on the ignorance,
That's where her childhood went,
New country,
New language,
That's how seven years were spent.
Time you can't buy it,
And some lose 'em here
I know that we bumped heads,
Just know mum that I'm here.

Then you was off to Georgia,
It was tough how we,
How we were brought up,
Tougher for you,
Cause you had no father,
Now I understand,
Now that I'm a man,
How much a woman needs,
Someone to call dad,
You cut through the pain,
You walked through the rain,
The game ain't playin' you,
Baby you play the game.
Now your in search of,
That father figure,
And if you find him,
He denies you,

And beat all the odds

It's called Dope Ball.
Similar rules and regulations, but at the same time very different.

(Ha ha ha)

Goes a lil' something like this.

It's not pick 'n roll, it's more like pick a roll.
What you gon' push? We waste a blow.
If it's all three, then that's the three from the top of the key, before you cup a brick, scrape some grams of the top of the key.
Same for the blow, we call those free throws, they call 'm cheerleaders, we call 'm cheap ho's.
Find some low ones, have them beg a few O's.
Next thing you know you're putting numbers on the... boat.
The whole point is to stay on the courts, but, in this game the whole point is to stay outta courts.
Yeah they similar, but not the same sports.
Both international, import, export.
Extort, and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought. Extort, and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought.

Anybody wanna test? Hi, who? Me

It's not my fault that your bitch chose me, now her and her girlfriend wanna do me
This is for those boys in those Chevys sittin' on them King James, them 2-3s
And if you got a problem with me, holla at my lawyer, bitch, sue me
I'm tired of the fuck-boy rap, fuck-boy this, fuck-boy that
Watch a couple movies and they put it in they rhyme, those wanna be fiddlers
I'm straight, you get shot 9 times
10 years in the game, since 99, I was speakin' my mind (Yes sir)
And then shit changed, if you got a problem, bitch cross that kinda line

Nah brah not me, and if you spit it better live it, better in fact, better show me
I'ma make em say UHHH, not even Master P could crack like this
And you ain't never seen a chico in the gang this raw since pawn that could rap like this (TS)

Blam! Motherfucker take that, now!

I'ma spit it, flip it, rip it for them boys
Makin digits off the coke when they whip it
Ride a stick, double clip it
One mississippi, two mississippi, three mississipi, cock back, click it, blam!

MR 305 no label stay hot,
38 choppers, but please no glock,
Used to move work but had no
Trap no block no spot,
Ma was cool with work, but no rocks,
Until she found my first nickel ruff bag,
Said I had enough shit to push a dad,
So she told me to get the fuck out the pad,
I was out to my first baby mama's crib,
Caught her fuckin' round with her wellas crib,

I wanna be owner, fuck a playa,

Lemme come back, I've been here for years,
Grindin', blood, sweat and tears.
I don' gave the game my life,
Turned the streets from my bitch to my wife,
Every mornin' I woke up to the same shit,
Everybody sayin' that I ain't shit,
Them boys in the streets on that hate shit,
Them boys on the same street doin' that same shit,
Planned to move bricks, but it's 8 balls,

Cut cut gay, buck buck spray,
This ain't a duck duck goose,
This duck duck hey, plus hey duct tape ace that.

Close the doors, I can't come in,

I know you want me so bad cause you just can't seem to hide it
The lights are moving to the rhythm of the music,
When we're together,
Everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the movement,
We can lose it, I hope you're ready

As long as I see the strobe lights,
I'm dancing all night long
When we're together, baby,
I'm feeling all right,
You got me all night long
So tell the DJ play it all night long,
All night long, all night, night, night
So tell the DJ play it all night long,
All night long, all night, night night

So tell the DJ play it
Tonight the admission is free,
Now we're shutting the club down
We moving now to the streets,
All we got left is love now

Feel my troubles fading to the rhythm of your heart beat,
When we're together,
Everything just comes together baby
Every motion calls your name,
Baby once you start me
And I hope you're ready

So tell the DJ play it,
All my worries help me put the past behind
All around us this worlds in a hurry
While we stand still in time
Feels like we're moving to the rhythm of the music,
When we're together
Everything just comes together, baby
So inspired by the movement
We can't lose it
And I hope you're ready

So listen a couple girls
Who was in and now I mess with cover girls
Of magazines, you can catch me on a cover, girl
I created my own planet to hover the earth and cover the world
I spit so sick, I'm calling the world
I see you tryna claim her now I play with her pearls
They try to come at me but all of 'em sterile
Life's a bitch, but I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please
No she's not religious but she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50
What a working girl!

I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me

I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I like when I see you break it down like you in control

I've got a cup to my right and a cup to my left
I'm stumbling and I'm out of breath
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone
I got a girl to my right and a girl to my left
The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breasts

Pitbull,"So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach from my hand

I sacrificed my life to give you my life to speakers
I tried to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus
God knows I got a good heart but my blood's been with demons
I'm fighting myself, believe me, I'm far from ignorant
Far from greedy if you knew what I come from
Knew what I've been through, you think there shoulda
Been another outcome just like most kids
A father, I did it without one
Come from the city where they X you like Malcom
Then you wonder how come I can move in the room
Full of woos, so sweet, so smooth
Thank you mom for making me a man
Let 'em mother fucker knock down my castle in the sand

So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach from my hand

Reach for my hand

I live my whole life with the world on my shoulders
So I couldn't care less what this music game throws us
I see them looking in front of ? , but they won't find it
I come from struggle, I am a fighter, must you be reminded
My mother's past has a trap, has a blinded
But I took her past, I took her pain
I made it strength, I fought the game,
Do or die, Pitbull's the name
Now all I see is the future, mom, I love you, I salute you
Then no matter what happens jusst you're the reason I am rappin'


Look I'm from the home where the spit is the wind is the big apple
Came down to south beach to build a new castle
Every day I'm hustling and every day you hassle
Doing what you can and I'm doing what I have to
Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner
I'm coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla
I did it for my town to show 'em the big picture
Kid hit the switch, I promise to never switch up
This is for my brother took three and went to jail
I'm sending all my pictures through the mail
He hit me with a letter, I know you'll never fail
So put me on the beach with a bucket and a pail

So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach from my hand

Reach for my hand",Castle Made of Sand,2011

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

Loquita, I don't play, you know what time it is with me
You want my heart, you got to work
And show me that you'd ride it there for me
I can see right through your eyes, and I know what you tryin' to do
You tryin' to rob, steal, take my love, well fuck you

Take my love, ha ha, not a woman on earth that can do that
Say what, I don't know where you from, or where you been at
I'm letting you know what's up, and if you don't play by the rules
Oh baby, you get cut, I talked so much, you took my love

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

Yaoh, I'm in the club, and the place is poppin'
Sip-sippin' bub and the bass is knockin'
Times are great, 'cause I'm with my crew
But my smile is fake, 'cause I'm missing you
Baby you know that I didn't learn my lesson
Shoulda gave you more time, more love and affection
And when I see you later with that other guy
Keep telling myself a player ain't suppose to cry

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

She took my love, and played me for a sucker
But it don't even matter, 'cause you know I still love her
She took my heart, and threw it on the ground
But it don't even matter, 'cause I still want her around

She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker
It's guaranteed that she's a professional heart breaker
But a great love maker, all in a sheet
She made my heart skip a beat
But for now she's as cold as they come
Not mags, no life and no guns
She took my love

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

So I took my letters and made 'em numbers right
Will you evaluate, Jennifer baby let's celebrate

I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate
This drink is for you
This drink is for you

This is for my singles ladies and single mothers
Raising babies working hard
I know the feeling, I used to live it
My mother worked two to three jobs
That's what this song is dedicated
To all the women out there motivated
Always finding ways to make ends meet
All my women out there innovative
You name the game, and they've played it
They've heard all the stories, so save it
All my women with power meet me at happy hour
Let's celebrate

I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate

Making sure you look right

Games are waste of time, now we can do the nasty
And do what the do and see what it does
Either we gon' love what we do to each other
And just let it be what it was
No harm, no foul, no commitment, no vows
But by that time I'm already tired of the way you like it, oh
And let your body decide, exactly what it does
But it's no secret baby, everybody fucks

We both know it's wrong but fuck it cause it feels right

Then they fall in love and make everything seem what is not
Damn, these are called rules of engagement
Welcome to the world of entertainment
They don't want a man like Reeman
They want a man that's stuck in the remains
I know it's ironic, but the good girls like bad guys

Call it what you want, boy as it may
Not from the bay but hella paid
Every day above ground is a good day so I celebrate
Mami got that bubble-yum booty
I wanna run through it like Rudy
She said ""do you own Nike?""
I said ""not yet"", she said ""then just do it""
Fresh at the Grammy's in a tuxedo
Play about 18 holes on any given day
Tiger Woods steelo, yea I get around but only on the D low

Bogota, Medellin, Colombia
Man what a trip
If you been there
Then you know what I'm talkin' bout
I'm runnin' through the world, y'all walk it out
It's a marathon, not a sprint
Long term, that's how I think
My life could've turned out ugly

Y tu no puedes más (y tu no puedes más)

Se que tu me quieres

Entonces en el baño, entonces en la cama, entonces en la mesa
Entonces en el piso y tu gritas, ay que rico dale Pitbull!

No es el 24 de diciembre
Pero si es una noche buena
Deja la pena, que tu estas buena

Eres una droga, muy inteligente pero te haces la boba
No matas los hombres, pero si les das soga, ay que loba

Vamos a jugar el juego

Descarado y fresco, si es la verdad pero te encanta esto, ha

Ella es dulcera y yo le tengo el pastel
Yo soy diablito,, yo no soy el ángel
Pónmelo ahí, que te lo voy a romper
Dale que llego Pitbull y Yandel
Suave papito, que ella te domina
Este es el consejo más grande tu vida
Ten cuidado con las asesinas

Me encanta su cuerpo
La forma en que lo hace
Para ella no hay liga
Es una asesina
Yo ya que ando suelto
Velando que ella hace
A ver si se anima
A terminar como debe ser

Yeeah-oh (yeeah-oh)
Nos encontramos una noche de pasión (noche de pasión)
Lo que no debió pasar, me sucedió (me sucedió)
Me hipnotizo y en sus brazos, me hizo ilusión
Yo que tuve el presentimiento

Me deje llevar por su actitud y empece a pensar
Aquí vamos a terminar, no podré luchar
Con su magnitud y aunque pensé mal
Tuve que aceptar

Me encanta su cuerpo
La forma en que lo hace
Para ella no hay liga (Yandel La Leyenda)
Es una asesina (Ear Candy)
Yo ya que ando suelto (Tainy)
Velando que ella hace
A ver si se anima, a ver si se anima

Me encanta su cuerpo
La forma en que lo hace
Para ella no hay liga
Es una asesina
Yo ya que ando suelto
Velando que ella hace
A ver si se anima
A terminar como debe ser

Yeeah-oh (yeeah-oh)
Nos encontramos una noche de pasión (noche de pasión)
Lo que no debió pasar, me sucedió (me sucedió)
Me hipnotizo y en sus brazos, me hizo ilusión
Yo que tuve el presentimiento

Solo quiero hacerte cosas diferentes

Pitbull,"Tyrese let's go 
She's playin' with my heart 
She's playin' all this games 
Stayin' in my mind 
Drivin' me insane

I just wanna fly far away from here 
Take me to a place way above the atmosphere 
I just wanna fly far away from here 
Take me to a place way above the atmosphere 
Take me away 
Come and take me away 
Come and take me away 
Come and take me away 
Come and take me away 
Take me away 
Come and take me away 
Come and take me away

She says she loves me 
She says she loves me not 
She's playin' with my mind 
She's playin' with my heart 
It's a contract 
And the devil breached
Life can taste sour 
But god it's sweet 
We can work it out 
And put the future past us 
I mean the past the past 
And make the future last 
Old school mentality 
But make that future cash 
Now take it back to the future 
And shake your future ass

What did I do 
What did I say 
To make you hate me so much 
Where should I go 
Nobody knows 
Maybe I lost my touch 
When I look in your eyes and I see you cry 
I'm thinking how can I make this difference 
When you stood by my side 
Through the lows and highs 
Maybe my mind just twisted

I just wanna fly far away from here 
take me to a place way above the atmosphere 
I just wanna fly far away from here 
take me to a place way above the atmosphere 
Take me away

I just wanna go a little bit to the left of here 
Connect and lift to the atmosphere 
Touch the stars sleep in the sky 
Wake up with the sun, hands up high 
Top of the morning middle of the night 
I know the majors don't fight, that's right 
But not on earth, thing's so hectic 
It's love but you don't respect it 
I gotta go 
Weather it's culture first 
If I don't leave first 
You might leave in a hurry 
So take that clutch 
Pack your purse 
When you come back here I'll be gone 
I gotta move on 
This to much for my psyche 
What makes you wanna fight me 
I gotta get in my Nike, go with no fear 
Any place except here

When I walk in the door 
You walk away 
'Cause you don't wanna see my face 
Sorry I lied 
Sorry you cried 
Feel like this love just died 
Everything that I do it makes you cry 
To late to apologize 
I'm sorry the way whey ended this page 
Now let's put it all behind

I just wanna fly far away from here 
take me to a place way above the atmosphere 
I just wanna fly far away from here 
take me to a place way above the atmosphere

Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot

She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her I wanna ride out, and she said yes

Go ahead baby let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drop

Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck
I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up

Cuando te acuestes con alguien ya tú verás que no es igual 
Lo vas a lamentar

Mamita que Dios te bendiga y que sigas pá lante 
Que busques tu vida que busque un amante 
Te deseo lo mejor, que todo sea perfecto 
Tú no puedes con mi vida bueno mami perfecto 
Que tú quieres que te diga que yo soy perfecto 
¡Ay mamita! eso no existe 
Eso es un cuento, eso es un chiste 
Te lo digo en español, inglés, hasta en chino 
Yo no cambio por nadie yo soy quien yo soy 
No te gusta entonces me voy
The grass always looks greener on the other side 
Till you get to the other side

Ay mi Dios
Quizás perdí en la batalla porque él que merece lo pide 
Que me amara y quisiera de la forma en que yo lo hice 
Es que amar con habilidad nunca ha sido posible

Yo no me niego al amor, no me niego a nada que me dé pasión
Yo no me niego a sus besos que son traicioneros y matan de dolor 
Si soy sentimental
Cuando te acuestes con alguien ya tú verás que no es igual 
Lo vas a lamentar

Hiciste lo que hiciste cuando quisiste con quien quisiste 
Y quieres volver, pero ya no es posible 
Rompiste mi corazón sin compasión 
Jugaste con mis sentimientos y mi amor 
Date una vuelta que llegó mi momento 
No quiero verte ya sé que estás sufriendo 
Mami boom bye bye que está es la despedida 
Ya que Dios se lo dio

Ay mi Dios

Want what we can't have
Why does loneliness hurt so bad
And girl I want you back
Well then I guess we always
Want what we can't have

Can't have
Can't have
Can't have
Ohh!

I see Central Park, from my hotel room
And it's got me thinking
'Bout the crazy things we use to do
For the fame, for the power, for the fortune
Ducked prison, ducked death, I'm fortunate
It was all a dream, now I wake up and live it
Thinking that the sky was the limit
'Til I figured out there was footprints on the moon
Now I'm like get out the way, bitch move

Papo I'm live, fuck the other side
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
Everyone wants what they can't have right?

Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so right
Well then I guess we always
Want what we can't have
Why does loneliness hurt so bad
And girl I want you back
Well then I guess we always
Want what we can't have

Can't have, can't have
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, ohh!

Looking at my backyard, now all I see the ocean
Not bad for a kid that grew up with roaches
Drama, chaos, and different coaches
That's what allows me to see through these vultures
First we shining shoes
Then we own the shoe shop
First we make the sandwich
Then we own the restaurants
First then we clean the house
Then we own every house on the block
Not bad for some immigrants

Papo I'm live, fuck the other side

Doing the garden, digging the weeds, 
Who could ask for more.

Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now

Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye

Did you think I'd lay down and die?

And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh-so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high and you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person and still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me

Se eu não me vigio um instante
Me transporto pra perto de você
Já vi que não posso ficar tão solta
Me vem logo aquele cheiro
Que passa de você pra mim
Num fluxo perfeito

Enquanto você conversa e me beija
Ao mesmo tempo eu vejo
As suas cores no seu olho, tão de perto
Me balanço devagar
Como quando você me embala
O ritmo rola fácil
Parece que foi ensaiado

E eu acho que eu gosto mesmo de você
Bem do jeito que você é
Eu vou equalizar você
Numa frequência que só a gente sabe
Eu te transformei nessa canção
Pra poder te gravar em mim

Adoro essa sua cara de sono
E o timbre da sua voz
Que fica me dizendo coisas tão malucas
E que quase me mata de rir
Quando tenta me convencer
Que eu só fiquei aqui porque nós dois somos iguais

Até parece que você já tinha
O meu manual de instruções
Porque você decifrava os meus sonhos
Porque você sabe o que eu gosto
E porque quando você me abraça
O mundo gira devagar

E o tempo é só meu
E ninguém registra a cena
De repente vira um filme
Todo em câmera lenta
E eu acho que eu gosto mesmo de você
Bem do jeito que você é

Eu vou equalizar você

You drop your fists in the fight, to show the man that you are
You fall in at the end of the line
The more you're bowing out the more you stand in the way,
Then try to take your place, but you just give it away
You fall in at the end of the line

You're gonna take a seat at the top of the table
Where beggars, sad and low will all be allowed

A faceless man stood out in a faceless crowd
And took the sky to the ground

At the end of today
I could feel the sound of writing on the wall

It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screaming in my mind

Long live rock 'n' roll

In a different time
When the words didn't rhyme
You could never quite be sure
Then on with the change
It was simple but strange
And you knew the feeling seemed to say it all

It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screaming in my mind

If you suddenly see
What was happened with me
You should spread the word around
And tell everyone here
That it's perfectly clear
They can sail above it all on what they've found
It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screaming in my mind",Everybody Hurts Sometimes,2011

But when I say ""I'll leave"" you don't believe me anymore

And it wasn't overnight
Strydes

Last time running never went too well
Heart saying carry on, head telling me forfeit
Glimpse of the high life, I wish I never saw this
Now I want it all, want it all, I'm selfish

Felt locked down like I caught a death sentence
Like Alan Sugar fired me from The Apprentice
See my little weight, I must've lost half
Even Nando's won't send me a new black card

And there's all opinions and assumptions
Back to the grind and there's more where it comes from
I love the life 'cause my life flash cameras on
Tell Cheryl Cole and Rihanna that I love them

From young I've been obsessed with the fame
Know you're in lane 'cause your dreams were the same
Every day I pray, really wishing for a change
Dreams to reality and now I'm in the game

Flash lights and the good life, keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something's gonna change
Bright lights in the skyline won't let me lose me way
'Cause I know somehow something's gonna change

Tell me how you feel
Do you love me or hate me, there's no pleasing everybody
Need to focus, then he lost track, I'm really sorry
Left the black clouds, bright lights got me feeling jolly
Never let you down, that's my word you ain't gotta worry

Work for this, don't know about you but I work for this
Couple labels said I wasn't worth the risk
Just another hoodrat hoodie with a black hat
He's just one of them looking for a purse to nick

Never really had a plan B
Stayed on point, I am sharper than a Stanley
Big star, flash car, looking trendy
I know it's time to?

From young I've been obsessed with the fame
Know you're in lane 'cause your dreams were the same
Every day I pray, really wishing for a change
Dreams to reality and now I'm in the game

Flash lights and the good life, keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something's gonna change
Bright lights in the skyline won't let me lose me way
'Cause I know somehow something's gonna change

Let me tell you when to take it down
This is the part where the song breaks down
Stay looking up, never facing down
Long as the bright lights are blazing down

Flash lights and the good life, keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something's gonna change
Bright lights in the skyline won't let me lose me way
'Cause I know somehow something's gonna change

And it smashed my body so that all my friends thought I was dead
My sister held me close and whispered to my bleeding head
""You are the son of a mother fucker""

I shook all night and held her hand
Chocolate people, well I'll be damned

To find out I'm Nimrod's son

Oh bury me
Far away please, bury me

In my motorcycle mirror I think about the life I've led
And how my soul's been aching all the holes where I have bled
My image spoke to me, yes to me and often said

Across the road, they were turning around and headed south with me

It got so crowded on the road, I started driving in the sand
My head was feeling scared but my heart was feeling free
The desert turned to mud, it seems that everybody heard

Everybody was remembering to forget they had the chills
Then I heard the voices on a broadcast from up on the bird
They were getting interviewed by some good man whose name was Bill

Tokyo, 7 p.m.
Yeh yeh yeh ooh!
As I watched tv vacantly 
I had a strange dream 
Woke up and saw the time
Tokyo, 7 p.m.
Just to see you
I've been dressed up since morning
I want to be loved all night
Tokyo, 7 p.m.
The restaurant
Where we were to meet
Had closed and disappeared
And I'm dying
From hunger
I want to see you soon
I want to see you soon
Tokyo at 7 p.m.
This glorious city
Is like a lie
I'm so lonely so I want to see you 
Tokyo, 7 p.m.
I truly love you
But I'm so lonely and I want to see you
A breeze hits me
As I open the taxi window 
I'm rushing to see you
Tokyo, 7 p.m.
Suddenly, an answering machine
Starts by itself 
And talks all night 
The tokyo night, mysterious 
Waiting for the lights
At a crossing 
You are always so kind 
Today again 
I'm a little late 
I want to see you soon
I want to see you soon
Tokyo, 7 p.m.
But it's not christmas 
I'm so lonely, so I want to see you 
Tokyo, 7 p.m. 
I truly love you 
I'm so lonely, and I want to see you 
In the whole world
Can you 
Love only me? 
The restaurant
Where we were to meet
Had closed and disappeared
Holding only a 
Bouquet of roses 
You are waiting alone 
The same roses 
I saw in a dream
I want to see you soon
I want to see you soon

Just once would be enough

In the pocket of my only good clothes
There's never any money but,
On the sunny side of the street,
I'll dance
like Astaire and

In the middle of main street
I'll see you by chance
I'll yell out your name
Hug and kiss and

Before I die

I was passing the time for a while
In a large bookstore
Open until midnight

I was reading through magazines
With my old friends in them
Reading the horoscope

And then a tv guide and
A best seller
A magazine my friend is in
And a magazine that I'm in
Paid for the whole thing by credit card

At the big free market
Opens only on Saturday afternoon
I was passing the time alone

Yesterday, I was thinking about things
I stayed awake until morning but
I slipped out of bed anyway

A cheap lampshade and
An old movie poster
And tibet tea and
Cut, white flowers and
An afghan coat
I haggled and got a good deal

When I have a lover
I am in love but...
Even if I don't have a lover
It's no big deal

And then on the way back
From Saturday afternoon shopping
Following behind me
A small dog, a funny dog
This dog who followed me, barking as it does

Even if I don't have a lover
It's no big deal
But even if I don't have a lover
I am in love...

There's a statue of liberty
In your heart
A free soul, a guitar,
A bike, boots and a jack knife
Living without a watch
But with an answering machine

You are looking for
A golden heart that shines in the night
The gold bracelet you gave your ex-girlfriend
Is in the pawn shop
A tattoo on the arm
A tattoo of the statue of liberty

It's fantastic
Statue of liberty
It's rising
Statue of liberty
It's cool

It's gorgeous

Your girl looks good barefoot
She's like the statue of liberty
She's always cool and she sleeps with anybody
She walks and loves as a free spirit
Tonight she'll spend the night somewhere
Of course with another person

Everything is possible
If it's good then it's good
And will come to an end
I can't walk
Wearing
Platform shoes
Somehow
How? this way
A rocker come this far
Slow low
Rough whatever
Each one has it's own means
Values are relative
And changes violent
This city
Has come to a dead end
On the verge of a nervous breakdown
With my microphone
I'll scatter rhymes
All around the place
I'll do it here too

Rare records, jeans
And a statue of liberty t-shirt
Dogs barking,
Children crying and
Cars always stolen

I'll begin by talking

About something that puzzles me
Things like jewellery
And ice statues
Fragile works of art
You cannot
Touch them
Gaze at them longingly
From a distance

Today I'm just
Wearing a baby doll
Doing nothing
Vegetating in my bed

In the afternoon
Wearing my brand-new suit
I'll go window-shopping
To kill some time

At night
Wearing a black gown
I'm invited to dinner
Please call me madame

According to the tarot cards
The beautiful girl
Lives in a sea of tears
And the fool won't stop
Giving away money
Just like a broken tap

In the morning
Wearing my fur coat
I'll get back to the hotel
In the car you're so proud of

Someday
Wearing a white dress
I'll have my wedding ceremony
You too please come

Driving along the same course

Saying anything

Rainy till tomorrow morning

Without looking at me
Start to talk to me quietly

With the same old menu

Sometimes
I call you in the middle of the night
And force you to go out with me
Let's go somewhere now
And dance together till morning
That's it, those born in march
Are very unpredictable

Sometimes
I cry in the middle of the night
Just to put you in a hard situation
Come on cheer up
I'm just being childish
That's it, those born in march
Are hard to handle

If I drink a bit too much
And lose my senses
Don't say anything
Just let me sleep

Come on let's dance
If you can't dance
You might at least try to smile
Love me more
Pour me more drinks
More more
More more more

Even if I drink a bit too much
And end up unconscious
Wake me up gently
Tomorrow morning
Don't say anything

Sometimes
Out of the blue in the middle of the night
I want you to kiss me
You who more than any one
Love me
That's it those born in march
Believe in love at first sight
That's I'm nata di marzo
I'm always in love
That's it I was born in march
And I'm yours

after 3:00 p.m.
I have no labor
no homework or so
I have nothing
I have to do now
precious things, too
now
nothing

turn on the TV, horse race, movie
and that old afternoon shopping channel
turn off the TV, thinking
what do I really want to do right now?

I wanna eat pizza

always I go out
on saturday night but
I'm sick of it
I have noone I want to see
nowhere I want to go
and nothing I want to wear
nothing

my girlfriend who calls up
my special silly friend
talking all night on the sofa
and remember there is

leftover pizza

now it's sunday
10:00 a.m.
I have no work
no homework
nothing
nothing I have to do
no special thing

turn on the TV, animation, news
and that old stupid shopping channel
turn off the TV, I wonder
what I'll do today?

love is alright

this morning
just before I woke up
I had this short dream
I can't remember it
very well just in flashes

those angels whispered
whispered in my ears
wondrous love words
I thought I knew from somewhere

it is a bright
morning
just like all the others but
I sort of feel different
for no apparent reason
I'm just happy
it's like today
is the day
to begin a new love

when the angels smile etc
love begins
when the angels smile
love is alright
it will be alright

this strange hunch
in the new morning
this wonderful hunch

as the phone rings
I can tell from the sound
it is you
some strange news

you whisper
in my ear
wonderful love words
I'd been waiting for

in the looking-glass
I'm putting on
this brand-new
shirt
I don't know why
I like myself today
more than usual
it's like
the first day of
a new
season

when the angels smile
a new love begins
as the angels kiss
two people make love
the camera goes on

a strange hunch
in a new morning
a wonderful hunch

in the light
I'm hugging
myself
today
don't know why
I feel like crying
it's just like
the beginning of
a new love today
like that dream
I once saw is now
becoming reality

when the angels smile etc
love begins
when the angels smile
love is alright
it will be alright

One day as I woke up
Wings had grown on my back
Almost transparent blue
Wings like a big butterfly's
Which I saw last night
In this strange dream

One day as I woke up
I had become a butterfly
Which I had seen long ago
And still could remember
In a strange dream
A beautiful dream with a blue butterfly

One day as I woke up
I had fallen in love

Like I had dreamt the night before
A strange dream

One day as I woke up
I had been reborn
Then I opened the window
The pale light of spring
And flew away through the window

I want to meet you
But we are always passing through by other
Even when we can meet
For a very short time somewhere

The words I wanted to say

On the phone always the word
I want to say tends to be cut off
It takes all my attention to catch the words
That are almost vanishing the air
I feel happy just hearing
The simple words
That you say
It's a symphony for lovers

Time is passing by
The people running around
I can hear from somewhere
Music that I was almost forgetting

Paying all our attention to listen

Music that somebody is humming

And something comes alive

I wrote a very sad song
When I woke up this morning
But I won't let you listen to it
Because it's too sad a song

It's a very sad story
Maybe you noticed it too
It's really very sad
But our love is over

Like this
We held each other
We saw the same sunrise

I had a very sad dream
This morning before I woke up
I dreamt that I was singing a sad song
And you just kissed me

I'm really sorry
I've loved you so
But...

I'm really sorry
You've believed only me
But...

I'm really sorry
I've loved you so
But...

I'm really sorry
But in the end
We can forget everything

Even without money
We're happy
Let's have something to eat

Let's dance till morning
Somewhere where there's lots of people

Our life is endless fun
Till when
Is this happiness gonna last?

Nobody knows
What the future reserves us

But for the time being
We'll be together

All the time

Or down in the dumps

You've got pink eyes

Have been
Worried

You've lost your vigour
Of late

You sigh staring at
The looking-glass
You've lost your appetite

Tries to talk to you
You just stare back absently
You've been listening

All by yourself

I have fallen in love
Many times
Love always begins unexpectedly
Like a lie

Love at first sight
Unrequited love
All sorts of love
They do nothing but
Ticke your heart
The same thing over and over
And though I should know better

I fell in love again
Yeah I fell in love
Again
With you

Through the window
I can see the city lights
I want to listen to your voice
I miss you so much

Couldn't sleep
Waited for the break of dawn
It's been a long time
Since I last felt this
The whole world
Shines in this new morning
It shines
Because I met you

I'm in love again
I fell in love
Again yeah
In love
Woo woo

I've fallen in love
Many times
All sorts of love
Love at first sight
Unrequited love
It always makes
Your heart ache
So I had decided
I would never
Fall in love again but

I fell in love again
I'm in love
Again yeah
In love
With you
With you
With you

in this new morning

love is always like this

everything looks
shining bright

one word: 'love'

The camera shook a bit
Once again
You're swaying a bit
Once again

The world is slightly cracked
Don't move, just stay there
See, it's completely upside-down

The sun has almost disappeared
Once again
And now I can't see you
Once again

The world is completely out of sight
Don't move, just stay there
Wrapped up in film

The town sways
The moon wanes
The town is aglow
You wave your hand

The camera shook a bit
You are swaying a bit
The sun has almost disappeared
And now I can't see you

Pizzo,"Yeah ladies first so watch me set it off even the brothers can't touch us 
Professional Ballers is what they call us ain't no tellin' who we're bailin' 
Kentucky Texas ATL strikin' in a Lexus 
The nigga that want to test this 
Thought this shit was shut down thought this shit was dead like Makaveli 
Cali legends keep it goin', bout this player shit I'm knowin' 
Haters, I know you're bumpin' this shit so here's another daltz
From the Bay to the SCC, you heard us straight from California's most 

We don't need no practice, no theatrics 
Bout the way we be livin' with the Mafia tactics, I be constantly at it 
Tryin' to stack my riches like Bill Gates 
Servin' raw and uncut caine so you can't hate 
Because it angers me when niggas try to bite my ass 
But we be Professional Ballers hittin' at the top-notch ass 
Pass the green leaf on the left, inhale a breath of chronic smoke 
Exhale like a pro, I be too much for you to cope 

[Chorus: x2]
We steady countin' our money, on a mission to ball 
All the things we dream we want to see before we call 
So we pack heavy, push Chevy's, makin' the 'fetti 
If you're ready to holler at a Professional Baller 

Baby Capone on the loose, skywalk and fly shit 
Off Paraguay, Glock in the drop plus we're hidin' 
Astronauts, turnin' in shit for the soldiers that recop 
Shoot outta state pushin' killer Cali rocks 
Big wreckin' ball nuts and you can notify the monks 
I be flossin' in gators, maybe ??? ??? 
Tennis shoes, press our shit 
Aliens gank and flew, runnin' out to see you 
With the loot 

Yeah 
West Coast Mafia, bitch 
Everybody else can suck a dick 

I'm steadily tryin' to get my bail on 
Tapped me up on the cell phone, it ain't far 
Stomped in steel toes, I look out my ??? so back up off me 
The K-I-double L-A T-A-why, call me the locster 
Only smokes the bombest chronic, Professional Ballers like the Sonics 
Respect game, with or without these gold chains 
We're sure the West got shit sold 
From the rap game to the cocaine, come get some 
Got pounds like a kick drum, got hitmen 
Payin' 'em under the table, lyrics fatal like a ninja 
No pretendin', we're steady ballin' 

[Chorus]

From the Valley to the Bay, I'm known for stackin' chips 
My 500 whip be hip with the AMG hit 
'74 drop Caprice, gold ones dip 
Candy-coated sport, Professional Ballers don't trip 
Makin' moves, pushin' luxuries to ol' schools 
I spit the A-1, that's why my pockets weigh a tonne 
And my crew be Mafioso's, high performance and low-lows 
Professional Ballers on the go and get more doe 

Who keep it knockin' with mean choppers? My niggas keep it poppin' 
We're rockin', Professional Ballers, Figga-Ro will be the tallest 
Player that you spot, duck or dodge? 
It's all, turn the Impalas all skirty 
Left em deserted, heat em where their pockets hurted 
Sold it up by then, two quarters and half a flynn 
With my nigga Bo-Loc in the 500 Benz 
Ready to bust and make it happen fo' sho', so stack G's 
With them 8-ball gangstas 
And the young mack knees and that's for sheez 

[Chorus]",Professional Ballers,1998
