Always so easy to play
I'd rather keep my head down
Carry out the rest of my day
Somethin' 'bout the way that
People love their harm
I've got an eye for trouble
And that's what keeps me up in arms
You've got this thing about you
That keeps me on the edge of my seat
'Cause every time you smile
I can tell you're just showing your teeth

It bothers me to notice
But it sure seems you like that game
Surprises me every time
But really it's just the same

With that velvet glove
But when you take it off
I can see your skin is not enough
There's something there about you
Like an animal ready to feed
And every time you smile
I can tell you're just showing your teeth

Speak a little softer now
Or maybe just use your eyes
Pull her in around you
Using love as your disguise
There's danger in everything
You say and do
I guess we're not so different
And that's what makes me blue

leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
in the bedroom and all around.

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

The Eurobeats,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Was pluming his flight
That his hour of departure had come

As we silently stood by his side

How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.

And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.

Be kind to Barbara Allen""

She saw his corpse a-comin'
""Oh sit him down for me"" she cried
""That I may gaze upon him""

She bursted out to cryin'

They buried Willie in the old churchyard
And Barbara in the new one

And I thought of angels as I saw her there

Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry that cross that is more than her share
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

It wouldn't take much just to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there

Who'd think they owned heaven if she was their own
They'd never be willing to let her sit there

In the booth at the ice cream parlor
Where we play the nickelodeon
And we dance when we hear our favorite melody.

Everything is moving fast.

What they did in the past.

It's fountains full of dogs and kids
And it's freaky apple pie

Who swears he's 83
And he's fiddled every contest
From here to Cripple Creek

That it's country music in the park
As far as they can see

It's a nickel for the fiddler
It's a nickel for his tune
It's a nickel for the tambourine

It's a high holiday on the 21st of June

And everybody's ruined",A Nickel for the Fiddler,1973
The Everly Brothers,"Alone in a barroom, a young girl is sitting
And smiling at nothing at all
And she stares now and then at the eyes of the men
In the mirror that hangs on the wall

She's waiting for someone and knowing there's no one
Who cares if she comes or she goes
Just a soul in the shadows the world never sees
She's somebody nobody knows

Someone no one's ever known
Cryin' where no one can hear
Somebody's dyin' alone
In a city where nobody cars

Down in the gutter, an old man had fallen
Like someone the world threw away
And the late crowd was leaving and nobody even
Took time to look down where he lay

The old man was crying and helplessly tryin'
To wipe off the stain from his clothes
Just a soul in the shadows that life left behind
He's somebody nobody knows

Someone no one's ever known
Cryin' where no one can hear
Somebody's dying alone
In a city where nobody cares
In a city where nobody cares

Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams & memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street?

Perhaps upon that Lonely Street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

All the things I've done and how it's been
And I can't help believin' in my own mind
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end.
I've seen a lot of sunshine, slept out in the rain
Spent a night or two all on my own
I've known my lady's pleasures had myself some friends
Spent a time or two in my own home.

I have to say it now it's been a good life, all in all,
It's really fine to have a chance to hang around.
Lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire,
While all my friends and my old lady, sit and pass a pipe around
(alt- sit and watch the sun go down)
And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone,
How right it is to care.
How long it's been since yesterday,
What about tomorrow and what about our dreams
And all the memories we share.

Days they pass so quickly now, the nights are seldom long
Time around me whispers when it's cold.
The changes somehow frightens me, still I have to smile
It turns me on to think of growing old.
Although my life's been good to me, there's still so much to do
So many things my mind has never known
I'd like to raise a family, I'd like to sail away
And dance across the mountains on the moon.

 Down in the Tennessee hills
Aint' no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top

 but sweet as soda pop

The Everly Brothers,"I can see the turning of the key
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was right but he's afraid
But something's telling me I wear the ball and chain

My patron saint is fighting with the ghost
He's always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is telling me I love you still

Everybody's wearin' a disguise
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes
But me I can't cover what I am
Wherever the children go I'll follow them

I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you I'm not free
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?

We sat in an empty theatre and we kissed
I asked you please to cross me off your list
My head tells me it's time to make a change
But my heart is telling me ""I love you, but you're strange""

So one more time at midnight near the wall
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
Won't you come down from the throne from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time, before I abandon it.

The Everly Brothers,"It was the Senior High School yearbook 
The class of '63 
I'll never forget the way you gave 
Your book and pen to me 
It was all talked out and settled 
You new I'd understand 
A girl with dreams as big as yours 
Just had to make some plans 

So I turned to your best picture 
Most likely to succeed 
The only one in the whole damn book 
That didn't show you with me 
And it said that you liked inner strength 
So I tried to be true to form 
And I hid my teenage broken heart 
Instead I signed this poem 

I hope you always drive a Cadillac 
I hope you always drink champagne 
I hope you always shine with the sunshine 
I hope you never have to face the rain 
Unless the clouds are lined with silver 
May every heart you meet be gold 
And may you find the world as kind as you've been told 

At the ten year class reunion 
They read your personal note 
And displayed your cover photograph 
In your full length sable coat 
But the words underneath the picture 
Were what mattered most to me 
There was something in between the lines 
That no one else could see... 

It said
I always drive a Cadillac 
I always drink champagne 
And if you make time while the sun shines 
You never have to face the rain 
I travel fast because I go alone 
Everybody gets bought and sold 
And I wondered if you'd really become that cold 

That was the last word anyone heard from you 
Until I got your card today 
A single line and signature 
That said ""I'm coming home to stay"" 
I wonder what life has done to you 
I wonder why you thought of me 
But if you stop by to say hello 
I wonder what you'll think if you see 

An old ragged high school yearbook 
That falls open to just one page 
With a picture of a young girl's face 
Full of beauty, dreams and rage 
But the words underneath the picture 
Is the verse that's still so true 
It's the one I swore no one would read 
Unless I showed it to you 

I hope you always drive a Cadillac 
I hope you always drink champagne 
And you'll carry my heart wherever you go 
Even if I never see you again 
But if you bring it back home to me 
Maybe then it'll mean you know 
That the strongest love's the love that let's you go... 

I hope you always drive a Cadillac...",Always Drive a Cadillac,1986

I'd ride that highway to the arms of my sweet family

In love's sweet innocence

I Wonder If I Care As Much
As I did before........

Last night I cried myself to sleep
For the one that makes me weep,
I dried my eyes to greet the day,
And wondered why I have to pay.

The tears that I have shed by day
Give relief and wash away,
The mem´ry of the life before,
I wonder if I´ll suffer more.

[Chorus]

My pride is made to say forgive,
and take the blame for what you did,
It´s your mistake I´m thinkin´ of,
I wonder if I´m still in love.

My heart can´t thrive on misery,
My life it has no destiny,
When things get more
Than I can bear,
I ask myself ´Do I still care?´

You didn’t give me love
Love that I needed

Was it a fair exchange?
My love for cheating
Now I die each time
You give a kiss away

Life ain’t worth living
If I can’t live it, live it with you

The Everly Brothers,"My grandfather's clock
Was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half
Than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
It was bought on the morn
Of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped short
Never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
Tick, tock, tick, tock
His life seconds numbering
Tick, tock, tick, tock
It stopped short
Never to go again
When the old man died

In watching its pendulum
Swing to and fro
Many hours had he spent while a boy
And in childhood and manhood
The clock seemed to know
And to share both his grief and his joy
For it struck twenty-four
When he entered at the door
With a blooming and beautiful bride
But it stopped short
Never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
Tick, tock, tick, tock
His life seconds numbering
Tick, tock, tick, tock
It stopped short
Never to go again
When the old man died

My grandfather said
That of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time
And had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound.
And it kept in its place
Not a frown upon its face
And its hand never hung by its side
But it stopped short
Never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
Tick, tock, tick, tock
His life seconds numbering
Tick, tock, tick, tock
It stopped short
Never to go again
When the old man died

It rang an alarm
In the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit
Was pluming his flight
That his hour of departure had come
Still the clock kept the time
With a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short
Never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
Tick, tock, tick, tock
His life seconds numbering
Tick, tock, tick, tock
It stopped short
Never to go again

The Everly Brothers,"On a weekend pass I wouldn't have had time
To get home and marry that baby of mine
So I went to the chaplain and he authorized
Me to send for my ebony eyes

My ebony eyes was coming to me
From out of the skies on Flight 1203
In an hour or two I would whisper ""I do""
To my beautiful ebony eyes


The plane was way overdue so I went inside to the airlines desk and I said ""Sir, I
wonder why 1203 is so late?"" He said ""Aww, they probably took off late or they
may have run into some turbulent weather and had to alter their course."" I went
back outside and I waited at the gate and I watched the beacon light from the
control tower as it whipped through the dark ebony skies as if it were searching for
(my ebony eyes.) And then came the announcement over the loudspeaker-
""Would those having relatives or friends on flight number 1203 please report to the
chapel across the street at once.""

Then I felt a burning break deep inside
And I knew the heavenly ebony skies

I saw an old mother with silvery hair
She seemed so neglected by those who should care
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

Her hands were all callused and wrinkled and old
A life of hard work was the story they told
And I thought of angels as I saw her there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

Bless her old heart, do you think she'd complain
Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry that cross that is more than her share
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

It wouldn't take much just to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

I know some youngsters in an orphans' home
Who'd think they owned heaven if she was their own
They'd never be willing to let her sit there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

The ones who forgot her she loves just the same

And I thought of angels as I saw her there 
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair 

Bless her old heart, do you think she'd complain 
Though life has been bitter she'd live it again 
And carry that cross that is more than her share 
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair 

It wouldn't take much just to gladden her heart 
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part 
A letter would brighten her empty life there

Who'd think they owned heaven if she was their own 
They'd never be willing to let her sit there

The Everly Brothers,"All in the merry month of May
When the green buds they were swelling,
William Green on his death-bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying ""Love, there is a call for you 
If your name is Barbara Allen.""

She was very slowly getting up
And very slowly going, 
The only words she said to him
Were ""Young man I think you're dying.""

""Don't you remember the other day
When you were in town a-drinking,
You drank a health to the ladies all around
And slighted Barbara Allen?""

""O yes, I remember the other day
When I was in town a-drinking,
I drank a health to the ladies all around,
But my love to Barbara Allen.""

He turned his pale face to the wall
And death was in him dwelling;
""Adieu, adieu, to my friends all,
Be kind to Barbara Allen.""

When she got in two miles of town
She heard the death bells ringing:
They rang so clear, as if to say 
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!""

So she looked east and she looked west
And saw the cold corpse coming,
She says ""Come round you nice young man
And let me look upon you.""

The more she looked the more she grieved
Until she burst out crying
""Perhaps I could have saved that young man's life
Who now is here a-lying.""

""O Mother, O Mother, come make my bed
O make it both soft and narrow,
For sweet William died to-day 
And I will die to-morrow.""

""O Father, O Father, come dig my grave
O dig it deep and narrow,
For sweet William died in love
And I will die in sorrow.""

Sweet William was buried in the old church tomb,
Barbara Allen was buried in the yard;
Out of William's heart grew a red rose,
Out of Barbara Allen's grew a brier.

They grew and grew to the old church tower
And they could not grow any higher;
And at the end tied a true lover's knot
And the rose wrapped around the brier.",Barbara Allen [Live] [Live],2006

At ten o'clock it ended in a heckuva fight

I couldn't carry Jenny so I left her alone

She made it with a bang
Accordin' to the story in the paper this mornin'
Jenny is the leader of a teenage gang

Jenny has a brother and he's hot on my trail
Her daddy wants to ride me out of town on a rail
I hope I'll be around when Jenny gets out of jail

I went downtown to see her, she was locked in a cell
She wasn't very glad to see me, that I could tell
In fact, to tell the truth, she wasn't lookin' too well

Her eye was black, her face was red, her hair was a fright
She looked as though she'd been a'cryin' half of the night
I told her I was sorry, she said ""Get out of sight""

It seems a shame that Jenny had to go get apprehended, a heckuva fate

'Cause I knew how much you loved the sun
But you chose to stay, stay and keep me warm
Through the darkest nights I've ever known
If the mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Then I know I love ya

Oh the snow fell without a break
Buffalo died in the frozen fields you know
Through the coldest winter in almost fourteen years
I couldn't believe you kept a smile
Now I can rest assured knowing that we've seen the worst
And I know I love ya

Oh I never was good with romantic words
So the next few lines come really hard
Don't have much but what I've got is yours
Except of course my steel guitar
Ha, 'cause I know you don't play
But I'll teach you one day
Because I love ya

I recall the night we knelt and prayed
Noticing your face was thin and pale
I found it hard to hide my tears
I felt ashamed I felt I'd let you down
No mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Couldn't change a thing no, no

The coldest winter in almost fourteen years
Could never, never change your mind

She seemed so neglected by those who should care

And I've thought of angels as I saw her there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair

Bless her old heart do you think she'd complain
Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry the cross that is more than her share
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
It wouldn't take much to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair

I know some kids in an orphan's home
Who think they owned heaven if she was their own
They'd never be willing to let her sit there

The Exies,"Come here
I've got a fear of being alone
Will you nurse it?
I can't sew the wounds myself

Silent screaming
As if I had lost my breath
Somewhat damaged
And I want you to notice

You opened these eyes
And made me see
This is how life shows me

A beating heart, a memory
I'm not alone
Will I ever be happy?
Tell me why

I'm paralyzed underneath
Surrender my serenity
Hoping one day that I

The days and years
They're hanging down around my neck
Choking the meaning
Suffocating who I am

In you, a refuge
The safest place to call my home
Killing the feeling
This fear of being alone

You opened these eyes
And made me see
This is how life shows me

A beating heart, a memory
I'm not alone
Will I ever be happy?
Tell me why

I'm paralyzed underneath
Surrender my serenity
Hoping one day that I will feel alive
Just like you, just like you

'Cause everybody hurts
Everyone is used
Any body's them
And anyone is you

Read between the lines
And you will find the truth
Hope is the light
That leads me to you

A beating heart, a memory
I'm not alone
Will I ever be happy?
Tell me why

I'm terrified, I've got a need
I don't know why
Will I always be sorry?
Tell me why

I'm paralyzed underneath
Surrender my serenity
Hoping one day that I
Will feel alive just like you
Just like you, just like you

Behind the wheel, black eyes 
Like to scream, you do if you can feel

Find your angel, lose your hobby
Everybody, you gotta do something right
If you find love hold on tight

don't push, your love away
Don't push, your love away

then on the walk on my way back home
I get a call from a friend on the telephone
He says come here I've got this girl to see
But beware, love isn't always free
Upon first glance, I got so hungry
Forbidden fruits, you gotta taste them
I took one bite, we all take chances
Poison lips, doomed romances

don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)
Don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)

a kiss of death, on the door
That's what you get, for takin home a whore
I shouldn't say that, it doesn't sound nice
Faith removes my fear sometimes
I'm too shy, you're too sharp
Together we can work eachother out
Loves too quick, she's always been
We're in your bed, drunk with adrenaline

don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)
Don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)

and I can see better days
We can share, love can save
You can hide in yourself
We can go our separate ways

and I've seen better days
Pass me by in a haze
And we've seen better days
Pass us by in a haze
I've seen better days

Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

I wonder if you think of me
I wish you were here with me

Tonight*Pittsburg, PA

Blut still we're having so much fun

You stop, drop everything
When the phone begins to ring

How are you today?
Is everything okay?

That there's no one that I'd rather go with to a

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now

Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another

And if you froze a million dollars
You'd give it to me all for free

The Faces Down Quartet,"I never thought of heaven as a relevant spot
I never questioned any of the tears or the raindrops
I was a bore, surrounded by doors that all lead to some other floor
And I who thought there wasn't more

You knocked me off my feet
You knocked me off my feet
Heaven is from where you have come
Now I know

I never thought I could reach out from under the stream
I never hoped to ever be a part of a dream
So if it can't be, the stories I'll tell will shelter me from a future in hell

Except saying heaven is real

I can't sleep if I can't wake you
Just to say I've nothing more to say
I just had to hear you once again

The days go by
Getting there and as I do
I know your days go on
While I'm living for a set of six songs

The night makes me feel so young
That's a routine I think you mean we've become
But that's all distant drops now

What I say will come with a delay
And the rest I'll show you when I get home",Across the Land,2006
The Faces Down Quartet,"You can tell me anything
You are a true exception in my life
It sounded like she said she was in love
I then told her all the things that I had though I better keep inside
All of which revealed I was in love

All I craved was the rest but that's a priveledge non-existent 
When the word is out and about

You think it's gonna settle down in a stable environment once you both know
But it isn't so when you're in love
If it wasn't for the fact that I couldn't go back 
I wouldn't stand the torture that they call being in love

It won't get better
It won't get better
Embrace the curse so it doesn't get worse

Contemplating everything while doing nothing
On the verge of tears just because you are somewhat in love
I don't wanna be afraid and worry in the shade about the end
When I should be out being in love

But I'll need some proof
Won't you treat me to a dose?
Although I know so well
I can't tell

It won't get better
It won't get better
Embrace the curse so it doesn't get worse

Now that you have other plans we were even closer than I could tell

How does the wind howl?
I can't defy it
It's nothing to do with me
It's just another dead end mystery

I'm not crying
I'm not crying

When the late, last caustic days approach somebody so immaculate
Rain will pour and violins may sound from rooftops that touch the sky
But I'm not crying
To terms with such a trying destiny

How does the moon shine?
How does the wind howl?

Conquers and captures their hearts and minds
You can't not win!

The Faces Down Quartet,"I've been talking to the wall and it's been answering me
Oh darling how I miss you
I'm just the mere shadow of my former selfishness
I crave the silhouette of your kiss
With only the blue light of the TV on
Lip reading threats and false alarms
There's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself
And a girl in a window on the Reeperbarn
Whenever I put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt
That it's you that I'm dreaming about
Do I have to draw you a diagram?
All I ever want is just to fall into your human hands

With the kings and queens of the dance hall craze
Checkmate in three moves in your heyday
But the girls don't listen to your line anymore
Now you're part of someone else

On the factory floor and you still say ""where's the action?""
Now you manufacture happiness
And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction

(Chorus)
All you toy soldiers and scaremongers
Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder
In between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before

Tighter and tighter I hold you tightly
You know I love you more than slightly
Although I've never said it like this before

So please let me be to you ever near

The Faces Down Quartet,"It's the pounding in the heart whenever you are gone without any trace
It's the breaking of the waves that were about to really carry someplace
It's a major minor detail
It's a solitary sequel to never knowing anything at all

It's the ticking of the clock when you wake up alone at seven AM
It's the thought of getting used to something so right and then just throw it away
It's a major minor detail
On a misty morning L train
And the fear of having to go back

You'll hear the piano sound
And know something turned around

It's the circus I bring on whenever I reach out to touch you my dear
It's the laws of our attraction and the fact that it's all going somewhere
It's a major minor detail
Like erasing that old ghost train
So one day I can be with you

You'll hear the piano sound
And know someone turned around

Not much changed
The conflict's never gone

A place next door I asked
Around the lot a store
Clerk told me two young
Kids were shot mother
Was near the tracks dragged
To where a train would go past

From a beat up truck by a rural motel
The manager seen how the truck bed bounced
While dust flew up with a rolling sound

Voices appear from the staff outside
In bulbous text in western style
His manneneck spin to turn his face
The bar spills drunks out frame by frame

Girls pushed girls side to side
To hear a suction sound as limbs realign
The crowd just seemed to multiply
They hear his plastic jaw as the news drops hard

""Your retro career melted""

They couldn't have agreed with the mannequin less
They didn't understand what the mannequin meant
The sound of a barreled gun held to the back
Some plastic clicks as the shell parts pass

Fleshtone shards fly by wild
The fill a plastic bag with the parts inside
The bag got dumped, a town nearby

The Faint,"Feel the vapor pressure drop
As the dark steam pours out the entrance
Real cold world is swirling into a club
That keeps the real life world out

Where every sense seems deathly
Weak from the frozen time you spent in transit
The glass dance world flickers on
And the low end thaws your anxious body

Maybe I feel detached, I may just look too shy
It's a disinterest not that I'm a timid guy
I call them bodies but they are attentive too
I feel the social glare I feel the attitude

Watch as mirrors clear themselves
With the breath of frigid air that eased in
Made up babies all rotate
As a siren spins a beam of amber

Time sliced beat by beat in a row
In a club, in a line, in the city
The glass dance world flickers on
Because the cycle happens enough

A baby falls out warm, it's screaming for its life
An infant tries to dance as it grows up then dies
That's simplified but, uh, when your complexion dries
You wake up cold and think, you wish it'd been this way

",Glass Danse [Paul Oakenfold Remix],2003
The Faint,"I checked in a room today
Up above the downtown market bricks
Right now a boy gets old
A boy gets bitter, a boy learns not to trust
Someone inside his room
The door locks tight
You keep the door locked

Months went by and doors got kicked in
Two outlaws collecting what they loaned
In a room beside my walls
A girl gets choked, she can't pay back the loan
48 more hours to go
""48 more hours"", that's all they say
In two more nights, I hear a sound
A shrill from one thin wall away

Every place is the same
Every day is the same
Every place is the same
Violent
There's a conflicting sound
Hear the arguments loud
Everyday, the sounds of the
Violent, violent, violent, violent
Sounds of the violent

I moved uptown
A bit, not much changed
Conflict is never gone
But just as a calm sets in
Police line barricades a place next door
I asked around the lot
A store clerk told me two young kids were shot
Mother was near the tracks
Dragged to where a train would go past

Every place is the same
Every day is the same
Every place is the same
Violent
There's a conflicting sound
Hear the arguments loud

You want to think of something smart,
Something someone would repeat,

I'm gonna tell you how it is.
Then, when you get your turn to talk
I hope your microphone is off

",I Disappear [Album Version],2004
The Faint,"In the beginning there was semen,
In a deep mound of flesh,
And a crest that traveled,
On a wave of their own mess.

Through a tunnel of mucus,
And onto a vault,
With tourists and traffic,
I just paced myself.

Not I as my whole self,
Just the half that I had,
Before greeting the rest,
Of my better half.

A connection was made,
Through the shared love of science,
And vows were taken,
A seat was hired.

A cavern of fluid,
Brought shape to my hide,
In the months that remain,
To the time of my life.

Add flash for the reason,
Was spilling from the crack,
To the palms of the doctor,
To a towel full of scraps.

My brains wouldn't fit,
Through organ sex,
An incision was made,
With a scalpel and mess.

I should have noticed the beauty,
And not how it hurt,
Wet like a cherry,
In the bloodbath of birth.",Birth,2004
The Faint,"Was it more than attraction and a physical lust?
Her loins in my imagination have urged an inconceivable touch
I was planning on, I mean wishing on
How embarrassed I'd've been if you knew what I was thinking of

And woah when it started, my first thought was love
Then just lust, 'cause when I heard you start speaking about ""warm""
In the evening I saw you, you were warming a bass up
Your hair covered your face up
I was acting indifferent at the Merch booth, putting on make-up

We met up at a party, at a spot on a yacht
Eyes spun around, we were docked
I crossed my fingers, but I didn't beg
Cause I knew you knew
Cause I knew you knew I liked you

I knew you knew I liked you
I knew you knew it
But I figured desperate guys never had a chance

I know I won't arrive on time
Before whatever out there is gone
What can I do, that day is done
It's just a promise that I made
I said I'd walk in her parade
Hot scalding tears I thought would flow
Still in my heart they'll never show

That day is done
You know where I've gone I won't be coming back
That day is done
Well I recall the time and place
When they announced her precious face
I thought at once my heart would burst
Still every time is like the first
There was applause when she stepped up
I wished that I could interrupt
I made no sign, I made no sound
I know I must stay underground

That's why she walks, or so they say
She always knew just what I needed
Now if she would just look my way
One time before they proceed
She sprinkles flowers in the dirt

I know I'll never see her face
She walks away from my resting place

The Fairfield Four,"I was fresh out of the service
It was back in 82
I raised some Cain when I come back to town
I left to be all I could be
Come home without a clue
Now, I married Dawn and had to settle down

So I hired on at the prison
Guess I always knew I would
Just like my dad and both my uncles done
And I worked on every cell block
Now, things're goin' good
But then they transferred me to Ellis Unit One

Swing low
Swing low and carry me home

Well, my daddy used to talk about them long nights at the walls
And how they used to strap em in the chair
The kids down from the college and they'd bring their beer n all
N when the lights went out, a cheer rose in the air

Well, folks just got too civilized
Sparky's gatherin' dust
Cause no one wants to touch a smokin' gun
And since they got the injection
They don't mind as much, I guess
They just put em down at Ellis Unit One

Swing low
Swing low
Swing low and carry me home

Well, I've seen em fight like lions, boys
I've seen 'em go like lambs
And I've helped to drag em when they could not stand
And I've heard their mamas cryin' when they heard that big door slam
And I've seen the victim's family holdin' hands

Last night I dreamed that I woke up with straps across my chest
And something cold and black pullin' through my lungs
N even Jesus couldn't save me though I know he did his best

The Fairfield Four,"It was six men of Indostan
To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
(Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind.

The First approached the Elephant,
And happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl:
""God bless me! but the Elephant
Is very like a wall!""

The Second, feeling of the tusk,
Cried, ""Ho! what have we here
So very round and smooth and sharp?
To me 'tis mighty clear
This wonder of an Elephant
Is very like a spear!""

The Third approached the animal,
And happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up and spake:
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a snake!""

The Fourth reached out an eager hand,
And felt about the knee.
""What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain,"" quoth he;
""'Tis clear enough the Elephant
Is very like a tree!""

The Fifth who chanced to touch the ear,
Said: 'E'en the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most;
Deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an Elephant
Is very like a fan!""

The Sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than, seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a rope!""

And so these men of Indostan
Disputed loud and long,
Each in his opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong,
Though each was partly in the right,
And all were in the wrong!

He scolded out and scolded in;
He shook his fist, his hair he tore;
He stamped his feet and slammed the door.

Heigh ho, the Peppery Man,
The rabid, crabbed Peppery Man!
Oh, never since the world began
Was any one like the Peppery Man.

His ugly temper was so sour
He often scolded for an hour;
He gnashed his teeth and stormed and scowled,
He snapped and snarled and yelled and howled.

He wore a fierce and savage frown;
He scolded up and scolded down;
He scolded over field and glen,
And then he scolded back again.

His neighbors, when they heard his roars,
Closed their blinds and locked their doors,
Shut their windows, sought their beds,
Stopped their ears and covered their heads.

He fretted, chafed, and boiled and fumed;
With fiery rage he was consumed,
And no one knew, when he was vexed,
What in the world would happen next.

Name was J. Temperance
Only two did not hate him
Because peasants fear local indifference
Pet shop and the vet, Cameron.

One night vet is called out
from his overpaid leisure
To Temperance household, delivered ran out
and phoned his wife in terror.

The next bit is hard to relate.
The new born thing hard to describe
Like a rat that's been trapped inside
A warehouse base, near a city tide
Brown sockets, purple eyes
And fed with rubbish from disposal barges brown and covered 

No changeling,
as the birth was witnessed.
Only one person could do this:
""Yes"" said Cameron
""and the thing was in the
impression of J. Temperance.""

Who drive right through the gates
In white roll-tops

I had an awake dream
I was in the supervision dept.
Of a bigtown store
Security floors one to four
They had cameras in the clothes dummies.
A man came up to them
He wanted sex in the dummies eyes
Then came up the cry:
""Security, mobilized!""

The star would complain of the smell in his room.

Gert was handsome, well-meaning, but slightly a careless type.
Not malicious, I hope you understand and grasp.
No chance.

But on returning from his clerical job, Gert 
Would park his Volkswagen at the end of the day

So that the exhaust fumes would flow upwards right through
The open windows of the athletic star's upstairs bedroom.

I drive a big truck
I shot the pinball machine, but it caused me bad luck. 
I wish they'd outlaw them old pinball machines
Many weeks they have caused me to live on sardines.

Last time I called my wife on the phone,
The first thing she said was ""John, can you come home?
I've got a load of hogs and they've got to go.""
""I'll see you when I get back from Chicago .

She said ""John, you know I love you, I wish you wouldn't go,
Send your babies some money. They're hungry and cold.""
The last thing she said, and then she hung up, was
""John you gave up my loving to drive an old truck.""

I made my trip up to the depot
I was gone two months cause I shot up my dough
When I got home my family was gone
The best friend I had rung my telephone.
He said ""John, I guess you wonder 'bout your babies and wife
Pneumonia got your babies and your wife took her life.""

Manchester right to, er, Newcastle. In Darlington, helped an old
Man on his own chase some kids who fucking threw bricks through
His flat window. He had a way with people like that. [Because of
This] we moved on.
'Junior Choice' played one morning. The song was 'English
Scheme.' Mine. They'd changed it with a grand piano and turned
It into a love song. How they did it I don't know. DJs have
Worsened since the rising. Collaborating on nothing in praise of
The track with words they can hardly pronounce in telephone

Government have brought over huge yellow trains on Teeside docks.

In the, er, pissing rain, before the Queen Mother hit town.

And government crap

Look where you are

Shift!
Tony was a business friend
Of RT, 17
And was an opportunist man
Come, come hear my story
How we set out to corrupt and destroy
This future Rising
The business friend came round today
With teeth clenched, he grabbed my neck
I threw him to the ground
His blue shirt stained red
The north will rise again.
I said you are mistaken, friend
I kicked him out of the home
Too many people cower to criminals
And that government pap
When all it takes is hard slap
Got out the window, a burglar wrote
There were men with beads on sticks
The fall had made them sick
A man with butterflies on his face
His brother threw acid in his face
His tatoos were screwed
The streets of Soho did reverberate
With drunken Highland men
Revenge for Culloden dead
The North had rose again
But it would turn out wrong
The North will rise again
So R. Totale dwells underground
Will wait from cyclic grind
With ostrich head-dress
A face a mess, covered in feathers
Orange-red with blue-black lines
That draped down to his chest
They are a tentacle mess
And light blue pant-heads
TV showed sham Chip and Dale
No concept of what they mean
The Arndale had been razed
Shop staff knocked off their ladders
Security guards up from the escalators
And now darkness descends
Tony seize the control
He built his base in Edinburgh
He had on his hotel wall
A hooded friar on a tractor
He took a bluey and called Totale
Who said, ""the North has rose again""
But it will turn out wrong
When I was in cavalry
I vowed to defend
All our English clergy
Though they have gone wrong
And the fall has begun
This has gotten out of hand
I will go for a foreign base
But he told me off life down at home
Said Totale, go back to bed

And you can't stop your age
