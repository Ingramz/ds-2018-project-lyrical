The Mel-Tones,"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness

Oh man that
Un hunh
I know shes waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try
Try a little tenderness

The Mel-Tones,"Bye bye baby
Time to hit the road to dreamland
You're my baby

Dig you in the land of nod

Hold tight baby
We'll be swinging up in dreamland
All night baby

Where the little cherubs trot

Look at that knocked out moon
Been a-blowing his top in the blue

Never saw the likes of you

The Mel-Tones,"Don't need no palace paved with gold
Don't need more cash than banks can hold
When I get to feelin' a feelin'
For something there ain't too much of
My sweet lil' darlin' gives me her love
 
Don't catch me chasin' round at night

The Mel-Tones,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
Its really killin' that he's so willin' 
To make whoopee

Picture a little love nest 
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest 
Think what a year can bring

He's washin dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks,
Thats what you get folks, for makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Five thousand dollars per;
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You pay six to her.""

He says, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge, right into jail.
You'd better keep her
I think it's cheaper
Than making whoopee.""",Makin' Whoopee,2007

The Mel-Tones,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love,2007
The Mel-Tones,"Ding dong, ding dong,
Slumber time,
The moon descends
And so to bed.
The music ends
And go to bed.

Should auld acquaintance linger in your heart,
Then don't forget we're just a dream apart!
Tomorrow night seems years away,
But after all it's just a day!
And I'll remember every word you said,
I love you so, and so to bed,

And so to bed!",And So to Bed,2012
The Mel-Tones,"Some folks were meant to live in clover
But they are such a chosen few
And clover being green
Is something I've never seen
'Cause I was born to be blue

When there's a yellow moon above me
They say there's moonbeams I should view, I should view
But moonbeams being gold
Are something I can't behold
'Cause I was born to be blue

When I met you
The world was bright and sunny
When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh
But nothing strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel, well

I guess I'm luckier than some folks
I've known the thrill of lovin' you
And that alone is more than I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue",Born to Be Blue,2012
The Mel-Tones,"Castles were crumbling and daydreams were tumbling
December was battling with June
But on this bright afternoon
Guess I'll be changing my tune
Kept on despairing beyond any caring
If I jumped out of a balloon
But I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune

At last the stars are bright and shiny
It's a human world once more
Yesterday's troubles are tiny
What was I worried for? 

Wanted a permit to make me a hermit
To grumble and glare at the moon
But I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune

At last the stars are bright and shiny
It's a human world once more
Yesterday's troubles are tiny
What was I worried for?

Afloat on a dreamy lagoon
And I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune",Changing My Tune,2012
The Mel-Tones,"Day by day I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

So come what may I want you to know
I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years day by day",Day by Day,2012
The Mel-Tones,"Paradise can not refuse us
Never such a happy pair

Everybody must excuse us
If we walk on air

All the shadows now will lose us
Lucky stars are everywhere

As a happy being
Here's what I'm foreseeing

For you, for me, forever more
It's bound to be forever more

It's plain to see
We found, by finding each other
The love we waited for

With a world of love in store

The Mel-Tones,"Get out of town
Before it's too late, my love
Get out of town
Be good to me, please

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees?

Just disappear
I care for you much too much
And when you're near, close to me, dear
We touch too much

The Melismatics,"Show a little inspiration, show a little spark
And show that things that drew me to you and stole my heart
And tell me something I don't know instead of everything I do
And look at me as if I mean something to you
Our hearts are beating while we sleep, but while we're wide awake
You know the world won't stop, and actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Show a little passion, baby, show a little style
And show the knack for knowing when and the gift for knowing how
And have a little trust in us when fear obscures the path
You know we got this far, darling, not by luck, but by never turning back
Some will call on destiny, but I just call on faith
That the world won't stop, and actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, to what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Caught up in our little lives, there's not a lot left over
I see what's missing in your eyes; you're searching for that field of clover
So show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show the world a little light when you show it your heart
We've got two lives, one we're given and the other one we make
And the world won't stop, and actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard (everything we got, we got the hard way)
Everything we got, we got the hard way
(Because the world won't stop) hang on, baby...

Anesthetics numb the pain, new beginnings start again 
Pick myself up off the floor, and find the strength I had before

Poison air, breathe it in, let it bleed, heal the skin, desecration, revelation, medication kicking in 
What we're feeling will transcend the situations we are in 
We are digging deep 

Gentle leader, violent leader, expectations, limitations, killing time until I die 
I saw the future in your eyes, I know why you won't sleep tonight, I've seen you in a different light 
You are digging deep

This heart of mine is singing right along

I'm just on my way to anywhere
Pocketful of nothing, nothing I can spend

Don't be a tease
Don't start what you can't finish
I told you once before
If it's love you're looking to get
You're gonna get what you're looking for

Don't you know, you're walking on dangerous ground
Listen babe when I make love
I just don't fool around, no I don't
I just don't play around

Stop where you are
Just take it slow
Once I put my hands on you baby
I won't let you go
Don't start what you can't finish
One kiss and I want more
If it's love you're looking to get
You're gonna get what you're looking for

Stop where you are
Don't move an inch
Stop where you are
You're gonna be in a pinch
Stop where you are
You're gonna get what you're looking for",Stop Where You Are,2014

Tonite, tonite what I'd give if I could hear

Just whisper (shhh whisper) ""I love you"" and will eternally

Tonite, tonite more than any time before (any time before)
