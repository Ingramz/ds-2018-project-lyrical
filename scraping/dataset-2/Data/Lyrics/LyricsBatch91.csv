Cuco Sánchez,"Buscaba mi alma con afán tu alma
Buscaba yo la virgen que a mi frente
Tocaba con sus labios dulcemente
En el febril insomnio de mi amor

Buscaba yo la mujer pálida y bella
Que en mis sueños me visita desde niño
Para partir con ella mi cariño
Para partir con ella midolor

Como en la sacra soledad del templo
Sin ver a Dios se siente su presencia
Yo presentí en el mundo tu existencia
Y como a Dios sin verte te adore

Amemonos mi bien en este mundo
Donde lagrimas tantas se derraman
Las que vierte quizás los que se aman
Tiene no se que de bendición

Amar es empapar el pensamiento con
La fragancia del edén perdido
Amar, amar es llevar herido
Con dardo celeste el corazón

Es tocar los tinteles de la gloria
Es ver tus ojos, es escuchar tu acento
Es en el alma llevar el firmamento
Y es morir a tus pies de adoración",Amemonos,1995
Cuco Sánchez,"Anoche estuve llorando
Horas enteras
Pensando que sólo tú eras
Toda la causa de mi sufrir

Mi vida ¿por qué te alejas?
¿por qué me dejas?
Si sabes que en este mundo
Sin tu cariño no he de vivir

¡Ay!
Cómo sufre mi pecho
Por Dios no hay derecho
Que tu seas así

No, ya no puedo aguantarme
Si tu no regresas
Me voy a morir

Anoche estuve llorando
Horas enteras
Pensando en ti vida mía
El nuevo día me sorprendió

Después me quedé dormido
Y en ese sueño logré
Tenerte en mis brazos
Se fue mi llanto, murió el dolor

¡Ay!
Cómo sufre mi pecho
Por Dios no hay derecho
Que tu seas así",Anoche Estuve Llorando,1995
Cuco Sánchez,"Arrieros somos y en el camino andamos
Y cada quien tendrá su merecido
Ya lo verás que al fin de tu camino
Renegarás hasta de haber nacido

Si todo el mundo salimos de la nada
Y a la nada por Dios que volveremos
Me río del mundo que al fin ni él es eterno
Por esta vida no más no más pasamos

Tú me pediste amor y yo te quise
Tú me pediste mi vida y te la di
Si al fin de cuentas te vas, pues anda y vete
Que la tristeza te lleve igual que a mi",Arrieros Somos,1995
Cuco Sánchez,"De Altamira Tamaulipas 
Traigo esta alegre canción 
Y al son del viejo violín 
Y jarana canto yo 

Pa´ las mujeres bonitas
Que son de mi adoración 
De Altamira Tamaulipas 
Traigo esta alegre canción 

Si la vida es un jardín 
Las mujeres son las flores
El hombre es el jardinero
Que corta de las mejores 

Yo no tengo preferencia 
Por ninguna de las flores 
Me gusta cortar de todas 
Me gusta ser mil amores 

Dichoso aquel que se casa 
Y sigue la vacilada 
Siempre anda jugando contras 
A escondidas de su amada 

Pero más dichoso yo 
Que no me hare falta nada 
Tengo viudas y solteras 
Y una que otra casada 
RV",El Mil Amores,1995
Cuco Sánchez,"Este corazón
Que aun te quiere
Ya está muriendo tarde con tarde
Como se muera la luz del día
Ya no puedo más
Tú me haces falta
Vuelve conmigo
Alma de mi alma
Vidita mía

Adónde estás, adónde estás
Mátame cielo, trágame tierra
Quiero morirme si no vuelve más
Ya podrás tener
El mundo entero
Y otro cariño mejor que el mío
Pero ya verás
Que todo acaba
Y al verte solo cómo hoy me siento
Siempre hace frío

Cuco Sánchez,"Y tú que te creías
El rey de todo el mundo
Y tú que nunca fuiste
Capaz de perdonar
Y cruel y despiadado
De todo te reías
Hoy imploras cariño
Aunque sea por piedad

A dónde está tu orgullo
A dónde está el coraje
Por que hoy que estás vencido
Mendigas caridad
Ya ves que no es lo mismo
Amar que ser amado
Hoy que estás acabado
¡qué lástima me das!

Maldito corazón
Me alegro que ahora sufras
Que llores y te humilles
Ante este gran amor

Cuco Sánchez,"Nací norteño hasta el tope
Me gusta decir verdades
Soy piedra que no se alisa
Por más que talles y talles

Soy terco como una mula
¿a dónde vas que no te halle?

En tu casa no me quieren
Porque me vivo cantando
Me dicen que soy mariachi
Y que no tengo pa' cuándo

Comprarte el traje de fiesta
Que el tiempo te estoy quitando

No soy monedita de oro
Pa' caerle bien a todos
Así nací y así soy
Si no me quieren, ni modo

El cielo tengo por techo
Nomás el sol por cobija
Dos brazos pa' mantenerme
Un corazón pa' tu vida

Ve, corre y dile a tus padres
A ver quien da más por su hija

Ay, corazón bandolero
Relincha ya cuanto quieras
Por esa potranca fina
Que amansarás cuando quieras

Tú y yo no tenemos prisa
Ai, nos ""quedrá"" cuando quiera

No soy monedita de oro
Pa' caerle bien a todos

Cuco Sánchez,"Ahora si ya es imposible
El vivir juntos los dos
Vete ya por el camino
Que la suerte te marcó

A mi lado no lo niegues
Fuiste mucho muy feliz
Pero eso no lo entiendes
Por que ya naciste mala
Y no hay nada bueno en ti

Pero si yo ya sabía
Que todo esto pasaía,
¿como diablos fui a caer?
Me re lleva la tristeza
¡que desgracia!, ¡que torpeza!
¡que manera de perder!

Pero en fin ya nos quisimos
Tu te vas y yo me voy
Al perderte voy ganando
Anda vete a ver que encuentras
Y que te bendiga dios",Que Manera de Perder,1996
Cuco Sánchez,"Voy por el mundo sin rumbo fijo
No siento pena ni siento amor
Soy el fantasma de mi pasado 
Soy de las almas que olvida Dios
Tuve un cariño que se fue de mi vida
Fue mi locura mi adoración
Pero fue el más grande de mi tormento
Cuando cruelmente me abandonó
Hoy la pena que venga 
Muy bien venida
Y si quiere irse 
Nada mas que se vaya 

Que ahí vendrán otras y otras
Y hoy la que sea para mí es igual
Yo no soy de esos
Que al verse solos quieren matarse
O vengar su amor
Por lo contrario,
Yo la bendigo por ese amor
Que una vez me dio
Si un día con otro yo la encontrara
Y me llorara pidiendo amor
La perdonaba,
Al fin seria lo que en mi vida
Las otras no son hoy",La Que Sea,1996
Cuco Sánchez,"Como el sol le hace falta a la luna
Pues sin él no podría darnos luz
Como el aire hace falta en el mundo
Así me haces falta tú
Si algún día quisieras dejarme
Por mi madre que no iba a saber
Ni pensar, ni morir, ni vivir
Mucho menos llorar y reír

Cuándo has visto llorar a las piedras?
Cuándo has visto resecarse el mar?
Dime tú, que hay eterno en el mundo?
No más nuestro amor y ya

De piedra la cabecera
La mujer que a mi me quiera
Me ha de querer de a de veras

Ay, ay, corazón por qué no amas

Subí a la sala del crimen
Le pregunté al presidente
Que si es delito el quererte
Que me sentencien a muerte

Ay, ay corazón por qué no amas

El día en que a mi me maten
Que sea de cinco balazos
Y estar cerquita de ti
Para morir en tus brazos

Cucumber Slice,"Yo, yo, yo, y'all can't stand right here
In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum close-range
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange

I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
Joking rhymes, like the ""Is you just happy to see me?"" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
I'm saying - electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slit it to the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broke times

Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro
This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks
""Oh, you're too kind!"" ""Really? Thanks!""
To the gone and lost forever like ""Oh My Darling Clementine""
He hold his heart when he telling rhyme
When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven
He nasty like the old time Old No. 7
You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola
Make 'em wish they could erase it out the Motorola
I told her - no credit for a bag
If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gak
Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck
And still keep your attitude on self-destruct

Cud,"The first time that I saw you,
You were running scared,
You assured me,
Your clothes were making chase,
Your mouth was making shapes before me,
The second time you touched me,
Your hands sent ripples through me,

You're one in a million, take me home,
Make dragons fly, make dragons roam,
You're one in a million,
And I will see you soon,
I want to take you high in my...
Purple Love Balloon.

The second time you touched me,
Your hands went running through me,
It was white so I could find me,
the second time you loved me,
the dragon was inside me,

I want to take you high,
In my Purple Love Balloon,
I want to thumb a ride,
In my Purple Love Balloon,
I want to make you fly,
In my Purple Love Balloon.

Cud,"Lola
I met her in a club down in old Soho,
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola,
C-O-L-A cola,
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance,
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola,
L-O-L-A Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy,
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine,
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola.

Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand,
Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man,

Well we drank champagne and danced all night,
Under electric candlelight,
She picked me up and sat me on her knee,
And said dear boy won't you come home with me,

Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola,

I pushed her away,
I walked to the door,
I fell to the floor,
I got down on my knees,
Then I looked at her and she at me,
Well that's the way that I want it to stay,
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola.

Well I left home just a week before,
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before,
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand,
And said dear boy I'm gonna make you a man.

Girls will be boys and boys will be girls,
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola,",Lola,1991
Cud,"Once again I'm gonna make it plain,
I'm much happier with you again,

They say it's the thought that counts,
Your feelings are like cheques that bounce,
I've said before I should be glad,
I'll say it again 'cos I'm feeling sad.

I was lying, I told the truth,
But I was lying,
I thought I knew what you wanted me to say,
But I was lying, I told the truth,
But I was lying.

I don't know what you'll think when you hear me say,
That it's the very first time I've felt this way,
It cuts me up that we;ve come to this,
It's your turn to want, I want another kiss,
the longer this situation persists,
I know your critics will glow,
And if they don't come and change soon honey,
You know I'll change my vote.

It feels so all-consuming,
It's a hunger so consuming,
You've started life inside of me.

Once again I'm gonna make it plain,
I'm much happier with you again,
I'm scared of the way you make me feel,
And I'm always wondering if you love me still,
Tell me how you dream,
I'd like to rip your heart out at its seams.
Tell me how you feel,
Do you love me still?",Once Again,1992
Cud,"I'm never fed up,
Because I'm made up,
Head full of loose change,
Because I'm rich and strange.

Holy moses, here we go again,
Headlong into some crazy scheme,

Success no more a pipe dream,
You must remember how,
Wow is to wow,
And a kiss is just too much.

From the cellar of my house comes a bellowing,
It's the tired and lonely tigers that I've kept there,
I can't imagine who the landlord's expecting,
They've been in their since June last year,
You must remember when,
You loved me like a friend,
And a kiss is just too much baby.

You must remember that,
I'm fat but I know where it's at,
And a kiss would be too much baby, let's get out of this town.

Cuddly Punx,"I was dreaming of the past,
And my heart was beating fast.
I began to lose control, 
I began to lose control.
I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm sorry that I made you cry.
Oh no, I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm just a jealous guy.

I was feeling insecure you might not love me anymore.
I was shivering inside, 
I was shivering inside.

Cuesta Voce,"Why does the gay little dicky bird sing?

Te quiero,

O será que alguien 
Llegó a tu vida y te sientes intranquila 
Y es por eso que no quieres 
Mi amor, amor, amor. 

Pero cómo te olvido 
Si apenas ayer dijiste 
Te quiero, 
Te quiero, 
Te quiero. 

Te quiero, 
Te quiero,

Que sólo es un mal momento 
Que ya todo pasará 
Y será igual, igual, igual 
Pueda ser igual",Te Quiero [Balada],2001

Mala suerte, porque tengo tanto miedo de perderte

Ahora pienso que tal vez sería prudente

Y me vas a perdonar
Pero me voy a buscar
Otros brazos , otros labios
Que me ayuden a ahuyentar

On sometimes I got to come down from the
Trouble, from the noise and from the sound

Inna berlin city woman and man dem irie
But me overstand well how somebody flee flee
When me sit by di riverside feeling free
When me chat about situation with me brother

Big up unu sound but a fire fi di symbol
Me haffi escape all di dust and rumble
Inna di countryside me a go njam well

Down inna di real jungle with no concrete

About last summer
Wondering how the time has walked away
Everybody was around everybody felt free
And I wonder why
Now I am feeling pressure of the society
And bring a little love to the city

Was los in den clubs, was los in den bars

Fahr deine Krallen aus kratz mir den Rücken auf
Zeig mir nochmal deine Piercings

Alk ist umsonst, weil der Barmann gefriert
Wer hat Schuld, wenn die Tanzfläche einschneit?

Und ich spüre wie das Eis zerbricht
Deine Kurven glühen im  Discolicht
Dein Körper kocht, doch du kriegst mich nicht!
Plötzlich seh' ich, wie heiß du bist,
Und ich spüre wie das Eis zerbricht
Deine Blicke haben sich festgekrallt
Du brennst vor Verlangen, doch das lässt mich kalt!

Ich bin trotzdem entspannt und chill am Strand

Ich werd' sonst noch bekloppt vom Hitzeschock

Hörten wir gerne rammstein und kiss.
Sie soff mich ständig untern tisch
Immer auf ex ex ex.

Sie war ein voll veganer eso-hippie.
Wollte mit mir für die freiheit kämpfen.
Backte die besten hash-cookies.
Ich sollte mit ihr nach jamaika trampen.
Ihr hobby war kamasutra power meditieren
Für die biobauern demonstrieren
Sie wollte yoga studieren
Meine freunde sagten dass ich doch
Ne macke haben muss.
Doch sie war meine dance hall queen.

Shoppen war ihr einziges hobby
Mein erbe hat sie aufgeraucht
Schnell noch ein cafe auf den champs elysees
Dann nach davos posen im powder schnee
Nach unserem candellight dinner am see
Holt die kleine maus ihre peitsche raus
Und teilt aus

Stress on my mind, think I'll end it all, people tell me to stand tall
But I don't want to live, got nothing to give and I'm tired of hitting walls
They don't understand from where I come, my past not a pretty one
Scars, never stars, now I'm ready to quit and let this life be done
Some tell me to hold on, tell me to be strong, but the battle's too long
No fight left in me, but they don't comprehend that my will is all gone
Nothing to grasp, hope is past and my faith is in the trash
So save the love that you think I need, I'm going out with a blast

Troubles got me down, never got a break, just pain and heartache
Not looking for a reason to go on, no more, I've had all I can take
I'm tired of the same old thing, same old scene, death must now be king
I give up, I don't want to live up to the wicked hopes of society
Some say excel, but I still fail so well, just call me a pro
Reasons for failing, truth be known, I really don't care to know
It?s time to move on, time to be gone, farewell to my king
Just want to end this losing trend with a bullet and a shot of gin

You lied to my face while I undressed your fears

There, there you go with your confidence trick

Feeling so low and looking so high
We both know that your truth is a lie

It's a lie

Blinding all colours and beauty

You're the hole in my favourite shoe
You're the last dying breath of love

And you hurt yourself

You say I'm deranged, I'll admit to being strange
But I just can't stop loving you
If the light in your eyes
Addiction came as a surprise
Didn't think I'd be so into you

Come on ev'rybody, I say now  let's play a game.
I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name.
The first letter of the name,
I treat it like it wasn't there,
But a ""B"" or an ""F""  or an ""M"" will appear;
And then I say ""Bo"" add a ""B"" then I say the name.
Then ""Bo-na-na fanna"" and ""fo""
And then I say the name again with an """"f"" very plain,
Then  ""fee fi"" and a ""mo""
And then I say the name again with an ""M"" this time.
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme.
 
Arnold! Arnold, Arnold bo-bar-nold, 
Bo-na-na, fanna fo-far-nold, 
Fee fi m-mar-mold. Arnold!
 
But if the first two letters are ever the same,
Crop them both, then say the name.
Like Bob, Bob, drop the ""B's"", Bo-ob.
Or Fred, Fred, drop the ""F's"", Fo-red, 
Or Mary, Mary, drop the ""M's"", Mo-ary.
That's the only rule that is contrary.
 
And then I say ""Bo"" add a ""B"" then I say the name.
Then ""Bo-na-na fanna"" and ""fo""
And then I say the name again with an """"f"" very plain,
Then  ""fee fi"" and a ""mo""
And then I say the name again with an ""M"" this time.

A dime piece nigga chicks catfight for
My gat strike war begin on the blocks
And got words with any army member or cop
I'll send 'em a shot 'cause cult VI cats'll attack
We hit the block til' we can build a castle with crack
No hasslin black I'm mad 'cause rappers is wack
Don't mind us culture subtractin' ya' stacks

Prepared for beef there's no peace of mind some
Believe the Desert E's relieves the problems
And if that's the case then let's get it poppin'
Juganot killin' 'em breakin' 'em off proper
The next big thing since Pun And Big Poppa
So big when I walk in a room it gets darker
I'm soon to be a household name just like Martha
Stewart and Bill Cosby and Bob Barker
The crew is Culture VI and type bonkers
Juganot tougher than Tonka the monster
Eatin' the tracks alive divide and conquer

Wanted for murder what'd you do? I done killed another beat
Ash that before you pass that what is you doin'?
Throw some spit on the tip of the spliff prevent the canoeing

Let's be realistic I ain't feelin' them they too simplistic
I'll subtract you and add somethin' different listen

colossal crews are crumblin' mumblin' mouths is runnin' and
No matter how you look at it nothin' amounts to nothin' and
Not a lot of rhymers want to try to put on a facade of maraudin'

Gotta barrage of marksman as large as the Partridge
Rippin' bone flesh and arteries discardin' the carcass
Part of the squad is heartless and parts obnoxious
Throwin' fists to the sky knockin' gods unconscious

I ain't the barber shop I can still get you clipped
Got a gauge behind the stove keep a tool in the room
Niggaz had you up north washin' Fruit of the Looms
Dirty underwear cleaner comin' home try'na act meaner
Ya' nickname in Attica was Tina
Try'na act tough'll only leave ya' eye crooked
Gimme the crack and tell ya' boss I took it
Titanium vest up under the shirt pussy
I see that maxi pad under your skirt
Don't try to hide your dress get hit with 25 or less
Have the surgeons inside your chest

You Know it be P V itchy to bang when I'm venting my steam
'cause all I shoot is my age and I M-16
If you rappin' and you heard me and you happen to disturb me
Quick to react with the mack and turn your jacket to a jersey
And just to get smacked or clapped you know it's no prob
With recliner gats that kick back and take a load off
So chill out you want war ofcourse it's a certainty
With chainsaws to take your brain off in gang surgery

Ya'll rookie ass niggaz I'm ripping these lames fuck this
With your wack I need to get in the game punches
Pollutin' these faggots put two in these rappers
The emcee Spielberg when I'm shootin' these actors
Bet a knife can make a pool of blood rise from your flesh
Makin' it easier for these bullets to dive in your chest
Killin' niggaz with a dirty weapon
Keep talkin' we can fight and shoot the fair one plus 37
Ya' boy sick I don't want to breath on ya'
So please leave 'fore the snub nose sneeze on ya'
You can do a bid for a kid for a crime
And you still couldn't serve a fuckin' sentence of mines

In this rap tracks get to a point I touch danger

Peep often see me the heats all sick
You'll see coffins beat off ya' see 4 bricks

I keep my palm on an appliance in case I get warned by the sirens

Ever since I've been sort of a tyrant
Gargamel ? had ?em sparkin' els for they lost men and orphans
And I spit too sick for walkmans and all that tough shit you talkin'? Shit
I should send you my hollow tips 'cause they rip through organs

You're prob'ly like me try'na gain control of life
But sometime it takes over that's when I grab a gun and just think
Yo' fuck life man I'm under the brink
Music escapes a parasite chooses his fate
Prior to gunfights you sign ya' will as soon as it breaks
And this is real I want rendezvous spots and prize money
Not lethal injection which manifest the equal intentions
Of them grime thunnys holdin down ya' local street block
That gave the notion of commotion cities open detox
The cleansing begins without trees the most paranoid yo'
Inflictin' in situations that most can't avoid
For sure caps have backfired bodies been caught
Quarterbacks is necropheliacs when shotties get cocked
And once ya' shit is cocked pull it
'cause if not you might see yourself goin' crazy
Thinkin' you can use your back to block bullets

Yo it's the main cause of niggaz depictin' this came wrong
With a spliff it don't take long to commence to a brain war Sonny
High when I'm writin' this shit like the sky
When it's lightnin' and thunderin' now my mind could adjust it
Public and toxic and seein' life in different degrees
If I want it I got it especially when hittin' this green
I ain't even gotta struggle my rappin' is kind of puzzled
Hard to get a grip chief smoke relaxin' my muscle
Sober niggaz hold it down I keep my actions above you
Below the ground I blow a pound and be excited as shit
It never occurred to me gettin' pissed and mad at the world
Could be a criminal with hot hands and nines in his grip
Not blamin' pitiful cats for the lame excuse for the packin' of tools
Open you up like a surgeon occupation nigga

Maaaaaan you shouldn't give a fuck got some guns load 'em in the pick up truck
call ya' mans pick 'em up get the dutch
Spics and niggaz collide but where our mental is aimed?
Doing drive-by's in rentals with James
Or whatever his nickname is 'cause when inhalin' smoke
Comin' down's like fuck it I'm never gon' get famous
For better livin' yeah and my patience is broke
It seems as if my better livin' goes away with the smoke

Where oh where is my sun
Why must it hide

It seemed as if to fly to the sun
Where a woman with a funny face
Juggled two big silverballs
Of sadness there's no trace
She smiled at me

I had a dream of two silverballs

Guiding me to felicity

Happy I seemed
But it was just a dream

See all people holding my
Silver fortune balls
Throwing them at me to catch
I jump high can't reach them yet
My fortune passes by

I woke up late but stayed in bed
Another silverball rolled past my head
Please let me catch just once this ball
I know I'll be alright if I hold it tight

Cumberland Blues,"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my Shield and Portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, Who called me here below,
Will be forever mine.

When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun.",Amazing Grace,2004

Abraham Lincoln, November 19th 1863

My Country, 'tis of thee, 
Sweet land of liberty, 
Of thee I sing. 
Land where my fathers died, 
Land of the pilgrim's pride, 
From every mountainside 
Let freedom ring. 

My native country, thee, 
Land of the noble free, 
Thy name I love. 
I love thy rocks and rills, 
Thy woods and templed hills; 
My heart with rapture fills 
Like that above. 

Let music swell the breeze, 
And ring from all the trees 
Sweet freedom's song. 
Let mortal tongues awake; 
Let all that breathe partake; 
Let rocks their silence break, 
The sound prolong. 

Our fathers' God, to Thee, 
Author of liberty, 
To Thee we sing. 
Long may our land be bright 
With freedom's holy light; 
Protect us by Thy might, 
Great God, our King! A-men. 
One verse, crossed out by Smith in original manuscripts, is generally omitted. Originally the third verse, it reads:

No more shall tyrants here 
With haughty steps appear 
And soldier bands. 
No more shall tyrants dread 
Above the patriot dead; 
No more our blood be shed 
By alien hands.

Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band

But I was nearly crazy
And I was clearly crazy

[Deacon the Villain]
On I-85 North, going nowhere
Would hit the 400, but I ain't got money for the toll there
Traffic backed up ahead of me, I see the road flares
School bus on my right, kids laughin' with brown and gold hair
Replaying conversations in my head by my ex-wife
From the house work that I did, to the kids, even our sex life
She said I was crazy so I threatened to prove her dead-right
So she got court orders, restraining me, put on the red lights
Frustrated, thinking how the fuck could I clean it up
Traffic stopped, about 1000 degrees in my truck
Loosened my tie, wiped the sweat out of my eyes, mixed with tears
Mind thick with fears, I've lost everything that I done built for years
Bright yellow school bus fucking up my limbo
Kids bitchin', cussin', flickin' boogers upon my window
Start rolling it down for some air and the handle breaks
Kick my door open, dive out, feeling some escape

""We said vows and shit, that shits' for life right?!
Yeah, that shit's until death, death...
That shit can be mended
But that bitch don't be listening to me!
She'll prolly throw a fucking fit and shit!
I'ma go there that bitch is gonna listen to me
She'll see I'ma fix this shit, FUCK THAT!""

[White man in the background]: ""Move your fucking car, maaaaan!!""

Motherfucker is my own car really haulting movement
I got some powerful shit in my trunk want me to use it?
I grabbed that shit, cocked it now talk like you're silly!
If you needed some release would I fuck with you, Billy?
""Look away lady, before I swiss cheese your Mazda""
Am I crazy for wanting my babies to have a father!
Gonna show my bitch of a wife she better work a little harder
Stop them kids from screaming, it's pushing me even farther!
It's my daughter's birthday, Billy, you like this gift?
Your name's not Billy? Really? Then why do you react to it?
If you're an actor, am I your fuckin' audience?

Today's about to be one of the biggest days of my life
'Cause I'm about to ask the women I love if she'll be my wife
I just know that she will, for this women, I'll KILL
I used to clean dishes at Micky D's, now I'm on GRILL
So I've been able to save up enough money for this necklace
Along with this ring for when I pop the big question
But my manager's been stressin' the way I been dressin'
Tellin' me I need new shoes but I can't afford to get them!
He's all about perfection and does shit that I hate!
Today he wrote me up and I was only five minutes late!
And then he threatened to take me off grill and make me scrub plates
And the toilet where people shit out all the food they just ate!
AW FUCK! I'm starting to hear my screws bust
Screw it, I'll do it, He gives me Windex and a toothbrush
Now I'm scrubbin the toilet like, FUCK MY BOSS and HE STINKS!
I'm asking my girl to marry me, fuck what everyone thinks
Let me look at the ring now to calm me down like my shrink
NOOOOOO! I JUST LOST IT AND NOW IT'S LOST IN THE SINK

I want to ask her but without the ring what'll I do?

And make her face look like Barbecue sauce.

And spit it out the drive through window inside a pinto and leave the driver

Start to hear sirens whistle I've lost my mind, it's official!
Grab my manager's pencil and stick it in his eye tissue
For having a time issue go to the bathroom and try to kick through
The sink. I made a mess and shot cops. Let off a couple of pop pops
ON THE CLOCK let me go before the alarm stops

The saddest thing I ever learned is relationships don't last
Or maybe I just feel that way cause of my past
Bad memories get to me when I drink mad Hennessey
feeling cold and alone even when I got mad friends with me
I'll still see something that reminds me of her
I got so used to her that without her my mind is a blur
She found somebody quick. I won't find another for a while
She was about to be my wife and mother of my child
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged
and the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange
like everything's changed and suddenly you don't trust her just the same
then you find out some other man's been fuckin out her brains
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain
so much that you can feel it in your veins and you can't forget her name
That's when you Literally go insane
and you feel like you're so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says

I'll never understand how a girl can say she loves a man
and turn around and have sex with another man
I would have much rather been robbed for a hundred grand
than to get interrupted and get a call that she's touching hands
with another man. Oh God! Another man!
I can't even cry. My tears been dry. That's why it's thundering
hard out tonight and it's dark and it's cold
Cause the angels can hear me cry, and it's all in my soul
and all of them know I've never felt this pain in my past
And it's ironic the first place we made love's the same as the last
In the shower ... that's why I put the rain with her name
And my power to trust someone again has faded away
Other girls want me? Tell em it looks like rain today
I wallow in my sorrow, smoke, and watch tapes that we made
And one of them tapes is the day I got played like games in arcades
The day I almost gave up everything that I gained
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged
and the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange
like everything's changed and suddenly it's on tape and you crumble
cause you notice on the tape she doesn't kiss you, she just fucks you
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain

Build yourself some protection to avoid the injection

Designed to satisfy your soul
And underneath your broken dreams
You need to satisfy your soul

Now I can see the sorrow in your eyes

Too fat, too thin, you lose or you win
This may come as some surprise
Too tall, too short, too loose or too taut

Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to me

Everybody I met (everybody I met)
Seemed to be a rank stranger (seemed to be a rank stranger)
No mother nor dad (no mother or dad)
Not a friend could I see (not a friend could I see)
They knew not my name (they knew not my name)
And I knew not their faces (and I knew not their faces)
I found they were all (I found they were all)

Curley Ray Cline,"Nobody's love is like mine
   No one so faithful and kind
   Love that is true as the ocean
   But nobody's love is like mine

They tell me that you've found another
And now you'll be going far away
Why have you left me little darling
I love you both night and day

I guess now I'll just go on dreaming
And wondering why it couldn't be
Some day little darling you'll be sorry
For the way you treated me
",Nobody's Love Is Like Mine,1996
Curley Ray Cline,"I got a pig at home in a pen;
Corn to feed 'Em on
All I need's a pretty little girl
To feed 'Em when I'm gone.

Goin' on the mountain
To sow a little cane
Raise a barrel of Sorghum,
To sweeten ol' Liza Jane.

Yonder comes that gal of mine,
How do you think I know
I know by that gingham gown,
Hanging down so low.

Dark cloud's arisin'
Surely a sign of rain
Get your gray bonnet on
Little Liza Jane.

Bake them biscuits, lady
Bake 'em good n' brown
When you get them biscuits baked
We're Alabamy bound.

When she sees me comin'
She wrings her hands and cries
Yonder comes the sweetest boy
That ever lived or died.

Now, when she sees me leavin'
She wrings her hands and cries
Yonder goes the meanest boy
That ever lived or died",Pig in a Pen,1996
Curley Ray Cline,"If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl, I love the best

If I had listened to what Mama said
I would not have been here today
A lyin' around this old jailhouse
Just weepin' my sweet life away

If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl, I love the best

She caused me to weep, she caused me to mourn
She caused me to leave my home
Oh, those lonesome pines and those good ol' times
I'm on my way back home

I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl, I love the best",Roll in My Sweet Baby's Arms,1996
Curley Russell,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Now's the Time,2012

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Now's the Time,1988

Curly Russell,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1999

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Show my other niggas they can get it too, no giving up
Safe house a couple hundred thousand now, keep picking up
Gasoline can't get no louder that kicking your ear drums
Got some slappers from 808 Mafia, you should go get you some
Depend on how your budget run, how fast your money come
Life in New Orleans, my nigga I gotta stunt
We tryna run up on some type of shit that my niggas be waiting on
Organization is taking for 'em
Bitches be bringing the paper for 'em
Rolling their weed and paper for 'em
Journal entries I read aloud
Them record labels keep paying for 'em
Thirty minutes got a plane to board
To the airport in a racing car
Charge it to the nigga playing card
Momma praying for me, oh Lord

I could move a boulder through a Boost Mobile
You could get it do if you do it how I showed you
In presence of pressure, keep your composure
Stand tall soldier, you'll ball before it's all over
(Fuck waiting baby, get your paper
Fuck bitches, won't stack your riches
If they don't see you, make 'em hear about you
And when you see 'em, make those fuckers feel you)

Need no permission to start a war
What's in the paper can start a car
They caught the vapors from chasing stars
Drop top, park chevy's off
Sauce dog 'em out, like they fucking golf carts
Burn they mouth on the basketball court
What it's all for, what it's all for
From a fan nigga 'cause I'm all heart
On the top floor at the Waldorf
Nigga dumb fresh but I'm too smart
To slip up with niggas and get caught
What you looking at is a real boss
Got a line of niggas that'll kill for him
But it's all good 'cause I'm too high
Tryna come up with another five million
Build a building me so we can hide in it
To the ceiling, money piling in it
No miles on it, windows now tinted
Hot Spitta in a 560 Benz, high vintage shit, fly isn’t it
I could show you how I done it, start a company and run it
Hustle that you put in to, you can pulls more than double from it

I could move a boulder through a Boost Mobile
You could get it do if you do it how I showed you
In presence of pressure, keep your composure
Stand tall soldier, you'll ball before it's all over

Give me my money, it just keep calling

Never knowing that the plan was to pass 'em like back then

And luckily I was the cutest guy, it wasn't no problem
I wonder if she knew that boy grew up to had to act right
I wonder if she knew that boy grew up to live that rap life
Ain't as rich as I wanna and can still loan her something
Ain't these bitches for everybody that be on to something?
Ain't everybody that's onto something live a lonely struggle?

It's just me and my homies, invite only
We don't need your input shorty
We want money, we don't want fame
I don't need your outlook on me

I'm just pimping while my side bitch watching
God bless the real, death to all the phonies
It's my party, invite only
 
Pardon me partner, I'm too busy staying polished
Meanwhile my conscience telling me I'm too modest
I let you niggas think that I was slipping 'cause of the singing and positivity
Well that ain't right
See I'm still that same mamma fucker 
That will have your baby mama sending confirmation numbers for them flights
See y'all do it on say and we do it on sight
And we in it for life then y'all in it for likes
That's why I'm in it for keeps and y'all barely keeping up
I should put y'all on my will, most y'all niggas is my kids
Wonder how your daddy feel to know his baby boy ain't his
Wonder why yo mom ain't tell him what it was from the beginning
So it's back to the cheese, like wipe that smile off yo face

Three ounces in the ziplock

Bought the Ferrari drizzop, the city's streets is hizzot
The A/C on full blast chilling as I roll pass
Only dope we slang as long as supplies last
Though I never run out, we got stacks to gain
All the antics and thangs and gun cabinets they hang
In case you try to bring it and assuming we can't hang
We assemble quickly, dismantle your whole gang
Proceed to board the plane, the pilot's my main man
So it's nothing to us living like the Gold Rush
I once rode the bus but now I drive a Rolls
Pull up to my tour bus pick up bags on a roll
What you know about slanging your lyrics like dope
Real shit they pay me for so you never see me broke
Understand what you niggas getting, a little culture from two of coldest ones living

Hangin' on every second of the moment

And for those that miss me I'll be back don't trip

When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke 
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go 

Young nigga that's more famous than these older niggas 
Young nigga got my game up from these older niggas 
Motherfuckas hear my name, I say I told you nigga 
I was taught to count my paper 'fore I fold it nigga 
Now look at my chains, all them things frozen nigga 
Rolling up my Mary Jane before I smoke it wit ya 
Hit this J, I bet this be a day you don't remember 
Looking at the top and I don't see not one contender
Cooking out the pot, I like my weed for lunch and dinner 
Got some cookies in the jar, OG in the blender 
You paying for quantity, but quality is what you spend for 
If there's a marijuana-ology, I'll be your mentor 
And all about this chronic leaf is what in for 
So give your parents my apology for me again or 
Get high like we Cheech and Chong 
We gon' eat some brownies, we gon' smoke, we gon' need some bongs 
Roll up so we can all

Laid out, plush couch, flat screen television 
Table full of vegetation so you just might stun a nigga

Give me some, now give her some 
It's big Mac, I love to have fun 
You are, you are the one 
If you get it or do it, then it'll be just like 2 on 1 
Break it down, lay it down 
Baby work that body like 
At the pad, acting bad 
Baby what that party like? 
Moving so schizophrenic 
Baby pull down your panties 
Let the Doggy Dog ram it 
I cram to undertsand it 
Back room that's my bedroom 
Make her right up in it 
Close the door, slow ?
I'm 'bout to slide up in it 
Smoke something

Having money and blowing hella' chronic 
Smoke I'm stunting 
Cutlass on them chrome spokes with the engine running 
Sounding like a dinosaur if the stomach rumbling 
Your bitch at the window cause she know I'm coming 
She tell you that she 'bout to go jogging and on the corner 
She jump in, take her to the honeycomb 
Stuffing kush ?, playing Megaman 3 
Your Wonderwoman giving dome out Miami 
Said she never leave me 'lone, She wan' have a family 
She just high, tomorrow night, she'll be titties out, dancing 
Trying to leave with the next nigga in a Aston 
So why get caught up 
I'm too swift up on my toes to have my name brought up 
In sewing circles with them hoes

But I keep a loud tool 
Play games you'll be shitting in a pouch fool 
Got stock like Dow do
 
New hardtop 
Off the car lot 
Hit the gas tires smoke like cigar shops 
Make ya jaw drop 
Bought it off the narc cops 
Tax on the work we got them H and R blocks 
Alumni yeah I'm from the school of hard knocks 
Looking out for the twelve Roger Staubach 
No cafe but we had them hard rocks 
For the bread they'll throw you off of dark docks 
So before ya heart stop 
Or the narcs knock 
I gotta give it to you straight like a bar shot 
Cuz the streets don't play fair 
Niggas mad cuz you got more rides than the state fair

Addicts and crack and bases 
My status is cracking faces 
Embarrassing cracking vases 
At the dinner party 
I took no slow classes baby but yes I been retarded 
You see my folks acting crazy like it's in kindergarten 
I'm bringing heat like old ladies when they is menopausing

Yeah 
Been at the lowest of my lows 
That's why I get high hoping no one ever know 
To open up my mind I can show you what I wrote 
Or rather show you how to boat 
And hope that you can live or float 
Independently self made 
And well paid 
Three whips one chain no welt pain 
When you treeing over niggas they gon yell shade 
They outta patience where I live cuz they sell weight 
Avoided the temptation of crack slinging 
But Lincoln park had it looking like back in the eighties 
Now partners getting broads and the hottest whips 
And I was sweating hours trying to get the illest scholarship 
Ain't have a pot to piss 
I wasn't born rich 
When I be writing I'm as hungry as a model bitch 
She got the fattest ass they got the hottest look 
Leaving wit eight bitches I need some octopus 
See how wale go j four cs 
My lake shore whore never be on the bs 
Bullshit chi town 
Riding around 
Top down 
Hanging with the squares will be the reason niggas not around 
What it do 
Penny phones all blue 
Or you could prolly use a nigga drive welcome to my car pool 
Yellow lam g shit 
She double od shit 
Five time foul niggas need to stop reaching 

[Chorus]

High as fuck with my down ass 
Bitch roll to the Porsche from the bus pass 
But got lost when me and the cash crossed paths 
Indo smoke out my nose no mustache 
Bitches I want but that money is a must have 
Fuck is you drunk? 
Pay that up front 
Like the Ferrari trunk 
Be careful you won't 
Have to be sorry hon 
Stay close to the G's and you might learn sum'n 
Might earn sum'n 
Chop it up like mobsters on the rooftop let you burn sum'n 
Stop talking so much 
Soak it up next time you have sum'n to say 
Boss the fuck up 
Butcher knives done died trying to be as sharp as us 
Talking bout you on yo way 
See them niggas downstairs 'fore you talk to us 
By appointments no walk ups

Guess a nigga eating good like whole foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ride wit' me so she pose too
See me and my guys like a plane flown through
Hella high roll up weed up like I'm supposed too
And now I'm into big things
On the building you need to know the tenant rate
Gettin' paid still ridin' no shirt
Let a bitch give me brain call it homework
Niggas try hatin' on 'em but it don't work

Alota shit done change
New clothes new cars new things
Them same boys that used to be at the bottom
Came up that's what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Slow money is just betters gettin' no money

Learn to get good show money, that's yo money
Get comfortable with it, really know money
Rich nigga shit, that really goes for me
Self made nigga, well played
I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade
You tryna copy whats been done, I'm tryna innovate
And club owners getting tired of tryna ventilate
Big mistake
I'm too busy finding places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like ""who is this?""
Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like Independence Day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say
Either you getting paid, or you paying to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way

Alota shit done change
New clothes new cars new things
Them same boys that used to be at the bottom
Came up that's what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Slow money is just betters gettin' no money

Uh, just made a million, got another million on my schedule
The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless
You niggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did
The hatin' was the fuel for this shit
So you wrote your own check ol' hoe ass
Sweatin' bullets at home, wondering if she coming back
Whoadie you was sippin' she can smell it on ya
That's why you only see her when you buying stuff for her
We was sneaking in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena deciding who allowed in it
My windows ain't tinted, pimpin', I ain't trippin'
Had showered that shit, I'm with this ballin' and chillin'
We plotted this out, one night in the city
Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twisting
Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it
Twit-pic'in when we get it and they mad at it
Fuck them niggas

Alota shit done change
New clothes new cars new things
Them same boys that used to be at the bottom
Came up that's what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Slow money is just betters gettin' no money

Lotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes

On second thought, I always had 'em though
But now they look better, and quicker to be down for whatever
Like me, her and her home-girl together
Changing the weather, by the chop of the Cessna Propellers
We landed on the water, the game that I taught her
Got her showing me the Louie that these Duck niggas bought her
Its a game to us, we just hang and fuck
While she swipe your credit card on dispensary pot jars
I'm laid up, calling the front desk, tell them to send the maid up 
While we play the terrace and blaze up
These detailed lyrics is far to intricate to be made up
Not pimping, what you gave her 
Was an inch, she took her foot and kicked you in the ass with it

Then I say a few poems and buy my moms a new home

And all that dirt I did, I still remain without a stain
So I twist it, smoke it by myself, clear my brain

I saw it all but never will I tell a thing
Can't think of one thing to lose, and 'bout a million things to gain
So I charge this to the game
But soon as I got my change, they say I changed maine
They told me state my name, I'm Roddy from the planes maine

Bitches by the dozen, just watch me come up from nothin' hata
Greater things await for those who remain patient
Yeah that's real talk, matter fact a true statement
But still I grind 'cause in the end I want more than Nathan

Smokin' kush, tryna ease them thought with vapors
But my mind stuck on gettin' big faces
Racin' toward the guap, these niggas still chasin'

Sleeping with my shoes on just in case I have
To wake up and be out
Once again it's on
Mama bring my bong to the game room
With nothing but some panties on
And them Bape socks that I gave you
Never was on probation but your man's on his papers
Spendin' 'em, stackin' 'em, feelin' 'em
Wrappin' 'em, lightin' 'em, never passin' 'em

Rockin Adidas flip-flops, and some J-Crew
Argyle socks, now watch them speed bumps
Love don't fuck my rims up
Maybe we'll stick with you, put you on the team official

Changing the weather, by chop of the Cessna propellers
We landed on the water, the game that I taught her
Got her showing me the Louie that these duck niggas bought her
Its a game to us, we just hang and fuck
While she swipe your credit cards on dispensary pot jars
I'm laid up, calling the front desk, tell them to send the maid up
While we play the terrace and blaze up
These detailed lyrics is far to intricate to be made up
Not pimping, what you gave her
Was an inch, she took her foot and kicked you in the ass with it
The famous story of Mike Tyson and Robbin Givens
The biggest niggas get beat senseless by little women
Look at Sam Rothstein, he gave his whole world to Ginger
Even these bosses be slippin, I catch that

Large yacht, fast money, she need a slow cruise
Cigar, Ciroc, her nigga old news
Old money always put me on my new shit
Hermes ahead in my to-do list
Rollin' up loud, take a walk in the clouds
Take a look at my niggas, young, rich and we wild
Ain't no bitches allowed, acting like snitchin' in style
Got this gold on my neck, we teachin' new principles now
Startin' the Lotus, revin' the motors
Walk on the clouds, and I'm second to no one

New cars, new crib, but I ain't a switch
The same old niggas I been wit'
Got this loot together, same ones gon' spend it
Circle of winners baby girl I done brung you in it
No iPhone pictures, you gotta live off memory
Pop the hood I show you the engine
Roll through my old hood, put you up on my history
Smoke joints with my niggas and cash stunts on them bum ass niggas
I don't deal with, with a caught fire now them suckers catchin' feelin's
But they can't reach us

Rosaries in my Rolls Royce, God put me on

I roll up something, nah I don't fuck with the drink
Would have wrote this verse down, but I'm too high to think

Even before I get my pad and my pen
I must have my weed, I grab my bag, then dig in
Mix my shit together so that it's all different kinds of flavors
They think I'm baking pies to distribute to the neighbors, no
I'm smoking weed, that tastes like, kinda cake-like
Bud is getting better, but the price is starting
To skyrocket, so I said fuck it, bought an Aerogarden
So I can get high, smoke big, and break even
No longer have to wait for harvest season
For strictly smoking, why do I have to push
Sitting back with a fat sack of pineapple kush
I wish a motherfucker would try to take my weed
So I take it and I stash the shit, so no one can see
Then I make it safe grab a brew to equalize it
Every day I'm smoking weed, I'm hoping soon they'll legalize it

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

The bud brownies that I ate just kicking in
I got my Jordan Number Eights, black, aqua, and grape
These niggas try'na duplicate the Pilot DNA
Copycats see the big dog comin' and run away
Bitches fall through at the crib and can't get up, they want to stay
I got your old lady in my '88 Z-28
Haze got her dazed, she's stuck, she don't know what to say
I have the best week ever every seven days
In the magazine pictures, so high I might fly off the page
Rap, smoke, fly, drive, do it all with grace
For the Kush, I got a Jones like Grace
I call my house first, cause first is my place, yeah

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me

At the church, funeral services for this beat

Like young thieves outside tryna break in your Z

For your big nose hood and you know them fools man
And I swear that ain't no good, but I'm not surprised

You can tell that she was with daddy, just smell her clothes

In and out of them streets, in and out them freaks
And I didn't hide nothing, from her I was a hundred

With a doctor, a lawyer, someone with a degree
But she wanted no pointers, was happiest with me

Making real jet movements, this lifestyle wild, these hoes attached to it

When in every car I'm smokin'weed
Up in it, I don't know what type of s*** you on
I need at least a zip
Didn't you hear? I say the cars I own are never least a whip
Leather jacket, n**** muscle cars on that greasy s***
And my bandana tied, I play to ride
Live a movie so make sure the camera right
And I'm pullin up and hoppin' out a mess of s*** that young n****s ain't supposed to get
You know I'm rich
Uh!
N**** my whole squad getting it
Practically live on the road
Doing 100 when I'm in this b****
You know n****s kinda slow
A raw paper and some bong weed
That lil n****'s tryna clone me
And labels tryin to make the old me
But I'm the only one and only

Kush god, keep it rollin like the brakes broken
That's a little gram, little man that ain't smokin'
We move this s***, movie s***, I'm in motion
George Kush, second term and I'm still loaded
Yo b**** on me, all over Miami still
I'm in the bay, smokin' on king Kinley
On that YO, retro haze but SP
I don't search for trees, I am OG
Lil n**** yo lungs ain't strong enough to high box regard
You ain't got no ones and you mouth in off
N**** knock it off
N****s is blow
Run we goin down, that's how much we gon' do
But not so much stuff, you have to start my own dude
Big face Rollie, and my mob stay smooth
F***in' b****es, now I'm lookin' like a n**** like you
I'm from Harlem

Hoes where you get that weed from?
Please don't roll another one
I don't even think that's trees son
Bulls***, all this to show you something
Motor running, tank on F
High, I came high off the bed string
I write with my left brain
Haters face get tight when it's set game
And them hoes know the business
Ball tight game for the ones they missin
No book, boy we handle b****es
N**** I rap clothes off yo women
Clothes I smoke, we're all in one city
Gold and chrome, thirteen inches
Bikes on the dashboard, sixteen switches
Car full of fumes, smokin' that fuel
X on in the ashtray of my team
Send a hoe smellin like Chevron theme
You more than whip, expectin you to
Double my money, double the crew
Triple what we smoked yesterday
Then it's 4-20, 24/7

High performance, exhaust systems
Straight bossin, more than often
Nigga I’m always getting it, straight jet livin

Badly in exotics at mafia style dinners

Niggas out they rabid ass mind
Thinkin I ain’t gon try to get as much money as I could make this year
You must be on some hardcore drugs
I’m just flippin through magazines and rollin them raws up
My red cup filtered with gin
That’s my gang and they destined to win
In the Stang and you better spin, give good brain
You should let er in
Leave your cigars, choice already roll I got
Weed in the jar, told you that my life’s the shit
And you gon love it
In the morning I got a polaroid of it
Wake up feeling way better than you ever did
With the nigga that you was with
And now you got the nigga all upset because of it

Looking at these lames being thankful I'm not them

I got it from going hard, I always stay on my job
Wanna get high you should come to my spot then
And smoke with some heavyweight niggas
Jets, Taylor Gang nigga losing's not a option
Now I'm always on the road
And everywhere I go people asking what I'm rocking
I tell em this is next year's fresh and this year's best
And some shit you niggas not in, so quit copyin'

Yeah man
You niggas got it confused, trying to do what the fuck we do
That's not the point
The point is for you to do you

Old, jealous niggas hatin' on us
Bitches is wishin' you'd shut the fuck up
I'm in the position, set my niggas up tough
What the fuck, just jump
Continents I promise it
I could go from bucks to billions in a minute
Made a split second decision

Without even tryin

Uh, the game got a grip, never slip
Could tell by the way I got my hands on it
Started at the bottom but now my money’s so motherfuckin tall I could stand on it
Ain’t just happened homie, I planned on it
You think you better? Don’t just talk bout it, put some grands on it
Sleep in Cali, woke up in France
Harlem, took the life I live
Chose to talk bout it now my fans on it
Now it’s Dior all on my pants homie, don’t know where I’m goin
My schedule full so I can’t call it
So much weed, you see all them grams fallin
Rollin so much up that my fingers startin to cramp on me
Hear you talkin bout what I am
On top of that shit you sayin you gotta say rich as fuck when you mention us
I get a hold of the bummest and I twist it up
Them Cadillac’s in Atlanta front just to pick us up

Oh please, won’t you put me at ease?
I’m chilling inside
My feelings tied
How will I know this is real?
Usually I end up
Foolishly I end up
Give it all the love I own

Was just another day
You weren’t even fun

Cartoons and cereal
A coup with 0 miles and oatmeal interior
These chicks digging my style, I’m sensei in the superior
To whatever you doin right now
And whatever you plan to get into
I’m just clackin my mouth
On the road to these riches
These hoes waving and flading
But I don’t pay em no attention
I’m all about my empire
We just tryin to get bigger
We want the plan inside us
These snakes tryna get with us
They lookin for the co-sign
But a real nigga don’t give a fuck
I’m too busy getting high
You can hitch a ride on another truck
Now excuse me as I kiss the sky
Peace signs to baby girl before she try to kiss me blah
She miss me like the sun in her eyes
Can’t catch a butterfly
Kush castles in the sky
The only hason is when I smash and go she wanna cry
I get dressed, she wonder where I’m going or why
Can’t deal with that

So don’t choose
I can’t stand to be hurt again
If you flow it’s just today
Then smoke and walk away
But please don’t tease
Oh please, won’t you put me at ease?

Oh please
Won’t you set me at ease?
Please
Oh please
Please, won’t you put me at ease?
Won’t you set me at ease?

Ever since my old crib splittin ounces
Go ahead from Chinese fool to flights unwinding
A 2 week cruise excursion, far from the madness, splurging
Learned about school but getting sting ray sea earchents

I’m gonna push through

Turbo charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can’t say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, I’m the Transporter

I’m already on some whole other, word to yo muhfuckin self
Nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
‘Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain’t bluffing

I beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I’m on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements, never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em

The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya

Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in-
To society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing by my luck is bent
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga

My son grow up without having to see half of the stuff I've been through
But in life we all got our own path
Don't understand that by now you won't begin to
Cop another Rolex or Porsche try and get even with me
Pulled up to the club, swear it looked like the dealer with me
Cause we had so many cars it was stupid
So I don't see a reason to try and reason with me
Made a couple million and fast too

Soon as I stepped off the plane
Switchin' four lanes like Jay and Jermaine
Killin' beats, visitin' grave sites and pissin' champagne
I been in the crib enjoying my hobbies
Suckers figured this'll be the perfect time to try me
Try me
Assumptions that I'm lunchin', gettin' sloppy
I'm just gettin' better, seasoned veteran
Eagle eye perspective, scope before I go in
Come out with the whole hen
A dollar and a dream
Have a house on the hill and the world on a screen

Gas in the tank, Top rank
About the K, we don't use brakes
Too blazed, pilots say we can't get on the plane
No debates, pounds are putting on, I'm making weight
Money saved, put it in there for rainy days
Niggas hate, don't fuck with them anyway 
I hustle too many ways to get comfortable
You know how I'm coming
Call your girls let's get into something
Money dicussion, take my time, I ain't rushing
What's the one you could trusting
Me, I'm a thug, ain't get up in the dust

Big money ended up countin' me out
Buryin' safes with undisclosed amounts
They all over the place, plus I fuck with the banks
I got a couple accounts, she got a million dollar mouth
She was born with it, she went to Dr. Miami for the rest of the shit
Stacked out renegade on the Vegas Strip
But she paid me for the gain that I gave the bitch
A level headed gentleman with a crazy wrist
Boss player, thirty points plus twenty assists
I'm not selfish, I throw all my niggas in the mink, don't cuff none
Introduce my homie to the bitch if she want some
She could come through get done, spend money, bang bitches
But I don't love one
Hustle 'til the cars come, Ferrari, drive out run
Pull up, hop out, car stunts I've done, L

Large amount of money, guarded vaults 'cause we stars
Chase paper smoke strong
All my bitches get along, well informed

Cut your phone off, hit you in the morn', city born

Hit me up-up, yup yup

Diamond rings, diamond chains
Diamonds on everything
Been some corners, droppin' change
Hop on to a private plane
Pay the cost to be the boss
Now I need some time to floss
I hear'em, don't believe them tho
Paper right just get and go
Making conversations, problem facing
Not them niggas 'round the way
I keep a nice long jacket no police so I'ma blaze it
I'm taking niggas out the waste
Always rolling up my killa tryna get another million in my safe

Said they'd be there when you need 'em
But I just don't see 'em where's the love
And if you down for me, I'll be right there
When you need me, hit me up
Said they'd be there when you need 'em
But I just don't see 'em where's the love
And if you down for me, I'll be right there
When you need me, hit me up

Couple bands, pop it
Got a couple chains, options
Looks like rain drops in every ring that I'm rocking
Niggas want me falling off but nigga we ain't stopping
Always hit the mark, 'cause I know how to stay popping
Now they stare, mind is clear
I seen yours, mine is rare
Money long, I don't care
Blowing strong, diamond share
When I'm home, I'm the mayor
Rims gold like a player
Really cold rocking carats

Said they'd be there when you need 'em
But I just don't see 'em where's the love
And if you down for me, I'll be right there
When you need me, hit me up

CurrenSy The Hot Spitter,"Tru Records exclusive, Curren$y Da Hott Spitta & XL
Action packed nigga get your cassettes ready
It's about to go down like this here

Uh, uh, these niggas keep hatin', that ain't right though
I'ma throw it down like this here

Now I ain't trying to take over the game
I'm just trying to get a Range Rover and a couple of chains
I got a X-ed out college bitch giving me brains
Gave her my e-mail address and an alias name
And they tell me take it easy but I can't help it
I want more green than the Boston Celtics
Let a true nigga breathe don't be selfish
Bet on hot spitta competition getting dealt wit
Hollerin' bout you totin' guns
But I see you with no straps like low-top Air Force Ones
And you hollerin' bout money ain't got no funds
And you rappin' on beats using pots for ya drums
And you'll never see me with ya bitch
Oh I got the hoe with me, you just can't see through the tint
And I'm beggin' ya dog please don't quit rappin'
If you quit rappin' I quit laughin'

[Chorus: x2]
Don't want to see us with no paper ha (that ain't right)
Don't want to see us niggas make it ha (that ain't right)
I ain't gon call you a hater dog ('cause that ain't nice)
Just let a nigga breathe in the game aight

I got a flat so I had to leave the V in the garage
And X see the bar on his Bentley ??
Headin' to the spa for a weekly massage
Me, ya lady, and ya sister do minage trios
And I just copped two Porsches
And the dashboard got more wood than the Evergreen Forest
 
Pull up on the block, two glocks two torches
Shorty too hot like papa bear's poridge
Talkin' bout you pop caps to wet me
The only cap you pop is off a bottle of Pepsi
I got enough waves for you to ride on jet skis
And fuck a bodyguard I let the tech protect me
Hell in a black end male with white break lights
Known for spittin raps out like that on tapes right
Say you got skills ha bitch keep frontin'
And I'll carve ya face up like a Halloween Pumpkin

[Chorus]

I guess I ain't supposed to spit
You probably want me locked off in the back so you can hush my shit
You probably thinkin' is see wrong for this
But XL ain't just a name known for production and shit
If ain't nothing else, I'm never ya bitch
Lyrically I'm hot, like the different color paint on my six
And if y'all really ain't on my shit, it's cool
'Cause that ain't right
I guess I know you better than me
You probably a pimp who get the pussy wetter than me
You probably a thug with more ice and cheddar than me
Fuck that if i was you I'd be better than me
Ya bitch you, you better be better than me
You're probably right, that ain't right
Naw dog, not on your life
You're better off trying to fuck with a dike
If you smart why you sound so dumb on the mic
You can't fuck with my beats let alone what I write
My click, or the fact that we tight
It ain't us, y'all ain't doin' it right
I ruined it right
A producer that ruined your life
Aw fuck it they done gave me a mic

Current 93,"Through the marshes
And through the flittering glades
Through the corn
And through the scything fields
The summer sun
She dances and rages
The summer sun
Flies burning into the light

Who will die for the death of the corn?
And who shall cry at the death of the corn?
Rise rise rise

The sleeping giant awakes
He circles into circling
The wild wild hunt
Dawn dies at dusk
And dolly banners are raised
For the death of the corn
They're sealed and shining
With the true love knot

And who will cry for the death of the corn?
And who shall lie at the death of the corn?
Rise rise rise

Shifting the shapes
That bleed the mountains
You tear apart my body
Though the corn king dies
He dies has died
And dying still
He shall rise again
And sink back into earth

And who shall cry at the death of the corn?
And who shall lie at the death of the corn?
Rise rise rise

Rise rise rise
Rise rise rise

The true love knot is found at the death of the corn
The true love knot is crowned at the death of the corn

Current 93,"Horses are riding into her arms
She lost her own way years ago
Her sister calls her from the far side of night
And she falls with that call

It's the only way out
She tells me I love you
But it's only a game
So she slides through the silence
She's fixing her time
To fall back into darkness
Again with a smile
Don't touch me I'm falling
She laughs in the night
Don't touch me I shall return
When the wheel comes around
You see we're all born to suffer
We're all born to fall
In a grey-shaded world
That calls us to zero

Her mother's mouth slits
Her father lies taken
She touches my body
But I crouch up to die
Down the ramblas we're walking
In Reykjavik we're talking
The snow is moon-cold
The roof freezes over
She's reading a book
She finished it years ago
She's tearing up paper
She's tearing up life
But she only starts thinking
When her blood is brown

Gold is the colour she promised me she'd wear
But Christ's blood turns black
His body she bears
When she dips him in waters
Confession of faith
It's hard to believe you
When you spit in my face
And I don't want to touch you
I don't want to lie
In the brown red gold slumber
That you've taken to ride

I remember I was thinking
Only of you
But you shattered me nightly
You broke all your oath
I found myself falling
And there
And there
And then
Through the ruins of this parched life
And the pain of the next one
I said fucking over
All of this is shit
But still the wind calls
Imperium

When you rage at the conqueror you only rage at yourself
When you torture the anointed you torture yourself
And you've listened to Piaf but not to the Christ
So you sparkle for seconds then dissolve into mist
The fog closes in and you think about Crowley
You think it's a game
But the game is just you
When shall you stop hiding in the heart of your night
When the cold trapway beckons
When the cold trapway stops
And Christ I was thinking of your bended arm
It's blue on the inside
It's blue on the outside
You said and then buckled as if you might die
There's no point in living
There's no point in life

And sometimes I hear you at the back of my mind
And a golden door opens but no light appears
There's spit on the bridle and there's blood on the saddle
And you slip in the shit you've shat in yourself
And Christus is Equus and Equus is Lord
And his name flies with fury and the wind cuts through you
You following footsteps that shed by a flower
Then I wanted to hold you but you're destined to fall",Horsey,1997
Current 93,"Long Satan and Babylon are walking
They're talking of fire and of ice
Of the silence that stalks in the forest
And a Christ spun out of the worlds

Long Satan and Babylon are moving
Through a world ripped away from its centre
They shear through the rushes
They follow the night night night night

They want want want want want want
Everything
Long Satan and Babylon are rushing
They are hurtling away
From the centre of things
They are running from the inside

The wind cries full and in them
Cuts through their emptiness
Hoof on stone
Claw against sun
Where to look in an unknown

Where to search in the vast whole
Piggy-back cross oh piggy-black cross
Into the silence thundering
As they only hear the silence

They do not hear the pain
But Christ sees everything
The little children are falling
They'll topple till the end of the world

Through a universe empty of sound
Though the world makes dark shadows
You must look in your heart
In the dark
You must look in your heart",The Descent of Long Satan and Babylon,1999
Current 93,"The empty streets
The songs of twilight
The clouds at rest
The church bells chiming
A scarecrow shudders
And some birds tremble
I looked at you and saw it's time

The faded flowers
The faded pictures
Of faded lives
Your body waiting
And unfulfilled
With no regrets
And empty heart
And head in hands
I heard them say today it's time

The sunset heavy
On mother mountain
The cattle lowing
The cattle dreaming
The endless rain
In haunted airs
Your loss of hope
We were shown
We were shown it's only time

The smell of rain
The twilight leaning
Against your lips
Waterwheels turning
The forests brooding
You took my hand
And pointed full of pain
That fishes dying
You see the sign that this was time

I waited years for you
Or so it seemed
And stumbled through your world
Praying for just one kiss
To stop my fall from grace
And shelter in your palm
You gave me everything
Both lock and key
The oil clouds see it's only time

If I could have one wish
As in the fairy tales
I would unmake my past
And rise like Lazarus
And stand in sunlight
And banish all the dark
That locked my face away
And say to you again
Oh that
That was only time

So willow weep not for me
And oak bend not for me
Though others died for us
And in our place
Though in the secret heart
Raw wound, raw source of all
I heard the news today
Whispered in the dark
At last
At last we know it's time

I knew at last it's only time
I'll come in glory

Was I binding cats with kindness and saws?

And the brave boys pass by
In brave pontoons
And mark graves
With pebbles that sink and shriek jingles

Or your slowboat? Were the paperweights
Calling you to statis? Or murder?
Was your soul at KostKutters or Kwiksavers?

Blick, völlig bekifft, dicht mit Shit spür ich die Schmerzen nicht. 
Erinner, mich an damals in Deinem Zimmer
Ich war das erste Mal da, da war schon klar ich bleib für immer. 
An der Wand handgemalte Bilder, von Dir in Schwarz und Silber, 
Deine Bewegung im Ballett wird im Bett noch wilder. 
Hab' Phantasien nur beim bloßen Ansehen, 
Du duftest angenehm, scheiß aufs Telefon 
denn ich will heut nicht rangehen. 
Auf dem Kalender steht Dezember, wir schlendern
Durch die Innenstadt, auf Geschenkejagd 
und was man sonst so macht.
Glühwein rein, denn mir soll warm sein, 
doch auch um mein Herz, und darum
Soll mein Baby fest in meinen Armen bleiben. 
Ich sah kein anderes Mädchen an, 
nur für Dich hab ich den Lippenstift gekauft, 
Dir geschenkt, ich hoff' Du trägst ihn auch. 
Nur Du auf meinem Schoss, wir leben zeitlos. War schön
Gedacht, doch nach 'nem Monat ging der Scheiß los.

Kann man jemanden brauchen und ihn deswegen verlassen?
Kann man immer wieder lügen um die Wahrheit zu sagen?

Den ersten Orgasmus in Deinem Leben hab ich Dir gegeben, neben Reisen nach
New York und Paris. Während Du schliefst war ich wach und hab mein Baby
Bewacht in der schwarzen Nacht, gelacht über Streit, gedacht an ewiges
Leben zu zweit. Ich blindes Arschloch
Deine Spielchen fehlen mir gerad'
Noch! Der Rat von Friends war von Beginn an
Lass das Mädel hängen! Gemeinsam
Ausgehen war Horror, denn nach einmal umdrehen, seh ich Dich rumstehen, mit
Typen die Dir unters Hemd gehen. Mal eben fremd gehen war easy denn ich
Merks bestimmt nicht, triffst Dich in Bars mit Typen, küsst sie
Unverbindlich. Austausch von Telefonnummern war typisch. Ich seh Dich dann

Dass du und ich was besonderes seien, viel zu schön zu vergessen
Gott sei Dank kann ich sehen, man kann dich nicht an Worten messen
Es reicht dir nicht zu verletzten, du musst Herzen zerfetzen
Du warst zart zu mir, hast gesagt wie sehr du mich liebst
Dass es niemanden gibt, der dein Herz so versteht wie ich
Und, dass nie jemand anderes in Frage kommt, egal ob der Tag mal kommt
An dem Zweifel erscheinen in dem wir zwei vereint sind, zu stark für Streit
Du hast Treue geschworen und mehr, du hast gesagt du vergibst mir
Du hast gesagt, du wirst da sein, doch als du weg gingst, was blieb mir?
Du hast gesagt, du wirst mich retten und trösten, du wirst mir helfen
Du hast gesagt, du wirst füllen und ersetzen, was ich nicht selbst bin
Du hast geschworen, dass du da bist, in Glück oder Panik
Hast geschworen, du gibst Halt, doch wenn ich fall' spür' ich gar nix

Du hast alles geblockt, darum blieb alles Leid in meinem Kopf
Weil ich's niemand' mitteilen konnt' hab ich's aufgeschrieben und gedroppt
Meine Mum hat sogar geweint, sie hat's gehört und gepeilt
Das im Endeffekt jeden Rhyme, den ich schreib' deinen Namen schreit
Jeden Valentinstag, Geburtstag und Neujahr Blumen und Karten
Trotzdem blieb mir nicht mehr zu tun als unruhig zu warten

Auch ich hab' versprochen bei dir zu sein, aber es nicht gebrochen
Auch wenn's nicht so einfach war wie für dich, versteckt und verkrochen

Doch wenn ich zurück denk seh ich sie lächeln
In guten zeiten anstatt von schlechten.
Ich sprech mit frauen um mich schon an der stimme satt zu essen,
In manchen sätzen die einfach sind liegen krasse schätze.
Deswegen lausch ich wenn die großeletern sprechen,
Und hör auf leise zweifel mehr als auf die großen versprechen.
An vielen ecken der welt fehlt erschreckend geld,
Ich frag mich on uns die indutrie nicht auch zurecht auch für deppen hält,
Wir rauchen tabak doch regen uns auf über abgas,
Saufen uns voll doch achten auf nichts zu essen was fett macht.
Ich schau mir an wie weit gras und becks mich gebracht hat,
Und merk das hat was, manchmal muß man halt weg vom alltag.
Mein alter herr macht es richtig soweit es mich betrifft.
Sicherlich er schuftet such halb zugrunde mann und das trifft mich,
Wir sitzen nachts am kamin doch er unterbricht mich
Fordert mich dann zum schweigen erfüllt das all mit gesang,
Gottes wesen liegt in einfachen dingen,
Bin froh daß beide meiner väter mir zeigen, wie ich goldene zeiten find

chorus

sehnst do dich nach goldenen zeiten?
Wenn sich dein herz meldet folge den zeichen.
Wir tragen's in uns aber wollen nicht begreifen.
Denk nicht dass ich davor gefeit bin.
Wir sehen uns nach goldenen zeiten.
Wenn ich sie götter zeigen, folge den zeichen.
Wann wollen wir begreifen?
Wenn nicht für goldene zeiten,
Wofür sollte ich schreiben?

Zu viele dinge passieren und wir können es nicht ändern,
Doch was viel schlimmer ist dass wir viele sachen passieren lassen,
Firmen bauen waffen, präsindeten investieren und lachen,
Denn wer den wahlkampf finanziert will auch gewinne machen,
Um uns beliebt zu machen sagen und tun wir viele sachen,
Wir beuten aus, heucheln uns raus und würden's wieder machen,
Die wahre last liegt bei denen die probleme sehen doch nichts unternehmen
Denn I'm endeffekt geht's um übereben, so war's wohl damals bei adolf auch
Doch wer weiß das schon, die meisten wollen von gar nichts gewusst haben
In dieser generation, und das ist gar nicht so lang her, genau wie malcolm und
Trotzdem fahren noch schiffe mit sklavenkindern in häfen rum,
Ich les viel toni morrisen und seh den horizont einzig als das was vor mir kommt,
Nicht als das was ich nie bekomm, die liebe kommt aus der seele weil ich's mir eingesteh,
Und trotz der ganzen scheisse die geht noch die goldenen zeiten seh

chrous

all der negative scheiss belastet mich trotzdem hass ich nicht,
Ich lass mich nicht verführen von allüren die wie stars vom himmel stürzen lassen,
Mcees wollen den krieg aber fürchten rache,
Viele wollen viel erzählen aber nichts verstehen als wär's fremde sprache,
Ich konzentrier mich auf mich und das was mir freude gibt,
Der mann der freunde liebt und bewunderungsvoll in die bäume sieht.
Wie kann man schlafen wenn man träume lebt?
Zeih mich zurück und akzeptier pech und glück denn das ist mein neuer weg,
Erwartet nichts ausser das ich leb wenn ich da bin,
Denn den der sich zu weit aus dem fenster lehnt trifft der fahrtwind,
Lass mich konkreter werden ich will nach dem sterben noch leben,
Und keiner von denen sein die schon beim leben sterben

ich war ne ganze weile weg, 2 jahre nose keller,
Und wenn man kinder wachsen sieht vergeht die zeit noch viel schneller,
Denk ich an max als mc: ich hatte goldene zeiten,
Hatte fans und cats die einen um erfolge beneiden,
Doch manchmal fragt das leben: was erwartest do?
Und ich war nicht froh mit dem status quo.
Ich wollt als mensch und als künstler reifen,
Hab mir gewünscht zu reisen,
Dann kam sie und ich konnt nicht anders als mein glück zu greifen.
Um's kurz zu machen, haben nen kind unseren frieden gemacht,
Unsere liebe entsprang ein unbeschriebenen blatt.
Uns es ist wieder mal nacht und ich soll schreiben,
Auf nen unbeschriebenes baltt für goldene zeiten

Ich hör leute sagen ich hätt hip hop verraten
Und hätt keinen flow,
Ich glaub so langsam ihr peilt es noch nicht,
Zeig mir einen mc der so abwechslungsreich
Am mic ist wie ich,
Ich mein so langsam reg ich mich auf,
Ihr denkt, immer wieder wir' war fett,
Doch da leg ich jetzt drauf.
Denn, ey, so langsam bau ich was auf
Was auf mehr beruht als auf beats und raps
Doch da scheiß ich jetzt drauf,
Ich hab jetzt bock zu flowen
Und jeder begreift es,
Jeder der reif ist, und jeder der weiss
Das rap nicht nur texte schreiben
Sondern live ist.
Ihr wollt das beste, das weiß ich
Und darum knecht ich so fleißig,
Vielleicht zerbrech ich mit 30
Doch bis dahin zerfetz ich reichlich von euch
Wenn ihr meint ihr seid es
Obwohl die zeit noch nicht reif ist
Ihr werdet in ciphers schnell ausradiert
Wie zeichnungen mit bleistift,
Ich freestyle vielleicht nicht oft
Doch für dich noch reichlich,
Gib mir 2 wochen zeit,
Ich geh heim und komm und zerfleisch dic,
Ich brauch nur zwei lines für dich
Und jeder weiß das do weich bist,
Ich komm rein und burn und do brauchst
Noch fünf minuten wie deichkind,
Ich mach aus die gleich nen beispiel für alle rapper
Mit leichtsinn die meinen sie können sich
Jetzt leisten auf meine kosten zu scheinen,
Auf mein sprossen zu steigen
Und durch mich fame einzuheimsen,
Ihr wollt dick in den medien sein
Aber den gefallen tu ich keinem,
Tut mir leid ich hab keine zeit
Um mein fame zu teilen
Es sei denn do bist gesigned bei meinem label
Und ich krieg davon 10 prozent.
Da bin ich konsequent, do bist leider extra lau,
Ich bin anders als do,
Denn ich bin leider extra schlau,
Do stehst rum I'm club wie gelähmt
Von deinem extra kraut,
Ich bin anders als do,
Ich bin liebder extra blau,
Ich hab dich schon mal live gesehen
Und es war extra mau,
Denn dein ganzes konzept basiert auf bites von sav,
Ich bin immer ich selbst und schein mit meinem extra flow.
Und egal was ich tu,
Ich mach es immer extra so ,
Do willst das ich nach meiner show noch freestyle, extra so?
Tut mir leid, aber jeder ryme kostet dich extra, so.
Ich chill lieber daheim I'm bett mit meiner extra frau,
Und check ein in fetten hotels wenn ich mal extras brauch,
Ich mach was ich will, kritik,
Da scheiß ich drauf ,
Ich muss bei dir zuhaus aufs klo
Da scheiß ich extra drauf,
Do willst beef, damit ich deinen namen sage,
Extra laut, ist mir klar warum,
Doch darum verzicht ich extra drauf,
Ich zieh mich nur zurück und dann schweig ich's extra aus,
Doch wenn do nächstes mal schläge kriegst hau ich extra drauf,
Ich muss lachen über die kacke die do extra baust.
Ich glaub do brauchst die beachtung, bist darum extra dauf,
Doch scheiß auf battle, ich bin storyteller, extra gut,
Wenn ich will schreib auf kommando con der ex part two,
Do glaubst mir nicht? Dann hör mal zu:
Was ist das nur los mit uns babe,
Do bist gegangen und seit dem spür ich nur noch schmerz.
Do hast nicht nur die koffer mitgenommen,
Doch auch noch mein herz,
Und weißt do überhaupt dass leben
Ohne dich für mich schwer ist?
Ich sitz am fenster und ich starre in den garten da draussen,
Wo wir beide noch gestern saßen
Und kann gar nichts mehr glauben.
Do bist ganz einfach abgehauen und keiner weiß wo do bist . . . .
Ok, das wars nur als beweis,
Ich glaub das reicht von dem shit.
Doch wisst ihr was, ich hab noch was,
Ich kann was das kennt ihr noch nicht,
Was passier wenn ich language switch und die verses auf englisch rip?
That's what it sounds like:
Just a little preview and a soundbite,
Cause kid, I've been rhymin' before the invention of mountain bikes.
I stand on my own, and go alone against your whole camp,
Cause millionair rappers don't make half my sense/cents.
I've got a lyrical genius and sex appeal like a venus,
You get smoked like a chesterfield since y'all don't know what the deal is
Let me explain it:
My aim is to reach high where your brain is and
Massage it with passages out of my rap entertaiment,
I'm rapidly gaining the ground
I need to put up my people,
Keep my plans undercover cause they fail when I'm see-through,
The people laugh when they see you,
Even though you swear you can flow your lp might have some nice beats,
But you're lacking charisma tought,
Und ich sag das einfach mal so, weil's so ist,
Für mich ist es leicht langsam zu flowen oder doubble time zu rhymen,
Für mich ist es gelcih, denn alles real ist die cliyue die euch zeigt was wirklich rippen auf deutsch heißt,
Ich tripple die lyrics zu neuen styles,
Und kick untern gürtel wie muai thai, ihr punks reißt die fresse zu weit auf,
Ihr hört besser gleich auf bevor's knallt ich töt
Und verbuddel euch vorm wald un die bullerei rätselt am vorfall,
Ich bin immer neu wie der urknall,
Wenn do mich mal burnst ist das zufall,
Ich zermetzel euch deppen mit texten
Mein rappen begeistert den globus wie fußball.
""ole ole"" wie sind die champs in der champions league der combos.
Die größten I'm spiel wie mutombo,
Aufeinander gestimmt so wie bongos, auf curse shows ist der punk los,
Kaum geht der erste song los,
Springen chabos und hoes bei phrasen und flows
Mit dem kopf durch die decke wie ponchos,
Wir sind enorm groß, so wie die gonos von chabos in pornos,
Zerquetschen mcees ohne klasse zu formlosen masse
Wie kacke ihr homos, ihr seht was ich kann oder hört was ich kann
Drum erkennt ihr's jetzt anund ihr zweifelt nicht dran,
Ich hab immer den drang immer besser zu sein,
Immer besser zu rhymen, immer besser zu scheinen,
Komm und scheffel den schein ich will rolex mit steinen,
Ich will alles das sein was ihr wollt
Von dem mann der den rap neu erfand
Und es besser verstand als der restlich schmand,
Scharf- wie'n-messer-verstand,
Ganz egal was ihr meint
Ich verarbeit in meinem lyrics was einen aus dem gleichgewicht reißt,
Ich vergleich mich mit keinem ich bin einzig und allein unerreicht
In dem style der das leben beschreibt.

Ich will Chancen geben, nochmal und nochmal wir haben es verdient

Ich atme deine Luft ein wie Chlorophorm
Immer wenn der Druck steigt in meinem Laub
Du bist mein Methadon, Methadon

Und nein, ich hab den Schüttelfrost nicht wegen dir
Sondern weil die Welt so kalt ist
Ich schieb den Affen, weil der Mensch halt einfach durchgeknallt ist
Mein Stress hat nichts damit zu tun, dass du mir heftig fehlst
Ich komm auch ohne dich zurecht, Netflix hilft
Spaß bei Seite, ich find' mein Glück auch von alleine
Doch hab einfach mehr auf meiner Seite, wenn du mich begleitest
Und wenn wir streiten, dann nur weil du mein bestes willst
Medizin kann manchmal bitter sein, wenn sie hilft
Und der Effekt ist die Nebenwirkung des Rezeptes
Doch du hast mich vorgewarnt auf Seite eins des Beipackzettels
Ich war mir deiner Risiken komplett bewusst
Setzte mir den ersten Druck, deine Wirkung war die Wucht
Ich bin druff, doch kann jeder Zeit entscheiden wieder aufzuhören
Kein Problem, ich brauch ihn gar nicht einen Turn
Ich kann schwören, ich bin die nüchternste Person

Curse,"Wir haben uns gefunden
Zwischen ausgetrunkenen Barre-Flaschen
In die wir unser letztes Hasch abaschen
Zwischen Kisten alter Gartenstühle
Und warmer Lagerfeuerglut in der Abendkühle
Schon nach den Silben deiner ersten Worte
War deine Stimme wie Erinnerungen an ferne Orte
Als hätten wir die Weltmeere bereist zusammen
Voller Begeisterung, Paradies und Geisterbahn
Stundenlang Gerede bis der Nebel kam
Bis taue Tropfen Baumkronen veredelt haben
Von Pyramiden und Osiris' Gürtel
Von Luftschächten, die Sternbilder spiegeln würden
Von Alpha bis Omega, unsre Augen waren der Schlüssel zur Galaxis
Reflektiert in unseren Brillengläsern
Wie alte Freunde schon beim ersten Sprechen
Zwei Supernovae die zerberstend aufeinander treffen
Haben geträumt wir können einander retten 
Vor der Einsamkeit nach eins, zwei selbstgedrehten Zigaretten
Nach zwei, drei letzen Bier im Kerzenlicht
Zwei Pfauen leuchten, Regenbogen gleich genährt von Gift
Die Nacht endet, doch wir merken's nicht
Das ist noch mehr für mich, in deiner Tiefe also her damit
Wir waren der Stoff aus dem Legenden sind
Es will nicht in meinen Kopf, dass alles endlich ist

Ich halt Ausschau nach dir
Falls du eines Tages wieder kommst
Hab ich „Vergiss mal nicht“ für dich

Wir haben unser neues Leben zelebriert über alte Beats
Und egal wohin du ziehst um zu studieren, ist es nie so weit entfernt
Dass ein paar Tasten auf dem Telefon nicht reichen
Auch wenn wir wochenlang nicht sprechen, es ist so wie gestern
So fühlt sich echt an, so viele Songs die ich geschrieben hab
Haben wir zusammen erlebt bevor der Text kam
Wir haben die besten der Momente aus der Gegenwart
Ausgeschnitten und gesampelt für den nächsten Part
Doch eines Tages kam der Break
Doch eines Tages kam der Break
Doch eines Tages kam der Break
Doch eines Tages kam der Break
So unterschwellig und so langsam
So leise und verhalten, dass die Schallwellen nicht ankam
Vielleicht haben wir es geahnt als fernes Echo hinter Bergen
Doch wollten es nicht wahr haben, haben es versucht zu verbergen
Die Platte voller Kratzer doch das macht sie so intim
Die Rillen unserer Finger hinterlassen Abdrücke auf ihr
Erst haben wir den Staub sanft entfernt, dann kam das Terpentin
Doch scharfe Worte weg zu wischen hinterließ dann Schlieren
Und dann hab ich getan, als wäre nichts
Und nächstes mal, ein neues Mal gelacht, getan als wäre nichts
Und nächstes mal, ein neues Mal gelacht, getan als wäre nichts
Doch wenn das Lieblingslied beginnt zu zerren, wirds gefährlich

Und eines Tages kam der Break
Und eines Tages kam der Break
Und eines Tages kam der Break
Und eines Tages kam der Break
Ich habe gedacht ich hätte sehr gekämpft
Doch du hast mir gesagt du wünschtest ich hätte mehr gekämpft
Vielleicht war mein Signal zu sehr gehemmt
Vielleicht war deine Schallschutzmauer auch zu sehr gedämmt
So oder so die Platte springt und hängt
Es kommt kein Happy-End mit Gospelsängern im Refrain

Ich halt Ausschau nach dir
Falls du eines Tages wieder kommst

Bis sich die Kollisionsnebel klären

Doch weißt du was? Ich glaub es ist okay für den Moment
Wenn du und ich das Gewicht des Tons an den Seiten schwenken
Ich stell die Platte an den schönsten Ort vor weißen Wänden
Ich lass sie nich mehr los halt sie hoch mit beiden Händen
Und eines Tages wird die Stille enden
Dann legen wir sie auf, drehen laut fangen an zu dancen
Und egal wie ramponiert sie klingt
Sobald wir beginnen zu singen, sitzen wir dann wieder im 
Lagerfeuerlicht, zwischen alten Gartenstühlen 
Trinken Barre, rauchen Gras, bereisen fremde Galaxien
Wir sind der Stoff aus dem Legenden sind
Und jeder DJ weiß es, dass es für jeden Break ein Ende gibt

Egal wohin die Beine schwingen und schauen wie weit sie laufen
Die Himmelsrichtung ganz egal, Hauptsache Richtung Himmel
Hauptsache Richtung Meer, Richtung mehr Selbstbestimmung
Hauptsache nicht mehr wertlos fühlen, ihre Wertungen 
Ins Gesicht gesagt und dann ins Gesicht geschlagen werden
Hauptsache nicht mehr ängstlich warten ob sie explodieren
Und dann schnell verstecken, dass nichts schlimmeres passiert
Hauptsache nicht nur immer still, waschen, putzen, sauber machen
Wenn sie fragen alles sagen sonst hast du das Maul zu halten
Du hast allein geträumt, deinen großen Plan umzusetzen in die Tat
Und eines Tages kam der Tag, nimmst die kleine Jacke deine Reisetaschen unterm Arm
Genug Taschengeld gespart, für eine Strecke mit der Bahn
Nur eine, eine reicht mehr wolltest du nicht fahren
Und nichts als ein Stück gebrochenes Herz lässt du zurück

Das Geld ging für die Bahnfahrt drauf
Was hast du da bloß gemacht
Du warst zu jung um Konsequenzen zu kapieren
Aber nicht zu jung um an dem nassen Wintertag zu frieren
Wind und Regen schlagen dir entgegen ins Gesicht
Doch im Vergleich zu was du sonst kennst, ist das nichts
Und trotzdem wird dir klar, du hast nie nächsten Schritte deines Traums geplant
Obwohl du kein Zuhause hast
Jetzt musst du nach Hause fahren
Und deine Aussicht auf die Freiheit schwindet Schritt für Schritt
Drehst dich noch einmal um, wirfst noch einen letzten Blick
Ja, eines Tages wirst du fliegen aber jetzt noch nicht
Nur ein Stück gebrochenes Herz lässt du zurück

Erinnerungen an damals, fällt dir auch noch heut nicht leicht
Du hast die Einsamkeit nicht ausgesucht, sie kam zu dir
Dann hast du sie umarmt und heute fliegst du um die Welt mit ihr
Verbrennst die Brücken und durchtrennst die Tower
Heut sind deine Flügel stark genug
Du erhebst dich über jede Mauer
Doch was damals war hast du niemals niemand gesagt
Danke, dass du dazu bei mir nicht geschwiegen hast

Die Augen auf, das Handy aus, von innen heraus kommt das Glück
Ich leg die mediale Scheinwelt beiseite
Ich begreife, dass die Scheiße mich nur klein hält
Nur um für ein paar Momente durchzuatmen, meine Waffen durchzuladen
Für den Wahnsinn den der Tag bringt
Denn der Griff zum Telefon ist schon neurotisch
Wir haben ständig Angst das Beste zu versäumen wie ironisch
Wenn das Beste was wir haben das ist was wir in uns tragen
Und genau das verpassen wir beim Gaffen was die anderen machen
Ständig starten wir den Tag damit, uns zu vergleichen
Statt uns zu begreifen, doch nur eins von beiden ist bereichernd
Ich kontrollier nicht diese Welt, doch das was sie mit mir macht
Mein Morgenmuffel transformiert zu Peter Lustig
Ich schalt ab und schaff den Platz für das was wichtig ist
Keine Illusion stattdessen Blick auf das was wirklich ist

Ich habe meine Waffen geschärft

Ich hab viele Sachen entbehrt
Auf dem Weg, aber das wars wert, ah
Ich atme Liebe ein, ich atme Ängste aus
Ich hab alle Waffen die ich brauch
Ich atme Liebe ein, ich atme Ängste aus
Ich hab alle Waffen die ich brauch

Wir haben zwar alles was wir brauchen aber es schon vergessen
Sind auf der Suche nach dem Guten, aber sehen das Schlechte
Alles was noch nicht da ist, alles was wir noch gern hätten
Alles was nicht geklappt hat, alles wo wir nicht perfekt sind
Aber was wäre denn wenn wir unsere Sicht 
Anstatt auf das was uns noch fehlt, auf all das was wir bereits haben lenken
Alles kann anders sein, wenn wir Veränderung anpeilen
Der kranke Geist beginnt zu heilen nach fünf Minuten Dankbarkeit
Ich schreib sie auf und lass sie wirken wie Rasierklingen
Die Negativität durchschneiden und Sicht auf's hier bringen

Ich atme aus, ich atme ein
Meine Welt ist endlich groß, nicht mehr klein
Ich atme aus, ich atme ein
Ich muss endlich nichts mehr tun, ich kann sein

Ich nehm mir meinen Raum beim Meditieren
Halt die Augen auf, schließ die Welt nicht aus
Ich will mich nicht verlieren
Ich will integrieren, alles außen alles innen
Erfahrung ist Erfahrung, Etiketten können nur trennen
Ich erleb nichts esoterisches
Ich sitz nur zwischen Erde und Galaxis
Einfach immer da sein ist die schwerste Praxis
Einfach nicht mehr weg rennen ist die beste Basis
Der größte Feind ist der, der immer da ist
Wir haben zwar alle Waffen die wir brauchen
Doch wir richten sie nach außen
Kein Wunder das wir unser Hamsterrad durchlaufen
Doch manchmal haben wir Platz für das was wichtig ist

Ich bin für die, die Liebe geben auch wenn’s schwer ist im Leben
Ich bin für die die’s erst erleben, dann denken, dann weitergeben

Ich bin für die, die sich Blöße geben, damit wir sehen
Und verstehen dass die echten Weisen in Schwäche zeigen die Größe sehen
Ich bin für die, die uns konfrontieren mit uns selbst
Bin für den der Versprechen hält, bin für den, der beißt wenn er bellt
Ich bin für Menschen die sich angekettet auf Gleise setzen

Ich bin für Nachbarn die helfen, Picknick im Park
Für Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen, Klar bin ich für Peace im Irak

Bittersweet or just desserts?

You'd been a wreck all week.
When it's unbearable,
The more unavailable the world can often seem

Will we claw out our eyes?
Or will we simply close them
And let sleep seep in?

Chicken-scratched some cliched note:
""on the razor's edge"",
""at the end of your rope"",
""the bitter pills you just had to swallow.""

Became the last time we spoke.

Just how desperate the situation was?

But I know that I knew --
Such overstated clues --
You stopped eating, kept drinking,
Stopped showing up for work.
When you're alone, did you utter dying words?

Why'd the bitter end have to come?
Why'd the bitter end have to come for you?

But he's been acting out of sorts; that strange sermon he gave accepting termination due to rape. Jeannie's whispered, ""She's carrying,"" but there's one awful catch: her boyfriend's been off in the desert for half a year.

Cole cried, ""This simply cannot be!""

She quipped, ""Quite the opposite -- I'm hardly the Virgin Mary... and you're no carpenter. So, who will build my home?""

And now those feelings-- I tucked away
Threaten this sanctuary.

A lifetime of burning culminated in one innocent, forbidden touch.

He joined the habit with a chip on his shoulder.

But only flat back drunk on a bottle of Jameson.

Singing our lives, just the two of us.
We were hiding in the dark,
I fell asleep by his side.

We woke to the chimes of the bells in the steeple and ran off to separate rooms.

Or our whole world would come undone.

Running like headless chickens as they reproduce to the womb

no future - no future
No time - no time
No survivors...no, they're all gone

they keep on falling out,
Falling out right in to the dust
Falling out... have a good time while there's still time
Guns are glaring, skies are glaring
When it's all done
They'll be no one left
Sacrifice the world gonna make you a man
If that was in line with the master plan

no future - there's no future
No time - there's no time

unstable hands are ready to explode
The light turns red it's time to overload

no future - no future
No time - no time
No survivors... no, they're all dead

they keep on falling out,
Falling out,
Falling out of line and in to the dust
Falling out, time is turning to rust
Have a good time while there's still time
Guns are glaring, skies are glaring
When it's all done they'll be no one left,
No one
People dyin' mother's cryin'
Last word's smokin' no one's jokin'
Close your eyes and you'll be over
Blow yourself away",Falling Out,1993
Curt D.I.S.S.,"Weapons, weapons, weapons

M-16's and 45's 
They help your country stay alive
They got the guns but we got the trigger
That gun of mine makes me feel a whole lot bigger

Social dogma, you think you're safe
I think I'm losing my mind
Deal with reality deal with facts
I've got 'em shooting at me I'm gonna shoot back

Cuz I like guns and guns like me
I like guns they made America free
I like guns and guns are the way
I like guns

So your lost in your lost world
Without my own weapon I'd rather be dead
People on the streets getting shot every hour
That's what Tawny Schnieder said
Time to look out your front door
Blow that sucker right on the floor
Load your gun and let him have it
The right to bear arms the right to be free

Cuz I like guns and guns like me
I like guns they made America free
I like guns and guns are the way
I like guns
Weapons, weapons, weapons
Go!

People on the street you think you're safe
There little guns all over the place
They'll take our toys and the government'll have them
It's time to not let them oppress you
Time to force your life on them
Tell 'em the way cuz you know it
Tell 'em the way cuz that's your right

I like guns and guns like me
I like guns they made America free
I like guns and guns are the way
I like guns

Remember
The right to bare arms
The right to bare arms
The right to bare arms
The right to bare arms
The right to bare arms
The right to bare arms
The right to bear arms
They'll wind up coming to get you",Guns,1993
Curt D.I.S.S.,"so you want to be a member want to be a name
want to be a local face want to play the game
dancing through a time warp in your dinosaur trends
the limits of your mind are where the county line ends...
listen to the media present it as a fact
fall in your orders 'cause you don't know how to act
travel on estranged 'cause you don't know your own way
they'll get you in the end then you'll pay
'cause o.c. life is not the life for me
stupid little girls
oppressed society
o.c. life is not the life for me
pressures on your backs so you want to be remembered
want to have some fame
fighting to stay ahead a part of the game
common authority but don't get out of line
or they'll put you in the slammer you'll be doing some time
74 tattoed on my head i find myself labeled as a victim instead i fight all the rules i don't see the way
i'd rather be dead then pay the price that they say
'cause o.c. life is not the life for me
stupid little girls and egotistic fads
o.c. life is not the life for free
pressures on you back it'a all a bunch of crap
put the plastic right inside the machine

Curt D.I.S.S.,"needles were stabbed into the walls
the executioner's cutain call
fighting back he found his life drowning
and there was no way up
'cause richard hung himself
richard hung himself
it happened just the other day
jesus come and pushed him off the shelf
he thought he'd find a better way
than stealing and slamming and maiming and ramming
the death who wears black curtains wears clothes
what's right the roof kicked out the road
tie the rafters a clinking of his chair
and he's all through if richie only knew
'cause richard hung himself
richard hung himself 
t happened just the other day
jesus come and push him off the shelf
he thought he found a better way
his life suddenly flashed right before his eyes
what a swingin' guy turnin' grey
with mold, yuck this is how he died
give it up, give it up, throw it all away
boiling acid bath
polminary wrath
feel the pulling surge it won't let you go
throw it all away
throw it all away
throw it all a
throw it all a
throw it all away
swingin' in his room richard won't come out to play
'cause richie hung himself the other day
oh how the world seems to fly by
his death the final high
'cause richard humg himself
richard hung himself
it happened just the other day
jesus come and push him off the shelf
he thought he found a better way
by stealing and tearing and ripping and slamming and
tripping and scoring and laughing and laughing and
screaming and hurting and tearing and being and taking

Curt Grubb,"Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time

If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

You said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love

Curt Kirkwood,"Running all around
Looking at the things
That I seem to see
That are filling me with wonder
And the other day
When you were just a flower
And there was a snowstorm
Right inside the bedroom
I became a bee
You became a scarecrow
And we had some trouble
'Cause we took a light bulb
Tried to turn it on
To eliminate the clouds
But it took the darkness
And it made it double

I looked up in the sun
'Cause I thought I saw a light there
Up in the air
I know it was a rose
Still it was a nightmare
Up in the air

Platinum rings
Spinning in search
Shadows on a sandpaper wall
In a duststorm
And I got a mothball
Hanging from a candlewick
And a pair of capsize
And I got a nightstick
Everywhere I look
I think I see a shadow
Everywhere I step
Is looking like dumb luck
If I had a wish
I'd wish I was a caveman
So I could fly like a goldfish in quicksand

I looked up in the sun
'Cause I thought I saw a light there
Up in the air
I know it was a rose
Still it was a nightmare
Up in the air

Little black tinman
A fist full of powder
Melting like a sugartree
Standing in a rainstorm
If I had a lie
I'd give it wings
And if I had a wish
I'd wish for everything

I looked up in the sun
'Cause I thought I saw a light there
Up in the air
I know it was a rose
Still it was a nightmare
Up in the air",Light Bulb,2005

Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1996
Curt Massey,"In the warm yellow glow of the Christmas Candles
I see the magic of Christmas shining bright, shining bright
Like the star that led the kings and shepherds
All to a tiny stable on that night, Holy night
With the lambs and the donkeys, cows and the camels breathing low

The perfect Child of God was born so long ago
In the dancing flame of the Christmas candles
I hear the whisper of angels soft and clear, soft and clear

As they watched in the night over Baby Jesus
I know they're watching me, always near, always near
I love the Christmas gifts and the trimming of the tree
Like the candles they remind us what Christmas really means

So, tonight as we light our Christmas candles
I'll hold the love of Jesus in my heart, in my heart
And keep the flame where the spirit of Christmas starts",Christmas Candles,1996

You wanted to walk and I nodded my head
As I breathlessly said, thatÃ¢??s for me

I left you standing under stars, the dayÃ¢??s adventures are through
ThereÃ¢??s nothing for me but the dream in my heart
And the dream in my heart, thatÃ¢??s for you
