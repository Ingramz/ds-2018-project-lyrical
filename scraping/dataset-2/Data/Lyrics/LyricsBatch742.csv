Chorus:

Niggaz just don't know, that I'm taxin all these hoes

These hoes they want to be seen, but they can't be seen with me

[Silkk]
You hoes better wake up and smell the coffee
You must have took a wrong turn because you lost me

Now the club be the best place, they work be the worst place

You can put some muthafuckin gold around my neck

Chorus:

Niggaz just don't know, that I'm taxin all these hoes

Mo B. Dick,"[Silkk]
All because of my car
All because of my car
All because of my car

[Mo B. Dick]
I'm in my car, cruisin to the beat
Trippin off, off these money hungry freaks
Wanna be down, wit a super star
'cause you know I got money an a cold blooded car

[Chorus]
Must be the Beamer (Must be the Beamer) 
That's turning you on
Must be the Benz (Must be the Benz) 
I ain't takin you home
{All because of my car}

Must be the Cruiser (Must be the Cruiser) 
Got you flaggin me down
Must be the Rover (Must be the Rover) 
Makes you wanna be around
{All because of my car}

[Silkk the Shocker]
I hits an run like an accident
Mr. hit em fast an slow is back again
If you don't believe me go an ask a friend
I got more hoes than the O-Zone
I hits em wit they close on 
(Why's that Silkk?) 
So they can go home
I rolls up on a bucket, she got a man
But when I rolls up in a Benz, das when she hops in
An thas how its gon' happen to her
I don't mean to be like mackin to her or rappin to her
But I'm jus askin to her
Now back up in the days I run game on em
They wanna play games so I bought a Lexus from my homie
An the next day after that, game don't stop
(Where ya car at)
I be like man, its in tha shop
But now I'm on top now
Put the......top down
See how many number I can jot down, how many girl I can knock down
An plus up on my block, now it ain't gon' stop
Now, since I got a little cash
Now I dash down the block but I keep my game tight
When I'm in the Rover, I gets the guests the same night
You try skeezin me, should be try pleasin me
Alizay to get the draws off easily
Thas when I switch my game over
You blame it on a hang over I blame it on the Range Rover
An I ain't tryin to hear that
(Oh it's like that, huh?) 
Like that, like that

Chorus

[Mo B. Dick]
When I'm flossin on these ghetto streets
Can't see how I get stopped by those crooked police
I can't understand, why they player hate
An they ask me these question, like how much money I make
Now it's none of their business, how I make my ends
An you can't get a piece of my funky dividends
I guess you could say, I got it goin on
'cause I keep seein girlies an they won't leave me alone

[Silkk the Shocker]
I guess the PD is tryin to see me in the State Pen
Behind me tryin to run my license plate in
I'm checkin my rear view, but I ain't gon' trip, bruh
Waitin for me to slip up, show me some ID wit yo' picture
I guess they wanna see my bank statement
See how much money that I'm makin
But I guess they just be hatin
They need to start missin me, stop trippin G
I guess they mad 'cause I got more gold than Mr T

[Mo B. Dick]
An all these freaks wanna get in my gangsta ride
'cause I got it front to back, an side to side
But I ain't got time
I gotta do my thang 
An if you wanna front you know I can hang
Now you know that I never wanna perpetrate
'cause y'all playa hate
You fools better recognize 
That a No Limit Soldier is on the rise

Chorus

Must be the Bentley (Must be the Bentley) 
That's turnin you on
Must be the Lex (Must be the Lexus) 
That's why I'm takin you home
{All because of my car}

Must be the Caddie (Must be the Caddie) 
Got you flaggin me down
Must be the Cutlass (Must be the Cutlass) 
Why you wanna be around

",My Car,1996
Mo B. Dick,"See y'all niggas think I'm tripping cause I'm on that doja
See y'all true niggas
One reason I'm spiitin' this game to y'all niggas
Nigga cause 'I want y'all niggas to watch ya motherfuckin' self
Motherfuckin' f-e-d's be followin' niggas out in the projects
All in a niggas car, all on planes and boats
Just like deez niggas and deez hoes
Tired of motherfuckers followin' me man take another route
Nigga somebody else, keep ya eyes open fool

[Chorus: x2]
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
I'm paranoid I can't sleep I'm in this dope game
I think these hoes and these niggas out to get me man

I ain't never had nothing in my whole life
I'm from the ghetto grew up on eggs and rice
I'm paranoid, I can't sleep cause I done stole a key
Peep out the window unmarked car after me
My little homie down stairs hollerin' 5.0
But I ain't runnin' from no motherfuckin' white folks
I got the a-k spray hit the window (lay it down) duck
So nigga holler God damn, hit him in the trunk
The dogs chase me but a nigga ran through the back
That's when I seen dope and willy in the Cadillac
They said p where ya going man get in
Put the gat to his head said interstate 10
Play it off, play it off while I do a trick
Take me to the project to meet my bitch
100 g's, 2 keys, and a bullet-proof vest, like
Billy the kid I got some pussy and headed to the west

Chorus

I was pullin up out the driveway
Car been parked since Friday
I looked and look back it wasn't there
But I saw him followin on the highway
And I today know that I'm gonna blast
See I don't know who's in it cause the cars windows were tinted
And I be seeing shit that ain't it ain't there
But I be seein shit, I be in places without even bein seen there
But be seen in places without even bein there
And it seems like I'm in a different time zone
This dope game got my mind gone got my mind gone
Be having nightmares in the day, I be woke but I be sleep
I looked at shock the nigga but I turned around and it was me
It got me noid, it got me noid
It got me noid, but I ain't paranoid

[Chorus]

I beez more paranoid than a fugitive
Because I choose to live pro life
When it comes to mine my ruger 9's on cock
For all them haters with the scandolous plots
The red dot marks the spot for my nineteen shots
But I forgot the way they did ya boy
That's why I'm never on the streets without my plastic toy
They wanna trap me kidnap me duct tape my mouth
Torture me until I tell em about my man and point the dope house out
I used to be about the same drama game
That's why I'm two steps ahead of you gutter brains
You know the name mia x the biggest momma
Ghetto sara lee at the store
Betty crocker when I choppa fo' sho'
The evil eyes be watching cause niggaz be always
Tryin to get in the best players spot and knockin'
Motherfuckers head off and kris krossin
Throw in mo salt than martin
When it rains it pours, horns with the rough tones
They try to get me slung on my back
Got to watch the jealousy acts so black
My eyes be in the front and the back and the sides peepin'
For all them crooks that be out creepin'
I feel they watchin' me

They watchin' but true soldiers don't die they multiply
Keep an open eye for all them haters

[Chorus: x2]",I Always Feel Like [Street Version],1997
Mo B. Dick,"This for all y'all niggaz dat tru to the g-zame.
From master p and the whole tru click. it's time to hook ya ice
Cream up and turn it into candy.
Mo b. dick: oh!

Chorus i: I got candy!
Mo b. dick: I can serve you on the block
Cocaine, cream, or rock, it takes over fiend
I got candy!
Mo b. dick: I wanna know
If you feel it, too, just like I do.

[silkk]
I hits the block non stop, rocks in my sock
Pause for a second when I see the cops
Rocks of candy, whatever you wanna call it
But when I get you hooked, it's like a muthafuckin alcoholic
I stay ? ? ? around like a poster, watch fiends follow like a toaster
Candy I have move em fast like ? ? ?
Knick knack paddy whack, give a fiend a fast sack
9 times outta 10, he'll tell his friends and they'll be right back
Whole bunch a niggaz, and just one fiend
They come to me for less cut, cause I boast bigger cream
And them fiends come back cause they understand me,
I open up shop, open up shop cause I got candy

Chorus ii: he's got candy! yo eyes roll in your head,
Mo b. dick: you toss and turn in yo bed
Cause I only sell the best to you,
Mo b. dick: indeed I do!
Simply put I'm the reason why
Silkk: why?
Everyday you get high,
Mo b. dick: real high!
And you know I got that crack for you
Mo b. dick: indeed I do!
Just for you

[silkk]
I'm sittin on the post, choppin game with this bitch,
I see ya later ho, I gots money to get
Cause as long as a fiend with dream, I got cream
Money moves everything around me, kn'what I mean?
Cause as a ? ? ? with a dolla, I'm sittin on a drop and parlour
On some gold thangs, watch all them hoes follow
My money makes stacks and real deals
I keep my cash, nigga taj, I can't chill, I gots to pay bills
And these niggaz can't stand me
Got this ho that said she wanna suck my dick for candy
Gotta watch out for these dope fiends cause they be runnin tricks,
$3 what they gon come with, $3 what they gon get
I hold the block like a 7-11(7-11), kick yo door in like taj (taj)
Cut the shit up like machetti, chop the shit up like grass
Cause I'm a stay hustlin till they fuckin can me bitch,
Because it's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I got
Candy

Chorus I

[master p]
Uuuunnnngggghhhh! I smoke weed cause I'm a drug deala
I sell candy on the block fool, to make my fuckin scrilla
7 grams for $2.50,
Got niggaz in the hood on hold, tryin to get with me
I keep a stash for the drought,
But the shit I sling daily in plastic out my mouth
My homies use code names,
Like l.d., big champ, slim, t dove, and big mann
I take penetentiary chances to make a livin,
Every 1st of the month, is like thanksgiving
Fiends hug me like they miss me
Hoes see me rollin in my car, and wanna be with me
I get my candy from california by the keys
Ship it in boats and trains back to new orleans
And open up shop like mr. rogers,
But sell mo hits than the dodgers
And fiends holla ""ungh!"" cause it's all good
From the triple beam, straight to the neighborhood
And when you sellin candy trust nobody
Cause niggaz even snitched on john gotti
Niggaz stay tru to the g-zame,
Never front on muthafuckin candy in the dope game
And never go to the fedz on ya folks
Cause punks get fucked with the soap

Chorus iii:
Mo b. dick: I got that real good cocaine (cocaine) each and
Every day, all real tru soldiers, on these streets I gotta get my pay.
My game so tight, so good, so good, yeah!
Mo b. dick: cocaine, he-roin, that fire ass weed
Values and boulders, just tell me what you need baby. oh!
Cotton candy, candy!
",I Got Candy,1997
Mo B. Dick,"Nigga, I'm bustin me locs, but I'm hittin em down with jokes
Y'all niggas on the rope, got your ho on da scope
Bitches watching me, jockin me, nigga blockin me, cockin me
Cause I'm the HARDEST motherfucker, out here rockin
I got the game in shades, got the niggas in blades
I got them hoes on a raid, because the nigga gettin paid
I've got, niggas from coast, slangin my dope
Got niggas and G's, and rollin keys keys to record sto's
Get paid wit fatals, niggas harder than Cato
Nigga turnin the tables, but niggas livin like potatoes
Get chopped up in game, niggas runnin my name
Master P up in chain, is he dead he's a man
But I be bustin, hustlin, niggas ain't trustin
I'm a soldier, that's why niggas ain't trustin
No bitch or no nigga, ho or no sucka
Fiend or no clucker, but ready to hustle
With boulders, bigga than yo' shoulders
Runnin from the rollers, gone on that doja
Cause cowards despise, soldiers we ride
Killers with attitudes, but ready to die
Cause chickens get plucked, hoes get fucked
Turkeys get stuck, and niggas get cuffed
Ready for combat, my gat with my hard hat
Strapped with my crew and my niggas and all that
Down for whatever, niggas straight rowdy
Ask any motherfucker in America they'll tell ya, we bout it
Soldiers out there tech, bustin don't think
Lose ya life if you blink
Fuckin with them soldiers on the tank, cause

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

Let's get ready to rumble, them niggas stumble
Hit em with left blows
Fuck it got death blows
Ready to got to war? Let's go!
We killas and realas, drug dealers and killers, fuck it
No Limit soldiers, close your eyes
Now picture me foldin dollar bills
I stay fuckin Tru, nigga fuck it, nigga do ya
Nigga I come to life and I scare all y'all bustas like Freddy Kruger
Gangstafied nigga, true to the game nigga
Stay fuckin pullin triggas, fuck up all y'all niggas
Cause I'm so fuckin T-R-U, representin I thought you knew
Cause killas killas killas
That's all I be around, nigga fuckin fool
About face, this No Limit soldier
One to the two to the three (hah hah)
Nigga I tried to told ya
Everybody quiet, while I load up this rifle (attention!)
Now all my soldiers start fightin
It's time to go deep cover
Lethal Weapon like Danny Glover, smother like jelly
Really, go deep like Jim Kelly
Fuck it, all y'all bustas open up y'all belly
Think we playin bitch, well we ain't
I heard we had drama motherfucker
Put up the Benz and now we drive the tank
Cause all I want to be was a soldier
All I want to be was a soldier, soldier

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

I'm a No Limit motherfuckin soldier till I die
We run this place, and I say the same shit, with a gun up in my face
I ain't scared to die, bitch like I said before, ho
3rd Ward, I'm from that motherfuckin Calliope
Projects supported worldwide by drug dealers
Transformin wimpy ass niggas into killers
Taking over, worldwide, doin shows oversea
Bringing bitches to the telly, put them hoes upon they knees
Gangstafied, like my motherfuckin homies Kane and Abel
No Limit, the world's number one fuckin rap label (worldwide)
Competition get smoked like we smokin blunts
I take a playa hata and knock out his fuckin fronts
Dope slanga, now I'm slangin CD's
A million records (platinum), it used to be some quarter keys
TRU tattooed on my back bitch thats my click
Ready to hop into some motherfuckin gangsta shit
I say No Limit loud, cause we ain't scared of nobody
Organized by P or should I say, John Gotti
Real niggas, put ya guns up if ya feel me
But if ya talk shit, bitch ya betta kill me
Like Skull I'm a hoodlum 4 life, I told ya
We be some motherfuckin No Limit TRU soldiers

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

Hard times got my mind on cock, and massive thoughts be the plot
Top priorities the family dope and royalty
My loyalty, fiends with a gang of true niggas
No colors, just a bunch of ignorant motherfuckers
Trust my pen is an infa-red
Hollow-tips be my lyrics dipped in venom when I send em
They split ya head (pssssh) wide open
My rhymes on fire blood, but you can't smoke ne'er a one
Don't try to come, don't even touch the mic
My shit so tight, it's more correct than right, when I recite
Absolutely, you booty-ass hoes and niggas
Perpetratin behind water gun triggers
Hurry up and figure out that studio Gotti's catch hotties to the mouth
Who got that clout, don't act surprised cause it's that bitch from the South
Mia X hoes, you don't want no problems
Get so much respect, even yo' niggas call me momma, the biggest one
To come stompin out the N.O., the crescent
Testin, chin-checkin, wreckin when I'm flexin on your WHOLE crew
Who wants to go to war with this lyrical arsenist
Ya talkin shit, I'll having ya runnin for the thesaurus, cause I'm walkin wit
The big dogs without hesitation, Unlady Like as ever
Full of, verbal annhilation
Escaping, po-po's chasin, want ta catch me but they cain't
I made em think, and now they too scared to run up on the tank
No Limit, you can start it, but we niggas is the hardest
To deal wit, keeps the steel, and the plastics to peel wit
In reach, so we can touch yo' ass
And leave a bout it scarf on ya face, we soldiers

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya",No Limit Soldiers,1997

What's happenin Serv? 

[Mr. Serv On] 

What you doin nigga? 

[New 9] 

Man I ain't doin nothin  just chillin.

[Mr. Serv On] 

Nigga pass the weed to a nigga baby. 



Chorus 

This world got me heartless 

That's why I hit the weed 

leave my middle finger up, I give a fuck (2X) 



Dear God tell me, how many times 

During the course of a day for ????? 

my life I gotta say a prayer for myself 

Or tell me, how many nights 

My mama gotta lay awake cryin 

starin at my picture on the shelf 

But if you ask me 

Some of you niggas instead of hating 

You need to be anticipating 

and find the bullet that's waitin for ya 

Do I feel for ya, I'm heartless 

I feel for people like my girl Cheryl 

who lost her brother Travis to these streets 

Can you imagine, having to identify 

your little brother that's laying beneath some sheets 

I don't think so 

Or what about this hoe 

That tried to tell me about a nigga 

that I came up with since diapers 

Serv watch yourself he don't like ya 

Or what about these niggas on my block 

that know I made it out 

All this dope you niggas done sold in the hood 

you still ain't bought 

your mama a house 

But believe me niggas I love you till my dying day 

But if you try to take me from my family 

I'm a bang you in a fuckin heartless way 



Chorus (4X) 



[New 9] 

I just got out last night so it's like a cycle 

Even though I know shit always don't go they way you want it to go 

I proceed to be a nigga I need, it's only real 

It's money making plans to demand at center field 

And shit's real and right now everything is tight 

I got to pack a gun but if I get caught it's my third strike 

I'm strapped up, my tennis too tight, that's how I'm living 

A nigga on a mission, anything in my way, I'm killing 

That's my mentality right, me and my niggas be quick to fight 

Type of niggas you don't want to cross if you kinda value your life 

Whether wrong or right, I got a pocket full of rocks and I'm on a block 

Smokin weed with my niggas, last thing I want to see is a cop 

On patrol, some dicksuckers roll, the heck is up 

I'm heartless so I point my middle finger cause I don't give a fuck 

I'm strapped up and on parole, I gotta fight to stay out of the penn 

The same shit happened last year, here I go again 



[Mr. Serv-On] 

Chorus 4X 



[Uzi] 

Mercy mercy me, Lord forgive me for the wrong I've done 

Ghetto child with a crooked smile I had a rough one 

This life full of plenty hurt, so soft and pain 

Consequences of the game but I had to maintain 

Step on toes, I'm ready to ride or roll over 

I'm a kill for a meal, lay back and smoke some doja 

But I know what go around come around good 

Knock on wood and it's understood 

I'm stayin young at twenty one life full of regret 

Ten commandments say don't kill but I done left some folks wet 

I got the blood of a dead man on my hand 

We goin clash again in soldier land 

Mm hmm 



[Glock] 

Now am I wrong when I want to bust your motherfuckin dome 

Got that blues song stuck, scratch on you ain't coming home 

I let it ride cause I know he be fake 

But fuck that he cross my family, this nigga's done took the cake 

Stop the record just start it up you can find him in the lake 

Have your people fucked up sayin I just saw him yesterday 

See that's real and I know you motherfuckers can relate 

It's written down in ghetto law and taught by this ghetto church 

That's why my hollow keeps me strapped, cause it be too late 

Cause in a minute all this shit bout to be in one way 



[Mo B. Dick] 

Here I go again 



[Mr. Serv-On] 

Chorus 6X",Here I Go Again,1998
Mo B. Dick,"[Chorus]
People always talkin 'bout. 
(I'm what, say what? I'm what, say what?)
You're a hustler .
(I'm what, say what? I'm what, say what?)
I don't care what the others think, 
Just be straight with me, (I'm what say what?)

Huh? Huh? Huh? 
I know I take chances to make sure I'm sittin' tight.
Do I get how I live, sometimes I don't get it right.
My gold and platinum plaques make you know what we did.
Have the whole world wonderin' what Silkk The Shocker, Master P did.
See it ain't no limit, it's only the beginnin'.
Why? 'Cuz all y'all want us to fall, and hit the wall.
It'll only take a minute, an' see I gets the bomb tree.
Beats by the Pound shit, it sound sick, rolex, and baguettes all.
I take this out the ghetto an' live up on top.
Akin flights, an shoppin' sprees, on 5-0-4 yachts.
See, money don't change me, make me live a lil' bit good.
Took some of my family members, an' my homies out the hood.
See, we ghetto millionaires, far away when we meet.
I think they watched us, P, 'cuz about when we speak.
See I'm too deep to change, everybody know my name.
I guess I gotta charge it to da game.

[Chorus]

Ugh! Green money, I like to count, honey.
My only bad habit that I like to sell B's, honey.
We hot, check the Billboard spot.
Twenty-four g's an' P's to make a club rock.
Now they violent, gotta get it rowdy.
Peep game gotta Benz, Lex Luger in or out it.
Don't hate me, the money don't make me.
It's gonna take two hundred million just to break me,
'Cuz I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya.
I like that doja, but hate the rollers.
Crystal, greed, an hinace, got cream. 
Makes a brother in a Bentley, from the ghetto.
There ain't no limit 'cuz we livin' large.
Bought a rolex, a yacht, with a gold card.
You done lately, your girl wanna date me, in my grill.
For, Ugh, an' I'm straight g.

[Chorus]

I guess they call me a hustler, 'cuz of the fast livin'.
But if I see somethin' I gotta get it, because I have vision.
An' if I like it, I gotta get, if I saw it.
Went from, over the shows, over the doors,
House full of floors that's marble, a brand new Ferrari.
Parked it, when I bought it, see, I'm a no limit soldier.
An' I came to get it started, what you, what you think?
I'm all about my bank, tryin' to be a multi-millionaire.
Before I'm old enough to drink, now we can ride, bro.  No lie, bro.
See, nobody be here beside us, so go ahead an fire it up.
Some girls wanna perk it, my homies like to work it.
Soldiers from Texas, all the way to Jersey.
Tick to the tock, all around the clock.
From the north, to the south, 
To the east, to the west, it just don't stop.
So to all my real g's, throw them up high,
To all the ballers that have the corks of Crystal, let it fly.
That's how we live.

[Chorus]

No Limit, say what? I'm what?  Say what? 
New Orleans, say what? I'm what?  Say what? 
South side, say what? Ugh! I'm what?  Say what?
East side, say what? I'm what?  Say what?
West coast, say what? I'm what?  Say what?
North side, say what? I'm what?  Say what?
Silkk The Shocker, say what? I'm what?  Say what?
No Limitc say what? I'm what?  Say what?
Ha ha, playas, congratulate. 
Ain't no hatin' on this side.  Where the money at? 
That's what hustlin' is about, you heard me? 
Master P, Silkk The Shocker, hustlin' till the izend.

[Master P] 

RIP homie  RIP 

[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] 

How do I say goodbye to what we had 

The good times that made us laugh outweighted the bad 

I thought we'd get to see forever 

But forever's gone away 

It's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 

[Master P] 

y'all niggas smile for my ghetto heroes 

So many homies gone  trying to ball till they fall 

Now I'm left with nothing but old cards 

and a bunch of pictures on the wall 

RIP tatoos nigga, just to show you that we real 

But I still can't believe that your dead fool, and how you got killed 

And on your birthday me and my boys visit your grave 

And I remember when you first got high 

and the first time you got laid 

And I'm going through a thing, Kevin nigga, what should I do 

I never imagined living life without a nigga like you 

[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] 

Chorus 

Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 

Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 

[Master P] 

We shed so many ghetto tears, see time is crazy 

And every sunday grandma go to church 

she said she gotta pray for her baby 

And ah, your little son, he look just like you 

And momma going through a thang, but she gonna pull it through 

And ah me, see and Silk we got a little money but that don't mean shit 

Cause I burn all that shit up nigga, just to have you again 

And it's real out here, all you niggas that's goin through some pain 

Keep your head up, and this for everybody 

that lost a relative in the street game 

[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] 

Chorus 

[Silkk The Shocker] 

Now look, I couldn't imagine life without you 

I just sit here wonderin why 

But the law of life, and god placed us here 

and said everybody must die 

Ended hard trying to move on but still I try 

Even though we got money, judgement day 

just some things we can't buy 

Even though you gone, I never let you move on 

Cause every time i think about you 

I sit back and write your name in a song 

Now ashes to ashes, and dust to dirt 

It's kinda spooky when one day I see your face on a t-shirt 

I just pray to god it's hard wishing it would get better 

And why it take a death or a funeral to bring our family together 

Now look, we done lost a brother, your son done lost a father 

Life ain't promised us so tell somebody you love them 

You'll never know whether they'll be here tomorrow

[Verse 1: Silkk the Shocker] 



See I'm that type of nigga, gotta do what I gotta 

Like send my girl on a plane ride, taped up with keys of narcotic 

But I ain't that type of nigga, that's gon' tell you what I'm gon' do 

You fuck up, I'm a kill ya, and I put that shit on TRU 

See I'm that type of nigga that ride with the rich, kick it with the poor 

Just 'cause of some shit that I used to do, and my rep 

Everybody see me, all of a sudden hit the floor 

Rest in peace to my nigga, go head and rest y'all head 

Nigga that killed ya, I'm torturin' him, the rest, they dead 

So Magic pass me them thangs and let me get 'em (let me get 'em)

My hobbies was totin' tecks Jack and my first words were give it up 

It was hard to maintain, couldn't see myself workin' this 9 to 5 

I'd rather be hustlin' on the corner with my niggas, gettin' high 

Chancin' my own life, I'm strapped, got a pocketful of bud 

But I wouldn't have it no other way, my daddy done raised a thug 

I never rooted for the good guys, I was always for the bad (bad) 

I guess that's why I got Master P's pictures posted around my pad 

My ghetto heroes was drug dealer, killers and cap peelers 

I didn't do too bad for myself 'cause, now Magic makin' millions 

Me and Silkk unbeatable team we can't be stopped (can't be stopped) 

We ain't got nothin' to prove to nobody (nothin') 

Fuck wit' us, you get popped 

It's a brand new generation, and we the children of the future 

So I'm gon' do what I gotta do because that's what I'm used to 

Either you with me or you against me, ball or nigga fall 

But I'm a No Limit Soldier, so I'm comin' for it all

Girl I'm really not trying to make you rush
But picture you and me making love sometime

I've been digging on you since the twelveth grade
Kind of shy, didn't know what to say
You turned me on like a light girl
Yes you did, yes you did
You were a friend but you became part of me
Back in the day I know that it was meant to be
Time's have changed, now I'm a grown man not a kid
So what I'm saying is

Picture you and me in a six four
In the back seat smoking on some bud
There some freaky little things going on in my mind
It's another crazy night in the N.O.
Girl I'm really not trying to make you rush
But picture you and me making love sometime

Girl I'm on another level everyday
Making money, everybody knows my name
There ain't no limit to the things I can do for you
No, 'cause you've been down when I didn't have a dime
And on these streets you were my partner in crime
It's only right for us to do what we supposed to do
And if you, twose you have it all
Me and you baby ball until we fall
All you have to do is promise that you keep it real
Keep it real girl, I'll die for you, you die for me on everything
I'm your tomorrow, girl you'll be my destiny
Think about it, don't you doubt it girl do what you feel
And in the meantime

Picture you and me in a six four
In the back seat smoking on some bud
There some freaky little things going on in my mind
It's another crazy night in the N.O.
Girl I'm really not trying to make you rush
But picture you and me making love sometime

Picture you and me
Intimatly, total estcasy
Baby can't you see
I really want you baby
I really, really want you baby",Picture U & Me,1999

My children of the corn worldwide
I know they got points in time ya'll life
And ya'll feel like the weight of the world is on your shoulders
And everything that could go wrong just go wrong
And just make it feel like uh..

I just want to get high and smoke my life away
All I want to do is smoke my life away
So I shield my mind, I see no other way
All I want to do is smoke my life away

There's so much trouble going on in my life
I don't even know where to start
It's those trials and tribulations and they ain't nothing nice
It's enough to tear your soul apart
Ya'll in the, me and my woman had an argument
Then she turned and slapped me in my face
Ya'll hear me on, I don't know what the fuck is going on
But I guess it's just one of those days

I just want to get high and smoke my life away
All I want to do is smoke my life away
So I shield my mind, I see no other way
All I want to do is smoke my life away

I like to get my hustle on day and night
Cause that's how I stack my dividends
Out on these streets it ain't no wrong or right
So in essence I ain't got no friends
That's why I live my life all by myself
Cause your friends will get you everytime
Yeah, when it comes to money everyman for himself
So I'm always in his state of mind

I just want to get high and smoke my life away
All I want to do is smoke my life away
So I shield my mind, I see no other way
All I want to do is smoke my life away

sometimes I just wish I could sleep it off
cause i dream about things that I know that i can't have
thing i know will never happen 
like a safe environment money happiness success
niggas want static than he going to get it 
i came up with blood money that means 
i'm wicked I roll with nothing but ninos 
so they call me a baller i wiped a niggaz ass 
because I'm not a talker 
took a flight to kali came back with some birds 
ten g's for a key from a nigga called dirt 
I like to hear my mack eleven empty out a clip 
shot a fool up in the club and then i changed my outfit
maintain and uphold my statis as a g 
niggaz kiss my ass because i got a lot of money
plain and simple niggaz leave huh when i don't feel'em 
because they know when they fuck up then i'm going to kill'em 
understand i was rasied where the young niggaz roam
if you wanted something nigga you had to get up on your own 
all these want to be motherfucken 
ass hustlers better wake up and stop killing on another 
cause

I wish that life was a dream 
cause some times i wake up 
and just want to scream

A lesson was learned when they put you in the grave
It don't matter what you got when a nigger gone get cha
Cause when a nigger gone hit ya a nigger gone hit ya
Bulletproof with ak's with hundred round drums
Can't stop one bullet penetrating your dome

You know we was dealt some bad cards but
You know
We gotta deal with it 
Life's hard so lets show em show em show em what's up

My ghetto ties got me livin' my life in pain
See the world knows we gonna be thugs forever 
You can take me out the ghetto
But you can't make it better
See the status of your money done changed 
But the status of your danger remains the same
I need to clear my head of these evil thoughts 
And teach magnolian' gateway the shit I was taught
Take a ride wit me nigga to eternity 
And watch you live tuh see anotha century
Life's a bitch who do you trust I put my faith in my glock 
Cause I know its gone bust
I used to think the hood was cool 
But my ghetto ties keep my checkin' in my rearveiw

Who do you trust?
My ghetto ties got me trippin'
And life's a bitch 
They can't stand to see a young nigga get rich

He might try to do a jack and that might cost me my life 
If you ever jack its real nigga 
You best kill me or pay the price

No street machine tell me what you seen
Then tell a nigga about some stoned ass 
Left the murder scene disguised in army green with a infra beam
Own self tryin tuh gum nigga run as soon as he heard the blast fool one
He didn't run tore his ass up with a quick fast sight
Witness that murda the first degree my ghetto ties fuckin' round wit me
Don't do that

How many times have you seen a family nut up and the mom was cut up
I see now but later on I'm gonna be seein' now

Hey dad. 
Son  who's your favorite rapper and who's your favorite rap group? 

You are  cause you the real ice cream man and my favorite rap group is T.R.U. 
'Cause I'm true 2 da game. 

Aha  I'm true 2 da game too son. You did your homework? You got any studying to do? 
Yea dad. Studying this  just how to be a true playa. Wanta ask me some questions? 
Yea son. Let me see this. Oh they didn't have questions like this when I grew up son, 
But I guess whatever 

It takes to make you be a man son. I'm all for it. Son, the first question is, 
If you rap about another 

Rapper on a record, what are you? 

You a sucka! 
Aha, you got that right son. Next question. If you hate another for being successful, what are you? 
You mean like, you rollin in Benzes, they be like P.H.ing you, 
The pigs be pulling you over cause you 

be black and you be sittin on triple gold, like the niggas in the ghetto be hatin on you cause you made it out? 

-Yea son, what is that, what you call that? 

-Dad, that only be two words. PLAYA HATA. 

-Huh, you got that right son. Look like you gonna past this test, 
But I got one more question for you. Son, if 
Any man depends on another man and can't think on his own, 
Can't survive on his own, can't take good care of his 

family, you know what I mean son. I mean, you were put in this world by yourself, 
You're supposed to depend on you 

and nobody else. 
I mean son, when a man can't function on his own and put his problems on another man, son, what type 

of man is that? What do you call that type of person? 

Dad, can I curse? 
Son, if you have to express yourself. Tell me, what type of man is that? 
That a punk ass bitch 
Hehehe, damn little P, you bout it, bout it, just like your daddy. 
Oh wait, one more question before I leave though. 

What you want to be when you grow up? 
I want to be a G like you. A No Limit Soldier for life. Fuck you hatas, cause we have millions.",Intro,2013

Oh 
It's life or death in my town 
And I'm standin' on deadly ground 
I just want to live my life 
All by myself
 
Life is full of debt 
And life is full of cnflict 
I'm just tired of seein' all my homies out here dyin' quick 
Society today is all twisted 
Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin' 
Now that's bad because LaWan got 3 for murder 
Politics in the court house ain't the same since the murder. 
That's why constantly I watch all my enemies 
'Cause death is a disease to all my TRU g'z 
The can't shake it 
They can't seem to break the cycle 
That's why I'm protected by the gat and St. Micheal 
Ralph Sten said money runs the country 
Make ya do some strange things when it's right in front ya 
I done see mothers turn on they own kids 
Money make brothers turn on one another. 
Even make each other split the other's wig 
Animosity 
Least of all tops is ta watch ya back 
Life or Death 
'Cause ya never know if ya breathed ya last breath. 

[Chorus: x2] 
 
I'm already dead 
So can't nobody kill me 
I done suffered to long to let another man fear me 
My pain brings anger to a total stranger 
Ain't no limit to my hall when I'm constantly in danger 
I just want to be surrounded by somebody that luv me 
But reallity is sendin' me those hatas undercover 
I don't know who to trust but my family and friends 
Takin' chances on your life when you let a stranger in 
Nowadays rappers dying 
So I take it as a message 
I lived to see another year so I count my blessings 
Tell Em' I'ma changed man, but they don't hear me 
On my knees beggin' god can you please forgive me 
Let the past be the past 
I'm investin' in the future 
Watch the ones that swallow most ya 
And the ones that'll do ya 
My advice to the world 
Maintain your sanity 
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil 
Thoughts 
'Cause there's gotta be another way 
Life or Death? 
See me? 
I trust nobody 
Money is the rule to all evil 
Better watch yourself boo

Welcome to the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep or die on these streets

And the ghetto ain't no joke
Cause every motherfucking day another nigga gets smoked
And momma pray it ain't me
But I'm addicted to this dope game, addicted to this green cheese
I be making mail like the mailman
This is for my partners in the hood pushing massive cain (ice cream)
Through the hood of the projects
Its fiends walking up for bubble ups
You think I'm bout to reject
When a nigga get some money, I got them gats cocked nigga
I ain't living like no dummy
If I die, I ain't scared to die, but don't ask me why
Will I retire and give it up realize
That's this my only mission of money
But y'all niggas look at a nigga hustling like its funny
But I got to feed the family
Even though if that take me getting fucking scandalous G
And I have to hurt shit
Put a nigga in the dirt, mean putting in work
Lay him down, and punch in your time card
Cause you never know when your ass bout to go meet the Lord
So I live ruthless, reckless, and rangeless (dangerous)
Don't give a fuck, my clique is ready to hang shit
Off the rack, ain't no trap
Just a bunch of motherfuckers walking with gats
Through the projects and walky-talkies
Jacking shit motherfucker ungh, that's why they bark
Like dogs, watch a nigga hard
And I be slanging dope like I'm getting paid like Lou Rollins
And the white folks can't stop this
And the Taz can't stop this nigga, cause I'm in the hood slanging rocks
Getting paid cause I'm major
And if I die fucking retire my shoes and hang up my pager
And give 4 G's to my sons and kill my enemies

Niggas (what?)
Would you ride for the cause? (hell yeah!)
Would you die for the cause? (fuckin right!)
How many niggas would ride and die for you? (we riders!)

My name manifest pain to my enemies 
Holler see-Murder and bring bitches to their knees
Violent killers ready for blood marches 
Convicted murderers with open drug charges
Strapped with semi autos and po-po's
And nickle plated slug nose and we left the Calli cause
We made niggas, raised in ghetto's and slums
Totin chips and A-K's, money round drugs (ha)
Shoot first, and leave them standing in their shoes
We TRU niggas, bounded by blood and tatooes
Infiltrating my click, fool it ain't gonna happen
Us niggas been gettin paid before we started rapping
Situation getting sticky, cause the ???? the phone
Here comes the brigade, aiming straight for your home
ain't No Limit to the motherfucking thang, we a click
We rowdy, many niggas in the TRU click

[Chorus]
We riders
No Limit niggas
We riders 
We TRU niggas

We real niggas

We thug niggas (2X)

How many niggas want to ride and get paid
I plan to sell a hundred million records in four days
Gangstas make the world go round
But TRU niggas make gangsta shit go down
We come in your set flip your dope and get rich
Take over your block and your spot with number one hits
Money and power, ha, give me the world
Cause after dollars no cents, only time will tell
Ha, I'm goin through somethangs, fool, so stop hatin
You live for weed and money, I live for greens and bacon
And I ain't takin no shorts with my ghetto d
I stick to plan be	 and keep my eyes on my enemies
And if you want some nigga come and get some
We ride bourbans and llacs when its time to attack
So throw em up if you a real soldier
I'll make you say uhhhhh, I thought I told ya

Yeah check this shit out. This is for all my real tank dogs 
My No Limit soldiers out there buying my shit 
Ya know this is for you you hear me? 
Show me love 
When you see me on the TV show me love 
On the video 
I got a tank around my chest representing my home 
I'm asking all the haters to leave me alone 
And uh much love to the calliope 
I'm at the Soul Train awards representing my court 
I did a show up in Texas with facing the boys 
South park, fifth ward, nigga bringing the noise 
Front row, nigga tatooed with TRU on his arm 
That's props, that's why I put it in this song 
Went to Cleveland for a three day tour 
At the party at the tele couldn't take no more 
My autograph sessions at the main event 
Thanking all my friends for the money they spent 
At the radio they loving my beats 
Ninety-three while we be mean green streats 
And my success goes to the man above 
But uh, I'd like to thank my fans for showing me love 
Show me love

Show me love 
All my niggas on the eastside 
Show me love 
All my niggas on the westside

When I was underground everybody down 
Everybody show me love, cause I share common ground 
With those niggas that was broke they laughed and joked 
Them niggas was broke too but I'm a rapper so they think I'm not 
supposed to 
But they still on my team cause I got fame 
And everywhere I go people be yappin my name 
Yeah I know Mac, we go back, me and that nigga tight 
As a matter of fact he slept at my house the other night 
It's cool I let a lot of shit go cause I'm ambitious 
When I'm fed up, nigga, I'm vicious 
Hard to stay focused around these motherfucking locusts 
And not to mention all the cochroaches 
Crab ass niggas hate to see you lead a barrel 
Signed me a contract and got me a Camaro 
And now they acting like I did them wrong by progressing 
I'm guessing that they wanted me to stay up in sections with little 
pocket 
money 
To get a nigga who was going my way 
y'all niggas don't know, I got so much shit I won't say 
I'm damn near breaking in tears as I'm speaking these words 
This same motherfucker from the third, show me love nigga 
Ya heard me, to all my niggas on the southside

It's four in the morning, mamma got tears in her face 
Love from my tombstone try to relocate 
But in my tank lord I got faith 
Five hundred dollars or so for my block 
Lord knows I couldn't stop 
That's a long way from bad credit cards and selling rocks 
For the love I've got and in return I'm putting it down 
Chi town, on my gd's, on six and thirty hos 
And my vl's on the westside 
I ride with jack time ballers 
Drink alazay (?) and hennessee with Jakeville shot callers 
I'm gettin love from niggas on Breakstreet 
And Watts, and Cappanella park and LA

That's a long damn way from the parkway

You gotta survive out here
You need a strong mind to do the shit I do
You ever seen something blown up before
See that nigga cross the street in that Cutlass
Check this out

[Chorus x2]
Survival of the fittest, respect my come up
Survival of the fittest, you better not run up

I remember back in 89 a nigga used to steal
And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

[Chorus x2]

Started in this game at the age of thirteen
Getting paid making money serving crack to the fiends
Hoes couldn't take me, niggaz gave me jealous looks
To the world I was a man, to the feds I was a crook
Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise
Shooting niggaz til we die, Gambino's on the rise
My nigga Fiend up by my side, my enemy bound to die
Got no mercy in my eyes label Gotti one of the realest

[Chorus x2]

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

[Verse 1: Master P]
I remember back in the days it wasn't like that
Everybody knew everybody, now days it ain't like that
We used to stand on the corners and drink brew 
Now days you gotta duck when they drive through
Cause they blastin', life is like plastic
But who would be the next egg took out the easter basket
Is it you, me, or her or she or he? 
who would live to see the long age of 23? 
Cause once you dead and gone who gives a damn
On your tombstone would read Rest In Peace Sam  
But in the ghetto you cooked 'till you dead 
Ain't no love when you dead and gone cause you red 
Like roaches for the gutter, peanut butter
your life in the gutter , fool cause you fluttered 
With this game that I spit, shoot out, don't quit 
Now you a victim of society another statistic
I heard the gunshots rain from the middle of the street 
The gun-smoke cleared three people on the concrete
I mean it's crazy, slippin' on daisies
Time to call it quits, they done put a bullet in a baby

[Verse 2: Master P]
Watch you back in the ghetto black 
Open the box, Mom's ain't nothing to eat 
Back in the day, I thought we was a family
My little brother on the street corner selling crack 
Only 15 used to be a quarterback
I wish the law would rehabilitate my auntie 
I came home try to visit that girl tried to do me
Started tweakin' said that she needed crack
Stole my grandma's rent money out her purse black
I stay Tru 2 Da Game you devils' can't see me 
I put that on my mom, I put that on my gold teeth   
My homies bangin' ,no respect for the American flag
But they kill over that blue and red rag

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Master P]
I remember back in the day smoking weed was the everyday drug
Now days they shoot heroin and sell blood 
Back in the day catchin' the clamps was gettin' us shot 
Now days catch the AIDS and your time will stop
My lil' homies doin' time, 25 with a L
A victim of the system, I'd rather die and go to hell 
I try to be legit and start my own company
Till these sucker want to bump into P
They point the finger at me for tellin' another what to do
How could another person tell you what to do
I could tell you to rob or steal or kill 
that's like pointin' the finger at Jack or Jill
For being the first person on this little earth
Is like askin' Mary why she had to give birth
And who would be the next victim to lose his life 
And who would be the next one to make a life
But when you make a life you gotta learn to teach your kid
So one day they can grow up and make it big
But all this gangbangin' and turf wars gotta cease
Cause y'all know we livin' in the last days G

Gotta show them I ain't fakin'
'cause if these other niggas get me for some bacon

I started counting my dope
Everything was cool black
Headed to the front
Got them fiends walkin' in the back
I ain't even trippin'
Ain't no time to serve these fiends
I got 40 g's and two fuckin' keys
Headed to the bienz to put the fuckin' cash up
Jumped on the freeway nigga fuckin' dashed bro
Think I see the rollers behind me through the rear-view

But I ain't even trippin' 'cause I ran through clear view
Stopped at Egg-Zone tried to get some gas
That's when I see two robbers on my ass
Played it all cold
Told be	 to get that pistol
Jumped back in the bienz shoulda seen they head whistle
I went back to the house and my homie want some flour
I ain't Scarface but got the money and the power
They call me Nino Brown
Or fuckin' Frank Nitty

But if you come up short
There's gonna be some shit up in my city

To pick up a few things
And I was reaching for some Cheerios
When I heard someone say my name
I knew exactly who it was
My heart started to race
I turned around my legs got weak
When I saw her face

There stood the girl that broke my heart
Just a year ago
I thought that I was over her
But little did I know
That running into her like that
Would leave me in a total mess
Wishing that we never said goodbye

And if I wasn't standing in that store I might have laid right on that floor and cried
I heard that voice I saw that smile
Clean up on aisle five

She ran over and hugged my neck
I didn't want her to let go
She smiled and said I looked just like a kid
With my box of Cheerios

Which wasn't all that smart
Cause it just left me with an emptiness

Saw her walking on the side of the highway alone.
It was raining like hell and I kept telling myself
""Not my problem, keep on driving, just like everybody else.""
Why should I be the one pulling over on the shoulder at night?
It's just a dog, right?

From the cab of my truck, to the foot of my bed, 
To a new pair of boots that she chewed in shreds.
Digging holes in the yard, chasing cars down the street
Till one got her and when I found her, I thought it hit me.
Took half of my savings to save her, and I didn't think twice.
It's just a dog, right?

Just an old mutt riding shotgun, getting my seats all muddy.
Just the one who I come home to, just my best fishin' buddy.

We were walking that spring in the sand on the beach.
You know she was the reason, Amy walked up to me.
She lost her place on the couch, but she kept her cool.
She was crazy about Amy and she knew I was too.
And the night that girl left me, she kept me from losing my mind.
But it's just a dog, right?

It's 83° today and man I can hardly wait 
To get this truck down to the lake, I bet the bass' are hittin'.
Boats in my rear view mirror, got my tackle box and all my gear,
The wind is right, the sky is clear, there's only one thing missin'.

Just an old mutt riding shotgun, getting my seats all muddy.

Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?

That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry

Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?

I can remember back in the day
if you bit another nigga
you was considered a biter
Non-originality, simply disrespectin' a true rider
Nigga, I'm fired up
Nigga, keep on bitin' the Bone
and your jaw'll get wired up
Keep on lovin' my song
but my nigga, you ain't Bone
Can you understand what's wrong?
Better get on
Sayin' you been flowin' since back in the day
Some of you was
Well okay, but whatever it was you were stressin'
It wasn't effecting nobody like this way
Hit me, so niggas can miss me with they drama
Tell them all like Willie-D told niggas
""Bitch, play with your mama. 'Cause I'm not your toy.""
So nigga don't test me, cause Krayzie ain't no sample
But really, could you handle
Big old slugs from these here magnum?
Ever since we came with Thuggish Ruggish Bone
Niggas been comin' up out the woods singin'
We stole they flow and song
If that's the case then why when we kick
Wicked shit, muthafuckas all like it?
And then why when you come tryin' to kick my shit
I can tell you strugglin' tryin'?
And back in the day how many niggas
Was really claimin' to be thugs?
Niggas was gangstas
So what the fuck done changed 'em? Huh?
What really be fuckin' my head up
Is when one nigga do somethin', come up
Make a Little bit of money, somebody all on your nuts
I'm keepin' it real, and bitch
If you Feel I'm talkin' bout you
Then it must be the guilt
I think we should give them the murder treatment
Yeah, that should learn 'em, baby

Oh, oh, we gonna kill them with the big shotgun
Yeah, fuck why'all niggas who's talkin', nigga
Niggas talkin' shit over here, nigga
Fuck why'all niggas wantin' to do it

Aw shit, these niggas done started over here
They talkin' shit, say we ain't rappin' (What?)
Niggas has got the nerve, and look who platinum
Niggas been runnin' off at the mouth
Before they think and look at the reality
I'm a speak on it, so bitch, be mad at me
Now first of all, why'all can't even talk
why'all need to go get your speech right
And then while you at it
You need quit samplin' that bullshit
And get your beats tight
Let's meet up at midnight in the alley
Where nobody knowin' what's happenin'
What's happenin?
You want to pull out some guns or do some rappin'?
A nigga don't want no problems
But then if he wants to cause it - a nine millimeter
Dawed-off, a .380, TEC-9, comin' out my closet
Probably only have to pull a muthafuckin' twenty-two
Probably just say ""Boo!""
And watch you niggas scuffle, scatter everywhere
Them niggas up outta there
That studio shit been known
To give niggas like you wig-splits
I hear you talkin', woofin' nigga
But I really can't feel shit
Now face it, nigga, rap just ain't the same
Especially since my Mo Thug family encountered the game
The fame is pain, for this I'll pay the price
And niggas tryin' to take my life
Always feelin' violent vibes
Just because I'm shinin' now
In the hood, it was sarcastic shit like
""You paid now, been awhile since you came around.""
So you tellin' me that I ain't down?
But first of all, when I was broke as fuck
You niggas did not give a fuck
Now all of the sudden
Ya lovin' me when we drunk, playa hata
We know who you are, can find out where you live
Better protect your kids
Fuck it, let's blow up his crib

I lived in darkness for years
And barely can see through the smoke
At the end of my rope from sellin' that dope
Been makin' them dumb-dums out of soap
And I hope to be a better man
Never did I understand what I had
My attitude mad, young and bad
Fila, Levis still sportin' the sag
Walkin' the streets, lightweight thinkin'
Plottin', worryin' my Mama to death
Want to go home, but somethin' won't let me
'Cause I know she got problems her chest
It's a struggle, a puzzle the pieces so scattered
We find 'em, take your time and put it together
Nigga, quit walkin' around like you're blinded
Put your mind on your money, thug
Don't worry about what you got
Open your eyes, and peep the plot
Say your prayers, achieve a lot
Nigga, don't stop 'til you drop
Somewhere in a box, locked and buried
Other than that, my nigga, just smile
And don't worry (don't worry)

And I want you to know (I want you know, yeah)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(You know it ain't easy, you know it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks

Bow my head, askin' the Lord for change
Since I started sellin' 'cane
Shit ain't been the same
Began to acknowledge my bang ways
Who can I blame?
Maybe my pain, dealin' with it by callin' it a phase
These are the last days
Carry no shame, everyday thangs
Went from sellin' cocaine to rockin' the stage
The otherside of the game
Where you're rich, my aim to fame
Strange tradin' places, you're dealin' with races
Just wouldn't it be fate
Runnin' with thug, me never replace this
The Lord, I'd like to thank you for my Mo Thug family
Sincerely yours, Thug Queen (Thug Queen)

I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all, it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, ""What you gonna do? What you gonna do?""
I said, ""I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know.""
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me
Through the stormy weather
Our families got together and stay strong
But you gotta keep your head up high
'Cause there ain't no reason
Why you got to let it down
Just look around, we platinum bound (bound, bound)

And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(It ain't easy, you know, you know ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain to the otherside of the game

Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
'Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors.

I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hard times
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they want to ask me,
""Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?""
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game.

Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battle scars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

And I want you to know (to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Through the rain, through the clouds
Through the thunderbolts)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(And we can't blame it on the rain, no)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain

Suckin' up the love, Doggouse and Mo' Thug

As I muscle through scrubs, congregatin'
Makin' my pressence ""Oh what a essence""
I ain't stressin' 'bout no second hand ass nigga with suggestions
Hey holla Mo' Thug (Mo' Thug)
Haters hold up, you know what?
I think that's Ken Dawg
Yep, show love
With the Big Snoop D-O
Smoke until we P-O
Players we came, together to get this money 'fore we G-O
They love me for that
They know I'm in love with the scratch
I hear a million niggas hollin' how they want a contract
I analyze'd all, information exposed in the air
Judge it for myself and told you my response as a player
Set up and had it, stretched out
World wide spread
All the way from the 2-1-6 to the 2-1-3 here

You better believe a nigga be stompin' in my big black boots
Lil' Lay and Snoop comin' though and I thought you knew
Niggaz gon' do what they do
And I play this game like I bring it
Do this shit cause I mean it
Seen it come together so clean, shit
Do you know who I'm the team wit?
Only them, real live players from the block to the stage
Keepin' it locked and gettin' payed
Nothin' but thugs in our ways
It's them polished pimpin' players
Poppin' pistols packin' drama
I'm a put it like this
Pretty much I'm that nigga that'll bomb ya
If you want it, you can get it
Information, let me hit it
Can you feel me, nigga you dig it?
If you wit it, nigga what is it?
It's just them doggs in the house and mo' and mo' comin' in
So nigga blaze it, raise the roof
Nigga lights, camera, action
Cause that's what's happenin'
Real niggas unite
And do it right, cause if you don't
You might not get it twice

Fuckin' with Cleveland, yeah, here to fold ya

Lover of this man, greed, indeed
Sayin' you love to fuck, and smoke all his weed
Hey, that's the way life goes for these hoes
Playa, the next thing to stay up on your toes
Cause-a, like I told ya these hoes got game
Runnin' down a line of niggas like an Amtrak train

Mission impossible, cause these hoes simply incapable
Goin' for the cash, and dash first chance available
Bitch, really understand me

What the fuck? These niggas tryin' to rob
Undercover setup bitch behind a job

Now, I gotta wet up this bitch
Hope in the meantime, this ho get hit
Damn, ain't no reason for the games that you play

No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat

Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart

It's gonna cost ya (it's gonna cost ya)
In a coffin, and aroused up (gotcha)
Tossed up, bust the lead, bring the guns
If you're hittin' hard, I be hittin' hard

Niggas droppin' like bricks
And I'm not to be fucked with
Click's so thick, we split you off, ripped
Nigga, go in your pockets, and I take your chips
Bitch, I flip the script, or straight dip
Steady mobbin' to the next spot
After we wreck, shot call
The line's so long it's to the next block
Roll a Lex coupe, so swoop, and Benz drop-top
Niggas be starin', tryin' to see what Mo Thug got
Picture me rollin', strollin'
Nigga with a posse full of platinum players
Everywhere it's smoke in the air
Nigga cross town on the way to the Clair
Even down the way, they smoke a pound a day
With my diamonds on the world
Comin' through a nigga hood
Niggas got sacks, tryin' to kick it, blueback
Soldiers, sell me somethin' good
Now I'm feelin' alright
Do it all night long
Kick it to the break of sunlight
If it ain't done right, nigga we come hype
Sendin' niggas invitations to a gunfight
Nigga, bring it on
Souljah Boy and Layzie Bone gonna stay lookin'
Lovely with about fifty million niggas
That'll pump me, bump me
'Cause, nigga, it must be

Mo Thugs Family,"Lil' Lay, hey (Yeah, yeah)
What's up playas (What's happenin' out there?)
Thugstas, and hustlas?
(Yeah, yeah, it's all real, yeah)

And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Oh, you know it ain't easy
Yeah, you know it ain't easy)

I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game

I lived in darkness for years
And barely can see through the smoke
At the end of my rope from sellin' that dope
Been makin' them dumb-dums out of soap
And I hope to be a better man
Never did I understand what I had
My attitude mad, young and bad
Fila, Levis still sportin' the sag
Walkin' the streets, lightweight thinkin'
Plottin', worryin' my Mama to death
Want to go home, but somethin' won't let me
'Cause I know she got problems her chest
It's a struggle, a puzzle the pieces so scattered
We find 'em, take your time and put it together
Nigga, quit walkin' around like you're blinded
Put your mind on your money, thug
Don't worry about what you got
Open your eyes, and peep the plot
Say your prayers, achieve a lot
Nigga, don't stop 'til you drop
Somewhere in a box, locked and buried
Other than that, my nigga, just smile
And don't worry (don't worry)

And I want you to know (I want you know, yeah)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(You know it ain't easy, you know it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks

Bow my head, askin' the Lord for change
Since I started sellin' 'cane
Shit ain't been the same
Began to acknowledge my bang ways
Who can I blame?
Maybe my pain, dealin' with it by callin' it a phase
These are the last days
Carry no shame, everyday thangs
Went from sellin' cocaine to rockin' the stage
The otherside of the game
Where you're rich, my aim to fame
Strange tradin' places, you're dealin' with races
Just wouldn't it be fate
Runnin' with thug, me never replace this
The Lord, I'd like to thank you for my Mo Thug family
Sincerely yours, Thug Queen (Thug Queen)

I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all, it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, ""What you gonna do? What you gonna do?""
I said, ""I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know.""
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me
Through the stormy weather
Our families got together and stay strong
But you gotta keep your head up high
'Cause there ain't no reason
Why you got to let it down
Just look around, we platinum bound (bound, bound)

And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(It ain't easy, you know, you know ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain to the otherside of the game

Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
'Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors.

I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hard times
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they want to ask me,
""Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?""
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game.

Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battle scars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

And I want you to know (to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Through the rain, through the clouds
Through the thunderbolts)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(And we can't blame it on the rain, no)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(We can make it through the pain)
I can make it through the pain

But potato chips in about a month
On the block losin' focus
In the front of the church, sellin' dope
Feelin' hopeless, copeless, 'cause I'm homeless
Shit, I gotta serve to eat
Feel the Lord hate me

Stay intoxicated so my problem don't overweigh me

Basically, helpin' my enemies
Destroy me and my self-esteem

Can take your place (that's right)

I don't give me love to just anybody
If I'm not correct, then prove me wrong and, just hold on

Is it really all good? You serious (I'm serious)

Jede Zeile bricht die Schweigepflicht
Straight aus dem Bauch entweder schrei ich oder schrei ich nicht
Könntest du mir freiwillig den Wagen geben
Sonst muss ich dich schlagen, treten, das ist mir
Schon immer scheißegal gewesen
Überfahr dich, park deine Scheißkarre in Holland
Könnte einfach so am Zollamt vorbeifahren auf'm Roller
Bring das Weed nach hause, erzähl nix von Weedverkaufen du Fisch
Du kannst viel behaupten, doch du existierst überhaupt nicht für mich

Ich will wirklich nicht cholerisch sein
Doch wenn ich spitte wirkt sogar Kinski gegen mich pflegeleicht
Ich knebel deinen Eselarsch
Mach wirbel in Amerika
Asien, Europa, den Mond erober ich nächstes Jahr
Wenn du zu frech wirst vergrab ich dich im Rasen, Ficker
Ja ich bin ein psychopatischer Killer, ein Wahnsinniger
Dein Label dehnt deinen Anus, du kommst dir wie 'n großer Star vor
Du hast jetzt Top10 Hits aber dafür hast du so ein Arschloch
Du bist fake, phony und du lügst in deinem Text
Image kann Realität nicht ersetzen wie Cybersex
Dein Produzent bitet Timbaland seinen Sohn
Ganz ehrlich, so ein Arschloch ist verantwortlich für deine Produktion?
Nich dein Ernst, ihr seid sehr behaarte Hinterwäldler
Und im falschen Beruf wie ein pädophiler Kindergärtner
Du machst auf Zuhälter und sagst du hättest 50 Huren
Suchst aber gleichzeitig deinen Penis mit 'ner Wünschelrute

Ist das zu fassen?
Du lachst wenn du große Schwänze in den Arsch kriegst
Doch du bist so bescheuert, dass du dir nichmal über die Konsequenzen klar bist
Dir fehlt die Basis, der Stil und der Flow

Einfach untrennbar, undenkbar wenn es anders wär, gib das Lenkrad her
Du dumme Sau, du wirfst dein bisschen Grips aus dem Fenster

Tu auf cool, doch du kommst nicht an wie 'n Athlet der den Start schwänzt
Und sag, was fürn Feature? Niemals, nein, leck mich doch am Arsch, Mensch!
Ich behandel dich wie im Zuchthaus
Quäl und verhör dich denn du störst mich
Auf dir warn mehr Gays als auf nem Friseurtisch
Und du bist des Wahnsinns, gehst zum Arzt
Weil du nicht mehr normal bist, tust als würd bei dir was gehn

Dass seine Bitch gerade mit mir Party macht

Mo Trip,"Wenn die Scheiße schief läuft

Ich erzähl euch von 'nem Jungen
Der nie ernst genommen wurde
Tief im Innern plante er schon seit Jahren den ersten zu Ermorden
Denn zu Erst waren's nur Worte, es hat Witze geregnet
Doch mit der Zeit wurden 's Tritte und Schläge
Er wusste nicht mal weswegen
Und so begann er langsam sich um sein Leben zu hassen
Griff sich die Pläne und dachte: „nicht überlegen und machen“
Der Kleine hatte ja schon immer einen Fabel [?] für Waffen
So hat er sich dann geplant sich in Richtung Kollegium zu machen
Er hatte vor die Wichser nicht Überleben zu lassen
Auch die Zeugen killen, um sie nicht drüber reden zu lassen
„Nach diesem Tag wird alles anders sein“, sagt er sich
Nie wieder Tageslicht, das macht ihn wahnsinnig
Es wird nicht Jugendfrei, von wegen ""mir kann Nichts passieren""
Ich hab 'ne Kugel bei für jeden der mich schikaniert
Noch ist nichts passiert, ich kann dich verstehen
Es gibt immer einen anderen Weg, komm wir gehen jetzt

Immer tiefer in den Dreck
Niemand pflegt deine Wunden, wenn der Weg nur nach unten führt
Immer tiefer in den Dreck,
Versunken im Sumpf und du suchst nach 'nem Grund dafür
Du wirst verrückt, denn das Glück hält nicht an jedem fest
Du fragst dich, warum Gott dich noch am Leben lässt
Du schiebst Krise, denn du steckst immer Tiefer in den Dreck
Du willst nichts lieber als da weg, komm wir gehen jetzt,

Ich erzähl' euch von 'nem Bullen, der nicht grade bleiben konnte
Alles was ihn interessierte, waren die Zahlen auf seinen Konten
Alles was er wissen wollte, war wie er seine Mücken kriegt
Ihm war egal, ob er seinen Partner in den Rücken fiel
Und eines Tages saß er nachts in seinem Wagen
Und bemerkte in der Ferne eine Waffenübergabe
Alles klar, er holt ihn rechts raus
Ich könnt dich ficken, wie 'ne Exfrau,
Doch heute bin ich eigentlich auf Cash aus
Also drückt er beide Augen zu und lässt ihn fahren
Ich weiß genau wie du, dass die Idee nicht seine Weste war
Für ein paar Scheine hat er viel riskiert
Zuhause hat er Frau und Kind
Wer viel besitzt, der kann auch viel verlieren
Oder was ist, wenn man ihn erwischt?
Wenn was passiert, soll er auspacken oder hält er lieber dicht?
Es hat schon oft geklappt, doch diesmal nicht
An diesem Abend da erreichte diese Nachricht ihn wie ein tiefer Stich
Sein Junge war von seiner Schule nicht mehr heimgekehrt
In den Akten, war sein kleiner Sohn nur einer mehr
Was ist Schicksal? Es lag in seiner Hand
Schon allein der Gedanke macht ihn krank, komm wir gehen jetzt

Immer tiefer in den Dreck,
Niemand pflegt deine Wunden, wenn der Weg nur nach unten führt
Immer tiefer in den Dreck,
Versunken im Sumpf und du suchst nach 'nem Grund dafür
Du wirst verrückt, denn das Glück hält nicht an jedem fest
Du fragst dich, warum Gott dich noch am Leben lässt
Du schiebst Krise, denn du steckst immer Tiefer in den Dreck
Du willst nichts lieber als da weg, komm wir gehen jetzt,

Ein falscher Schritt, dein Leben ändert sich komplett
Du denkst an alles, doch vergisst dabei den Schmetterlingseffekt
Du gibst ein F-Fick auf jeden, hast für alle keine Zeit,
Doch sei dir sicher, irgendwann holt die Vergangenheit dich ein
Manchmal dauert es nicht lange, bis ein Messer in dir steckt
Du denkst an alles, doch vergisst dabei den Schmetterlingseffekt
Und du könntest aus den Fehlern lernen, niemand ist perfekt
Doch es zieht dich immer tiefer in den Dreck, komm wir gehen jetzt

Immer tiefer in den Dreck,
Niemand pflegt deine Wunden, wenn der Weg nur nach unten führt
Immer tiefer in den Dreck,
Versunken im Sumpf und du suchst nach 'nem Grund dafür
Du wirst verrückt, denn das Glück hält nicht an jedem fest
Du fragst dich, warum Gott dich noch am Leben lässt

Neben Babahasen paffen und paar Tüten verkaufen

Als ich das erste Mal am Boden mit 'ner Platzwunde lag
Und auch nicht als die Cops mit ihren Wachhunden kamen
Ich probierte es mit Arbeit und saß acht Stunden da
Ich entschied mich dann für Rap und bin auch all die Jahren drangeblieben
Sodass ich sagen kann, ich bin auf keinen angewiesen
Das Viertel wollt' mich runterziehen und machte mich müde
Doch ich kam aus jeder Zwickmühle
Guck doch, Mann, mein Vater ging zu früh und das hat Scherben hinterlassen
Mit drei konnt' ich nicht sagen, „Ma, wir werden es verkraften!“
Wir zogen in der Viertel und das ohne jene Mittel
Doch ich blute deine Tränen und würde sterben für dein Lachen

Ich guck' immer noch zum Fenster, wenn mich deine schöne Stimme ruft
Ja, ich weiß, im Viertel geht es nicht mit rechten Dingen zu

Rennen deswegen ständig hier entlang und zählen die Batzen
Ich saß lange an den Tasten, was ist Gold und all der Dreck hier wert?
Ich wollte keine Texte mehr für andere verfassen
Mein Bruder riet mir, Gott sei Dank, es nicht zu lassen
Denn das, was ich brachte, überstieg die anderen um Klassen
Wie sie anfangen, dich zu hassen, wenn du anfängst, was zu schaffen
Sie wollen dich nicht sehen mit Para in den Taschen
Ich blick' immer noch zum Fenster raus, bin immer noch ein Rapstar

Chillen in der Mensa oder driften in 'nem Benzer

Shit ain't been the same

Maybe my pain, dealin' with it by callin' it a phase
These are the last days
Carry no shame, everyday thangs
Went from sellin' cocaine to rockin' the stage

Where you're rich, my aim to fame
Strange tradin' places, you're dealin' with races
Just wouldn't it be fate
Runnin' with thug, me never replace this

Sincerely yours, Thug Queen (Thug Queen)

I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all, it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, ""What you gonna do? What you gonna do?""
I said, ""I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know.""
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me
Through the stormy weather
Our families got together and stay strong

Why you got to let it down

Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
'Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors.

I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hard times
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they want to ask me,
""Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?""
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game.

Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battle scars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

And I want you to know (to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Through the rain, through the clouds
Through the thunderbolts)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(And we can't blame it on the rain, no)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(We can make it through the pain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game",Otherside/Otherside (Outro),1998

Through the days into the night

I've been patient for so long cause 

All this time that I've been waiting 
For this moment to come alive 
And all my life I've known for sure 
That you'd be coming back for more 

Forever, never gonna let it go forever

Let it take me where I want to be 
Where everybody moved slowly 

And the world was silently asleep

Show me all that I never knew before

Moa,"I wish that everything
Could be the way it was
But too many things have changed
Time has come, to fulfill promises
Touching came easy
But holding takes more

We shall overcome...

I cry, but I've run out of tears
You used to lick them dry
To ease my pain
Do what it takes to make me
Cry again
Tears are the fruits of unconsciousness

We shall overcome...

I smile, but it's lost without you
You used to make me smile within
My heart
Do what it takes to make me smile again
You know the secrets, you made the code

We shall overcome...
",Overcome,1998
Moa,"You only live twice or so it seems
One life for yourself and one for your dreams
You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is it's name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice
Make one dream come true, you only live twice
You only

When we first kissed
And you looked into my eyes

We're rockets on a journey
Exploring me and you

I wish that we could land
On the dark side of the moon

And for a day the world was ours
I will never forget although time may pass by
How you came to me so tenderly

The night was cold and it felt so old
Until you came with your youthful flame
And suddenly like freed from spell
The night felt young and hot again

And now that time has passed
I still remember your tenderness
Just the thought brings the warmest breeze to my memory
When you came to me so tenderly

Touch me again so tenderly
And I'll survive every day
Cause I'm burning inside, by your sparkling side
Since you came to me so tenderly

Are you there to strike my chords
Do we exist or are we tripping

Take a chance if you feel free
Somewhere, do you feel me

That shake the hottest towns
We make the hottest sounds
And make the parties bounce

And venomous Jizzow

On a Phat fam trip
With more kicks
Than foot locker
Your boots been rocking
Keeping it up in this mother
Your style's fake
Like it get sarcasm
Every time you knock her
It's urgent for us to be
Submerging from the underworld
We the chosen ones
You don't believe me
Ask the oracle
Read the chironicles of this
Mad rapper slash whoever
Yo we fam?
Yeah we fam
And keep it
Through this endeavour
This mission we ain't preaching
Just need to split some knowledge
Time to put fake noise
Wise in cold storage
We beyond
It's your time

And those cast that filling me
Like all your fans

Squealing me
The stress is killing me
But remain the trendsetter
Like when push comes
To hold ups jeans
You should know better

She never yawn
To remind you of my name
Every time you be counting

I got some assumption
Now an era of submission
On this repercussion
I superscript patch on
Equipped and all ready
Then everybody best believe
That you fly

Caught a chick do that thang
Better keep to my slang
Got a gig to be hang
Rather be with my friends
Got you sick when I sang
Would you stick to my fang
Bet you flip I say so

Better be prepared
With a red carpet
Gotta move my steps
Taking off your hat
Show me some respect
Doing as I said
Everything's the fact
Flip that and so we roll

Save the best for last
Coming through
The only crew capable of
Taking this track
To critical mass
We got you open
Off the lines
That we be quoting
Exploding
We leave the venue
With the stage broken
That no sugar coating
Long rage we snipe
Scoping up close
With mic cords choking
Deliver the final blow

With melted wax vinyl flows
Oh,its time to go

All you need to know is the vibe round' here we built and instill it
Sean Paul alongside
Fabolous, you done know we bust
Telling them again, hey!
Girl run away the guy that wants to ""vibe kill"" it
She say a only the ""topper"" youth and ""dapper"" youth she want (to) win it
Fabolous!

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Lets get it ta' poppin' ma, its a little before 1
And I'm yellin' out hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yo
I can tell by the ring in the middle of ya tongue
You're the kinda girl that has a little bit more fun
I'm literally yours hun
Cause' I never seen a ass so big with a waist as little as yours hun
And by the expressions on them hotties grills
I know they want to holla at somebody real
And I'm usually lookin' for somebody skilled
Enough to make a nigga say aye aye aye yo niggas get mad 'cause I may slay they hoe
But I don't want to let the a.k. spray so
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten' me
I do this every year so I ain't never scared
I do this everywhere and you ain't never there
They sayin' this everywhere, how could you never hear

[Chorus: Sean Paul]
If you want to roll with the thugs tonight
Lights, camera, action can you feel the hype
Hit cruise control blazed Kryptonite
Well its alright, baby its alright
If you want to live up and free your life
Come through let we kick it 'til a morning light
If you want to roll with tha thugs tonight
Well its alright, baby its alright

[Verse 2: Sean Paul]
So get with it, we want (to) hit it, we nah quit it
And I like tha way you body set and how your clothes fit it
I want you give me some of it because minute by minute
Temperature it all a rise because you thighs and all you hips, style
You shockin' it, you a rock it, you a kill it
And a one thing the Dutty Paul want to predict
Say by tha end of tha night you will be chillen' with tha click
Flossin' it, money we tossin' it
'Cause we a tha Boss in it
We naw ease up...We ain't stallin', grab the girls all in
That's my true callin'
Ya'll freeze up.. We be flowin' it,
Your girl knowin' it And that's why she's showin' it.

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Over here the liquor is light blue, the chronic is light green
They wearin' the right shoe, they put on the tight jeans
They bringin' me right through', I walk with a slight lean
My style excites you, I know what that might mean
Aye, I'ma freaky scorpio
Yo, tryna' leave with your skio
Aye, but its mandatory tho'
Yo' after me let shorey go

But that's another story tho'
But please don't try to bring us to the Maury show
How cool is he?
You don't know a fool who be crazy enough to fool with me
You'd rather swim in a pool of pee
Then see the one you love in the vehicle with me
Aye

Is that yo' hoe? She feelin' our style
We come through the spot real heavy on the waist
So when they wanna move, we put 'em in they place

Yo, I was schooled by the hood, raised by the wolves
Trained by the pain, adopted by guerrillas
Gotta tank for a car, ice for a arm
Got tattoos wit skin and scars from brawls

Got a buildin' for a crib, Manhattan for a backyard
Skyscraper ladies, they fuck me when they man gone
Kings of New York, I'm one of the few of those
Difficulties to come, it's gon' be funerals

You get a quiet spot in the shade, for a grave
I get paid 'cause I got murder 'fore sixteen
And I'm so much rich, I got a condo for a piggy bank
So much stash, I just laugh at your face

Blow a stack on David 'cause I'ma pyro
Maniac from carriage, wit' the Rolls Gold
I was told by the O.G.'s like my Pops
If you can't whip they ass, then niggaz get shot

Hustled by the bus stop, aged to the front stop
Block party departed, somebody got bodied
Right before I snatch this little number from my hottie

Yeah, young dude wit jewels and barrel lens
Heavy bones on the deuce, flickin' it up in the mix
Fast forward to O6, gettin' head in the O6
Have a chick, feelin' like she workin' out on that Bow-Flex

I'm focused, looked through my lens, see my vision
Surprise myself and came through without one spool missin'
From that hallway kissin', there was room in the Carlton
I can smell it in the air, P in that next room sparkin'

Me, I let that heady flow, meet me at the tele' hoe
You don't do the tele', oh, fuck it bitch you gotta go
Workin' wit a lot of dough and a little bit of time
Bitch I wanna fuck, I don't wanna know what's on your mind

Never fakin moves, motherfucker run the jewels

You say yo shorty trauma, what's all the drama?
I shoot em up like their last name was Farmer
Shorty got the death wish, I wish to die
But when I try, it just goes by
You couldn't kill me because I can't kill myself
And if I got beef then I got it for self
And if I catch a body, I catch it for self
To me, murder is good for the health
Little man paranoid, Mr. Schizophrenic
Thirty-five niggas wanna funk, don't panic
Just shoot a head up, or take your beatin like a man
Or pull a burner if you want a longer lifespan
That's how I see it if I gotta die so be it
But maybe one day, my luck'll run out though
Until then, I couldn't give a FUCK yo

Gimme some space, I'm hittin hearts, street sweeper
A little crazed nigga from the streets
Raised in the ghetto, I'm puttin out heads yo
I'm open, time to catch wreck, put em in check
Snap his neck, grab his loot then jet
Who's next to be a victim - easily ripped up
Get ready to run when I ripped em
Drop to the floor, feel the wrath of the drug war
Call me a thug who gets buck when I want more

Who's that nigga standin with the jewels?
Throw on my hood, cock back the tool
Just to get a rep, yea you god damn right
Just lick lick shots cause I don't fuck with fights
Back on the ave, and five-oh arrive
Chalk on the ground where the motherfucker died
Niggas know who did it but ain't nobody snitchin
No word of to myself, if they do, I'm flippin the script
Settin it off, yo, put em in a dopefiend
And cut em up like protein

Set it some bitch-ass nigga, I'm widdit

My shit is real, I had to pioneer in this
Around the way, all the fake niggas fear this
Paragraphs bust your membrane
On and on I bust through like teflon
The Little P, is not to be stepped upon
And if you think so kid then you're dead wrong
Little, far from big, yo a type small kid
P, I represent the brothers from Queensbridge
To make a long rhyme short I smoke weed
Sip a forty, yo fuck the court
So bad they tried to lock me in a group home
Prodigy's hard but fuck it I can rip a ??
I catch wreck with the Einstein's intellect
And get stupid like a Stimulated Dummies mix
Feel the wrath, feel the aftermath
Even if you tooken notes, kid you couldn't pass the class
I keep a loosey in the chamber, cause beef got me shook down
Paranoid, ain't got no time to fuck around
So bypass the clock when it's time to go at it
So we can pop em off if the chumps want static

And double up on ki's and make somethin like a half-mil
Shorty's in it to get paid
No doubt, I got clout with the females
Put it in detail and write it
And if you ain't givin pussy, then bitch you ain't invited
I'm on some other shit that you couldn't fuck with
Destructive, and couldn't give a fuck kid

You gots to be on the up and up
Watch your back, pump your crack
But don't forget to re-up
A burner's your God and you pray to it all day
Then at night, you catch a body
But it's just the shit you got to do
Cause if you wasn't watchin, they'd catch your ass too
You gotta go all out if you want props
Or you can just kill a man, and it's the same for cops
Now you want a little fame from the drug game
Whether you shoot em up, or pump cracks, it's all the same
But fuck it you're in it to win it
Fat uptown, cookies in the rocks, your spot's hot
Now you're livin the life of a project sad song
Makin your loot from all the right wrongs
But that's the way it goes when you choose your path
And you might just, feel the pain of a tec 22 blast
All out war, with niggas from the next block
You're pullin out the Glock, to shut em down
Now you're Mr. Big Shot in your tribe
Niggas know your name from Mt. Vernon, to Southside
Comin from the streets of Fright
Where the only thing you'll know is how to roll it up right
And load it up, tight, you're startin a block war

Frank Nitty style, buckwild
Thirty-eight slugs from uptown thugs

But now it's a burner, used, for murder
Step a little closer and your ass is grass

But the shit ain't real unless you got that buddha filled
Chalm, keep me goin on when I perform
Charge the brain, lick em up, that's the name of the game
So it's the move when I move little smooth
On the motherfuckin mission and I just improve
Upstairs, niggas dyin on the 6th floor

Kid, watch your back, one time's comin' always (Yeah)
They lock me up for 12 days,  I can't comprehend
Now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin St.Ide's down with some Seagrams Gin
Life is like a dice game and I'm in to win

On the scene from the 41st side of Queens
We get the CREAM, laid up, love-love for dame
Cos I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim King
Doin my thing, do wild stakes my name'll reign

To all my peoples locked down comin back to life
In the world once again though ya bid was trife
While you was gone, we was goin to war and even more
Saw my man layin dead on the floor, kid I swore
That our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong(Yeah! )
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police(Where?)
Sweatin dogs as I'm runnin cross 12th Street
Just as I approach the block
I spot a jake on the creep down by Vick's weed spot(So what! )
Made a U-ey up the hill plus a change of plans
I had to hurry back so I could warn my man

Ya had me stressin little son, had my heart rapidly pumpin
Niggas start a guttin behind the bushes duckin
My ears rung, I punch a clip into the guns
Got grazed in the arm,  one slug hit my son
He was bleedin from the head, I couldn't believe it
We was defeated, if it was a case I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin(The temperature's risin)
I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin
So to P I passed the iron

Kid you ain't lyin!
I went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin
On a door to be open, goin in the building, it's a trap!
Police buckin at me, they try to twist my dome back
Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Locked the door, police grabbed me up and tryed to break my jaw
""So where's the gun we saw?""(I don't know! )
""We know you was there at the homicide scene""(I know nuttin! )
""And if it wasn't you, was somebody from ya team""

From the cradle to the grave

Yo,  it's the real drama kills, nobody moves, stand still!
Bottle you! Drop that ass off in a land-fill
Son bless me with the iron, I got beef
With some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet em with the hollow-tips
Flip em like the Gotti clip, my crew shift the body shift
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin sent up North, son I'm bett-er
Doin my dirt on a low
Fuckin wit them mobbers like a crowd
No doubt you gonna blow, you never know
He didn't even have to go there
Unprepared, now he's six below
Y'know I'm chillin, I gots no time for catchin feelings
Get that money I wants, some brothers wanna act funny
But it's all good I still die for the hood
For my peoples, yeah knock on wood

Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama what I gotta say is short not long
This nigga that I'm beginning to dislike he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit he might be dead
Know him well and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him,  cause I'll screw him
He shitted on my man and we got plans to do him
Lets get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin
Ain't no fair overhead there,  we just debatin on when and how
Later on right now, spoke to Killa yesterday
He said to chill for a while
But it's hard acting like everything is alright
I get the chills when I see that nigga in my sight
A dead man walking,  not only that he's still talkin (About what?)
About how and what he did very often
You don't know how much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin
One day my man and the next he's not
Didn't know him long anyway,  so fuck it

Don't fuck with her no more now I fuck with Tanqueray
Tanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold
Last name was English and the first name Olde
But Gold couldn't take the dick it made me lazy
We split apart and now I met this new trick Dainy
Now me and Dainy, we been together ever since
Our love combines to form a science, what is this
I bust her cherry, took her virginity in '91
Now that she's open everybody want to tap something
Go get your own don't make me have to fucking clap something
I love my shorty more than life now ain't that something
To love you Dainy more than living itself
Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
When I go pick her up they tell me put her back on the shelf
They say say yo P she only wants you for one thing that's your wealth
But I don't pay attention, cos she's my baby
The Dainy you know she drive me crazy she's my number one lady
Met her back in '89 now she's 22
Acting like she 40, she said all I need is a man to support me
Besides, you from the 41st side of things
And Queensbridge niggas be acting like they kings

Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
Said a Brinks is coming through, at Fashion Avenue
At Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew
Of motherfuckers, who ain't going out like suckers
Told me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers
I told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker
Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers
Diesel drove the the beemer, the hatchback of course
Nautica'll navigate to keep us on course
Polo's acting bolo trying to say he the Boss
I said shut the fuck up, the kid is out with the loot sack
Got a big trey pound, itching just to swoop back
Timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle
Scope is on the top so you know he living Eiffel
Took the aim of Oswald, caught him North in the Face
All them other kids they had they tools aimed at space
Levi had the snub so you know they getting laced
Donna Karan was crying, cause mad shells was flying
Damn all we want is a piece of the pie and
Nike scooped the sacks cause he moves like Air
Threw them shits up in the trunk now we up out here
Got back to the mansion, to divvy up the paper
Helly Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
So she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice
Everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice
I guess not, and Guess was hot, so guess what
Guess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut

When you play with crime sometimes it's not too fly
Even though the goods look deceiving to the eye

That's why you got to walk on by, walk on by
Walk on by, walk on by, walk on by

My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock
Now Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop
One sip I thought the bitch was a fucking warlock
The more she started giving me the stronger I got
Pushed her off to the crew then she started getting jealous
Steamed cos I spent more cream with the fellas
Fuck them niggas spend that cheese on me
See if they be around when you need pussy
Then I thought to myself yo this trick is right
Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night
I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock
Niggas started riffing why you tricking yo this shit must stop
Moms like you need to see the AA
Better hope they help your ass out on the same day
But never that, I got the shakes so I need that
Son call me stressed out I just be that
But when it comes to Henn Rock dun I need that
She's my shorty for life so fuck the feedback

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines

Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
Know wha'mean, Hav, situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse
For the cops to discover, while I be dipping in the Range Rover
All jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes trying to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low sipping Asti Spumante
Niggas try to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep letting them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got G's in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter soft leather upholestry
But mostly, keep the gat closely cause niggas wanna toast me

A-yo I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose
Sling do my thing organize fiend servants
Trying to make a mil is stress you know the deal
So we sling krills, get your cap peeled, cause everything is real
Cause I wanna chill, laid up in a jacuzzi
Sipping bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort get caught
Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost never found again my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hitting snitches off with mad stitches
Your last resting place'll be a ditch kid
No one can stop me, try your style's sloppy
You want to be me, you're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about making the green
Living up in luxury, pushing phat whips and living comfortably

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines

A drug dealer's dream
Stash CREAM keys on a triple beam
Five hundred SL green, ninety-five nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend
Murdering, numbers on your head while I'm burglaring
Shank is serving 'em, what's up to all my niggas swerving in
New York metropolis, the Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds feels like, the holy beast is watching us
Mad man my sanity is going like an hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced trying to bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you
Is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar moving on your weak production
Pumping corruption in the third world we just busting

Hold up and analyze the wildcats slang cracks
They swing an axe, the new routines, be my eyes black's
Playing corners glancing all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, feeling higher than an airplane right
Word yo, I want to get this money then blow
Take my time, blast a nine, if you front you go
Sip beers, the German ones, hand my guns to sons
Shaolin, and Queensbridge we robbing niggas for fun
But still, write my will out to my seeds then build
Mahalia sing a tale but the real we still kill

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines",Eye for a Eye (Your Beef Is Mines),1995
Mobb Deep,"Hey yo Queens get the Money long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle when the guns go blast
The fool retaliated so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now who the fuck you think is livin' to this day?
I'm tryin' to tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said ""Queen's niggas don't play. Do your thing
I'll do mine kid stay outta my way""
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
Can't stop till I'm eatin' off a platinum plate
Po po comes around and tries to relocate me
Lock me up forever but they can't deflate me cause
Havin' cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to havin' money to live with
I thought step back look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helpin' ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, and plus a cellular
Yo Big Noyd! (What up cuzin'?) I can't cope
With all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope

Yo it's the r - a double p
E - r, n - o - y - d
Niggas can't fuck with me
Comin' straight outta QB
Pushin' an Infiniti
You ask can I rip it constantly? Mentally?
Definitely, to the death of me
Come and test me
Trust me, nigga couldn't touch me if he snuff me
So bust me, you're gonna have to, cause I'mma blast you
My lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual
I'm born wit' it
I'm gettin' on wit' it
An' I'mma have it 'til I'm fuckin' dead and gone wit' it
Cause I'm a what? Composer of hardcore
A lyrical destructor
Don't make me buck ya, cause I'm a wild muthafucka
You know my flow, you know my stilo
Even pack my gat when I go to see my PO
Jump out my hooptie
Pass my gat and my lucci to my shorty
In case my PO try to troop me to the island
And if I start wildin'
Flippin' on niggas walkin' around wit' da nice gold medallions
But she didn't violate me, so I escaped see
Back to Queen's pumpin' the fiends makin' more Cream
Know what I mean? I'm a natural born hustler
Won't try to cut ya, pull out my 4 4 and bust ya

Yo babe no time for fakin' jacks
Cuz niggas who fake jacks get laid on their backs
The streets is real can't roll without steel
I feel how I feel cause I was born to kill
Do what I gotta, to eat a decent meal
Brothers is starvin', don't try to find a job son
It's all about robbin'
So don't be alarmed
When we come through, cause we supposed to
If you opposed to
Get your face blown dude, off the map
Cause I react, attack
A brother wasn't blessed with wealth so I act like that
Drug dealin'
I'm frontin on the world once I start 4-wheelin'
Cause back on the 41st side we do a ride
Sippin E & J, gettin' bent all night
Yo, who dat? I never seen him in my whole life
Step to his business cause it's only right
Po po ain't around so I grab my pound
Money retaliated so I hit the ground
My life is on the line gotta hold my projects down
Can't see myself gettin' bodied by a clown-ass nigga
That ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest and now he's layin' me down dead
And up from under the benches I started hearin' sirens
I stop firin'
He cut ass like a diamond
Jetted to the cribpiece, what a relief
Stashed the heat then proceeded to peep out the window
Call my son, ""yo son we got beef
But no question
Money had a problem so I solved him""

I got my mind on the stick-up now it's time to get paid
Thinkin' of ways to take loot already made
There's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid
Gimme yours and get laid
Give up the goods and get sprayed
I got lots of love, for my crew that is
No love for them other crews and rival kids
All them out-a-town niggas know what time it is
And if they don't they need to buy a watch

While I be sippin' gin straight in a plastic cup
On a park bench on 12th st., my whole crew's famous
You tried to bust your gat and keep it real but you nameless
First of all slow down, you on the wrong route
Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about
The street life ain't nuttin' to play with
No jokes no games kid
For years I been doin' the same shit
Just drinkin' liquor, doin' bids
Extortin' crack heads
And stickin' up the stick-up kids",Give Up the Goods (Just Step),1995
Mobb Deep,"Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Hold the fuck up

We gonna take this little intermission to listen
To what the fuck I got to say, you know

I been doing this shit for years:
Holding heat, selling
Using, abusing all kinds of drugs;
Robbing niggas, running up in niggas' cribs
You know, the whole shit

So don't ever in your life get me confused
With some of them other niggas that you might see
On TV
Or hear on the radio and such
Know what I'm saying?

I mean, this is me: P
I'm speaking for my fucking self

When you see me:
At the show
Or on stage
Or on the street
I DEFINITELY got the gat on me
You know what I'm saying?

And it ain't like I'm trying to be a tough guy
Or trying to make people think I'm crazy
By sayin' all this shit

But what it is, dat
I know how niggas gets down, alright?
I used to be in the clubs:
The Muse, The Tunnel, whatever the fuck

Niggas get they little drink on
Havin'
Fun with they little crew
(You know what I'm saying)
Start cuttin' shootin' whatever
Things like that
A lot of these so-called ""rap niggas""
Ain't never seen no parts of that shit
You know what I'm saying
You dig where I'm coming from?
Word up, yo

And I know a lot of y'all niggas
Matter of fact, all y'all niggas
Is right now listening to this shit
Is like

""We gonna see them Mobb Deep niggas
We gonna see what they about
Know what I'm saying
We gonna see where they head is at""

So yo
I'm gonna let you niggas know right now:
You ain't gotta waste your time
Or your money
On your hospital bills
And if you step to me on a personal level
I don't back down easy
There's a good chance your ass is gonna get
Shot, stabbed, or knuckled down
One out of the three

So don't gamble with your life, duke
Word up
And believe me
I know very well I could get shot, stabbed or fucked up too, whatever
I ain't ""Super Nigga"", I'm a little skinny motherfucka
It's all about who gets who first, though
You know what I'm sayin?

So therefore, say no more
To all my niggas: Get the money
Frontin' niggas get deceased

And, oh yeah, to all them rap-ass niggas
With your half-assed rhymes
Talking about how much you get high, how much weed you smoke
And that crazy space shit that don't even make no sense
Don't ever speak to me when you see me, know what I'm saying, word
I'ma have to get on some ole ""high school"" shit
Start punching niggas in they face just for living

Yo, I'm finished what I had to say
Ya'll can continue on",The Infamous (Prelude),1995
Mobb Deep,"Sometimes I wish I had three different faces
I'm going to court for three cases in three places
One in Queens Manhattan one in Brooklyn
The way things is looking I'ma see central bookings
Facing 3, 3 to 9 is mad time
After re-concurrence for assault 2-9
I gotta maintain 'cause stress on the brain
Can lead to a motherfucking suicide thing
And plus my probation, a ill violation
How the fuck did I get in this tight situation?
I'm going all out you know moves I never fake
And fuck the Jake, they can catch me at my wake
And if I did burn a bag of blade
Put the light in the air sometimes I just don't care

Son I got plans, power movements, get on some rude shit
I keep living like this, I might lose it
My man is coming home from doing long ass bids
What up Kiko? I ain't seen your ass since we was kids
It's all strange; my niggas locked down thinking long range
And see their names in the Daily News third page
They sent a kite to my nigga Killa
It only took one sword to put seven holes in his squealer
A 3 to 9 spending most of his time inside the bin
Reclined, and still came home with a shine",Just Step (Prelude),1995
Mobb Deep,"Every day of my life since 11-2-74
On the street makin non-stop CREAM galore
Packin heat, stickin up weed stores and more
Collectin interest off of extortions to settle my score
It gets deeper when things get real
I'm down to stickin out West Bank for my mill
And I'm from Hempstead, it's close to the shacks of Park South
While I'll be outside slingin, you're always high
And don't come around to the crossroads of life
We're to the death, you and me, this beef for eternity
I'm goin out to the fullest extent
So far into my troubles it's hard for me to get back
To my everyday self and composure
Catch you when you open then I bring you to a closure
Put ice on a razor and freeze ya in ya shoulder
I went for ya grill but you dent from my boulder
I know this kid who says he knows ya because of that
Now I know where ya lay ya hat at and that's that
Say no more, I put it on you while you was yawning
Murder without warning the very next morning

Once we step thru the door, party over, that's the endin
You and your crew'll leave out, a bunch of dead men
Bump me and I'll bump you back
You ain't tough black, niggas like you just get their life jacked
But I'mma cool nigga til you push me to the limit
But try ta play me and ya ass I get up all in it
Don't try to cop pleas now son, it's dead and done
(I gave you fair warning) So run and get your guns
It's on, time to show em how I perform
My attitude will transform, leave you dead plus wrong
Gettin the flow within, representin for Queens
Shit is real, why you hopin that it's all a dream
But you can't wake up, wettin a chest you bless
Chokin off your own blood, don't blame me you brought your own death

Ayo Noyd, it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Yo Big Noyd it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Yo Big Noyd it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew

Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew

My beeper kept beepin, the other numbers started leakin
'Who is this on my mind?' I was thinkin
Then I realised it was my dun playin 911
Once I seen the numbers I ran for the fuckin guns
My dun in trouble, I be there on the double
I jumped up in the bubble, yo kid where are you?
(1-14 between Manhattan and Morningside Avenue)
This happened just right out the blue
Aiyo dun, fuck that bitch, tell her get off your dick
(But she's cryin and she says she has feelins and shit)
Yo it's a set-up, them niggas got me fed up
Ty stay in the buildin, if they move fuckin buck em
Get up off the scene, you know what I mean?
And hide yourself down with them other fuckin sixteen
Glock and get off they block
Then I hung up the cellular, ready to rock
And it's on

Yo, you get deaded in the streets, kid set it
You gots no credit, fool you get wetted
Up with the semi-auto Mac double, love it
'Did he shoot eleven or twelve?' is what he wondered
Nigga I got one more shot, you must be drinkin
Put the heater to his head, watch him start blinkin
'Am I goin to heaven or hell?' is what he's thinkin
Switch to a bitch as his life start sinkin
Down to a level of no return
Pull out the heat cos when the slugs hit it definitely burns
Now chill and think about your life for real
Every member of my crew is livin life for real
Got your self fucked into somethin that you couldn't finish
Up against the fulliest squad and get diminished
I'm from Q-U-E another E-N-S
So why you small tough talk? I'm not impressed
If I seen you in the Bridge, I'd make you undress
Give up the money, the polo especially the Guess

Mobb Deep,"I open my eyes to the streets where I was raised as a man
And learned to use my hands for protection
In scuffles, throw all my blows in doubles
I'm coming from Queens motherfucker carrying guns in couples
And wilding, a Q-U soldier
From Lefrak to Rockaway back to Queensbridge
Black it's only crack sales makin niggas act like that
Back in the days we could scrap, now you lay on your back
As things changed with time I traded in my knuckles for a Mac-10
And rather live the life of crime
With my Bed-Stuy connection connected in two
It's liable to start shit too wild for you
Peace to, Baisley, Forty-P get down
And when you outta town represent your ground
Them niggas bleed just like us so show em where we come from
Queens; leavin niggas done Son
The Mobb gets hectic

Shit is for real up in Queens we get hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic

As we sling on the corners like we always do
Son get that loot quick, spending dough like I never had shit
I'm living large pushin luxury cars
Though that shit is outta reach, anybody in my way gets scarred
Permanently bed-ridden
And if you're pussy, then motherfucker get in where you fit in
As I walk around the streets
Son I got mad beef, I'mma blast you before you blast me
That's my philosophy cause nowadays you gotta be relentless
Grab my Mac and slap a nigga senseless
Don't try to play me if you do you better D.O.A. me
Son I got em shook grab a little baby for shields
You got drama run for shelter for real
Pour some beer for the ill ain't no time to chill
Hit em up cause I'm quick to erupt like this
Wet 'em up with the MAC scratch em off my list
Show em, the real meaning of drama you never had it
Til you bumped heads with the Havoc
Ain't nuttin' soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat, whole crews retreat

Ain't nothing soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat whole crews retreat

We gets hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic

Everything is real inside my mind; these days
You can't make it if you ain't affiliated with crime
A lifetime of street living
Throughout the beef I've accumulated many slugs have been given
But wilding ain't the way to be living
You're only gonna end up bloody on a floor shivering
Or locked up, caught inside the beast
Meanwhile on the street saying no more peace
My man, Sto-Bo, kid hold your own
In a cell locked down not far from home
And at the same time on the outside I'm representing
Still packin heat make you cowards keep stepping
Getting high, it's cause of the lye, I can't lie
I could move the crowd poppin slugs in the sky
Why come around if you afraid of what's over here
My man Havoc put the bug in my ear

On the real, for real, but wait it gets realer
Real like an innocent child that turn killer
It's thing like that that only makes things iller
And makin cream doin sticks if you ain't a drug dealer

(It's) only facts coming out of my mouth piece
As far as I can see these streets is getting sour
Q, U, too much drama to get into
And niggas regret when they begin to
Regardless of your name or what you been through
Pause for a second, open your eyes and think, duke
Life ain't the game that it seems to be
Fuck a fantasy I'm living in reality
Caught up in this untouchable mentality
Hit you up bad, make you loose a few calories
I need to slow down, movin through life at a high speed
Watchin all the slow runners pass by me
I can see through you, due to, my Queens education
Speaking in behalf of this drug-game nation

(Drop that shit)Yeah, yeah, check it out
Now run for your life, or you wanna get your heat, whatever
We can die together
As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence
I don't give a fuck about my presence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel
24-7, mac 11 is my people
So why you wanna end your little life like this?
Cause now you bump heads with kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive
The last night, damn right, I ain't tryin' to fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
Ways of action, I grab the gat, then
Ain't no turning back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm like motion
No signs of anger or fear cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans with a stranger, word is bond

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you
I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Fuck where you at kid, it's where you're from
Cause where I'm from, niggas pack nothin' but the big guns
Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger, at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'ma test your gun skills
Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a motherfucking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
With macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way and beef, stupid fuck
What the hell you smoking? What the fuck possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Who's the richest nigga in the project, who got it locked
Rocking Convertibles, drop tops and mad hot
Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team
Who's organized, all eyeballs is on CREAM
And your whole clique got nothin' but raw shit
Whip after whip, stay flashing your dick on tricks
Your whole crew's ravishing, team's untouchable
In the jungle, banging NaS, Mobb Deep and Wu
There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons
Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holding your guns
You know what's out there, thousands of gram, wrapped in Saran
Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand
Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender
Get ninjaed on the island, plus the Bridge, boy remember

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that 118 tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me
Thug selling drugs, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy",Right Back at You,1995
Mobb Deep,"I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got nuff shots to share
For all of those, who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunning
And keep them shook crews running, like they supposed to
They come around but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathing
Your simple words just don't move me, you're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen but my mind is old
And when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothing really, hey, yo dun spark the Phillie
So I can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas
Why they still alive I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation
Getting closer to God in a tight situation
Now, take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

Son, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Living the live that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
Some get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook son, he's just a shook one

For every rhyme I write it's 25 to life
Yo it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguarding my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play, I don't got time
For your petty thinking mind, son I'm bigger than those
Claiming that you pack heat but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears you'll be left with one in your dome
13 years in the projects, my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live
Or am I going to burn in hell for all the things I did
No time to dwell on that cause my brain reacts
Front if you want kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jacks kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid you outta line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sipping, E&J got my mind flipping
I'm bugging, digging my ways out of holes by hustling
Get that loot kid, you know my function
Cause long as I'm alive I'mma live illegal
And once I get on I'mma put on all my people
React mix to lyrics like Macs I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleeping cause I'm creeping

Son, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks

Living the live that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
Some get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones

Mobb Deep,"I keep it real pack steel like my man Y.G
When a fool try to play me wet 'em up then I'm Swayze
You must be crazy kid
Man I never did forever wildin' that's how we live up in the Bridge
You just sit scared cock back the gat then hit a nigga like a bid
25 naw kid you gettin' life
Forever burnin' in hell niggas is trife
It's the, semi auto you can bring it on yo
I'm pullin' out strippin' niggas just like a porno flick
I'm sick the Mobb rolls thick
Cross paths with my clique and get vic
I'm on some bullshit that's how I was raised G
Slept at the stage have you slippin' down blazin'
In pools of alcohol walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this you gonna take a fall
Infamous Queensbridge kid we on the scene kid
Creepin' for those that's caught sleepin'
Don't ever do that I run with two macs
And plus my crew back my every move
I choose givin' crews the blues
I'm open off the Damey
Obey me or get sprayed with the sweeper
Cause I'm my brothers keeper
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters
And big heaters
Blow ya three times leave a mark like Adidas
Jig you I know how to fix you
Pretty boy niggas frontin' hard is the issue
Word to my unborn you get scolded
Old and molded when I get bent you get folded
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get cross
Put your right on your back take it to the source
No doubt I'm stuck and I can't get out
Of this lifestyle the 41st side get bent run wild
The 41st side two you know how we do
Violate motherfucker I'm a see you, with the Lenden
It's the start of your endin' settin' it again and again

Yo, it's the P. E. double push a Lex bubble in the winter
You can't come alone only the hoes can enter
Told him to meet me at six on the hill at the center
Took her to the west way and bent her right over
Stay intoxicated, never sober
Face it, violate and get laced while you wasting
Slugs you ain't buckin' nothing
You better off buckin' yourself you need to stop fronting
I used to drive an Ac and kept a Mac in the engine
Littles painted it black with crack sale intentions
To blow up the whole projects the Infamous
Our sons will grow up to be murderers and terrorists
It's the nigga in me accompanied by the cognac
You can ask around, don't fuck with the Mobb
I could've told you that, where you been at
You must have cut class
If it ain't me, another member of my crew will kick your ass (what what)
We do damage to limbs
In '91, stomping you out with black Timbs
Prodigy and the H.A.V.O.C. from the Q.B.C
Putting cowards where they're supposed to be
If I don't know your face then don't come close to me
I got too much beef for that
Drama in the 3rd degree
And to the kids you don't wanna be me
I'm up in the mix of action, where niggas wanna kill me
But it's the start of they ending my man's lending
Me his linden forty-two shots depending
On whether or not the clip is full to the top
We busting caps non-stop
Blazing in all the shows and even at the hoes

Naw naw chill son chill

And it's the start of your ending
Yeah, yeah it's the start of niggas ending, you know what I'm sayin?
And it's the start of your ending
All y'all weak-ass crews that got drama with mines, you know what I'm sayin'
It's the start of your ending
And it's the motherfuckin' start of the ending

Tight with my loot, 'cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick but I ain't wit that trickin' shit

Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get I'm stayin' in the projects, forever

Mobb Deep,"Word up, son, I heard they got you on the run
For a body - now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phones tapped so I won't speak long
Gimme a hot second, and I'mma put you on
It's all messed up somebody snitchin on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Askin' on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep
They said they just wanna question you, but me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced for now just stay low
Once in a blue I check to see how you're doin
I know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union
They probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hopin to find who they lookin for but they won't succeed
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But word son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers, to get they thug on but oh well
Son they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
Oh you heard who did what, no I don't know who did shit!
So stop askin, then I know I'm not goin crazy
From windows, I see lights flashin and maybe
Somebody's takin' pictures - you know who that be
Police lovers, and neighborhood snitches
They put up your sheet so everybody's pointin fingers
And lyin, aiyyo son, the temp is risin

The temperature's risin, no there's nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin, huh and ain't nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin, huh and ain't nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin (There's nothin surprisin)

What up black? Hold your head wherever you at
On the flow from the cops with wings on your back
That snitch nigga - gave police your location
We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation
Killer listen, shit ain't the same without you at home
Phony niggas walk around tryin to be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home they was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme you'll probably be locked up
Tried to hide somewhere along the lines your plans slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminisce on how I used to pick you up in the Ac
Years ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wonderin who snitched it got me losin lots of sleep
At night, you know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops cause that shit ain't right
Sometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn - why the situation go down like dat?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
And a - couple of years 'fore we see you around
Butt 'til then maintain and keep your story the same
The cops is grabbin wrong niggas, lookin for someone to blame
They harrassin, strugglin to find the truth
There's a chance ya case'll get thrown out, cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver - me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river
Make sure it sinks to the bottom
Outsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em
But still, but still, but still

The temperature's risin, no there's nothin surprisin

Mobb Deep,"It's just another day, drowning my troubles with a forty
That's when I got the call from this brown skin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever
She got a crew too and said that we should get together
I said, ""Aight, just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower""
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
Cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the ho lonely in tears
Ain't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears
Ideas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear
(Check it out, Son) So we take the gats for precautions
Plus this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole batallion of Bucktowners
Waiting for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe I'm blowing this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen to niggas very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, fuck the world is my mental
We put together five soldiers
The bitch called, my blood curdled
Told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet
First nigga fronting getting lifted off his fucking feet
It took eternity, we reached our destination
My heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs then froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, ""Eyes open cause it might go down""
Said he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound
Evey angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see, we
Jetted thru Marcy cause D's ain't bagging me
Word Son, they got us on the run, dun, see yo

Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
Trife life got me thinking like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt yo
What can kill you is what you don't know

OK check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib
But the bitch live in the Bridge
You ain't really sweating it, cause little do you know
The niggas in the Bridge be setting it
You thought you was safe and tried to walk the back streets without heat
On the 41st Side of 12th Street
The side where niggas don't give a fuck
The side where if you come through fronting, kid you getting bucked
On your way, to apartment 3A
With a phat herringbone, let him slide, no days
Son get the heat, cause I'm about to stick him
(Fuck that shit, yo if that nigga front, yo hit him!)
Aight bet, so just hold it down
While I cock back the long three pound
You're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming
Just the right time kid, it's twelve in the evening
You're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprised
""What's goin on?"", as I reply
""Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide""
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that we're juxing, if you got what we like you gets tooken
Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good looking
Now we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn
Getting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up
Got the 80-0 in case a nigga wanna roll up
Get your motherfucking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making G's by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessey, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searching me but never ever find shit
It's the everyday, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's
But all this bullshit holding me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
I get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas
Pulling the trigger when the drama appears
Cause a nigga worse enemy is fear
So yo

Mobb Deep,"It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookings, the way things is lookin
It's Friday, you in for a long stay
Gettin shackled on the bus first thing come Monday
Hopin in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowin, home is a place you're not goin for a long while
Now you're up on the isle
In a position that you ain't got to refusin to smile
But keep in mind there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requestin P
See you're fragile, it ain't hard to see
Niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
Cause the wrong population's on infinitely
If this was the street, my razor would be a mac demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screamin'
What you in for kid - bustin nuts?
Cats heard of me in street stories told inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that
Wisen up young blood, before you make things escalate
And I would hate yo set your crooked ass straight

Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked
You talk too much shit, you shoulda kept your mouth shut
All that gossip, motherfucker don't you know my Glock kicks
Hollow tips, to your body, mad toxic
I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I graze you
Pop goes the Glock when there's beef on the block
Chill for a while make them think the beef stop
Then I creep like a thief in the night, it's only right
Ain't no turnin back, it's on tonight
And if I get caught then my ass is up north
Straight on the course for upstate New York
Stress, smokin back to back cigarettes
It popped off, one point in the mess hall
But to avoid that, from head to toe, dipped in all black
Hit them niggas where they pump they cracks at
Havoc, with the murder master plan
Keep my nine up to par, so my shit won't jam
God forbid if my shit do, run behind a tree
Fix my shit then hit you, slugs in your body
Mainly in your brain tissue
Witness from the scene, get ghost, stash the pistol
So simple then, watch my back, lay up and relax
Roll a sack, K-A black, find a shorty to tag

Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Livin the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

I got the powder, combine wit the powder, and water
It oughta, drop in a half and hour
In the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil
Then I pause... and ask God why
Did he put me on this Earth, just so I could die
I sit back and build on, all the things I did wrong
Why I'm still breathin, and all my friends gone
I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle
But my, heart pumps foul blood through my arteries
And I can't turn it back it's a part of me
Too late for cryin, I'm a grown man strugglin
To reach the next level of life, without fumblin
Down to foldin I got no shoulder to lean on but my own
All alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse
Fuck the whole world kid my money comes first
Cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me
Cause niggas will have you locked up the snitch'll be your man
Givin police the run down on your plans
We're never goin down like that
So I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
Illegal business, forever mine, fuck payin taxes
The last kid that shitted and gave police access
To my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out
A lesson that you can't live without

Make your moves at night

Thugs holdin fort wit the sixteen shot rugers

And my mobb comes deep to put the wind beneath your feet

Huh, huh 
Hey Noyd, what up this cat right here, man 
Word up! 

The tough guy strong me 
I guess he got plans to ruin me 
He want to do me slowly but surely 
I beat his fast ass a bit early 
Grabbed the biased raid, the shit was curly 
Put the drome to his dome 
Let him know it's never early 
You can slide before I snatch the heat from his side 
Saw the devil in disguise by the look in his eyes 
He was surprised I snatched him up 
Regulated his gat and backed him up 
Stepped to the side, P blast em up 

Hey yo, cannons are rough 
You got strucked up, ya strokes slit 
So rapper nigga playin' thug try to pro shit 
(Yo, kill that nigga, man!) 
All I remember was I shot for his throat G 
You see big guns and 3-D is haunting 
It gets deep, fuckin' with these Chi-nese 
Thai weed burnin' my hip from hot thats 
Burnin' my lips from roach clips 
Catch me on 40th and Bootlegger in the a.m. 
These are-tape meridiam cats, insomniacs 
Four in the mornin' we throwin' back some Cognac juice 
Lettin' thats loose in the blue van blitz-through 
These kids too couldn't find the pistol 
Hey yo, I got the Lexus, holdin' my necklace 
I'm bent off some next shit 
Gasoline wick, a kerosene twist 
Stumblin', place of my gun right, it's slipped down its caliber 
Lookin' for chicks that he can stab now 
Numbed up for my fiery cup 
I held juice of sin's nectar 
Saints found they youth 
Mega-action, bitches all around ready to fuck 
Big asses, you bought all the shit, pressin' ya luck 
My pipe games like a night train 
Top speed through ya warm piece 
? to say the least 

Give up the pussy fast, quick and not slow 
Not goin' to the cell if it ain't a freak show 
Said you know Mobb Deep is plannin this shit 
QBC, niggas grab their click 

Give it up fast, quick and not slow 
Not goin' to the tables if it's not about dough

[Prodigy]
Here come the vultures; the Mobb-laced potent rap shit.
Perhaps, kid, make it happen; start the flippin'.
You fuckin' comic, who you kidding?
My nigga's laughing, blood bathin'; the world's greatest.
In-famous, crime-zanous;
To interfere would be dangerous.
Plane descent; stand clear; save your strength.
You couldn't do the limp if you was coked up.
By my z'd up, whatever the fuck; who gives a fuck?  You get fucked.
My coalition specialises in collision.
The clash of the cliques; the duel o' the iron mac; spit
And leave ya half-split.
You'll be missin' much more than a fraction
When it's time for action.
Hit 'em while a man down; make that nigga backspin.
Trapped up; a madman.
We blastin', you're collapsin'; heavily light, my gold Mac 10. 
Get imprisoned with dem raps; they have you relapsin'.
You get castin' the Mobb, deaf and assin'. 
We face splashin'; dope fake's ice-pick stabbin'.
He slow leakin', he 'ternally bleedin' for speakin'.
Outta place niggas get placed back, indecent.
Live at the main event may I present,
Screamin' out loud for any squad that's deaf.
My infamous Mobb; ya heart throb; hold ya breath.
It's KO from dead arm; rights and hard lefts.
Another satisfied consumer who got blessed.
Single out ya army til; there's no man left.

[Chorus]
Man down. (Man down, down, down, down...) 
Man down. (Man down, down, down, down...) 
Man down. (Man down, down, down, down...) 
Lay the fuck down!

[Havoc]
Infamous cartel; visible evidence.
We scarred well; associated team benevolent.
Never hesitant; opposition get settled here with
Sharp shit that'll rip through.
One hundred layers of Kevlar; sharp like the gym star.
Exiled, son, he get sent far;
He's the foulest; QBC gat bust the loudest.
Below profile; peep style; thirsty prowlest.
Catchin' court cases; pay for your legal aid.
Son, that's money wasted; I ain't got time for that.
Invest third place on my best sold rap,
On the scrap from the ignorant cats.
It'll be dead in a few... just like that.
Couldn't bust his gat right.  (Yo, y'know what?) 
But now you bucked your own man, amateur ass.
Homeboy, take that ass to class.
But you cut in, duckin' a reality blast.
You catch a D minus, fuckin' with New York's finest.
The conversation from them outsiders,
Dick riders, connivers, bomb ya camp.
We know survivors; push you off guard; got homicidin'.
We analysin'; tell you up front ain't no surprises.
We take you down first round; give ya man pound.

[Chorus]

[Big Noyd]
Check it out, Dun, them niggas ain't ones
To be blowin' off the top and shit; I'm tired of shit.
Dun, I'm about to dot the bitch and leave him stiff.
Toss me the fifth so I can bless the God with gift.
Yo. nigga Noyd, what's the topic?  Yo, the topic is this:
Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list. 
First of all, them tight niggas with that space-down shit;
I stick a rocket up in they ass and give 'em a lift.
My marvellous Mobb is tonic, intoxicant, bee-swee.
Morphine raps; you get dope from inner mind-see.
Shit fienin', now get your fix 'cause you need it.
Fuckin' up your intravenous; the Infamous Mobb, top secret.
The only way you weakin' is if you beakin' this.
Sneak devy niggas, mischievous.
'Knowledgin'; the God behind the scene on some snake shit.
The vultures, water from their mouth, but we can taste it.
We just waitin' with patience.
Yo, dun, check the cross-examination; these niggas fakin'.
So you can scream, you can fiend, you can dream for the bacon,
Or you can snatch the Mac for the faggot, ai! 
Bang 'em up, fuck em up.

Mobb Deep,"Yo nahmsayin?
Yeah she'll take you out too kid
Take this shit out

A rainy day laid up thinkin' sittin' gettin' bent
Watchin' old seventy flicks, mind's on the slouch
Back on the couch, heard the phone ring
It was a shorty from uptown I met back day, long time no hear from
No doubt long time no see
I heard you had a seed a baby girl and now she three
Whats up wit that cat, you know who your baby pops
Slung rocks up top then heard he got knocked
He home? Fuck dat nigga I'm on my own
Matter fact got my own crib, plus I'm all alone
Word? The bitch is bad; chill son she got me tempted
Reminiscing the fatty, jumped in the ride I rented
Fresh Timbs, Mecca dice well presented
Sippin E & J straight, was bent when I entered
Gave her a hug, stared her straight into her mug
She ain't she's a bitch, she back then and now its bugged
Turned the VCR on, ""Friday,"" my favorite flick
Its hard for me to drink Alize (no doubt) I take a sip
Got into convo, how you been over the years?
Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear
Whatchu mean, I thought you left that cat which was true
I'm not talkin about him, another dude
Been wit him for a year and had a baby by him (word?)
Matter fact you saw him, downstairs you walked by him
Now thinks it's a setup, could it be or maybe not
She said dont sweat it he dont got the top lock
Tried to play it cool, but in my head shorty's wildin
Using me to get the next nigga jealous called up the fellas
Ty Nitty line was busy so I beeped Gotti, Gotti was
With Trip and two other grimees, The Twinz
Let me begin then explain
I'm at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed
Stuck without a gat, now prepared for combat
Gave the address, told my son there's more cats
Be here in a second, big gats no half steppin
They flippin on me talkin bout I never learn my lesson
I laughed an additional hit them with the math
Hung up the jack, while shorty soaked in the bath
Played the living room, dozed off for a second
When I woke up shorty was standing ass naked
Make moves, all this bullshit pussy better be good
Stepped to the room, threw off my Champion hood, slow motion
All arm bent off the potion
Shorty went down and had a nigga wide open
It was over laid up in the cut
I heard a thump, jumped up threw on my boxers
Yo, what the fuck? All of a sudden
I saw this black motherfucker with this big ass gat
And two other motherfuckers with black masks (what the fuck?)
Clutching duct tape no escape
Tied me up, smacked me all in my face
Shorty wasn't even screamin', looked up saw 'em schemin'
""Yeah, yeah, we got this nigga now, we got this""
All bloodied up, shook the fuck up
Held for ransom, they yelled, ""We got the bones!""
Smiled, then started dancin'
The phone rung it was my son, let them know they had me hostage
Threw me on the phone said, ""Son don't worry son, we got this""

Vague memory of last night now it's all dawnin
Look down and see dry blood all on my garment
It stained all my Guess farmer's, colored enormous
I hopped up, outta my bed holdin my head
Flashbacks of gun shots shot past my head
I can recall an eight man brawl three men fall
Bullets flew I had to drug my man behind a wall
Left a wet trail, delivered these slugs like air mail
Directly at the cat that made my man blood spill
An eye for an eye you know my science of life
Is you man or mice thugs or the cowardly type
I kick the 98 shit for your ears to list

We do the things y'all wish y'all could
And play the bat yo and watch the brothas bark like wood

So knock on it
Go head you want it
Nobody want it 
You turned in for it pulled nine stingers like a brown hornet

While y'all was droppin' I was underground shadow boxin'
Layin' low puttin' final touches on the flow
So here we go, tryin' to snatch that dough
Got niggas breakin' camp like Dre from Death Row

From the streets to the jail, I represent well

Took a shower and then I strapped on my firearm

But it ain't my turn to say goodbye
How do I know? Some people call it instincts
I like to call it my luck who gives a fuck

I'm stuck, in this environment can't depart from it
And if I try I always end up back where I started 
Plan A square one there's no escapin'
So I pun and realize my too

I'm tryin' to live a full life before my time is through
Clock's tickin', so I don't got no time for you
As I head outside amongst the rest of the animals
Where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand it

(To all my kiko's)
It's sort of like a family brawl
We gather up all the soldiers and form into a invincible
Swarm of kids, now it's on again

Drinkin' straight from the bottle warm gin drippin' down my chin
For the crippled children you can't win 
Against 25 niggas bent up with mac-10's
Semi-automatic, fully addicted crime addict

So long as there's cash involved I gotta have it
There's many different levels of the criminal mind
Either you're in it for the gusto or I'm wastin' your time

Now is you ready for men, 'cause they your peeps that you saw
You probably heard about me and my crew doin' what we do

'Cause I be wreckin' mic-checkin' fools that come around second-guessin'

I sparks in the dark like stars in the sky
Spiritually, lyrically, since knee-high
The cradle, I represent my peoples and my label
'Cause when you take a ride through Parkside it's fatal

What's my time to shine my design you can't define
It only takes a line and a rhyme to blow that mind 
To have you buggin', niggas got they tapes dubbin
Where ain't no line for me to kick a rhyme pushin' and shovin'

Now it's over, walkin' like a soldier I told ya
Shorty droppin' bombs and shit, like Oklahoma
Kinda soul, comin' wit that bomb for sure 
Run for shelter little brotha when it rain it pour

[Chorus] 

First of all the foundation
Money is the root of all evil
The cream'll have you shittin' on your people
Livin like lotto, everything is everything

Ain't nothing change but the clothes that my money bring
I'm makin' figures that I never thought possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army in techses

And them Acuras that made you get your cap peeled backwards
For years, I've been tryin' to blow for years
Gettin' bent off Moet spend a G on beers
Livin' life to the fullest, my story ends wit a bullet

To the chrome-oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you're lookin, you can find me risin' to the top
I'm a classic approach my level and get your ass kicked

Floatin' in a river wit yo body rapped in plastic
I'm tryin' to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team dies
I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky

While the rest still livin' steady tellin' me lies
It's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up

Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against me
And is it the henny that bend me; i be in the zone
Gazing at the walls, suppressed, thinking da phone
Don't take personal, but only a minor few can understand
What a nigga feeling; 40-first 'til i die motherfucka..(no doubt)
I'm still breathing. you a must son, we full bread
You ain't my dogg, tring to infiltrate my clik is you
I get wit you, handle that on a later note.
We o'er-dose eveything is death, we so close
I'm trying to tell these cats, but i let them do they thing..
Ready for the bad news 'til da phone ring
Son is dead, now i'm irate over my head seeking revenge.
Son is dead, son on your behalf trying to laugh

Check out the drill-dun, conceal guns
Play the hum leaning back checking out the action
On the benches we drinkin x's
Yo twirl dat shit, while i spark this...
Sharply burn it down like an arsonist
Pull out the miz cause its time to bring the biz to kidz
And blow all hell fire out ya empire
Live as wire couldn't make my mobb expire or retire
I'm letting off 'til my arms tired
You set quite wit my head full of riot.
Our buyers, it clear for your ear to hear
I declare only live niggaz lock this year
'96-i lost my dun; '97-it got worse..
Pull money out the team, got to get mork..
And sat down you play the background when shots sound off
Flashbacks of how my man is gone, kb forever in my memory
I spill some henny then i keep it moving

Dealing with the mental aspect on chest
So we create a trust, if you dunns come to shot
Get hit with a twenty-one gun salute
I keep a loaded yet deadly 7sc 30

And quick to say a poem to ricochet in your dome

I draw first blood be the first to set it off 
My cause tap all jaws lay down laws 
We takin what's yours we do jerks rush the doors 
Here come the deez tryin to make breeze and guns toss 
In full force  my team'll go at your main source 
We're not tourists hit bosses and take hostage 

Your whole setup  from the ground up we lock shit 
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics 
Switch to killer instincts for niggaz pop shit 
Yo nigga Noyd what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in 
Ninety-six strike back with more hot shit 
Illuminate my team'll glow like, radiation 
With no time for patient, or complication 

Let's get it done right, my click airtight 
Trapped in a never ending gunfight so niggaz lose stripes 
Or lose life, jail niggaz sendin kites to the street 
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish em off 
Well done meat, that said twenty-two slug to your head 
Travel all the way down to your leg 

[Chorus] 
Ayo it's hell on earth, whose next or gonna be first 
The projects is front lines, and the enemy is one time 
I ain't gotta tell you 
It's right in front of your eyes 
We wreck the QBC, nigga rep yours it's all love 

Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow tip slug 
Then crack down, on wannabe thugs adapt to gat sound 
And bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now 
Articulate, hittin body parts to start shiftin shit 
Never hesitant, it's the crack game unlimited 
Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite 
Then reminesce, twenty years later how we was gettin it 
Either with me go against the grain you better hit me 

Leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me 
'Cause it's a small world and niggaz, talkin like bitches 
Bitches singin like snitches, pointin you out in pictures 
'Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin me 
All that bullshit, is just makin me 
More the better, then concentrate on gettin chedda 
If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you 
Shape and mold you, sun you, then I hold you 

Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you 
It'll be I, like I'm supposed to, the click is coastal 
International to local, Bacardi mix physically fix 
Hit you with shit, that'll leave a loose nigga stiff 
Probably thick, Son I solved em 
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos 
Walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop 
QBCity GodFather Part III, Gotti Gambino 
And Ty Nitty, Scarface rest in peace

Yo, the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips 
You seein clips when the mac spit your top got split 
Layin dead with open eyes close his eyelids 
Turn off his lights switch to darkness, cause deep in the abyss 
Is street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife 
Youse the wild child, kid cold turnin men into mice 
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet 
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggaz is left stranded 
Shut down your operation, closed for business 

Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness 
POW niggaz is found MIA 
We move like the special forces, green beret 
Heavily around my throat, I don't play 
Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way 
The God P walk with a limp see, but simply 
To simplify shit, no man can go against me 
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me 
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty 

The reason why it full for so long, cause I don't waste shit 
You probably hid, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it 
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin 
I hear thugs, claimin that they gonna rob the Mobb 
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue 
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take this message 
Along with that, I ain't your average cat 
Fuck rap, I'm tryin to make cream and that's that 
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down 

Four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound 
Speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground 
I could truly care less the God will get his 
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest 
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist 
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it 
A live nigga stay on point never diss 
Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged 
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the burbs 
Live up to my word, if I got beef, niggaz comin in herds

Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart, with the million man march

[KAM]
Damn that's how you know the world about to end
Rain hail snow earthquakes and a million black men
Upon the God indivisible
With liberty and justice for all cause why'all done made us miserable
With this AmeriKKKan nightmare
That's why October 16th we gon be right there like yeah
The same niggaz that you want gone
Well we about a million deep on your front lawn
It's goin on from here to Abraham Lincoln's statue
And every brother here thinkin yeah we need to holla at you
About this overdue bidness
With the Black Muslim, Christian Jew and Jehovah Witness
To get this out in the open the only way
Is for us to declare a black holy day
The homies say that they rollin
Plus we got family, forty miles up, controllin

YaknowhatI'msayin? Word up son
Listen up son, knowhutI'msayin?
(Watch out for them man) Listen up son, check it out though, yo

Open your eyes get wise and look alive focus your attention
Windows 95 updated high tech lynchin
Crosses of the colored man who claims he hold the keys to the safe
Secrets of the world, blow him in his face
Who's the master of the universe, galaxy and planets
Babylonians ecstatic moon the sinkin of Atlantis
(Be the one soul original black filled with melanin
Goin out like represent Kuwait in 2000)

Never too complex to where it fly
Over the heads of 85, I strive
To stay real and keep hip-hop alive
Revive thoughts collide, you better slide I advise
You keep the eyes on the prize, my metal rips
Militant minded like the prejudice devils I shatter
This march was meant to spark a million diligent hearts
Or e'rylife, we even see alike so play your part

Knowledge equality, born gods can follow me
As we swarm the yard like bees out in D.C.
The TV'll televise the revolution for sellin lies
Within the constitution, realise the former solution
October 16th, a million black minds comin intertwined on the fact find
Lord Jamal, black Jesus and I stack rhymes
But the black-on-black crime that attack mine

[Chorus]
So where you at why'all?
 Right here, hangin with my brothers and we showin no fear
So where you at why'all?
 Right here, if you represent then throw your hands in the air

Hear my synopsis, I drop this
Generates thoughts of born-awareness of the here-and-now
Buildin a poem with many spearin out
Society inflaws unjust laws remain the voided common cause
Equality rules you to love that equality
Many's law to trust this
Act of the devil possess the sword of justice
Take the devil's head through levels and bad truth can spread to mental dead

Imagine us traveling back to Nazareth
 Most fabulous
To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus
 When I catch rays through the blaze holy essays
 No more death days and vexed slaves possessed in caves
Yo it's the last days and times we gots to raise your mind
Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall of the ledge
And blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

As we struggle in the jungle of sin, my thoughts are militant
Destroyin the ignorance, buildin the innocent
Teachin infants infinite knowledge
That wasn't taught in high schools or college
My representation is with the thirty million man destination
Washington, D.C., war with the masons
The only celebration is Satan's elimination
The past education at the present is revelations
The future's our creation, elevation of the nation

[Chorus]

Yo around Red (16) October
BROOKLYN ZOO attack like cobra
Killin warrior soldiers in D.C., you face Jehovah all over
The darkside, I ride tracks to provide
Elementive intelligence while you fake MC's hide
LEFT RIGHT as I command all my sons 'cause I'm grand
(Pull his head, snatch land) See if I slide through the sand
Snakin those who choose to fake moves on Zoo, ya get bruised
(Bring ya crew) Opposin the chosen son of God, you get scarred hard

Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro
Crackers in the back obscene nahmean?
But I've been knockin em out the box like ????
So on the single we be flowin at the lingo
Comin together, not solo like Mandingo

Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
And mould me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull? Eatin us like cannibals
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight

shit gets hot like a ill pot of grits spilled on you
Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you
I understood you should try to take my life
If I was you I would too damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until...
I made things right
Pull out guns exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines ignite the pipes...
and never let the daylight decieve
during the suns' hours niggaz do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggaz can't shoot never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop
fresh out of box shit filled to the top
Smell the barrell when its bolt-locked nigga

It's that war shit
It's that war shit
And you know what dun

It makes you sick to hear the mobb bang like this
Infamous for the world to hate or play this
Don't give a fuck if you can't rock to this
My duns' heads bop to this
We stand out like a tourist
And make more noise than them other rap niggas
No gimmicks just pure adrenaline
Raw lyrics incredible beats
Don't mean to rub it in
But your small time beneath our feet
Straight ass cheeks niggas be askin
For ass whippings, guns kick like pelle
My big shit be jumping like Jordan

Often lay a man down on the floor when it gets like that
I'm not blowing off rounds so you can hear sounds
So you can run back actin like you a vet
And swearin' you dead
You survived some real shit
Now what's this it's not going down like this
Ground y'all niggas like punishment
Dumpin' out full clips when we dumb out
Though I'd rather do music and chill the fuck out
Dun you bugged out I'm trying to walk a peaceful route
But niggas always got mouth until that piece come out
Niggas always gonna think something sweet
Until they least expect you bringing action exactly

Feel the gat blow while your shit rips
My shit'll hit while you lettin' niggas go
So you can lower the wrist
That'll only put odds against any attempt
Any provoke uprise you ain't got it in you
First of all you too soft for fastball
Point game track y'all merk like a jaguar nascar
And be out buck 80 on the slow mar
Hennesy spillin' all over my radar
Stay charged niggas getting amped off the mobb shit

Have you wildin' out on some club shit
Fit to make you dance at the same time
Stop and glance
Slap flames out the nigga with the wrong idea
Young shit with young mind but that quite contraire
Young nigga smart nigga
Who started from the stairs
How dare
You try to come around the way
In fear like a nigga that been there for years
Shout words that we live but don't play with it

They man's wanna dub this
Thugness it ain't easy to find
Shit like mine I'm a rare species
You's a dime a gross that's a dozen heast the least
Keep silence the most
Regulate with the rest of my establishment
Blast out the pockets of coke
Make the cops boat
I break down your whole background yo
Irons a permanent flesh your clothes soakin'

You feel the shots pain every heartbeat throbbin'
Don't get excited you'll only make it worse fighting
Spent most of my nights graveyard shifting
Make burial grounds be that man grim reaper
With all pleasure
Pick your feet up pick the heat up
Let's do it like the crematory
Make it hot make the temperature rise like mercury
When I feel like getting' bent (yo don't fuck with it dun)
I'm a drink away the pain until the brain get numb
Can't take all my dogs getting lost in the fog

Never to return I guess they heard God's call
And nature don't surprise me now
Prepare for the worst and never believe the silver line clouds
Scrutinize crowds my surroundings
Get suspect we start four-poundin' shit
Picture me up in the mix 
With the next man broke and is on my dick
A good man of plenty but an enemy it was clear
I just be another problem that he feenin' to fix
But I can't have that pull out I try to grab that

They bought the jewel from a don wit a king-sized hat on, slanted 

Kangol wit Bentol, ya mental, mid-war 
Spill Hen' in the store, that's for the own' 
Blaze wit a bent four, yo these laws is your's

Silk shirts on my chest show what a flirt
Halle Berry blew a kiss at the Barbara Streisand concert
Silk pants colored pink, gators match gangster musical thing
And I'll front like my doo doo don't stink

Hazard lights blinkin, gators hit the floor
Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin
Just to think, that was yesterday's action
'Cause today goes either way we came a long way

Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home
Quincy Jones posters
Wake up, guns under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs

Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son

Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat, comin and flee with the murder weapon

Cremate your flesh to ashes

Long shotgun's down my pants leg, limpin'

He taught me how to shoot when I was seven
I used to bust shots crazy, I couldn't even look
Because the loud sound used to scare me
I love my pops for that, I love my nigga D. Black
I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left
And through all of that a nigga ain't scared of death
All y'all brand new niggas just scared to death
I spent too many nights sniffin' coke, gettin' right
Wastin' my life, now I'm tryin' to make things right

Fully-blown melanin tone

Everybody want to use the name soundin' all lame
We come up in the party with them shanks and things
Have you curled up on the floor feelin' the pain
And nine times out ten we ain't even start the shit
We finish it then they want to press charges
Plus everybody and their mother want to act tough
Till they discover how fast  a nigga leave them under white covers 

Was a thumper till he met the forty thunder
Now I feel strange when I walk by his mother
It's fucked up that's how the ball bounce
The cookie crumbles
That's what the guns do dead you
On the humble, but god fogive me niggas tryin to hit me
What I'm supposed to do you talk about my life 
And a nigga got a lot to loose
So I tuck the heaters then proceed to move
We a mob for real, you an example

You should spread love not war
'Cause my shit is poppin
And I'd be god damned if you shot me 
You need to spread love not war
'Cause you won't feel safe
Comin out your crib, knowin that we got beef
You should spread love not war
Just think about your kids
How they need you alive for they're guidance
You need to spread love not war
'Cause death hurts whole families 
Imagine it's your  moms that grieves

Two in the neck, yes you will, 
if you not feelin me yet outta respect
Can't stand it man, you niggas is set
Sweatin hard ain't do shit, but run your list
When a nigga get confronted 
All he do is take the fifth
Not the long, talk about the four
Niggas is raw you ain't know, now you know
Leakin down on the floor
Never a need for my words 
Believe what you heard
Never flash a gat and go bust it
That shit is absurd cause I be right back 
To my brother say word you got to drive, no doubt 
I cock it bein tougher for herbs
'Cause the plot is power and I do it for hours
Won't save me for a minute
Till I move on you cowards
Direct drama to us
Infamous be the ones and we rowdy
Million dollar ballad make an album, get classes

Look around your surrounded by the M-O-B-D-E-E-P
Infamous niggas rep Queensbridge housing P's
My dunns come through with the big long chains
Plus we got bullets, to blow your brains
Niggas learn when they feel the pain
Know what I'm sayin? Straight like that
Standin ovation with max, we clap niggas for less
Splash niggas for laughs shift the game
Raise your odds
I need 93 thousand for 16 bars
Put out the movie, the hoods rush the stores
700 thousand from out the doors
We the most thorough
Need I say more?
The hoes love the morgue
Cause we so raw
Handcuff you whore
When P come through the scene
Glowin like a black light on white clothing

Know they staring brain feels like a wheel lost with out the ball bearing 
Stuck contemplating on who I can trust 
But like lleullo in a bill my feelings just get crushed 
But that's why I stick with my duns like I stick with the guns 
Don't get mad rip your hun concentrate on my funds 
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist 
Never get patted down when I step in the place 

Jiggied up, smoke the pot, confirm if it is real reefer or not 
Rally up, after this get followed straight to the crib 
Gem Star, double edge apply pressure 
Shave em down, blow marks right through your mecca 
want to be a thug, now you got the thug look, 
Stick em up, leave medicaid, with the real to push 
God body, with a rubber grip black shotti 
Pump one in his ass make that nigga switch hobbies 

A dossage, hand delivered, without postage 
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice

Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at them 

I ain't no killer, you know me 
But I'll be damned if I don't lie for my C-O-D 
And then this Old G, scold me and told me coldly 
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homey 
But I gotta redeem, get this cream by any means 
I never been clean 
Nigga, my whole click got dirty 
From the battles, to the trials and bloody up shirtsleeves 
Nigga you heard me, its gangsta 

Vision the canvas I paint a picture 
Similar to Ernies Barnes nigga 
But mines is more ghetto more guns more drugs, mostly thugs 
All my duns, their baby moms daughter and sons 
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out 
Park benches broke, a nigga stretched out 
Jumped off the roof to his death its real 
Hand Ball walls displayed with are I-P murials 
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building 
Devils spring, keep em going while the snows blowing 

Grams get dipped, 50's are moked, cookies are broke 
And spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke 
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects 
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at 
If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off 
Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off don't get clipped off

If eight was all make a nigga want to gain some weight
Fat belly black motherfuckin D-O-G
And I'm a thug for them young niggas thuggin for me

Ayo
Fuck where you at kid
Its where you from
'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my Queens Duns, niggas who pump drugs
To all the housing projects who rep for they hood

Live and direct from the south to your stereo
Prepare for bustin and dumpin okay player here we go
Strapped with infa-red raps when I hit the traps
Crack the wack into pieces when I hit the track
Like stone to glass I shatter they raggedy ass
South style waiving my motherfuckin soldier rag
A hard illustration of my brutal lifestyle
Memphis Ten made a lot of niggas buck wild
The root to all evil daily I chase it
Blow it on weed and drink then hustle to replace it
It's hard from the start where I lay my head
We get rowdy and bust shots till we raise the dead

Yo fuck where you at kid
Its where you from
'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my gold grill niggas and my trail niggas
South to east we keep it hard for them real niggas

Feel my though, You don't want to get filled up with holes
Moms filling out surgery cards blowing her nose
Wiping her tears cause something on your top got shot
Should have brought alone wit you what you loaned on the block
Fuck, leaving without it dunn I'd rather get knocked
Charged with a ten body for a nigga get shot
For a weak ass bitch, fuck that little whore
Even though she get my dick harder than the parol board
Stick and move, slide in, slide out big guns
Mack milly prepare to mob you steel phillies
Connected with Eightball dunn so what's the drilly
Out to take it all if you wit me then feel me

Don't get yourself shot
Bleedin to death hops
I pop canners off leave a nigga head whopped
A maverick my H-K will work magic
You'll find yourself in the O are for talkin that shit
Street justice I tip the scale over cousin
I hold more weight you just a no name nigga frontin
Get your hardware lets treat it like a contest
And we can dance till one of us drop from being hit
Murda Muzik my street life influenced it
Its so real bredren I wouldn't test it I rep it
A renegade crack your top like devil spring
Vigilante niggas know the song I sing

It go
Fuck where you at kid
Its where you from
'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
No mistakes for the fake no escape
Chop them boys up and puttin it in their face

Fuck where you at kid

'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my ice pick niggas one
To all my dunns trying to get the fuck up out of the sprungs

Fuck where you at kid

'Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my Queens Duns, niggas who pump drugs
To all the housing projects who rep for they hood

Fuck where you at kid

[Havoc]
Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns 
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days
Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, ""I don't give a fuck"" in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son (what)
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs
Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on
We just getting warm, Operation ""Quiet Storm""
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Half P and I's got it in the smash for sure
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at

[Nas]
Hey yo I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You ballet?  They read your obituary, in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope-slangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rosters, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
Thieves on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yelling, ""Freeze black kids!""
Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus
Wishing they was on the blocks with us
To watch me and P do it (uh) put the heat to it (uh)
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest?

Dirty fingernails, reachin in my pocket pullin knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
Out this lifestyle we live, iced out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason bein we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggas out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus kid
Rap niggaz shit they drawers

[Nas]
Yo they probably did
I air condition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard
To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up
Feeling like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, being looked at, as uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight
Y'all niggas get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue
We too official, blue steel pistols
Teflon vests, it's no contest we hit you

that you could come out to challenge me in blood talk? 

Take a walk jerk this ain't Levert, Sweat and Johnny Gill 
This is rap for real, somethin you feel 
You catch a chill when you hear the Mobb bang through your stereo

We roll Mobb Diezel, the whole Q.U. double E, N-S 
And when you spot us, play low-key 

Dunn these niggaz is actresses, and they tryin to play the man's role 
Can't they see us wildin on the video? 
Don't they see us in the club swingin elbows? 
Or on the street with our jewels on the cell phone? 
Hoppin the sidewalk with Benzes and Jeeps 
I ran through more cars than it's sand on the beach 

I'm pleased to meet you, now here's a word to the smart 
Don't ever let your peoples boost up your heart 
'Cause you'll fuck around and get your ass torn apart 
Challengin the Mobb in the arts

To prevent lop side I never slam the door 
To never get shitted on don't put my faith in whores 
Never let my information leak through my forewall 
They say I'm all to sick cause I screen my calls 
No matter if I'm in the right, I'm a probable cause

Use a maytag nigga and ya won't do shit

Ain't no hard time invented that havoc can't handle
If cats only knew all the shit I been through
Homicide, suicide, am I, losin' my mind?

Just, standin' my ground keep it bottled up inside
Practice what I preach dunn, ride for my loved ones
Asked about my life, no doubt had a tough one
Did dirt, got dirt, shit only got worse

Been asked god why he put me on this earth, yo
Not for nothin' dunn, I want it all - can you blame me?
Niggas just be settlin' for crumbs
How dumb, how come, with no outcome?

Ten years later niggas still in the slums
Strung off the next shit, dyin' for they next shit
Foamin' from the mouth for the next man necklace
And how about that, niggas too grown for that
I'm holdin' it down, now where your head at? yo

Until you tamper with my plans to go on further

Fuck the hassle, it ain't worth my energy unless I must
If you insist, I'll be more than glad til his beef marriage
Me and you til death do us
Scrape my fingertips on bricks, forty-two shot clips

I use a wide holster, it's more discrete while I'm post up
Or in motion, most niggas be floatin'
Don't even make eye contact, walkin'

Watch who you pass and it might be a reaper
Watch my niggas we'll jump when you least thought
We came from the streets up, now we put g's up, so

Yo, had time to think when just on the brink of death
At my front door me receivin slugs?
Only twenty-five, got fifty more to go
And knows, their plot I hope they ass die slow

Like my man twist said don't even see me when I blow

It's bad enough I gotta grow up the fast way
These things going on got me thinkin they the last days
Tryin to come up, but shorty with a plan
Doin my best but can't see the promise in my land
These older cats wildin out over turf dog
I'm caught in the middle and it can't get worse
Just the other day I saw my homie wheeled off in a hearse
So used to it, it don't even hurt
My heart's numb, guess that's the Dunn Dunn
Can't speak on it, 'less you been where I come from
Stuck like bubble gum with no help from anyone
Moms got four others -- my four younger brothers
We're not supposed to do the tender age of ten

Fore I lay me down to sleep pray to God that I'll see the next day

We the one that's gon' hold it down, it's no thing no sweat
It barely take no strength, you cowards ain't built for this

Play all day and night without a care in the world
But it's drama in my hood, sho' it's hard to chill
You gotta stay on point and sharp as hell
Dunn, we just want to have fun
I just want to be with my dawgs, 'cause we all we got
Don't why it is, but that's how it is
I just want to be with my clique 'cause that's where I fit

(It's real) Where do I turn to, who do I console in?
I know I'm just a shorty but I want my wrist frozen nice
As I sat and thought many a nights
I could do the right thing or get read my rights
It's life, in the hood
Everything that look, it ain't

Runnin from jake, sweat runnin down my face

Lil' dunn control yourself, learn discipline
And show some respect for others

Smack flames out a nigga and I got you smilin'
The way I cut a nigga every which way but loose
A blood stained Gucci suit will be the proof
Laid back cat but I love to chill
Love a freak in a thong with a ? full of ?
Said you went to catholic school and that's cool
Let me see you throw the suit on
With no interruptions, ma turn the cell off
Start for the touchin'
And I'm sick with the candle
A fatty, ain't nothin' that a nigga can't handle
I been through it
It's a first time for everything, settin you free
And I feel you your man ain't lettin' you breathe
You a dime from your face to your navel
Your man better wake the fuck up and let you out of that stable
Used to think like that until I thought
? shoe on the other foot and I got ?
Stay home, cook and clean like she the boss
Hell no nigga, not while I'm up in New York
She gonna do what she want, flirt when she want, fuck who she want
Then nigga It's a wrap
You like 'No she won't', but yes she will
Chick might as well have Big comin' out of jail

Bitch front, she gettin' out on the shoulder lane
It's 3 in the mornin', why you think you came
Should've stayed where you was, I don't play those games
Ring on the finger, fatty off the meter
There's only one thing that this shit could lead to
The reaction, your mind'll crack
And put my mans on if it's poppin'
Bitch you laughin'?
Everything that I spit is real
And everything on your inside you scared to tell

Girl I know the situation all too well
I'mma keep it gangsta, rep the 'bout
Lady caught on, so I had to bounce
With bleach in the crib, all my clothes got doused
That's when a nigga knew I had to get out
Know what you're goin' through, been there before

Girl all you wanna do is just be free
And that's why a nigga like me got these keys

This man? Where we headed for the future man. What's the resolution?

Wealth, health, and happiness nigga
Keep me from runnin' 'round clappin' these niggas
Sometimes you gotta just handle your business
Fuck it, it's on me, rounds of shots for niggas
Punk, I wake up everyday to cathedral cielings
Jumpin' out my bed, wall to wall marble and pillars
Livin' like the Pharaoh Tut, I'm blessed with life
So I breathe deep and give praise to the most high
Then I, get fresh for a new day
I eat broccoli for breakfast and smoke my trees
Turn on the flat screen to see-Span
See the elite strength, attorney general slowly gettin' bills passed
Prophecies comin' to pass
We gotta survive this shit dun, it's nothin' to laugh at
I hops in the V, grabs the heat and I stash that
I'm in tune with Doc, Pac, and Huey, it's a rap.

I traveled the world, and been a lot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself, you got drama?
Who's gonna clap that chrome?
Nobody like you, somebody like me
When death I'm ready for it in Threes
And me off point? see'mon now nigga please
I'm paranoid, you know I'm burnin' those trees

Saw a lot of niggas die, some niggas survived
And those that did did it by the skin of their hide
Dodgin' that long ride, the four-fifth aimed at 'em
And knew to fall back when them slugs came at 'em
On the real, for me to be here tellin' ya'll this
Is like dice, then I rolled that Four-Five-Six
And never lost ever since, though I took that big pinch
My Brother passed away, 24/7 I was bent
Drunk in my pain, a lot of friends went and then came
And those that stayed understood a nigga pain
And for a niggas problems had no one to point the blame
I was my own worst enemy goin' against the grain
Somewhere along the line them pieces had to get grabbed
All this money plus family, shit wasn't that bad
All you little shorties runnin' 'round like shits sweet
Just remember these words from the M-O-double-B.

I traveled the world, and been a lot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself, you got drama?
Who's gonna clap that chrome?
Nobody like you, somebody like me
When death I'm ready for it in Threes
And me off point? see'mon now nigga please
I'm paranoid, you know I'm burnin' those trees

I kiss my finger, cross my heart, I'ma make it out these dark days
Whether together or we part ways
I got a promise to that boy tatted on my arm
Three strong, man, the heat's still lukewarm
Who can you trust when your friends want to pop your safe?
You let him stash in your place, now you watch his waist
Vision the days, hear the ghost whisper
Dogs we left in the past, brought back now here with us
Cross my heart, let the haze linger
Pour out a little liquor, knowin' God took a good nigga
Thousand dollar slippers skirt from the scene he was just a worker, dog,
You were his every dream
I kissed his face like I never knew 'em
It was me, once upon a time when life was ruined
Now the mink rope chain sparklin'
Jumpin' out of bed, Thousand dollar slippers slidin' huggin' the
Carpets.

I traveled the world, and been a lot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself, you got drama?

Big-up to Jersey and my people's out in el-a
Well-a hell-a can never cut the swell-a
Cos you can tell I gets biz like Markie
No matter what the weather son you never wanna spark me
I'm kickin rhymes and gettin mines on the regular
See me in the black Benz just blowin up the cellular
We high as shit, the sky is it
You know the sewer style yo is fly as shit
So grip (what?), you're cheap and buried 
cos you're never comin near it
So fear it when you hear it, cheer it but don't compare it
I still be schoolin, foolin em when I'm speakin
Kids be heapin, they love the way that we be freakin

It's all about expanses, stocks of skunks, 
props and my pops get a mansion
By the age of 16, had dreams of big screens
Mad rubbers to keep my dick clean
Chrome tools in rent
and I only go downtown to buy jewels and tints
Jaboll, Guess, ol' Gold and sess
I check the mic 2-1 and chew gum to ease the breath
My style is wild like the Cats of Villanova
The heat on the street'll keep my 40's spillin over
So the skunk and thai keep me high when I'm smokin
And I don't sleep, just take naps with one eye open
See I believe the beaded weed in me is feedin me
the inspi-ration to riggity rock the nation
from white folk to Haitian, Jamaican
Burn MC's like degrees of Mason because you're fakin
I'm on point, exclamation with the caper
The flavor misbehaver from the super dooper rhyme maker

My crew is shake, rattle and roll thick
Thicker than your blunt cos yo I be's the Brooklyn trooper

Bust the lingo Ringo stiggity Starr bingo
I run shit like Kunta, breaks bones like Mandingo
I'm starstruck like starbuck, the bad bro is mad though
I'm all that small cat like Tomko or Hasbo
I have no figgity fear yeah, it's me and mines

Yo, well yo the shit sound clever, 
I'm down for whatever like nuttin nice
Big-up to DJ Dice wreckin shop when he cut 'n' slice
These 20 MC's, please! I never heard of some
We need to murder some like Colin Ferguson
But now ya heard us from the under so feel the thunder
Ya best ta come clean like J-Rule and Felix Unger
I'm buggin like gristle, see I suggest you
dismiss you, my style's official and that's the issue

Yeah, say it (say it) uh-huh
I'm the illest

Yeah, yo




I gotta be a ill nigga, with no denyin
How the FUCK I get this crowd movin without even tryin?
Made it out the projects, against all odds


Went from, ridin these trains to coppin expensive cars


And even so, all this shit don't make me better than y'all
It only means that I work harder than the average nigga
Never sat around for handouts, I watched and observed


Then quickly rubbed my eyes, if my vision got blurred


I coulda sold drugs (yea yea) 'til I got bagged and jailed
Out of sight, out of mind, niggaz locked feel me like braille

(Feel me) While everybody was chillin

I was broke like a motherfucker, loyal to my vision


Knowin that I'd be on top or somewhere close to it
Nigga, my livin quarters'll be the thing to prove it!

And vowed once I got there to never ever lose it

Let my, head get big and slack off on my music

I'm the illest!

""We done seen it all, done been through it all yo"" -> Prodigy

I'm the illest

""Let y'all niggaz know right now, word to mother f'real"" -> P

You know I..

Come through with that seven-four pound I
Voice activated, know these whities just hate it


Thinkin I'm a drug dealer, how else could he cake it?

BITCH, my shit legit, plus I invested in stocks

So if this rap dough stop (yea) the show won't stop (uh-uh)

Believe me there's more ways than a few to make it pop (word)


You gotta have it in you, bring it out once it's needed (yea)
I won't stop 'til I'm famous, hostin shows with Regis (that's right)
Be strategic, live it shit it and breathe it


It's my world, my game won't be defeated

(C'mon, give it to me give it to me)

Keep them checks comin, thoughts flowin

Words blowin, hoes goin, Havoc always holdin

First one to fuck in back of the Porsche truck

Lord knows how many babies that chick coughed up


If you asked my enemies they would say it was all luck

That's why you see, mixed emotion when my name's brought up
Cause I'm the illest



[Chorus]




[Havoc]
Yo, you know you ill when you can kill two birds (yea)
With one stone alone and slowly emerge


From the deep depths of jealousy and envy's domain
Make chips then stash for the days it rain


Never cry and survive the pain (that's right)

Though shit looked impossible, to an, eye untrained

Nothin to lose, and know the game, be proud of yourself

Remind yourself, say it to yourself, say it

You off in the corner glowin' (""What can I do?"")
Nothin' else, but to take what's yours, convert it to mines
From the cash to the shine (""What can I do?"")
When shit is so fucked up, can't tell wrong from right
Right from wrong (""What can I do?"")
When they say, life is short, to you it's the cash
Today it's seemin' long (""What can I do?"")
Now I try to keep a positive look, my motto to jux
But can't seem to stay focused (""What can I do?"")
They say, an unoccupied mind's the devil's playground
So I sat and wrote this, to kill time (""What can I do?"")

[Prodigy]
Yeah yeah that's that gangsta shit son
I feel you my nigga (that's right that's right) (""What can I do?"")
(Infamous baby you ain't know?) We goin' do it like this
(That Mobb shit nigga) (""What can I do?"")

But send niggas to hell
They try and stop me from cashin' in man (""What can I do?"")
But squeeze without thinkin', flip without warnin'
I got the drop on 'em (""What can I do?"")
You know, give it my best, empty this clip
And if live and happen to snitch (""What can I do?"")
Except, find his home, bring it to his family
Should I shoot his moms? (""What can I do?"")
Fuck it, send him a warnin', lick that bitch
Let him know the shit is on (""What can I do?"")
It's not my fault, it's just the game we in
And when you violate codes (""What can I do?"")
But punish niggas for they actions
My shit jam when I start blastin', no (""What can I do?"")
Just relax, take out the clip, fix that shit
Put the clip back and keep goin' (""What can I do?"")
Man you gotta keep your thug showin'
People take kindness for weakness and so (""What can I do?"")
But be a cold-hearted bastard
This world is fucked up, and that's how it go (""What can I do?"")

(Fuck that son, Infamous nigga) (""What can I do?"")
(For two-thousands baby, why yall niggas got your own) (""What can I do?"")
(Your little run, your little five year run ten year run)
(Y'all niggas small time baby) (""What can I do?"")

Mobb Deep,"Uh, yeah, yeah, yo, it goes tick tock
This is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz, well, live they shits pop

Hey, hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys' pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

5-8 with double-X-L, pen saggin' blunts draggin'
But never lived well, imagine, a felon on a two-way street
One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap
The other street opportunity, the chance to live sweet
Think positive k-nowledgement k-cypher complete

So you can be an architect, design apartments and shit
Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip
Soon as I'm on the set, I'm never on a chick, I play it cool
But still ain't pussy muscles get wet, it's just the booze

Check my niggaz, what's the gossip, what's the word
Puff some herb, all I see is niggaz runnin', chin shots
All I heard, dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground
Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down

Now it's back to the same old shit
You know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit
In the jungle swingin' on vines
I saw the gat with the same old clip
Another nigga layin' the hit

Bloodied up, screamin', I'm dyin'
I be in Queens where the famous hood rats and ghetto stars are
Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah

Tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through, better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz, well, live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

It's like this nigga, it's on, toilet up for me, roll that shit big
While I reveal the story of a wild street kid
Cock your seat back, relax, while I spit
The spittin' image of how I live

Well, first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks
I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen
""Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open""
Gangsta, I soaked it all in, my first ammo was a one shot

Deuce, deuce, had my pockets full of bullets, I was real loose
Thug parties out in wave crash, always got shot up
Thug parties out in Queens bridge, always got shot up

No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic
Niggaz aim on the fight, we cut yo melon
Drinkin' that old English Red Bull and Blue Bull
Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit, fuck it, we was broke

Little bad ass, my nigga rap sat me down, like this
He said, ""P, you gon' wind up dead
You and Hav' real good with that music shit
You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind off the street""

And it stuck in the back of my head
Though I still did my little bit of menacin'
Every now and then bang-outs in broad daylight
Like these things really happen
Niggaz get cut up, I put it in my rappin'

It's non fiction, it's the real deal fiscal
It couldn't get more graphic, I'm so trail
I said, it's non fiction it's the real deal fiscal
City you havin', let me touch that ass

So tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz well live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

Tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through, better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz well live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop

Blood, sweat and tears, niggas is dead and shit
What the fuck else can happen, yo?
I don't think much more, son, word to mother, yo
We done seen it all, and been through it all, yo
Let y'all niggas know right now
Word to mother, for real, for real
That shit is the truth, I'm not lyin'

I put my lifetime in between the paper's lines
I'm the quiet storm nigga who fight rhyme
P, yeah, you heard of him, but I ain't concerned with them
Nigga, I pop more guns than you holdin' them
Make my route while the sun's out and scold your men
Unload ten in broad daylight, get right
Fuck your life! Hop on my '98 dirt bike
You try to stop mines from growin'
I'll make your blood stop flowin'
Take affirmative action, to any ass if he askin'
Now here come the MAC-10
You's a dick blower, tryin' to speak the Dunn language
What the drilly with that though? It ain't bangin'
You hooked on Mobb-phonics, Infamous-bonics
Lyin' to the Pop Dog like you got it
You ain't no wildin' out for the Knife-Fist thrower

Diamonds and guns before the fame, duke
A nigga like me hold TEC's, are you the same too?
Goin' through the emotions of gun holdin'
Long shotgun's down my pants leg, limpin'
Killa B, you still livin', even my pops too
He taught me how to shoot when I was seven
I used to bust shots crazy, I couldn't even look
Because the loud sound used to scare me
I love my pops for that, I love my nigga D. Black
I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left
And through all of that a nigga ain't scared of death
All y'all brand new niggas just scared to death
I spent too many nights sniffin' coke, gettin' right
Wastin' my life, now I'm tryin' to make things right
Grand open some gates, invest in the rag business
Do things for the kids, the little Dunns
Build a jungle gym behind the crib, so they can enjoy youth
CBR's and VCR's, ATV's and big screen TV's
Nigga, please don't make me have to risk my freedom
We worked our whole life for this, you get your shit beat in (for real)

That nigga P-Double got that shit for y'alls
Peoples to rock to, stirrin' up pots of brew
In hell's kitchen, I chef the impossible
To serve hot plates all across the Unified States
Sit down and sup' with the top rap reps
We the streets that's watchin', boy, move diligent
You better walk like a nigga on a tightrope do
Infamous first infantry, first division, fourth mission
First assignment, give 'em that shit they been missin'

Those that listen get addicted to my diction
Fuck rhymes, I write prescriptions for your disease
Generic raps just not potent like P's
One-thousand one-hundred CC's on the throttle
I peel off, chest naked on Katanas
Spaghetti head, Mobb niggas is full bred
Fully-blown melanin tone
I rock skeleton bone shirts and verses
But thirst for worse beats
So I can put more product out on the street
Get respect and love all across the board
We've been adored for keepin' it raw
Nothin' less or more, I score every time for sure
While the rest of y'all niggas just nil

Yo Yo
If we got plans for murder we gon' follow thew
Some times we game play we just gotta move
At tha heat of tha moment then its time to shoot
Ain't no time in stayin just time to prove
Gasoline will do damage that won't heal back
We gon' hack that boy headless you can't fix that

Came threw blowin tha heat but its all speculation
Got some murderin ass niggaz reduce space men
But there's gonna be a conflict if you get in are way men
I tell ya this 1 time get out are way men
Cause I will kill one of you bitches fro bringin dat shit
See we don't give a fuck about your reputation
Or how many soles your walk with will put you with them
Ya name rings bells there sowed to ma bullets
Fuck you n' everybody you move wit lets do this..

Them guns we holding, claustrophobic, we'll let 'em air
Dump-dump, reloaded the Amerikaz Nightmare

Slugs travel much farther

With the box cutter, top gutter
I hover over you lames, run for cover, end in your brain
Yeah, you did your thang but not very good
And by the looks of things, You can't come back to the hood
This is not a good look for you my nigga
Wus really poppin, Inquirin minds wanna know
How you rocking them new guns, we cop those
Invoke, like we bought 'em in Costco's
Don't get yaself murk'd, wet shirt
Said it first, hurry this that red alert
You ain't gotta get buck to know that this letter hurt
The sight of my hammer, gotcha heart pumping

Moms will be wearing that yellow ribbon

Won't catch me gun smokin, have the cops think
There was drugs that provoke it while we rollin, hey

Of that thang, heard it's lethal in a good way
Just so you kno I ain't the one that get yo clit ate
But hope you got a strong back, I'll make yo shit break

When I pass by, have you stuck, S.U.'s, black 'em up
Twenty-four, black rims, tires gotta fatten up
Whips, go to AutoSport, stash spot, sorta for my mascots

When you see us, better bleed us off the top of the dome
Meanin' you better get to squeezin' cause our reason is gone
Meanin 'that shit is out the window, we won't give it a thought
And we don't give a loud motherfuck about who you are
What's your set that you rep, you can get 'em involved
(*BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM*) is all you hearin' when you go at the Mobb
(*BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM*) is all I'm sayin' if you tryin' to talk
We what you would call, niggas that talk it walk it and live it
Your music is not ""Murder,"" you an Infamous mimic
You what we would call, niggas who suck dick for a living
Get off our balls, or we'll take chances for prison

I don't kill you that's what it'll do
Run with a few multiple-scribed, they say we belong in a fuckin' zoo

We done crashed all sorts of clubs forcin' the love
Often above them cowards and them so called thugs
When we come through respect is there, cause we demand it
Know the mobb is in the building, we officially landed

Keep your eyes on the man with the hammers, they can't stand us
Try to raid us the faggots snitchin' and got the cameras
Cock the cannons but shorty just keep dancin' 'cause it might
Be a chance that it won't pop off

Come with somethin better than that, to blow your mind more

Gettin our shine on... I think this due for a storm, hurricane Mobb
Rain on your parade and you can thank god
Or you can thank P, for simply not squeezin'
Really it wasn't called for, and you don't want it

To call for it, don't play my gun, it go off
Inside of your head oops, niggaz be dead
Then we drooped in the Coupes real heavy on the gas
Out there like the concord

I show you how to do songs, then after than show

Another day, another dollar, it's 'bout getting money
Then you can give me a holla, my nose runny
I've been out in the cold, hustling for so long
My hands numb, but bet I feel that paper in my palm

It's like ahh, shit it's on, time to go shopping
For cars not fashion, my whips be the bomb
My clothes, be the same shit that we had on
And fuck looking cute, save that for the broad

It's the H-A-V-O-C, dump and reload
Knock-knock, answer that, I'm blasting through the peephole
Body charges, pay lawyers so we beat those
But get locked and I'm slutting lady C.O.'s

And we the only niggas you know, that fuck they P.O.'s
They push our files to the top, you still on parole
We got, money to roll, no time for penitentiaries
Too much dollars to fold, it's bulging out our jeans

But losing ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world

Y'all like bitches, the chit-chattering
Stay not liking a nigga but giving dap to him
Hav' don't change for no chick, and they adapt to him
Never get cool with you niggas, I end up clapping 'em

Federal note fetish, you fuck with my niggas
Franklin and Grant, get your ass blammed with the quickness
Y'all niggas is finished, you overdosing the world
With that cute shit, it's time for this realness

And here I go again, letting the mac blow
Slugs bubble up in your stomach like lactose
I'mma date shorty, put it up in her backbone, for real
Put it on her like a track I rapped on, for real

Know what? We outlive labels, and distributors
We run laps around every artist on your payroll
Then hop up in a Range Rov', jet black with the black rims

And I don't think you'll ever understand
Until you get a dose of your own
It's your turn now

Crazy how I never use to say a single word
I just held in all the hurt, all this hurt
And I was so afraid you might flip out
And leave me in the cold
Then my mind ran out of space
So many stories I'm told

How would you feel
If I put my girls before the one I love
How would it feel
If every time you want to talk
I turn the TV on
How would you feel
If when we're making love
I don't go down no more
So you know how I feel
Get ready cause a 3-6-0's about to go down

Taste this
And let's see if you can handle it
Just one sip
You probably choke on your own medicine

Once you swallow then I got you trapped

No more running
No more hiding
And if you try
I'm still gon find ya
And get you back
Get you back

Listenin' to my conversations
On the other phone
Got somebody followin' me
When I leave out our home
And I am so appalled
You take it there
When you're the one who messed up
It's like I'm sleepin' with the enemy

How would you like it
If your girlfriend started playin' F.B.I
And she was the one
You forgave when she messed up
And spread her thighs
Plays with his brain
Started foolin' with ya money
Your house
Your Bens
Your friends
Your work

So they call me a silent storm
And soon he'll feel all my of pain
I'll come for sun after the rain (Oh)
ain't nothin' sweeter than revenge
To put this bullshit to an end
Let's see what happens when I get a Lex
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Lets see what happens if I quit my job

No more hiding (Yep)

Or get you bent, whatever you like
I'm not into wifin - no sir

Got a man home beast, then be easy ma
She don't know how to creep, I be teachin ma
I got jars of that haze, yeah I'll show you how to twist

Get it tight but not too tight, it's all in the lick

All you need is the will to learn
.. and some good trees to burn
Relax, you'll be straight like a perm, word

Babe girl you now rockin with strength, Infamous Thugs is nuttin to slug

I don't want to scare you away, I'm sayin wha**up
Tell your friends come over here, and party with us

If why'all from the hood, why'all gon' love our ways
Cause we got money, and we still the same way
Go 'head, do that dance, and you can feel free
To be you and just do you, everything's great

Yeah tonight we gon' have a little too much to drink
Just leave your car in the lot, so you can feel safe
We goin' party 'til six then take it to my place
Then later on I'll have a car bring you back safe

I ain't into games, I'll give it to you straight
We can have a part time love, I just want it straight

So I kick the Dunn language, the response was better

We like, 'Dunn' did it, 'Dunn' hit it, 'Dunn' split it
Everything hon wanted, Dunn was with it
She like to see me doo-rag'd and me ball-cap'd
She like to see me tailored, Gator'd, slacked

In fact, I see you lookin through the windshield wipers
As the rain hit the windows on the blue Dodge Viper
The sniper, not never but hit ya from long range
Check it, got haters like X had Brother Baines

Used to have quarter thangs but now I got quarter games
Got a quarter of a movie, here come {?} trains

I'm not tryin to be your girlfriend you dig
I ain't even tryin to lock you in
There's no need for us to pretend
I'd rather spend yo' dividends

You and me can be lover friends
I'd rather keep this between us two

Just movin' to the music it's on
And the sounds of 50 and D-R-E
Everything's calculated and sound precise
Another move another mill', let's get right aight?
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Feelin' lucky enough to bet it all on the dice
Shorty do what you wanna do, hit the dancefloor
And move how you wanna move, later on
We can cruise if you wanna cruise, it's whatever you want
The fact is I got more than I flaunt, yeah

I do my thang, in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dancefloor jampacked, look

Bottles of DP, I do it real B-I-G
Bitches break their neck to be where I be
Take 'em to ecstasy, without ecstasy
I'm a chef you need the hit I got the recipe
Doc got the antidote, it's in the drums and the notes
Can you feel it? Em said for me to make you feel it
And remind you that you rockin' with the realest

'Til the speakers all blown, we gon' turn it up
And do that damn thang, yeah do that mayne
Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
Get to poppin' and shakin' that thing on the flo'
A little dose of it, now I want some more
Nobody put that thang on me like that before
I be a fiend for it, it's the way you move
But I ain't payin' for it, cause I ain't no fool
If you okay with it, tonight I stay with it
Hit the telly play with it in a major way get it

Mobb Deep,"It seems like, ever since a nigga became multi
Every women on planet Earth got their eyes
On the kid, they all wanna touch
On a nigga skin, they love me so much
They all got P on they brain
And at the show they do anything to get backstage
Just so they can hug 50, and kiss on Banks
After we all get a turn, the broads said, ""Thanks.""
Shit, just last month a nigga wasn't shit
Now I finger pop dimes, with diamonds on my fists
Niggaz bringing me they girl like, ""You can have my bitch
Just help me get down with the G-unit!""
Man, little groupies, they make me sick
You ain't getting in the after party unless you're a chick
And bitch, you ain't getting in the hotel, unless we grip
And you're gonna look fine, plus suck a mean dick (woah)

Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl, I know I seen your face before
Turn around, yeah I know, I recognize that ass
You was at the last show with your backstage pass

Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl, I know I seen your face before
Turn around, yeah I know, I recognize that ass
You was at the last show with your backstage pass

Shorty what's up? You know you wanna roll with a nigga
I'm trying to fuck, if you decide to go with a nigga
I'll tear it up, in the tele you'll be loving a nigga
I'll work that, work that. yeah, I'll work that, work that

It's funny how a bitch'll make her way backstage
Harder than the politician on the campaign
No games baby girl, gotta do the damn thing
Let me see you back it up till you pull a hamstring
Face fuck, girl go for broke
So hard, leave stretch marks up in her throat
Then Havoc on the floor
I don't need to get her number, she'll be at the next show
Half-ass dress, smelling like sex
Dried up nut on her neck
They don't call us the massacre tour for nothing
We destroy good girls, send them home, pussy sore from fucking
Catch 'em in the morning in somebody White-T
And that's the kind of bitch that you call wifey
She'll do it anywhere from the tele to the tour bus
Here's the hot line bitch, call us

Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl, I know I seen your face before
Turn around, yeah I know, I recognize that ass
You was at the last show with your backstage pass

Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl, I know I seen your face before

The illest yachts, the hottest broads they make
Can't wait 'til it's my turn to get dough
So I don't gotta fuckin' day dream no more

Coming up we ain't have much, a lot of canned food
Cereal in the white box with powdered milk too
My moms couldn't buy me the shoes I want
We put lay-away on shit that only cost a few bucks

It's cool to have shelto, I had the libeaz
With the weak ass Velcro, looking ridiculous
I knew way back then we had to step it up
'Cause waiting for the bus in the snow wasn't us

Me and hav' took the train from Manhattan to Conney
Everyday and night just so we can got songs done
We had guns, weed and a couple of forties
If we got lucky on the way, we could jook someone

We used to watch video music box
And pray maybe one day we could get a shot
Outside, my niggaz had all that shit you see on T.V.

A vigil, bullet proof cars, supped up time shares

Or how the streets gonna be when they release fur

When I get that million bucks will I remain the same?
Or will I have to get at niggaz 'cause they sayin' I changed?
Will everybody wanna ball, be my friend and leech?
When niggaz put me to the test, have me clapping the heat

I used to think bein' rich, ain't all that bad
A far cry from what a dream was all I had
Do I got the right team or they riding for cash
Would they jump in front of me when them cameras flash

Is the 'pop police, gon' be up my ass
Can't leave the heat under the seat, gotta find a better stash
Gotta collect receipts 'cause that bitch uncle Sam
Invades your space when you evade his tax

50 4 1l's yea I copped 'em for them hoes

I had you but you showed me no affection

Got withdrawals, took you to the malls
The more I got of you, the more I got spoiled
Now my toes curl, let's have a baby boy or girl
Had you in Switzerland, half across the world

Grew up an investment and you can't be doubled
Came back around when I bubbled
Now I'm in trouble, took the wrong turn
Let my homie borrow you, now he won't pick up his phone

Where you goin', baby, where you goin'?
Talk about money this is money, baby, where you goin'?

To get you I'd risk that time in prison
To get you I'd take risks that'd mean death
I'ma love you until the end, it's all about you my precious

I'd never ignore you for a bitch again
I'd put that on my honest
Got these other nigga jealous 'cause you all over me
In public, you be all inside my jeans

Took me all over the planet, places like Europe
Taught me new tricks at them banks out in Zurich
These niggaz, back in the hood
Could never have you like how I do

Forget the trials and tribulations you been through in your life
Come to me runnin' trust me baby I make it right

You with me lil' mama, let's breeze lil' mama
We start with a lil' bit and take it to a lotta that
Love gettin' hotter you can if you wanna
Have it all it's yours just ask and you got it

The trillion cuts, the Audi and Porsche trucks
I do these things for you 'cause you my done
Girl, feel special 'cause I don't spend
Nuttin' but time with certain other broads I rip

You belong in minks, bracelets and rings
Not handcuffs forget about that locket chain
And just leave lil' mama, this P lil' mama
I ain't them, I'm me lil' mama

My baby, you crazy and I'm hooked
Your body right, your smile light up the room
That man you got, that nigga's a fool
Guess one man's trash is the next man's jewel

When we first middle sex fif, knew that you was that chick
Wooly sayin' holla at her, whip sayin' girl get in
Remind me of a women that, I can have without the stress
Asked if she had a man, couldn't tell if no or yes

Hell, I just dipped her number and talked more
When I hit you one conversation, I knew that she had trust issues
Who the hell would do that, man cheated on her twice
Last one before that, found out homie had a wife

Looked so secure, but yet so delicate
Can't come back in the crib without a search for evidence
Baby girl, I ain't here to hurt you, here to protect and serve you
Ain't your fool model them other dudes don't deserve you

What you tryin' to do, scare me off and leave you low
Funny how you let it ring and never answer your phone

He like the 'Sold-a-soul' man, who the fuck you 'cause? I'm out

And give you a chance

Every time I hurt you it's because of what someone else
Has done to me and I know it's not really fair
No I just can't trust you 'cause I just got outta something
And I'm running, boy you know that I'm running scared

You treat me so good that it's just too good to be true
And I don't think that I really deserve
To be treated like a woman should
'cause I been so hurt in the past I'm still carryin' bags

This is no way to live

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Trust me man it's ok bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house it's like oh no
50 got 'em locin again, they open again
Got 'em sippin on that juice and gin

You could find me in the background burnin that backwood
Stylin and stuntin doin my two step frontin
Now I'm a tell you What Em told me homey
Just lose the parental discretion's 

advised this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumpin, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumpin, cause I'm sick with flow

You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's fo' sho'
I got the info you already know
Man I get it poppin in the club

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You, know, I, got, what it takes to 
make the club go outta control

You want to search me than search me 
but hurry up cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twistin
In club today for the chick to go both, 

ways let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink till the burn is gone, 
hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make me sign a disclaimer

Try to get me on some pop shit these chicks will frame ya
But, in any event, keep fuckin with 50 it make cents
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes want to holla
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalla

Now my buddy so gone I can pop ya collar
Now follow same nothin let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starvin
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go

Mobb Deep,"Yeah

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Now if you followed my footsteps and walked through my shoes
You wouldn't go against me cause you know you would lose
It's been along time comin' I done paid my dues
Now every time I turn around it's like I'm back in the news

I know a lot of niggaz want me wearin' cement shoes
And Uncle Tom niggaz wanna see me locked up to
Around the same time KRS was writin' Black Cop
I was busy tryin' to pump cracks in the black blocks

Poppin' shit to my homeys about how my gat pop
Got rid of that chrome thing and got back a black glock
P ninety hold ten but I had six shots
I used to walk around with it and risk gettin' knocked

I bought a fresh box of bullets from Old Man Sam
Wanted to shoot a nigga so bad it was itchin' my hand
Some shot it out with me, and some of them ran
And some of them dashed were good and some of them jammed

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Now if you take a good look and look into my face
And if they wouldn't even dare to violate my space
Som' I did so much dirt, I'm tryin' to clean my slate
And ate so many niggaz food and now they want mines ate

The dogs bark when I walk and since the souls I took
Moms pray for me with her right hand on the good book
Saw shots fly by me, no, I shouldn't been trippin'
The Pulp Fiction must have been God's divine intervention

Wouldn't thought then from that, I learned my lesson
And clean my act up and go straight to perfection
Uncle La got knocked the feds hit it with seven
And left me with the fifty cal and a mac eleven

Start everything from everything from heads to the worries
And had half the hood damn near wanted to mirk us
Found myself askin' God what the fuck is my purpose
You go to heaven, know I'm foul but put a good word in

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Now homey if I go to Hell and you make it to the pearly gates
Tell the boss man we got beef
And tell his only son, I'm a see him when I see him
And when I see him, I'm a beat him like a movie

For leavin' us out to dry on straight poverty
For not showin' me no signs they watchin' over me
Yo! We a new breed in two thousand six
We don't give a fuck about that religious bullshit

Nigga show me where the cash at
The nice whips with the three car garage to fit them shits
Man my life is painful, pray to angels
I'm prayin' to myself hopin', I ain't got to spank you

My bullets shank you, and when my guns start cuttin'
Ain't nobody gon' save you
In the bible times, they ain't had to deal with the shit
We dealin' within, these survival times

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

You the nigga that was careless, get the fuck out of here

Even worse they ask for help, like I'm the Red Cross

You just a groupie, oh you gangsta, then shoot me
Who gives a fuck really, I miss my nigga Twin, kill me

Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminesce, twenty years later how we was gettin it
Either with me go against the grain you better hit me
Leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me
Cause it's a small world and niggaz, talkin like bitches
Bitches singin like snitches, pointin you out in pictures
Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin me
All that bullshit, is just makin me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin chedda
If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, Sun you, then I hold you
Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you
It'll be I, like I'm supposed to, the click is coastal
International you local, Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit, that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, Son I solved em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos

Yo, the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips
You seein clips when the mac spit your top got split
Layin dead with open eyes close his eyelids
Turn off his lights switch to darkness, cause deep in the abyss
is street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
Youse the wild child, kid cold turnin men into mice
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggaz is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness
POW niggaz is found MIA
We move like the special forces, green beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way
The God P walk with a limp see, but simply
To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it full for so long, cause I don't waste shit
You probably hid, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claimin that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missles
along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryin to make CREAM and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound
Speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground
I could truely care less the God will get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point never diss
Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the burbs

13 years in the projects, my mentality is what, kid

sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live
or am I going to burn in hell for all the things I did
no time to dwell on that 'cause my brain reacts

I don't fake jacks kid, you know I bring it to you live

Like I don't keep it street, like I ain't got the heat
Like I ain't homicide all over the beat

Like I ain't for the beef, like I don't really care
'Cause I ain't camera shy we can do it anywhere
There's diamonds in my chain, there's diamonds in my ear
A n**** come slippin' I'll make him disappear

Ay n**** f*** all the slick talk, get bread instead
Stay low strapped up metal on inf red
Too smooth, won't slip, new jewels, don't trip
Been around the world twice jet, lear, boat, whip

Oh s***, I'm hella rowdy and I'm nothin' nice
Money ain't s*** but a number name ya f***in' price
D*** rider, coat Taylor, a** kisser, sucker for love
Type to pick up the glass slipper

Look around a** n**** before you add liquor
'Cause bein' an ad-libber he'll be in a bag with ya
I'm seein' a bad picture of bein' a cab skipper
Broke as f*** waitin' for Satan to come and get ya

Keep ya clique tight, know ya goals
Don't speed, slow ya role, don't speak, learn the codes
For they pop ya a** barbecue ya body with beans
Outta the shoty while I'm in the Maserati
With somethin' that's gonna swallow me

Get too close and I'm ****** it won't be no discussion

And you turn up missin' with ya own page in the feds
I got power and I will flex on you real quick
Call ya dawgs, call ya trick, hug ya momz for you split
'Cause you ain't never gone see that b**** again

And this ain't a war n**** we just havin' fun with ya
Like a bed with a baby, if I smack ya I might **** ya
Half a million in diamonds, half a billion from rhymin'
And I'm steady and climbin' that means I'm still growin' up

Got you burned while you lookin', see my Ferrari in Brooklyn
On the corner of murda and duke, so come through
I'll light ya buildin' on fire that's why these rappers retire
'Cause they tired of dealin' with the n****z like me

Now enough with all the lame s*** and wrestlin' games, kid
I need the rocks to fill the rest of the chain with
I need the block to feel the best that I came with
I need the cops to get the f*** off of my d***

Different day, same s*** media and paparazzi love
Envy and betrayal, my heart's cold as hockey gloves
I light it up and take off that beef and broccoli high
Chocolate tie, green skunk, south Jamaica queens punk

Stand up ya boy's back put ya grams up
Get money you ain't heard nothin' but a hit from me
Quit dummy 'cause it's a changin' of the guards
Beat b****es over the head the caveman of the squad

And he barely fell victim 'cause they raised him up so hard
So my 9 is on my hip and my praise is up to God
'Cause we in a battlefield where the razors lead to scars
And the lasers lead to holes, s**** in n out ya clothes

Aw fuck it, let the little nigga live!
Yeah right, then have these other niggas up my wig
No mercy, shit left me about
Years ago, I let him in, I'll see him out
And now he on the floor just bleeding out
You know it's on when you see me and my team out

[Chorus]
We conquer, overpower and crush
Come and get washed up

E's back, easy man, move before we seep that
Lame ass team that you got off of the mat
Weak cat, pull it back, please do repeat that
Queens rep: we got more than a little of that
We used to daydream on the bench how we could cease this
And conquer like the British in snapbacks and fitteds
Getting soaked up, no love, the boy's back, he showed up
Soldier up, you know it up, come and get folded up
Your bitch is attracted to all of this madness
She want a felon, she ain't fuckin' with no graduates
Bad hood, bitch magnet, I'm a savage
They just wanna fuck, niggas wanna talk marriage
Baby carriage, sittin' in a tree
While I be pipin' 'em down inside of hoopties
Like, longer, harder, this Mobb shit stronger
Than all of y'all weak music, we conquer

Heart beating crazy from a dream I had
We was doing it up, cash flowing
I know you hear me nigga but you not knowing
Champagne bottles and hundreds flowing in the pool
So much poppin' the jacuzzi was full
Mad hoes for the bro
And everybody rolling up, we could all smoke
Pure molly, good golly that turned up the whole party, a few notches
It's all coming back now

I had a dream I didn't even go get my Grammy
I was smoking and fucking bitches in Miami
I had a dream that Biggie told me that I was nice
Then I woke up and realized it was real life
4-5th on my hip, bottles pop
Weed in the air, these hating niggas still on my dick
I had a dream that my niggas came home
Celebrating life, then I woke up, my shit was blown

Used to mix E&J with Ginger Ale
Sold crack when mom's drank pink champale
Now I'm in Anguilla on a ship that sails
Out the St. Maarten got them bricks in them mail
I don't play with the money cause the bread get stale
Rather sleep in a box 'fore I sit in a cell
Raising a wine glass, spliff in the air
I'm a gangsta, shoot me in the head if I tell
King pin, rap nigga dreams at twelve

Know what that mean, motherfucker fell asleep

Hangover three, had bottles non-stoppin'

Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
KnowhatI'mean? Have a situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse
for the cops to discover, while I be dippin in the Range Rover
All jeweled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryin to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low sippin Asti Spumante
Niggaz try to creep on the side of my jeep
Stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really yeah
but keep lettin them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours and your team's inferior
You want to bust caps I get, all up in your area
Kidnap your children make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got G's in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
Push back, the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
through the butter soft leather upholestry
But mostly, keep the gat closely, 'cause niggaz want to toast me

There's a war goin on outside, no man is safe from
You could run but you can't hide forever
From these, streets, that we done took
You walkin witcha head down scared to look
You shook, cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cop's control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin to bag me and get rocked steady
By the mac one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home wit
My skin is thick, cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin lye relaxin
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul, before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
And to the drama I built, and all unfinished beef
You will soon be killed, put us together
It's like mixin vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin, takin my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord forgive me the Hennesey got me not knowin how to act
I'm fallin and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say so it's left a untold fact, until my death

I-llegal world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged, that fucked me up God
But shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples when you're upstate bleedin
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid witchu
Hit wit a 2 to 4 it's difficult
Wild on the streets I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, cause hoes like to run game
Some niggaz like to trick but I ain't wit that trickin shit
I'm like a Jew, savin dough so I can big whip
Pushin a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get I'm stayin in the projects, forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worse and my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot
Fuck lookin cute, I'm strictly Timb boots and army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin the smell
In the Bridge gettin down it ain't hard to tell

On the real all you crab niggas know the deal 
To my seed May I lead you into no breed of evil 
In the categories and stories I breed my sequel 
You know the money blues blunts broken 22's 
Monkey see Monkey do 
A shorty sipping sunny dew 
Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. that's mad smokey 
Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me 
Up in the Marriot, Sweet dirty tint, Don't make no noise cause we dirty 
Tell the ho's to hurry in 
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom 
And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens 
Rolling on you non descript niggas 
Your marked for death like colombians with bad coke that gip niggas 
Tilt the dutch, twisting up the uwee if your skilled enough 
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili's bust

On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 2x 

Now its verbal abuse cause the mic's in use 
This is your sorry excuse 
Get your neck put in a noose 
K-L is quick to let loose, to make your blood count reduce 
Over the snare drum 
We reproduce like cum 
Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was 
Giving life to idea 
Through the verse is what he does 

See a close call about two clicks from my fortress 
We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses 
QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us 
We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is 
We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess 
Accumalating to much cream for you to touch 
Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers 
From the ruckus 
Your gone and your crew still love us 
Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit 
I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent 
Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles 
Onyx pendants, and Rubied down shit from the nile 
Kamikaze style, sought the antique three pound 
Yo Nas, lets cop this brick and let the mobb supply the town

The side bubble converti 
Eyes low cause the lye blow 
Five-oh know we dirty drive slow 
Write a line sipping a glass of wine 
The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind 
When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with 
Exhale precise shine like cocian white 
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know 
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinite's and lexus 
So send my enimies a message 
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot 
I'm still protected 
So never ask why I write so violent 
My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island 
I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and 
When I performed niggas mic's went silent 
To the kid who made my man ill will bless this

Infamous for the world to hate or play this
Don't give a fuck if you can't rock to this
My duns' heads bop to this
We stand out like a tourist
And make more noise than them other rap niggas
No gimmicks
Just pure adrenaline
Raw lyrics incredible beats
Don't mean to rub it in
But your small time beneath our feet
Straight ass cheeks niggas be askin
For ass whippings
Guns kick like pelle
My big shit be jumping like Jordan
Often lay a man down on the floor when it gets like that
I'm not blowing off rounds so you can hear sounds
So you can run back actin like you a vet
And swearin' you dead
You survived some real shit
Now what's this it's not going down like this
Ground y'all niggas like punishment
Dumpin' out full clips when we dumb out
Though I'd rather do music and chill the fuck out
Dun you bugged out I'm trying to walk a peaceful route
But niggas always got mouth until that piece come out
Niggas always gonna think something sweet
Until they least expect you bringing action exactly

Point game track y'all merk like a jaguar nascar
And be out buck 80 on the slow mar
Hennesy spillin' all over my radar
Stay charged niggas getting amped off the mobb shit
Have you wildin' out on some club shit
Fit to make you dance at the same time
Stop and glance 
Slap flames out the nigga with the wrong idea
Young shit with young mind but that quite contraire
Young nigga smart nigga
Who started from the stairs 
How dare
You try to come around the way
In fear like a nigga that been there for years
Shout words that we live but don't play with it
'Cause when the shit go down you be like they did it

You feel the shots pain every heartbeat throbbin'
Don't get excited you'll only make it worse fighting
Spent most of my nights graveyard shifting
Make burial grounds be that man grim reaper

And nature don't surprise me now
Prepare for the worst and never believe the silver line clouds
Scrutinize crowds
My surroundings
Get suspect we start four-poundin' shit
Picture me up in the mix
With the next man broke and is on my dick
A good man of plenty but an enemy it was clear

I count on one finger all y'all rap niggaz that excite me
Y'all niggaz is trash rap - wanna fight me?
You shook to death, take breaths and step lightly
Y'all Little League niggaz is so bald they might be
spent too much time with wifey, come out to play
with the hard-headed, Infamous song torture
Crack your knuckles, buckle up your pants tight
Pull your hats down, let's get it on like papi bar fights
My spiral book, hold the world's most lethal
There's no cure, for what my pen do neither
Bring the fever, y'all niggaz is the rap Justin's
While we was gone for a moment, y'all kept the crowd goin now
move over bacon, time for som'in meatier
Your shit's weak, your best song was mediocre
Fuck a penis, how dare you entertain the thought
that you could come out to challenge me in blood talk?
Take a walk jerk this ain't Levert, Sweat and Johnny Gill
This is rap for real, somethin you feel
You catch a chill when you hear the Mobb bang through your stereo
It's heavy metal for the black people, rock'n'roll
but it's hip-hop though, my drug music
It's thereapeutic to the user, you slam dance to it

My shit'll touch home, straight to the core you ain't alone

Concealin them slugs, if it go down, remember that mug
Cause ain't no love when a nigga shit is touchin his ribs
Hungrier than a hostage, shit, we blitz
in formation pack the led up in shit
The better you get, the better we get, and that's it
Yo this snake's in the grass when they bite Mobb anti-venom
Stop em in they tracks, goin at em when you send em
Imperial dogs, creepin through fog
Carved needle slip and you fold, the shit's lethal
We roll Mobb D-iezel, the whole Q.U. double-E, N-S
And when you spot us, play low-key

[Prodigy]
Dunn these niggaz is actresses, and they tryin to play the man's role
Can't they see us wildin on the video?
Don't they see us in the club swingin elbows?
Or on the street with our jewels on the cell phone?
Hoppin the sidewalk with Benzes and Jeeps
I ran through more cars than it's sand on the beach
I'm pleased to meet you, now here's a word to the smart
Don't ever let your peoples boost up your heart
Cause you'll fuck around and get your ass torn apart
Challengin the Mobb in the arts
Our literature stands collossal, compared to y'alls
Way ahead of your time, you're strugglin to keep up
Your style's limited, your rap's primitive
Go 'head with that bullshit you kicked Dunn

With new sights for me to see.

No more me and you to plague me mentally.

Just remember the good and forget the bad, (Forget the bad)
Always remember the love that we once had.
Just remember the good and forget the bad, (Forget the bad)
Always remember the love that we once had.

It's time to put our love to rest,
And too bad we couldn't pass the test.
And as they say: ""It's for the best"",
We can leave those memories with the rest.

I'm telling you...

I gave you everything and more,

Can't seem to feel it anymore.
