Welcome to my hood

And every know this is the hot spot

Welcome to my hood
Them boys will put you down on your knees
(Woop, woop)
That's the sound of the police in my hood

Audemar on my wrist
Diamonds, look like they glowing
Fifty stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing
Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin'
Treat 'em like jack boys, catch 'em slippin' then slay 'em
Lord forgive me for my sins,
That's my confessions if they put me in this Benz
I got possession of a federal offense
I'm talking pressure in my criminal intent
So wear ya vest's and I'm still gon' stunt
Like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck ya house note nigga
Blow that bitch on a bottle
The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo' in the back (Rose)
Tell you ""we the best forever"" DJ Khaled handle that

I know some niggas from my hood that would rob Norieaga
I'm talkin' Norieaga, nigga, the real Norieaga
If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us
And tell congress when you see 'em bitch I'm stealin' cable
And leave the D-Boys alone 'cause they motivate us
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers
Some of 'em on house arrest, some of 'em on child support
Some of 'em did they bid, the other half waiting to go to court
Mr. Landlord we gon' bust your ass for that eviction note
Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo'
I'm talking strip clubs, I'm talking liquor stores
We throw our money round here, but y'all can

That's the sound of the police in my hood

Bitch I'm on probation, so my nerves bad
And they say time fly's, well mine's first class
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets
I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach
Back from hell, cell twenty three, tell the warden kiss my ass
Pockets on Monique
Bitch I'm from the murder capital
Hoe I'm far from practical
Shit happens and since I'm the shit, I'm who it happens to
Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I'm red hot
I don't see nobody, see nobody like a head shot
All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out
Got it sewn up, check the thread count

T-Pain,"Oh,

Baby stop, not in here(I got a presidential suite)
Baby why don't we just get outta here (Where we can have the freedom to be)
Secret lovers under covers have no fear cause

I'm about to blow ya mind
Blow ya mind, blow ya mind
Girl I'm not here to waste ya time,
Waste ya time, waste ya time
Girl I'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind
Girl I'm not here to waste ya time, waste ya time, waste ya time
Girl I'm about to blow ya mind

Baby now we're here what you wanna do? (I'll let you think about it for a minute)
Don't worry bout me, I'm here to satisfy you (Ain't gotta worry about me getting it in)
And ya mind ya body and ya soul comes 1st to me (Its time to make the temperature rise)
But we had to get away don't want nobody to see (Why?)

[Chorus]

Baby was it good, satisfactory (I got time so we can do it again)
Was it good for you like it was for me (One is not enough let's get the second one in)
Baby I know you been, you been dying to see (If I can do your body right)
If your baby could fulfill that one fantasy one more time

[Chorus]",Blow Ya Mind,2005
T-Pain,"It's kind of like you holdin' me, strokin' me
Takin' control of me, never let go of me cuz you my girl
It's kind of like I'm floatin' and takin' a turn
On the roller coaster of love, when I see you shine like pearl

I know you got a man and all, but he ain't treatin' you right
Nine times out of ten, you won't see him tonight
Baby girl, I'm tellin' you, wan' smellin' you, wanna situation
So don't even keep me waitin' and contemplatin', come on

Lovin' the square, I'm just rollin'
Me and Tai can't control it
They serve told me to look to the left
Jay lyrics 'em her and not her
Dog it ain't gettin' no worse
Got better (uh), a brandetta
When I caught my breath I said

Como estas? Ven aqui, mami girl,
Como estas? Ven aqui ir my casa, casa
Como estas? Ven aqui, mami girl,
Como estas? Ven aqui ir my casa, casa

Wednesday night at the moon,
Tryin' to find somethin' to get into
You wouldn't believe what the hell I seen
Drive by a Puerto Rican mama
Had a big thing right behind her
Before she spoke, she didn't think
That I would say

[Chorus]

(Taino rap)

Girl, I can tell you one thing
I'ma put you off in my range
Take yo ass right 'round the 8-5-0
But I can do you better than that
Turn around, let me hug you from the back
I bet you didn't know I knew that espanol
Listen here

[Chorus]",Como Estas,2005
T-Pain,"I got the hat, I got the shoes, I got the outfit
I go outside and pick the right I'm goin' go out with
But right before I hit the streets 
I gotta put on my dancing shoes in the mirror

The hat, rock with it, rock with it
The hat, step with it, step with it
The hat, slide with it, slide with it
The hat, ride with it, ride with it
The hat, walk with it, walk with it
The hat, get low 
The hat, and I know where I'm 'bout to go

[Chorus]
I'll be on the dance floor 
Don't be tricky with me 
Sorry I was in the corner, now she's looking for me
I'll be on the dance floor
That's what I do
In a minute I'll be in it and I'm tricking with you 

I'll be on the dance floor 
Don't be tricky with me 
Sorry I was in the corner, now she's looking for me
I'll be on the dance floor
That's what I do
In a minute I'll be in it and I'm tricking with you 
On the dance floor

I hit the club and I'm ready for a dance hall (a dance hall)
Mr. Dizm 'bout to blow a nigga pants off (his pants off)
So if he wanna ride with me 
I'm 'bout to do the same thing that I be in the mirror

The hat, rock with it, rock with it
The hat, step with it, step with it

Hey this is Yo' boy Tay Dizm 
You know what I'm saying
That kunamattata you know
Hey, I'm doing this here for the south
You know what I'm saying
My nigga Pain

And I told y'all niggas before he dropped this
Cause anything we touch we know it would be the shit
Like an old school body that's good all out
From the grill to the paint to the dog in the back to the jump off
And if he's not gonna set it off, hit the club
And who's step up to my crew, then this is what my crew goin' do my nigga

The hat, rock with it, rock with it
The hat, step with it, step with it
The hat, slide with it, slide with it
The hat, ride with it, ride with it
The hat, walk with it, walk with it
The hat, get low

Somebody told me (told me), today was my day (day)
They see me on the big screen and they see me on the stage
And it must be true, 'Cause, here I am, here I am baby
I wanna thank you

Konvict Muzic, it's time to do it
I can't handle all these bills and payments
This stuff is overstressing me (but I still gotta do it)
Baby mama put me on them papers and get nothing for the baby (but I still gotta do it)
I can't keep on working, (keep on working)
Seems like the whole world's ignoring me (but I still gotta do it)
Schemers keep on drinking (keep on drinking)
Everybody's getting more than me (but I still gotta do it)

So what you think, what you know?

All this music got me going crazy,
Can't even concentrate on my family (but I still gotta do it)
Plus I gotta go through all this family hatred, 
I don't know why everybody's hating me (but I still gotta do it)
Even one of my homeboys thinking that I'm banging his lady,
I don't know why he would think that outta me (but he gotta go through it)
To all the nappy heads I got you baby,
We bout make it yes indeed (and we gon get through it)

[Chorus]

[Bone Crusher]
I work a nine to five shawty and they think it's funny,
And how they feel that my stress don't count homie,
I hit the beat like a cop when I hit the block,
Because my baby's gotta eat, I ain't goin' never stop,
I see them laughing at me fo cause my pants red,
And my do' won't shut and my car's shabby,
But I see the future man like I'm Nostradamus,
And in my heart all I see is a future star,
But in my brain ain't nothing but these notes man,
But y'all don't feel my stress y'all don't understand,
The next step is my pistol and it goes down,
Wiggle it out fat boy just calm down,
And sing this song, and sing that song,
Cause god goin' make a way for me to get my hustle on.

T-Pain,"Ladies and gentlemen
You are now in tuned to what unknown buffoon
With enough room in he's tomb to blow your mind like ""Boom""
Then you assume, that I have done something wrong in my life
But at the same time I'm gonna try to describe the vibe 
Of the world through my eyes
And maybe you won't despise me 
Or try to deprive me of the respect that I need (oh, I see)
You don't know that the nigga Motor just blow and I'm walking by myself
Talking to myself up and down the streets when both my feet is in old shoes
And all these old dudes talking 'bout ""oh, 
It ain't that bad, I walked through the snow in school""
Bitch we live in Tallahassee a place were it never snows 
But it rains on Pain 'cause
Faheem can't take it
My head is a mail box and it's full and I don't want to check it
I wanna buy a whole damn car just to wreck it
'Cause this fucked nigga told my wife I got two other girls pregnant
Now you think I'm gon' change 'cause my wife cries all night
And I'm not the quite husband type, you're damn right
'Cause I've been living my whole damn life without my damn mic
And my damn light beer doin'
One day I might see you in a fi-fight with you 
I can take your life in two ways
A heart way and bad way, 
Cause if I have a bad day then you may not make it to the Youngbloodz concert
Ladies and gentlemen I'm sorry if I'm losing you

You blew up wit the hood rat

God damn I think that I'm high
Too much haze
But I see my ghost pass within the blink of a eye
And my ghetto niggas know how it feel
I smoke more than a building on fire
Roll more than the wheel
I get stuck like a car in the mud
And blow my greens out
And call my nigga t pain and ball us some buds
And choke till I think I'ma cry
Oh I think I'ma die

So I'ma take two hits and I'ma my mind away

Now its on me again
So I take another pull
We in the Cadillac, floating like the ocean
Suddenly everything was moving in slow motion

So I take another hit
And try to relax
I'm beating on my chest
CJ beating on my back
Somebody help me I think I'm about to die
But I got it
I got it

So I pass the blunt and it came right back to me
But I know this smoke is still running through me
I don't think I'ma ever open my eyes

Would it be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place

How many times have we sat at the table?
And both ate one time and said what's on our mind
I'm thinking of a relationship was a fable
A fairytale of me, that's just how it seems (oh girl, I heard)
Even when I heard that you were cheating, I was faithful
And would do any goddamn thing that you would say too 

I tried to talk and you walk away
Right out out of my face, right out of my place 
But

About this young rappa man

He had a pass in the same
Put a pass in it mane
Rappa, producer
A whole stack of thangs
And then one day he said to himself
You know a man has to change
So now he a rappa, a sanga, a danca, a romancer
Man cancer can't be way more to serious
I'm tryna drop this real but they ain't hearin this
They fearin' this
Used to all that shit they hear on the radio
I bet you I can stay here or somebody
And they gone play me though
So we came up, not givin' a fuck
What a nigga gotta say bout Pain
Got niggas lil' ladies
Droppin' they panties
Smackin' they fannies, sayin' his name
So I'm playin the game they want me to play
Sayin' everythang they want me to say
And I promised home boy
If I get back to this rappin'
It won't be today
Ain't got time for the rap shit, bap shit
Make a hand clap shit,
Nappy, nappy, nappy mo nap shit
That shit second
This shit first
That shit harder
This shit worse
And this shit curse me
And it hurts me to let it go
But I gotta come back to the sack
To let these otha niggas know
That its another side of Teddy
Another dub side on the machetti
A fucking prime spot on the Chevy
The situation gets heavy
So find it in yo heart
To let me put this gang bangin' shit away

[Daz Dillinger]
I'm on a two million dollar bail
Caught with the product that them young niggaz sell
I'm fresh outta cells, twelve hours later.. my clientele hit my pager
The situation gettin thick, Dat Nigga Daz is major!
I live the life of a gangster, I rob gangsters
Ten years up on the table, I deny that flavor
She a fighter to the fullest, if I lose I catch a bullet (bullet)
Can't tell a nigga nuttin when he starvin and losin
Now I'm back up on the street, completely correctly
You disrespect me, it's the same that's it's gon' be
Automatics get tragic when you let niggaz have it
Then I'm caught back up like before, I gotta stack my cabbage
Monday morning, 8:30 right back in court
Couple of homeboys, my momma give me full support
Raised up filthy but the Lord be with me
Like an addict, it's the verdict and the jury, ""NOT GUILTY!!!""

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
They used to have me on that paperwork
'cause I used make my paper.. work, lifestyle covered with dirt
See I was first on my block with .40 caliber glocks
Similarities to my uncut, they ready to rock (ready to rock)
'Cause everybody wanna ball, nobody wanna get caught
Only the pros and the cons get to stack these knots
Motherfuckers want that Benz with the millions by the karats
When they fencing all day, they start talkin like a parrot
Information they sharing so be cautious where ya walk
Never pillow talk behind closed doors in the dark
It might creep back and bite you, indict you, convict you
To a five by nine for a very long time
Fuck droppin dimes, niggaz is droppin whole hundreds
So the hood's gettin skinny and the one-times love it
If I don't go get it, then the next nigga will
So I kill at will with my gauge in them killin fields
Yeah!

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Yo X, tell my momma to put the house up, wait, the house cost too much
Tell her to get a hundred grand out the Porsche truck
It's just like a house 'cause I take a bath in it
Get ass in it and I gotta stash in it
Smoke hash in it, blueberry chocolate tah
Smokin chronic make me see shit, like 2Pac alive
Bandana knotted in the front like 2Pac alive
Walkin out the courthouse spittin on the camera guy
I bang (Thug Life), but this ain't Death Row
This some gangster shit for my niggaz down on death row
Exhibit A - watch how I let the tec go
And Exhibit be - burn the rubber on the West coast

Knowing they just want me 'cause I'm in the top spot

T-Pain,"I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' her eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man lookin' at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimpin' like I supposed to
Rollin like I supposed to
Shinin' like I supposed to
In the club, fuckin' wit' honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand it when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freakin' all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas tryin' to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm goin' holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin' through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt wit all y'all
Yeah, yeah homie u say she ya girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'm be like cousin
Believe me man, this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them player-ette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff yo bitch
'Cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt)

Hey homie, if you ain't gettin' no money
You better keep her away from me ya dig

Well if u love ya girl
And wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
'Cause I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide

Better treat your girl right
'Cause another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
'Cause u leave your wife
And I see ya wife
That be for real
How long u think that's finna be ya wife
Well I'm livin the life
You just gettin' it right
Your old lady look at me
'Cause you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like u
'Cause you you the better type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see me dance
I noticed she was checkin' me
And diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that right
You know smack that thang
Sit that right
Upon that dresser

Pullin' on her hair
Like we gettin' in a fight

But it'll settle just right
So if yo girl sexy

Tryin to catch a glance up her skirt

We playing in my glam in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

When I, when I, when I,when I pull up to club
All the shawties be like (Damn 28's)
Then I be like girl u know just who I am (Don't hate)
See I done fell in love wit a stripper y'all
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy Paine was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down
I be like como si llama, lil' mama mi llamo pain, what is yo name
I'm feelin' yo vibe
And I'm hopin' you feel the same
I'm a wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what u say

But I noticed she had make-up on her eye, then she started to cry
I said, ""Baby, please, explain.""
She said her man put his hands on her, he was outta control
And she really needs someone to hold and not let go
And then she looked into my eyes just like you do, then I imagined she was you

Baby, I wish that I was a magician and I could make all of this disappear
And, baby, I wish that I could go back in time; and trust me, baby, we wouldn't be here

And I never meant to hurt you, how can I prove it to you?

Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me

The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'mma slide (yup)
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay

I try to play cool
Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryin' to keep myself from goin' crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't)

Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin' them climb up in my throne

Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin' crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above

It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick with 'cha entree and get over your side

We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love 'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

I try to play cool

Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin' the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin', it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us

Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man looking at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to
Shining like I supposed to
In the club, fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand it when a nigga bring his girlfriend to club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wondering why all these players trying to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gonna holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt with all of you
Yeah, yeah homie you say she's your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'm gonna be like, ""cousin""
Believe me man, this is how them players do it in the chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff your bitch
'cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt)

(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)

Hey homie, if you ain't getting no money

Well if you love you girl
And wanna keep you girl
Don't be walking up and asking me to meet you girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide
I've seen you girl
Better treat your girl right
'cause another man will
Better eat you girl like another man will
'cause you leave your wife
And I see you wife
That be for real
How long you think that's finna be you wife
Well I'm living the life
You just getting it right
Your old lady look at me
'cause you ain't hitting it right
She probably used to like you
'cause you're the bitter type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass looking thick in the light
I noticed she was checking me
And digging the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that price
You know smack that thing
Sit that right
Up on that dresser
Yeah that's right
Pulling on her hair
Like we getting in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight
But it'll suit 'er just right
So if yo girl sexy
And she test me
Don't be upset g
'cause you might catch me
Trying to catch a glance up her skirt
The McLaren in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

(when I, when I, when I, when I) pull up to club
All the shawties be like (damn twenty-eight,eights)
Then I be like girl you know just who I am (don't hate, hate)
Say I done fell in love wit a stripper you all
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy paine was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down
I be like como se llamas little mama? mi llamo pain, what is your name?
I'm feeling your vibe
And I'm hoping you feel the same
I'm a wink my eye and let you know I got the game

Twenty five's on my range, I know that that's a odd number
The way you tootin' that thang can make the guys wonder
What's underneath or even if it's real
I'm hoping she a freak cause I ain't tryna chill
I'm tryna get it poppin, with a shortie like mine
That's willing to drop it low enough to blow my mind
It's H.U.E.Z. and Bow Weezy

If you wanna please me baby all you gotta do is
Pop, lock, and drop it

But baby don't stop it, we can do it like Chris Brown girl and get it poppin'

Boots with the fur (With the fur)

And the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy)

T-Pain,"I'm like eight foot four, blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore

No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents
But I'm still a thug

I'm so gangsta you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing, well I just baked Caramel Delights
T Swift and T Pain rappin' on the same track
It's a thug story tell me can you get with that

I had a dream last night I had high-top Nikes
I had diamonds in my mouth, and diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke I was singing ""I'm on a boat""

'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
Shorty I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty I'ma take ya

You can call me T Sweezy now I'm a rap star
Hey it's a thug story now tell them who you are

Singer turned gangsta
You don't wanna fight me
Straight to the top
In my extra small white tee

T Swift and T Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story tell now can you get with that

What! what! I knit sweaters yo!
What! what! don't test me

Hey hold on, hold on I didn't even say anything
What? I said ""yo""
Yo, you guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't even swear

Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off

Tryna hope for tomorrow
When I think that I cant

Now you can dance while you think about the revolution
And while you vex having delusions of persecution
I'm a stay flawless, an instrument of execution
Out of many still grows one people
Justice ? still remain unequal
And I'm a diamond in the dirt
And there is no sequel
Many try but they cannot replicate what we do
Hear evil, speak that evil
Speak good to the hood, there is no retrieval
Think about while you sippin' on your ?
If my words could talk they'd say

Come up swinging at you thugs Aflac
Then I fall in the sway back may back
See I'm back for the money like I left that
See I be running on the route where the cash go (where the cash go)
And any nigga interfering with the cash flow so he can get pumped on like Citgo
Make his body bounce bounce like a 64
Tall clips chrome lips see the big gold
I'm a duffle bag boy like I move coke big crack threw the music so the flow dope
I keep my money ova bitches til the door close
I need money like a bitch need dick mo
I'm tryin' to c it like a motherfucking castro rubber bands in my pants and a swift bankroll

I'll tell ya one thing don't play about mine

And where my money young niggas gotta have that
Rubber bands by the grands in a big bag
Pockets fat like I'm carrying a backpack
A couple grand for the Louie band nap sack
Understand I'm the man who you can't match
Money man minivan full of brown bags
Better grand any man never top that
Cause money and the gat pop those straps
Getting loot in the top drop right back
I ain't playing creep ya avenue and I'll blast
Bust shots like a new year day blast
And I ride all day like a buss pass
Grinding hard for the bread and the cash flow
Kick doors wave 4's where the cash go (where the cash go)
I'm trying to see it like a motherfucking castro
Rubber bands in my pants and a swift bankroll

See the beamers when ya pull up in the dope home (my money)
Seventeen and he got his own kilo
Running green nigga living like nino
Riding clean wax sitting for the c note
It ain't green get it back with the c loc
Momma dead broke daddy fucked up
I'ma make them come and hit me with the recoup
God dammnit I'm still in the dope spot

That you are about to receive some of that good tongue
Tryin' tell me not to do like you don't want none
Tryin' to sit up in the bed, tryin' to act all calm
Acting like it ain't good, tryin' to hold that cum
But you know that I'm the best, you know your Teddy Verset
It's the first ten minutes, you ain't felt shit yet
I got the whips, I got the chain, I got the handcuffs, too
But ain't none of that for me; I'm about to handcuffs you
That's the freaky shit; I keep on skeeting shit and leaving leaky shit
I take her ass back to the church, a preacher and deacon shit
I'm beating it; let's try computer love, I keep deleting it
I'm fucking under the dresser, the bedroom floor, and the sheets and shit

Take ya pants off
Not that fast; do it slower

My little man wanna hide them guts
I'm a take my time with them guts
And, baby girl, when I'm in them guts
You ain't gotta worry bout ya man 'cause
I bet he can't do it like me (nope, nope)
I bet he can't do it like me (nope, nope)

I wanna bone
Move you out the hood
I told you I would

Been around each other so long

Starting to think a like

Mixin' henny wit the sprite,
While I'm drinkin' and drivin',
No police lights,
No police sirens,
I'm headed to the club, lokin' for a freak,
To spread a lil' love, to spread a couple cheeks,
Pull up to the spot, 26's like beam,
Eyes on me like ""bitch, do you see em'?
Stroll to the front dor headed to the vip,
Bought a couple bottles and I tok a couple sips,
Strokib' out the room and what do I see?,
A nice round butt and a pair of double d's,
So, I crept up like shawty what's happenin'?,
You killin' that dress and I love it with a passion,
Then she turned around and her face was aight,
She had a gap toth and a mean overbite,
But I was like hm!

If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' fuckin' you,
Is that what you wanna do shawty?,
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' fuckin' you,

Woke up the next mornin' and all I can remember,
Was takin' shots and tippin' the bartender,
Surrender to the woman, end up bringing me home,
Cause' she started lokin' better, every shot of patron, (yep!)
I jumped up wit a devilish grin,
Cause' tonight, damn right! I might do it again!
So I called up the homies, (whaddup??) let's ride,
We can hit the sports bar, over on the southside,
Get a couple of coronas, couple of limes,
Went up to the bar, saw a couple of dimes,
So I, slowly walked up and said hi!
My name is Ludacris and I'ma hell of a guy,
One said I know who you are,
I'm your number one fan,
And right now, it's to bad, I got a man,
And I said I understand,
But where the hell is he at??
Cause' in a minute, if he dont show up, then man

(don't make me do it, don't make me do it!)
If I had one more drink

One more drink I'ma get cha,
Home, then I'll split cha,
Grab the camera phone,
And take a bunch drunk pictures,
Cause' hennessy mixed wit a whole bunch of buddha,
Equals you, mixed with a whole bunch of Luda,
And you know how far one drink could go,
Start slurrin' my speech, slowin' up da flow,
Hikin' up these skirts,
Climbin' up your shirt,
It's mr latenight Luda and I like to flirt,
So guess what babygirl

If I take one more drink,

The new Benz is all white call it John McCain.
How the hell could you stop me?
Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever,
That's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built
See the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me,
And I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me
But these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets
Till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters mad that I finally done made it

Put your foot in my Nike's
Picture you livin' in my life
Picture you stuck in a cell
Picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge
Picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed
Picture you wearing the scars
Thank you for making me struggle
Thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle
Tell me the world ain't mine
If you ain't seein' me lately
I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose
This is what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father
Tryna hope for tomorrow
When I think that I cant
I envision Obama
I envision the diamonds
I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect
All my niqqas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it
That I'm making this statement
Take a look and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

He chat, I chat though we never met
He said he wanna explore me like the Internet
It's like an orgasm every time he sent a text

He wanna download, he likes to download
Little Kim songs and put 'em on his ringtone
He even got my screen saver on his iPhone
I get more hits than a T inzone

We goin' back and forth, sendin' emails

He wanna come through and put me on his hard drive

Three o'clock in the morning we be online
Others send friend requests but they get denied
He type I miss you
I type back to let him know the feeling's mutual

It's just Myspace love but it's beautiful
He love to watch my videos on YouTube
Hey, it's like everytime I log on I get so turned on
Computer love playin' in the back

The only one that have me up all night long
Feel like a fantasy, the chemistry is so strong

Hit it just like, that!

You could be my cuddy cuddy buddy fo' sho'
(You can ride with me)
Girl, don't act like you don't already know
(Don't act like you don't see)
We can get it on the bed or the floor
(Don't matter to me)
Girl, I wanna take you to H-Town

Girl, I wanna take you to H-Town

How you do your lips like that?
Move your hips like that? Work your ass like that?
Why you make noise like that?
Move slow like that? Fuck fast like that?

Baby, I ain't gon' lie to you
We so sexually compatible
How I thrill myself, I could kill myself
When I feel myself inside of you

You could be my cuddy buddy
Nibble on my nutty buddy
While we do some freaky thangs with the lights on
Touchin' on you while we listenin' to T-Pain
Huggin' on you while I'm listenin' to Mike Jones

Do it soon as we got in the sac
Or I could hit it in the back of the lac
Off a fifth of da yac
Like, like, like, like, that!

It's the middle of the night, y'all got into a fight
Now you mad with your feelings hurt
Girl, let me buy you a drink, please tell me what you think
Right before I get up in them skirt

Skeet, skeet
I pull up in the lac truck
Beep, beep
I'll be shorty backup
Beep me
If your man act up
He full-time girl, I'll be the backup

'Cause I'm yo cuddy buddy
See-see-cuddy buddy
Soon as he fall asleep
She on her way to love me

'Cause I'm yo cuddy buddy
See-see-cuddy buddy
Soon as he fall asleep
She on her way to love me

'Cause she know that I got that wood
'Cause she know that my sex is good
We can do it on the bed or the floor
'Cause you know that I keep it hood

'Cause she know that I got that wood
'Cause she know that my sex is good
We can do it on the bed or the floor, let me know

Girl, You could be my cuddy cuddy buddy fo' sho'

At the keg parties with the white boys
At the beach with the surfers in Beverly Hills
At an ex party with Vicks and light toys
I guess you can call me a chameleon
I adapt to any situation I'm in
And my momma ain't raise no fools
I'm just comfortable in the skin that I am in

Now we all make mistakes
Yeah I'm a walking contradiction
And plus I neva listen

I got a place that only I can go 
Let me take you to flight school 
(We'll learn to fly) 
Let me take you to flight school

You've never been so high, kiss the ground goodbye 
And you say, damn baby how did you get that fly? 
Flight school 

I got the airplane passes, the aviator glasses
She be lookin fly like aviator classes
So classy, Jacqueline Onassis
Used to sneak and move like Ali, Cassius
Massive, like Kennedy's assassin
We was killin time like clocks in the casket
Perhaps its time to prevail
I'll show you Gotham City like I'm Christian Bale
I can be Barack and let you be Michelle
Miguel. Gizelle. Dress fresh as hell.
Louis. Gucci. Ye in that pastel
Adore Dior, ride down Lake Shore
She felt the vibe, I had to make sure
She felt deprived livin like she died
Slide with a G, now she felt revived
In town for the night, she's somebody wifey
The LE, she never seen these
So the moment I might seize
I done come up out the coma of livin life's dreams
When you wake up in the morning you join the flight team.

These the last hours, but superman late

Man, will he come back and save the day? 
Fly across the earth, put things in reverse 
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse 
Certain things I can't doctor, and you say I'm the worst 
I ain't have enough patients, but I needed a nurse 
Got to come by my head let, see if my head ache 
Then get my head straight 
Then give my head great 
Every time I popped up like the VCR 
I took your breath away 
Then we performed CPR 
With all the cars, the clothes, the lights, the boats 
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats 
In the penthouse position, 
With penthouse bitches, 
See I pimped my crib, so I must exhibit 
Shit, these last years been a haze like Issac 
So I close my eyes 
Tighter than Asian eyes 
Get realized 
I got the same wings angels fly 
With Louie Vuitton feathers, now that some fly shit

No need for me to write it, I just gotta picture her smiling,
And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like yeah

Turn up the lights, give me a mic
I'm bout to sing it to her just how she likes
Jump off the stage bombs away,
Crowd surfin' all the way cowabunga
You know it's right, just do the wave
Girl just move your body like a snake
And if you wanna get with me
Put your hands in the air, show me that energy

It's gotta be the crunkest
It's gotta be the loudest
It's gotta be the best, the best love song she's ever heard in her life
I gotta tell her how I feel

Okay, it's blood sweat and tears, it'd be the realest shit I ever wrote
Never stop or giving up, the realest shit I ever quote

24, 24 hours grinding overdose
Money running low, the studio rebirth an animal
People want that gutter back, that's just who I do it for
Giving them that manure flow
Having them know I'm trained to go
Heard them niggas dropping meat so fuck them, here's a dick to blow
Now I'm on the top of shit
Now they're showing sportsmanship
What it do and what it be, niggas on some other shit

Y mis sentidos se ponen sensitivos

Se maquilla, se pinta se monta en el carro y se enciende
Mami caliente
Borracha los dos haciendo cositas diferentes
Yo te veo y tengo un deseo, móntate en la nave pa darte un paseo
Con su meneo, meneo, meneo, meneo
Ella me calma y yo me olvido del tiroteo
Tiene trucos, hoy anda en el mercedes buscando quien la descongele
Ella llega a la mansión tres niveles
Y en la cama (shhhh) caliente (shhhh)
Se pone agresiva y no hay quien la pare ella enseguida quiere hacer maldades
Que la acorrale
Que la tire

Listen up if you a true hustler man for real 
You gonna bounce back if you got get back skills
Fuck all that weeping and whining and crying piss on a bitch
I'ma make it do what it do get out and get my grits
I'm on that graveyard shift my water feel pass me
Hustlin' tryin' to stay focused got a twenty four hour notice on my door
Business is slow, I speak the truth will pressure out the roof
A long way from being recession proof
I'm going through
I ain't trying to be a deadbeat dad 
I want my kids to have a better life than I had
My cellular off, need some more minutes over my limit
Had the money but bought ounce of weed thought I could flip it
Man I'm niggorant 'cause that's what some of us black folks do
Instead of payin' a bill we gonna buy the new Jordan shoe
Milk and diapers and baby wipes cost an arm and a leg
A breast of wing and a thigh
Hustle trying to get by

Hey don't underestimate me,
A couple of days is all is gonna take me
'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that
I drop it off and it come right back

Don't underestimate me,
A couple of days is all is gonna take me
'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that
I drop it off and it come right back

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired of being broke
I'm sick of this sequel
Man I swear I hate reportin' to them people bra' I'm down on my luck
Ain't got a buck to my name, dirty testing pissing in a cup, what the fuck
They found weed in my system, I told my girl I was quitting
They sent me back to San Quentin for ninety days
Did my time and got out, 
Now I'm in the unemployment line trying to figure shit out
But the penal system got me by the necks haha
With my troubled past I can't even get me a job
My partner rap he got his own record label they doing their thang
If I holler at him maybe he can shoot me some change
Plus I'm a loyal nigger man, I learn quick bro I ain't stupid
All you gotta do is show me one time and I can do it
My fellow put a hustle under his wang, show me the game
Now I'm doing my thang

Hey don't underestimate me,
A couple of days is all is gonna take me
'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that

I'm trying to stay out of trouble and triple double quadruple 
This little change that I got
By throwing a few concerts
But I'm not too sure if I'm ready to spend this mill' 
The reason why is rap shows don't always go that well
Uh, and the chances are that I probably won't recoup
So I'ma take this loot and book some old school R'n'B soul groups
That way the value insurance won't be that high
And plus I'm minimizing the chances of somebody dying, that's right
I got a homie that work at the toll bridge
He make good money, plus he get benefits
He been hollering at me never the lesson
Trying to get a nigger a job there which is a blessing
But I don't think the homie really understand
I am an entrepreneur man I ain't working for no white man
Attitude of a hood boy, all my life I've been running from the Elorys I'm serious

Hey don't underestimate me,

I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend
Man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still with fuck them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn
And don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

How to hate a bitch
That owe you everything
At least a wedding ring
Moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking 'bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you
I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

And I don't love them hoes
Don't fuck up with Wayne 'cause when it ""Wayne's"" it pours
No really, I'm on my ""fuck that bitch"" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon-toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock well
And I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for fuck you

No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here, girl I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round me
All you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya,

I threw up numbers like an auction
‘Cause I do it, do it, do it
Like it’s no other option
Fat asses, big bottles
When I’m around they both get poppin’
I talk about girls and money
Too much I admit, way too much girls
Too much money, those 2 things that don’t exist
And I think It's so impressive I’m riding in the back
Young and black ’cause I’m chauffeured and not ’cause I’m arrested
Getting richer every year, you can grasp up my progression

Ain’t gotta go back to my hood ’cause they 'round
And the niggas that’s next to me it’s all the niggas that stress with me
I done made it from the bottom and they say I did it on my own
So to me that’s destiny
If anybody got a problem I just tell ‘em to get on their grind
Try to to see as much checks as me
And my wife is a goddess my tree is the finest
A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us
They showin’ us love, but I remember back then the niggas would doubt us
We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us
They screaming my name, I’m repping my city it’s me who they proud of

Been talked about and mistreated

Got my mama straight and my daughter good

Been broke before and now its open doors
I got the dopest flow and they seen it

Ella tiene el flow la diva de club
Su cuerpo me mata y sin miedo me ataca
Por la noche se mete en mi casa y la fiera de adentro la saca
Se mueve se mueve me lleva por la parte oscura me atrapa

Me toca me besa el cuello
La jefa de la tribu ella me saca
Tiene algo que me descontrola me en boba cuando se acomoda
Llegando pa brinca coke con soda
Es fanática fanática de la moda

Pégate llévame al cielo
Rompe el suelo
Falda corta suelte el pelo
Ella sabe a mantecado, vainilla fusión de caramelos

Sintiéndonos, besándonos
Seguimos acercándonos tú y yo uoh

Señora la reina de la noche
Se mueve me enloquece
Con un flow cacaca caro
Como yo no reparo le dije claro negra vamos al grano
Me preparo, se me pega el descaro rápido como disparo (boom)
Ella me amaga, yo le amago
Ella es la nena buena yo soy el malo

Con ella yo convino, tomando vino
Pido a lo que ha tenido
Su cuerpo asesino multi platino
Fiera cruzate en mi camino
Quieres pasión prendemos el rhino
Tu eres la mami de mi destino
Cuando se mueve maquino maquino maquino

'Cause the relationship has been so good lately
If I don’t do what I do
Then who’s gon' put food on the table?
It is what it is, I’m just handling biz
But I do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live

Mama don’t work, heater don’t work
Police pulled me over and said
He seen weed on my shirt
I pray to the lord and ask for forgiveness
If he popped my trunk I can get a life sentence
He came a little closer and told me that he smellin’ it
I said “I rolled one up
I won’t insult your intelligence
But I threw it out the window half a mile ago”
He asked me when the last time I smoke
I said a while ago
Forgive me officer
I’m stressin’ and my pockets sore
Hurtin’
Chillin’ with my dog like a f***in’ Labrador
He said he ain’t with the bull, matador
Looked at the top of my car
Like what this ladder for?
I told him I was puttin’ goals up in the mornin’
And I’m goin’ to my uncle’s house
To see if he can join me
The officer got a call so he was needed
And he told me slow it down
And I told him please believe it
Then I proceeded to go to my uncle’s house
Well it really wasn’t my uncle
It was a junkie’s house
He got a bada** niece with a donkey now
Pullin’ out the parking lot
Headed to the other spot
Out all night, addict with the addicts
'Causin’ Havoc, I’m a Prodigy
N****s know we Mobbin’ Deep
Gotta stay up when everyone fall asleep
The good die young, and promises are hard to keep
I left my old job, and now them n****s hardly speak
I got a new job, and plus I’m making more a week
The girl that I’m with is like a young Kimora Lee
I got them folks fiendin’, pumpin’ that Jodeci
Sippin’ and my soda pink, you n****s is toilet seat
Check my resume, it used to say I sold quarter keys
Conduct disorderly, stayin’ in the trap house
Trips went to work, I’m so glad that it mapped out

Honey, we got off on the wrong foot, baby
'Cause the relationship has been so good lately
If I don’t do what I do
Then who’s gon' put food on the table?

I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live

So good, lately
Ooh Ooh, so we can live

So so so so so we can live
So so so so so we can live
So so so so so we can live
So so so so so we can live

Simon says, monkey see monkey do
I wore the shirt, you wore the same shirt too
See me with my b****
You buy your b**** the same purse
Shoot you and your n****
Y’all can share the same hearse
This that murder 1, mixed with the bubblegum
Kept working my dun dun duns
Come get your mama some
N****, this that slum talk, some say we talks slums
I rarely finish the end of my words
Watch the rims hit on the curve
And what a n**** really care about a lisp?
People arguin’ over me while I’m layin’ in a b****
Death to a snitch, get it while you can and, oh s***
Its 3:30 in the A.M.
We’re just gettin’ started like when I had the van
Bought the tour bus and put some n****s in the pass
Your style good enough to put in a glass bag
And you know I’m getting’ mine
You should use a hashtag
Flow off the hinges tryna f*** all her friendses
Just killed her p****
You gon’ have to use forensics
Organized crime, you can put me in a lineup
Plus I got dreads
I’ll pay a hundred for the line up

So so so so so we can live
So so so so so we can live
So so so so so we can live
So so so so so we can live

Appetite for destruction, and I don’t need a menu
So far ahead of y’all n****s
I can see you in my rear view
See you in my rear view
One of your headlights out n****
I just got my first R&B b****
And got head all night with her
She said she tired of the generic
I say what up, she say what up

T-Pain,"Damn, I fucked my aunt
I can't believe I fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt y'all

I was thirteen, skinny little freckle-faced kid
Growin' up in the country felt like doin' a bid
But the summers were my favorite when we swam in the lake
And trips to the city, what a magical place
First baseball game, man, I'll never forget
Crackerjacks, bleacher seats and the crack of the bat
My friend Tim caught a ball, but he gave it to me
And five years later, I fucked my aunt

Damn, I fucked my aunt
I can't believe that I fucked my aunt
Man, I really fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt, y'all

Rainstorms always give me the blues
Worst one in ten years on the evening news
She rode her bike over cause the streets was closed
My aunt standing there in soaking wet clothes
We opened some wine and laughed like kids
She told me funny things that her and my mom did
But then my uncle called and she had to go
And twelve years later, I fucked her sister

Damn I fucked my aunt
Can you believe that I fucked my aunt?
Man, I guess I fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt y'all

It was my eighteenth birthday, the world was still new
My parents threw me a party as parents will do
My uncle's wife gave me a punny gift
It was an ant farm, man she was a trip
Later that night I was up in my room
I watched as the small ant community bloomed
So simple, yet so complex, I contemplated my own life
And wondered what would come next
I took out my favorite ant and crushed it with my dick
And also, I fucked my aunt

Damn, I fucked my ant
And I fucked my aunt

Man, we fucked our aunts
We fucked our aunts y'all

Oh, I can't believe it
They fucked their aunts
I mean, I fucked my aunt too
But you don't see me making songs about it
Although we technically didn't have sex
Just some above the clothes stuff
And some under the clothes stuff
I mean what is sex really?
Is it just penetration?
Or do you have to finish?
'Cause I finished

Damn, I fucked my aunt y'all",I F****d My Aunt,2013

Lookin' down yo' blouse lady, and everybody is in tune

They got a beautiful woman and givin' poon

Oh you did your hair? Little Dicky pay attention
Oh you getting scared, what’s the root of all this tension?
You know I’d be a hell of a date and if you torn I will split the entrees that you crave
And when you bored I can send you Snapchats for days
And make them personally for you like they all will be based
Around the inside jokes we develop in time
And if you tired won’t initiate the sex it’s fine
I can talk you on the phone when you driving alone
And make you feel comfortable enough to take me to mom
And that bitch gon love it, she gon' tell your ass
'He legit yo hubby', she gone tell your ass need to quit your clubbin'
And go get that young'un while I’m sitting with your dad being slick straight grubbin'

She like her Jesus mountain high
So he can watch her lonely child

I know my God seen his breaks and his edges
A jacket for giving that painted his city in gold

Two brothers goin sack for sack
in the back of the 'llac, takin a whiffle
Strippin the fuck up out of some willow
Poppin ecstasy like Skittles
It'll get you in the long run, sniffin them long ones
Way girl burst ya dick and now it got ya on one
Came up shorted, circumstances nigga quote it
What goes around comes around tryin to steal this (?) Brady hostess
Keep your focus, and never the love of the hocus pocus
Set up hoes lovin to get jackers to come and smoke us
Die-hard soldier, T-Pup-alicious, cops get vicious
No mercy on haters or no bitches
Got in my clitches waitin for a nigga to take some chances
so we can deal with these hardco' Sic-Wid-It-ass circumstances

niggaz on the turf wanna put my ass up in the dirt, cause I skirt
a Lex-o and slurp a genie bottle full of X-O

You can't love it, don't leave the ghetto
Me and I'm heated like two jugs of methyl


Damn, cydal shit when vital shit starts to happen
Eager to be the nigga just for cappin
Strappin up ain't no thang, it's survival
It's makin sure you all good when it comes to enemies and rivals
It's +Higher Learning+, but it's True Lies
when it comes to the Superfly
Speedy Gonzalez destroyes from the Eastside
Is it ridicule or stardom?  Did we hurt yo' feelings, pardon

Is this just a spell we're under
All we seeing is the rain and thunder
Can we kick it in to an endless summer
(come on) free flowin' communication
Break the hypnosis grippin' the nation

Maybe now it's up to us to put down
The recipe we got to turn this 'round
Time to turn the focus on to you and me

You got to believe in you and me
Don't you know the truth will set you free
You've got to believe in you and me
Don't you turn your back on destiny
Ahh yeah... truth gonna you free

There are times when it all seems hopeless
I look at the dice how did I roll this
Is there a way we can all find solace
Can't we change the channel and adjust the focus

I gotta message and I gotta send this

Where we gonna be when we turn twenty-five
I keep thinking times will never change
Keep on thinking things will always be the same
But when we leave this year we won't be coming back
No more hanging out 'cause we're on a different track
And if you got something that you need to say
You better say it right now 'cause you don't have another day
'cause we're moving on and we can't slow down
And these memories are playing like a film without sound
And I get so excited and we'd get so scared
Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair
And this is how it feels

As we go on, we remember
All the times we had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be friends forever

So if we get the big jobs and we make the big money
When we look back now, will our jokes still be funny
We will still remember everything we learned in school
Still be trying break every single rule
Will little brainy bobby be the stockbroker man
Can heather find a job that won't interfere with her tan
I keep, keep thinking that it's not goodbye
I keep on thinking it's our time to fly

As we go on, we remember
All the times we had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be friends forever

Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now?
Will we survive it out there?
Will we make it somehow?
I guess I thought that this would never end
And suddenly it's like we're women and men
Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round
Will these memories fade when I leave this town
I keep, keep think that it's not goodbye
I keep on thinking it's our time to fly

As we go on, we remember
All the times we had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be friends forever

As we go on, we remember
All the times we had together

This is all about you and me
This is how it has to be
The dreams that we have dreamed
The places that we want to see
This is all about keeping on
The light before the dawn
The love that flows through every song
And positivity

Some people say that anything can happen
That you can make it right as long as you believe
But if the rain comes and the clouds get dampened
Just keep on keeping on and know that you will see

There were times we wondered
Were we gonna go under?
Rainbows or thunder, we didn't know
Through the tears and the laughter
Whether happy or sadder
The before and the after made us all so close
The journey isn't done
Just look how far we've come

[Boy]
This is all about keeping on
The light before the dawn
Let me tell you one to one
The journey's isn't done

Some people think that they don't need direction
Some people think that they are better on their own
I know that we have made the right connection
And I can see it in the way that we have shone

There are times we doubted
When we screamed and we shouted
Our vision was clouded it was hard to deal
The terrible weather somehow just made us better
We did it together and we kept it real
The journey isn't done
But look how far we've come

This is all about you and me
This is how it has to be
Let me tell you one to one
The journey's isn't done

You know you can't forget
Gotta take that baby step
The best part hasn't happened yet
Still you got to understand
We can't get stuck in (the) sand
Together we can make a plan
Together we gotta do the best we can

Some people think that life is never easy
That you can't tough it out or make it in the end
But when the sky is gray and wind gets breezy
You gotta hold on tight and kn ow you've got a friend

There were times we wondered
Were we gonna go under?
Rainbows or thunder, we didn't know
Through the tears and the laughter
Whether happy or sadder
The before and the after made us all so close

T-Squad,"You know parents are the same, no matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids are going to make some mistakes
So to you, all the kids all across the land, there's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand

I remember one year, my mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first, I just turned up my nose
She said, ""What's wrong? This shirt cost twenty dollars""
I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar""

The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips
I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep""
She said, ""You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet""
I said, ""Mom, let's put these clothes back, please""
She said, ""No, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show""

I said, ""This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowze
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks""
She wasn't really, everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, no, no way, uh-uh, forget it

There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering as I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went, she said
""If they were laughing you don't need 'em 'cause they're not good friends""

For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about two-hundred more times
So to you all the kids all across the land, there's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand

Okay, here's the situation
My parents went away on a week's vacation
And they left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind? Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't, yeah, of course I should

Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
And that's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, ""Was that for me?"", I said, ""Yeah""
She said, ""Why?"", I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy""

She said, ""How do I know you're not sick
You could be some deranged lunatic""
I said, ""c'mon toots, my name is the Prince
Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?""
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes

She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on""
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sun roof was open, the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car

We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short, short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, ""I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer""
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded

My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
And I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?""
They didn't speak, I said, ""I want to plead my case""
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns, one would beat me while the other one was driving

I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you all the kids all across the land, take it form me

So come on and start, just rock this party
I wanna see you get out on the floor with your dance move

It’s a party whenever the band comes through your town
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with doin’ your thing
So come on y’all just dance

with hot rounds, plus some troops that he's got now, he asked for a meeting but i'm not down

a burnin' pain in the small of my back

a shot to my shoulder, another to my waist
i turn to see my queen with a smile on her face

strap at hand, i don't understand, how could you 
decieve me for another man?

i wake up to darkness, my one room apartment
no lights, just candle wax burnt to the carpet

it was just a dream, right? oh, what a sight
there lies my queen, asleep in the night

T. Duggins,"In the city of Chicago, as the evening shadows fall
There are people dreaming of the hills of Donegal

Eighteen forty-seven was the year it all began
Deadly pains of hunger drove a million from the land
They journeyed not for glory, their motive wasn't greed
A voyage of survival across the stormy sea

To the city of Chicago, as the evening shadows fall
There are people dreaming of the hills of Donegal

Some of them knew fortune and some of them knew fame
More of them knew hardship, died upon the plane
They spread throughout the nation, they rode the railroad cars
Brought their songs and music to ease their lonely hearts

To the city of Chicago, as the evening shadows fall
There are people dreaming of the hills of Donegal

T. Duggins,"Oh, I'm sailin' away my own true love
I'm sailin' away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I'll be landing?

No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Or either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

If I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'

That I might be gone a long time
And it's only that I'm askin'
Well, is there something I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passin'

How can, how can you ask me again
When it only brings me sorrow
The same thing I will want today
I will want again tomorrow

Well, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'

Well, if you, my love, must think that way
I'm sure your mind is roamin'
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you're goin'

So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there's something you can send back to me

T. Duggins,"The last time I saw you was down at the Greeks
There was whiskey on Sunday and tears on your cheeks
You sang me a song as pure as the breeze
On a road leading up Glenaveigh

I sat for a while at the cross at Finnoe
Where young lovers would meet when the flowers were in bloom
Heard the men coming from as far as Shinrone
Their hearts in Tipperary wherever they go

Take my hand and dry your tears, babe
Take my hand, forget your fears, babe
There's no pain, there's no more sorrow
They've all gone, gone in the years, babe

I sat for a while by the gap in the wall
Found a rusty tin can and an old Hurley ball
Heard the cards being dealt and the rosary called
And a fiddle playing 'Sean Dun Na Ngall'

And the next time I see you we'll be down at the Greeks
There'll be whiskey on Sunday and tears on our cheeks
For it's stupid to laugh and it's useless to bawl
About a rusty tin can and an old Hurley ball

Take my hand and dry your tears, babe
Take my hand, forget your fears, babe
There's no pain, there's no more sorrow
They've all gone, gone in the years, babe

As small birds sang when leaves were falling
Where we once watched the row boats landing
On the broad majestic Shannon

On the wild and wasteful ocean.
Its there that we hunt and we earn our bread
As we hunted for the shoals of herring

Out of Yarmouth harbor I was faring
As a cabin boy on a sailing lugger
For to go and hunt the shoals of herring

O the work was hard and the hours long
And the treatment, sure it took some bearing
There was little kindness and the kicks were many
As we hunted for the shoals of herring

O we fished the Swarth and the Broken Bank
I was cook and I'd a quarter sharing
And I used to sleep standing on my feet
And I'd dream about the shoals of herring

O we left the home grounds in the month of June
And to Canny Shiels we soon were bearing
With a hundred cran of silver darlings
That we'd taken from the shoals of herring

Now you're up on deck, you're a fisherman
You can swear and show a manly bearing
Take your turn on watch with the other fellows
While you're searching for the shoals of herring

In the stormy seas and the living gales
Just to earn your daily bread you're daring
From the Dover Straits to the Faroe Islands
As you're following the shoals of herring

O I earned my keep and I paid my way
And I earned the gear that I was wearing
Sailed a million miles, caught ten million fishes

T. Graham Brown,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man"" 
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland",Winter Wonderland,2008

Oh for the wonderful love he has promised promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned he has mercy and pardon pardon for you and for me

Born a true blue thoroughbred
Head a chiselled face of fables
Omen of no ill

Blooms that twine around your ears
Blossoms of the royalest texture angel of the years

Clad in sacks and scraps of linen
Living 'neath your waterwell
Praying that my youthy pauper's face
Will quench you well

Gazelle girl striding through your palace
Precious jewels nestle in your hair
Rameses born with platinum future
Take my heart and care.

From the break of dawn to the end of day
Always happy and kind in their minds.

But in the morning with the sun he pulled an automatic gun

Jasper was born with a moth in his mind

He startled the face of a friend of my girl's
He cut out her eyes and he wore them with furs
I get half the dues, wear my shoes
Tonight you might laugh while crying the news
'cause Jasper C. Debussy, that's his kind of blues

He wears scarlet pantaloons and five foot one inch hose
His face is like a rock and his eyes like the night

Hung on a star, his cigar is suspended from his lips
His coat is a moat and his bread is the lead that keeps him there

Bizarre is killed in a drawer in the deep sheets of his bed
His head is the hat reaches up from the mat made of yeti
His drinks are all laced with the liquid dye traces of his love

Lunacy hid in the skin of a gasoline rainbow
Is where he was claimed as a trainee explainer of madness
He melted a picture of sane peoples bubbles
When that sunny-eyed lightning, explaining their troubles
The business world's puddles reflecting their true Venusian doubles

Looking for a chick to fight
Had a seed and made a veil [?]
Blew some smoke and leave a trail
And fly high

I'm takin' in the night life
Crazy Sally in the alley, playing with a filck-knife
Met a chick, got a flat
Got a cat with one leg
I bought a Jeep, nice and cheap

Reflections looked most better than all
Cared too much, hating hatred
Seeing things deformed and almost cold
Crying sadly, shielding gladly my eyes

Thin men peeping, sleeping, looking, falling
Dizzy from their windows high

The men of magic thinking if evil
He was bringing sunless children
Seeing all the bad,
'cause beauty was too ugly
And faceless people
Wondered at the beautiful forms they had

Now the mirror's broken
I'm smiling, seeing good things
Yet despite foot splinters swirl in the air
Forever call him beauty
Children come at night time
Weird things blackening the fairest maiden's hair

When I first knifed her heart
Now she's dead, but whose this head
Speaking of things apart

For the skull hewn in Scarlatti fashion.

High in your fields above earth
Come and be real for us
You with your mind
Oh yes you are
Beautifully fine

T. Texas Tyler,"During the North African campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had
Been on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The
Next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant
Commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer
The text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took
Them out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread
Them out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, ""Soldier, put away those
Cards."" After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and
Brought before the Provost Marshall

The Marshall said, ""Sergeant, why have you brought this man
Here?"" ""For playing cards in church, Sir."" ""And what have you to say for
Yourself, son?"" ""Much, Sir,"" replied the soldier. The Marshall said, ""I
Hope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever
Punished."" The soldier said, ""Sir, I have been on the march for about six
Days. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy
You, Sir, with the purity of my intentions."" And with that, the boy
Started his story:

""You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there
Is but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into
Two parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think
Of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I
Think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew

Mark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five
Wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were
Wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the
Six, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and
Earth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God
Rested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the
Eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was
Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I
Think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn't
Even thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God
Handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it
Reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I
See the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of
Heaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number
Of spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the
Number of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of
Months in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter
So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a
Prayer Book.""

Ground, I'm a codeine dranker that's all I sip

I must tell the truth, I cannot lie
I was headed for the kill, steal, destroy, and die
Top to the bottom to bottom to top
Success is where I'm headed there ain't no doubt

But the truth is what we need to reach our point

A funky little story about you and me (Oh, I want to melt with u)
Getting busy for awhile
From the tip of my typhoon (Oh, I want to melt with u)
To the bottom of your ankle chains
We gonna shake and shake and shake
Until we're both deranged
With endorphins
This is the ultimate rave

In other words, get close enough to stick
And I'll melt with you

And we'll groove and groove until the earth moves
I want to melt with you, yeah

Don't look now, but there's a river of blood

I'm thinkin' about the quivery ocean (oh, I want to melt with u)
And drippin' all over your every motion
And thinkin' about the way that you kiss (I want to melt with u)
I'm thinkin' about some of this
And I'm thinkin' about some of that
And then my backbone slips (I want to melt with u)
And my lips just drip

T.C. Ellis,"You say that you love me like river
A river you say'll never run dry
I'd rather hear you say forever
Instead of a smile I'd rather see you cry
Don't use the magical
Mysterious, intoxicating, joy fantastic
Fascinating word called love
Unless you love me to the nine's
This is the only kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes over your
Body, mind, and soul

I want to be loved to the nine's (to the nine's)
I want to be loved, sugar (to the nine's)
I want to be loved for all time (for all time)

Baby, take a real good look at my face
Cause honey, it just might be the last time
Maybe you should have played an ace
Instead you played the queen
You'd be better off cheatin' than tryin'

Yo, check this out
Would you hug me on a crowded street?
Could you keep your cool if I washed your feet?
You soul a bath
What if I gave it, your body I ask
How long would you save it?
Could you lie down on a bed of thorns
While I drink your ocean dry?
And if we said we loved each other
Instead of smilin', would you cry?
Could you kiss three times with your dress upside
Downstroked and laughin'
Would you stay awake for fourteen hours
Listenin' to the grass grow?
I ask thee would you, could you,
Would you love me to the nine's (I'll love you to the nine's)
Would you, could you,
Will you love me for all time? (I'll love you for all time)
Would you, could you,
Will you love me to the nine's (I'll love you to the nine's)
