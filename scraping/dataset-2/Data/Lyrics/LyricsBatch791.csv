Nomeansno,"========
They say the eyes are the windows of the soul
But I love all the little dark holes
In your BODY BAG.
Your little willie, he's oh, so pretty,
And those titties, and those titties
In the BODY BAG.
Nobody knows you and nobody wants to.
Willie's poised to dive into flesh,
Something tells me he will leave a mess
In the BODY BAG.
When we kiss my eyes are closed,
My lips are full, I breathe through my nose
In the BODY BAG.
Nobody knows you and nobody wants to.
See the children play in the mud,
Moulding balls of faces and blood
From the BODY BAG.
All praise for corporal flesh;
The smell of love, the smell of death
From the BODY BAG.
Is it a womb or is it a tomb?
A sac of water that's quiet and warm,
A complex shape's beginning to form,
On marble slabs you're flat on your back,
All colours fall into the basic black
Of the BODY BAG.
The creatures of earth are countless and strange,
Open your lips and tell me the name
Of your BODY BAG.
All praise for corporal flesh.
",Body Bag,1991
Nomeansno,"You've spread your wings and learned to fly
You've tried and tried and now you've succeeded
Weil, that's too bad, that's too bad, that's too bad
I'm alive, that's too bad, that's too bad
Open your eyes, revenge, open your eyes
Revenge, open wide

you've fooled them once, you've fooled them twice
They think you're nice but no, you're just clever
That's too bad, that's too bad, that's too bad
My friend, that's too bad, that's too bad
This is the end, revenge, you die, you die
Revenge,

you want to know why? you want to know why?
You die? you die? you want to know why?
You want to know why? you die! you die!
That's too bad, that's too bad, that's too bad, I'm alive
That's too bad, that's too bad, I will survive
And the band played some good'ole
Rock'n'roll

what I want most in the whole wide world
Is a girl just a girl one who will keep me
From losing my mind one who will keep me
From losing my mind and she'll be the best
Girl in the whole wide world she'll be the
Best girl in the whole wide world
Revenge you die! you die! you die!

I'm sleeping late. I'm cutting classes

Long enough to know

Restless and curious
Down in my gut I know
That I will never ever
Want what I am told

Got the same rap at school
Heard it so much that now
Guess I believe it too

So guess what kinda crowd
I hang around with now
Being bad is better
Than being nothing at all

",Bad,1991
Nomeansno,"I want to come home now  
I've been away too long  
I want to come back  
I'm too sick at heart and scared to go  
I can't pretend any more  
To you i can't pretend  
I need a friend  
I can't be alone any more  

I need you   I need you  

Now cut off, apart, isolated  
In my pride, in my hatred  
My face is sad and afraid  
Black in the sun and white in the shade  
The night reflects it  
In every window i pass  
In evrey pane of glass  
I can't last, like this, i can't last  

I need you   I need you now 

All those i pushed away  
They walk with me, live in me now  
And the silence of what i never said  
Screams in my ears and pounds in my head  
But when i look at you  
I know i could never lie  
You see all of me when i look into your eyes  

I need you   I need you now I 

Woke up dreaming that i was dead  
Beside you on the bed  
I smoothed my hand across your hip  
And lingered with my fingertips  
From beyond, from far away  
Blessing where the shadows lay  
I whispered what i could not say  
How you took my breath away  

There is no world and i am a shadow  
You are no woman and i am noman  
There are only eyes and arms and hands  
The eyes that cut me out  
The arms that hold me round T 
he hands that reach out to pick me up  
And lift me from the ground  
Go ahead, raise me from mud  
Then in the light burn me down  
And whether i live forever, heaven sent  
Or am doomed to die, earth bound, it doesn't matter  
You may let the years drip from my face  
As the world turns round and round  
But as long as i can breath  
Can lift my voice and make a sound  
In everything i am, in everything i do  
A am your servant, i need you  

I need you    I need you now

Nomeansno,"When I speak the words I repeat
Are lost within this roaring
And when I call your eyes turn to me
But what are they exploring ?

Hidden shapes that pass fast away
Upon the waters streaming
And what I see I just cannot say
There is no one to heed me

I could say that I am sorry
But what forgiveness lies before me ?
In the river
Those who know me know all too well

All my sins and failings
But brother dear, how could I tell ?
The course that I was sailing
In the flood, before my eyes

I see the face that I despise
In the river
It's mine, it's mine
Drifting far away

I can see you'rte not very strong
As the current sweeps you past me
Ans I can see your head going down
As helpless your cries find me

""Help me ! Save me ! Lend me a hand !
Pull me out ! Pull me out !
Save me ! Save me ! Give me your hand !
Pull me out ! Pull me out !""

I would save you, give my life
But it's already sacrificed
To the river
It's gone, it's gone

Drifitng far away
Mothers tell your children the truth
Don't hide the fate that's waiting
When you're born you start to drown

Then the winds rise, the sails are riven

Nomeansno,"~~~~~~~~~~
Real love is scary
You try to hide when it looks for you
You never know what it will do
Not real love
Not real love
Real love is a long stone bed, he said
His face a mask of indifference
And it don't care about me or you
Not real love
Not real love
Real love on a sunny day
Is a crow on a telephone pole
With something to say
And you feel like someone
Has just walked on your grave
That's real love
That's real love
The glory of love
The glory of love
That precious rain
That falls from above
First a gentle murmur
That calls from the heart
And then a great wind
That will blow you apart
That's real love
That's real love
Like a ghost it will pass right through you
A spirit that lives on
When you are through
And there is nothing that you can do
The wind in the trees
The smell of wet leaves
The rumble of a passing truck
A streak of blood
Please forgive me for what I've done to you
And lord forgive me for what I'm going to do
In the name of...
Real love is scary
You try to hide when it looks for you
You never know what it will do
And it don't care about me or you
And there is nothing you can do about
Real love
Anyway, that's what I heard a crow say
But who cares what a crow say anyway?
Especially about something, something
Something so strictly personal
(Real love)
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? That wind on your face
You can get down on your knees and pray
But nothing that you do or say
Will make it go away
(Real love)
It's like thunder, like lightning
The way you love me
The way you love me
The way you love me
It's frightening
",Real Love,1994
Nomeansno,"I recall at the end of it all 
You were on your knees and I was standing tall 
But is my memory deceiving me? 
Was I hanging there while you prayed for me? 
Remember how when the show was done, 
We were dancing and singing and having some fun, 
Then I heard you speak, your voice was bleak--- 
""What we forget we must repeat."" 

Are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are, are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are 
I remember the tricks of the trade, 
Who got left behind and who made the grade, 
And I don't need the pages of some master plan 
To tell me what to do or tell me who I am 
But when all is said and all is done, 
Under the yellow glow of a setting sun, 
It really doesn't matter what you have done, 
You are blind and deaf and dumb 

Are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are, are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are 
I remember an endless space 
And the tolling bells of some holy place 
Is it a dream that comes back to me 
Or a memory that I can barely see? 
Not the voices that haunt my mind 
Of the friends and lovers I have left behind. 

What I see, what comes back to me, 
Is a place I cannot find.

She went away 
Gone and left me 
She's gone to stay 
She's gone, but I don't worry 
Because I'm sitting on top of the world 

I'm going down to the hardware 
Gonna buy me a hacksaw 
Gonna free my heard 
Cut that pain away 
She's gone, but I don't worry 
Because I'm sitting on top of the world 

I'm going down to the graveyard 
Gonna buy me a tombstone 
Gonna leave this town

Because I'm sitting on top of the world",Sitting on Top of the World,1994
Nomeansno,"Newly weds, nearly deads
Seas of green skies of lead
Constant rain on my head
Stately homes for the rich
Bowling green, cricket pitch
Victoria, what a bitch

Victoria

I was born in a place
Where the cops spray their mace
On the kids at the gigs
And they act just like pigs
Beat 'em up, knock 'em down
Victoria what a town

Victoria

Land of hope and gloria
Stuck in old victoria
Guaranteed to bore ya
Sentenced to victoria

Yuppies flock to this place
Victoria, what a waste
From Oak Bay to the Gorge
All the geeks at the forge
Victoria, what a bore

",Victoria,1994
Nomeansno,"Faced with several choices
All of them wrong
Snap out of it, I tell myself
Stop singing that same old song
The All Clear sounds but the streets are deserted
We sit in shelters with out eyes averted
I searched for your face among those who remained
But they were
All the Same

I wanted it all, now I find I'm lost

You screamed that I had sold you out
That there had to he something I could do
I'm just trying to hold on, I said
But when you were gone what could I hold on to?
This world is tangled deceptive and huge
You make your choices, try to find what's true
You got lost, that's what happened to you
But now
I'm lost too
Lost

To this land I was driven, to the land of the misgiven,
To the land of false starts, to the land of missing parts
I wanted it all, now I find I'm lost
Lost

I go to work everyday
Come home and watch the news
What chance did we have, I think
Just us two?

Missiles with eyes search for all who survive

Still I called und called und called

When I'm strong enough
It stand up out of this chair
And walk away
One fine day
If I live long enough

Youæ??l see the back of me as I'm
Walking away

Iæ??l go on and on and on
Across the Porch and over the lawn
And when 1 reach the street
See the dust fly off my feet

One fine day
I will settle up
Empty my account
And give it away
And on that day
Conversation will cease
The arguments and questions
Will fade away
Iæ??l go on and on and on
To the edge of town
Iæ??l keep my feet on the ground
But never again will I look down

Iæ??l be on my ...

Maybe I have no guts
Maybe I love you all too much
But I can't sleep I can't breath
It's tearing me up, it's tearing me up
It's tearing the heart out of me

One fine day
Iæ??l wake up to find
All my fears and heartaches
Have melted away
And on that day
All the mists will clear
The sun will shine
And nothing will stand in my way

With nothing to weigh me down

All this pain and heartache was just my foolish pride
What difference could there be, what significance to me

If the moon should fall or if the sun should rise
Always just we two, bloody red and thoughtful blue

I'm afraid there's nothing left to say
I can see you turn and walk away

""Unadulterated""
""Emcee's""

(Sabac Red)
I be Brooklyn till I die don't even question it twice
My crew's nice, late night at the corners we shooting dice
It's like, summertime in New York, jeans, shorts, tims, ??
Tanktops to roofies, groupies acting loosely
Who'll be, in a black drop, with his hat cocked, that can't block
Puff on the stove, get spit in snapshots 
I'm trying to live, feed the kids, drive some whips, handle biz
Own a crib, do my shit, in the streets, that's how it is

(Ill Bill)
If I say Rockstar, I'm talking about rocking the mic
My shit's hot like the rock fiend dropping a pipe
These cats are idiots, with raps so pussy they catch period's
I'm serious, my life is like a drug experience
A porno movie with no plot and I'm the only guy in it
Like Vivid video's with Kobe Tai dime bitches
Ill Bill rap crusader, chilling in the black Navigator
Canarsie to Pennsylvania

""Wild...""
""Like...""
""Rock...Rockstars""
""Who...Who smash guitars""

Chorus 1x

(Goretex)
Break with me your out, bang you with shells and heaters out
Blast off the terrorist, blow bombs and speakers out
Hookers and bricks, gutter cats, bitches and pimps
Cripples and Gimps, ex-cons, pushers and tricks
Street poet, speak the essence, what's realer than this
Up in the club smoked out coke, the feeling of Cris
You lighting the wrist, Richard Simmons fro with a pick
Taking my record label hostage if they stompin my shit

(Sabac Red)
I remember them cold nights and long lines for clubs
Now it's strictly V.I.P., free drinks and drugs
Pounds and hugs, getting back rubs, be them Underground thugs
Stay street but got new found love, take a Continental, driver rental
Travel the globe, Non Phixion to the end worldwide we rock shows
Explode from out the projects, Glenwood to Drysneck
Hold your drink up, and make a toast to how the gods get

[Chorus] - 2x",Rock Stars,2002
Non-Prophets," 
While emcees were burning ism I earned degrees in journalism
Learning the system and about how freedom of speech is worth killing for
But watch what you say in all those interviews!
You're in limbo? WELL WE'RE IN LIMBO TOO!

Contact the dead to get advice from Anne Landers
Transmit personal problems like head lice in bandanas
The big man on campus has delusions of grandure
Doing a thesis on ebonics, unconsciously using poor grammar

Your mannerisms are suitable to cancer victims
How much opposition does it take for your stance or position
To dance to this rhythm? (you're jignorant, baby!)
Dance to this rhythm. (Go ahead, baby!)

Ah, forget it. It's actually accepted for rappers to have no ethics
Their albums would benefit if they put in half the effort
I attended candle light vigils for Matthew Sheppard
While you put out another ""fuck you, faggot"" record

That Ain't Right
I blame my hate mail on typographical errors
Correct the mispellings and then send out thank you notes for the love letters
Accept rejection when I get a return to sender
Reject acceptance when the girl's got an agenda

I've entered this Brave New World of true cowards
Talkin' 'bout, ""No one goes to shows no more. They're too crowded.""
So they stay home and burn shit
Then they say, ""I downloaded your life off the net. Totally worth it.""

It's 2003. Time to stop acting like assholes
It ain't about backpackers or cash flow
Fashionable afros, salon style dreds or frat clothes
And it ain't about these fuckin' loud mouths shoutin, ""BATTLE!""

African medalions didn't sell platinum albums
That's part of the reason why you think hiphop died
It was here before you were. It'll be here in the future
Life's not a bitch, she's just sick of being personified

That Ain't Right
This household is filled with the half-deads
They've got a mouthfull of pills because they're crack heads
They shout that I'm ill, but they're doubtful of skill
With the type of stabbing that turns my back red

I don't blast lead, I write until my pen explodes
All over fashion dreds and your Echo clothes
I don't listen when they say, ""Shit ain't ever gonna change,""
and they say I ain't got no soooooouuuuuul..

Nona Gaye,"Once upon a time a good friend of mine
Told me to tell y'all what I say today
Do the things that keep a smile on her face
Say the words that make her feel better ev'ry day
You bet you better keep on you Ps and Qs
If you don't the woman you can easily lose
Oh, I had a love, a true love and I lost it
No one seems to understand about the pain that it cost me

Woman's got to have it
I believe that I should know
She's got to know that she's that she's needed around
When you kiss her
You got to make her feel it everyday, boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground
Think it over

Don't take for granted the smile upon her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
Maybe the little girl never said a mumbling word
But she's got to know that her voice is heard
Oh, I had a love, it was a true love and I lost it
Now I'm suffering all this pain that the true love cost me

A woman's got to have it
I believe
She's got to know that she's that she's needed around
When you kiss her
You got to let her feel it everyday, boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground

So if you've got a love
And maybe you've got eyes to keep her
You've got to give her what she wants when she wants it
Where she wants it (all right)
How she wants it
And every doggone time she thinks she needs it

Your woman needs it
The same as mine
A woman got to have it

I felt hog tied ever since my dog died
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride
I know he up there he just siting and he wait
I'll be racing up the stairs I'mma get to the gate singing

Oh I'm gonna finish mine
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line
Gonna finish mine

Gimme the water, gimme the water
I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got to pray I got to pray, like Hammer after “2 Legit”
I got the power I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrap the stupid shit
I “Stand Up” like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much they drive an Uber whip
Damn, queen said why we in a queen bed
I said its yours don't worry little bean head
I'm just here to catch my breath I got a world tattoo
She said cool just bring me some food

All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line
Oh I'm gonna finish mine
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line
I'm gonna finish mine

The water may be deeper than its ever been

Lord rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers
So when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She like her Jesus mountain high
So he can watch her lonely child
I know my God
I know my God seen his breaks and his edges
A jacket for giving that painted his city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days he prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was his love
And all that was left was his love
And all that was left was his love

This thirst in my soul
There's a thirst in my soul it tell me
Where else can I go
Where
For you
Come on
I may cry a river
I may cry a thousand tears
But you take it strop and you wash
You wash me new
Me new
People sing
This water is deep
Yes (This water is)
Yes and I need you to
Jesus rescue me
Come on, I need you to
Take me to your mountain

Someday we'll all be free
Be free

Yo! stoned is the wake of the walk, I know you feel me
My crew might be sway, yo, but I can see you clearly
Smilin', while you robbin' me for my stylin'
You need to stop, before you find your grave on Long Island
I'm pilin', blowin' stacks, closin' racks
It's all Non here, over ruffneck tracks
I'm on a mission, dismissing, all that ass kissin'
Before my lyrics burn a hole in your neck, that's what I'm wishing
I'm tapping spines along with your mind
Cause I made you feel good when I rocked your whole 'hood
My soul run deep, like a crack in the street
I keep it real, so you can feel, my true skills
100%, like Absolute, Get gin, you want to blend with the new trend
I got you swaying, what's to say..., You never felt the really real
Let me run a tab, and let your ass pay the bill

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Now wait a minute, hold up, you still want to test me
I'm spraying out lyrics like water from a jet-ski
Oh no! You're still not stepping
Towards the same mic I rocked as soon as I crept in
Cause I been doing this thing for a whole lot longer
And if you want to rock the spot, you better funk stronger
Keep on, and I'ma have to unleash
The true funk baby that ain't nothing but a beast
You need practise. then again, it ain't worth it
My brain is a computer so that means I'm word perfect
Blowin' through the 'hood, just cold knockin' spots off
Get nothing but a chicken and Nonchalant's got your hot sauce
Play your cards right now you sweat the inner city
I got all the diamonds so hard so plus I got the kitty
You still want to test me, you must be gun simple son
I kick a funky flow like a bowl of rolled chilli's

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Now put your mind on the matter, to call your next batter
I'm knockin' home runs in your ass so what's the matter
A' take your time cause the funky rhyme blow your mind
Strut my stuff cause I'm so tuff, and hard to find
In this maze of amazement I got you cornered
Cut your dimes and your nickels cause you know your money's spent
Meanwhile back at the ranch, take a chance
On this funky head bob that's gonna make you dance
Now even the funky chickens who can make up on the twist came in
But do the chicken with the twist and you can blend
Put your eyes on the prize, we gonna take a ride
So deep in your soul you got tears in your eyes
You blinded by the light, now can you see me
Cause I know that you feel me cause I'm cutting like a knife
With the phife, you flow is so weak I call your punk
You starvin' for some soul, yo, you need to bite a chunk

It's Saturday night, I'm on the usual standing in the long line
Waiting for my hand to be stamped so I can get mine
It's never me and who, it's always the same crew
Me with a few ends rollin' with a few friends
Fake smiles, yeah we got 'em in the pocket books
For all them frontin' niggas with the rented cars that want to look
Music blastin' in the cars while they passin'
Mini skirts high, hoping we can catch an eye
To get a duplicate number from the last week
You rap outside but inside the club you can't speak
Talkin' bout yeah, you want to keep it real on the phone
But got me on the list just to bone
I don't think so, let me mingle, cause I'm single
Movin' to the next man, with a drink in my hand
It's all about a good time on the weekend
Party on the Sunday when you should be sleeping

Gin, juice and tonics, stereophonics got me open
Swayin' up the crowd make you want to go wild so high
Can't stop Cause you feel good
When you brushin' thighs catchin' eyes off the guys when you walk by
It's Saturday night, now can you see this
And if it wasn't packed in the club it wouldn't be this good
All the fellas from the hood
Be givin' out your number all night if you could
Relaxing, no pistol packin', now what's this feelin'
Temperature's risin', bass lines through the cieling
Time to get a drink, I think champagne will do
Pass a glass to me, and slide four bottles to my crew
Why I thought you knew, that Nonchalant will make you feel right
It's past midnight, and this funk's tight
It's all about a good time on the weekend

Creepin' while they peepin' out the jeep an' damn

But oh, what I'm feeling, and you know I'm willing
To give it to you like it is so you know you're dealing
With the true one, big fun, hell I 'fess
If I roll past you're house then you're best to get dressed
While I'm sippin', still trippin' off the last week
Honeyz makin' moves but they still can't catch me
Cause I'm swervin', been in ever curve an'
Checkin' out the scenen so I'm just observing
>From a 8-50, ladies are you wit' me
And if you want's to roll, holler, can you come get me
Cause it ain't no joke when we creepin'

Hey baby I can see reflections of a life long dream
The sounds of screams got me wonderin' if my life is worth the means
I see it's only been a while, I can barley feel it's real
But niggas know about the way it goes with me, I know you know the deal
I'm only about makin' mine, brothers takin' time
And if you want to move with me then never try to fake in line
Just know how temporary life can be
And find a way to say you tryin' to live this life with me
Don't call me crazy 'coz I say the things I say when I feel them
'Coz I could never blame you for the times you said you had to feel 'em
Just get your story straight 'coz I can be a saint
Tryin' to put you in the paint, flip the shit, and try to get you back
It's never easy when you dealin' with the realsits
So just relax with us and hope to God your nervous ass don't miss
'Coz you could easily take a turn for the worst
So listen first just remember when it starts to hurt, It's all love...

is gon' be pointing in the same direction, alone with no affection

I feel the fire when you're vibin' wit' me
That's justified by the lines if you can find them this week
I'm puttin' it down for all my sisters livin' life like this
Through all the times you thought that one was just a sight like shit
I get this crazy feelin' knowin' that your minds not here
And I can tell the way you stare up at this world you fear
But listen, ain't no need to be afraid fool, you got it made
The ground work is laid, and if you're careful then you won't get played
Just make it easy for yourself, be a soldier for yourself
If not for nothing but the love you get from nothing else

To keep your mind from getting wrapped up in the turns and twists, it's all 
love...

Look, I don't want it if you can't recline
Find you're timing wit' your best self, look at you just sweatin' mine
Even if we had it all night to do, I couldn't comment on this shit
I hope you might find it too
It's automatic that the way I feel I would if you please me
Never let your mind get you thinking I'm the one who's easy
Just live your life without what you might fear
And get your hands on what you know is lookin' tight right here
It's been a minute now since we've all felt the first impression
But it seems with all the love I showed you haven't learned a single lessson
Is it that you're fellin forced to do
'Coz if it is then we can always try to talk shit through
But look I need a little feedback from your side, young
Just see if you can get with that and let's have some fun with this
Love that you've been hoping for with thoughts alone
Now get yourself up off your ass before your times all gone, it's all

I see the red lights flashing, damn here they come, what did I do?
I gotta think about what's already done so I'm pulling over
My Range Rover, windows tinted,
Got my hands on the wheel while they flashin lights in here
What you lookin' for is underneath your nose
If you take a look around, while you pattin' down my clothes
But it never fails, you got me payin' bail
While the true bad boys is on the streets raisin' hell
I couldn't see it, I couldn't be it, another dirty cop
How the hell is the crime rate rise gonna stop
Transactions, his-a-action, you keep passin'
Every damn day cause I see it around my way
You think you true, but who's gonna win or lose in this crime game
Niggas on the street, doin' dirt through the time change
You writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

Why don't your ass be a real cop?

The judges don't avenge us cause their ass is out of order
I can't plead my case, but when I don't need you
Your ass is in my face sayin' I see you
But I can see you too, and everything you do
Swinging your night stick, Mr man in blue
Yeah, you writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

Now raise your right hand, and your oath, now what's your motto
To break all the rules that your ass is 'sposed to follow
That right hood on your head is just invisible
And when I dig deep, yeah it all gets political
Cause drug orders come from the borders not from the streets
Ships and planes, check the first class seats
But you still pull me over, put your foot on my neck
Hold me down till I stop breathin', said that I flex
But everything must change
Nothing stays the same, so I'ma see that you have your day
When the shit hits the fan and starts to spray
Find my tape, stick it in and then push play
Yeah, this is your foretold warning
And you know I'm getting practise from the deserts that I'm storming
Yeah, you writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs

Let me tap the brain so I can justify the reason
Why I'm callin' your name in my sleep
Why I memorised the tag number on your jeep
I think your skills is something that I want to check
Judging by your looks and your thighs when you flex
I been askin' around tryin' to figure what to do
I know all the names of the fellas in your crew
I ain't playin' no game I'm for real
The cards is on the table so I think you know the deal

That it won't take long 'fore the lifting of the dress

Even though, I gotta say I wouldn't mind if you did
But with the kids comes the ex-girlfriend

Cause I ain't one to be fightin' in the streets
Tryin' to duck flyin' bottles every time that we meet (from a dumb ass

So tell me when the coast is clear so I can get near

Tell me where she at cause I want to thank your mother
I don't give a damn about the rules that I'm breakin'

You're killing me softly so I'm pressed for time
Why don't you just say that you're gonna be mine

Is spreadin' so damn fast, a black major can't last
But what can I do, a strong black woman

Maybe it's the computer, maybe it's the TV. Maybe.
Maybe Not. I doubt it. Maybe it's...
I've lost communication between rational and doubt.
Washed out the wave until it led me to the drought.
Now I'm pissed and angry, just staring at the floor.
I need a little more focus. Come on, this is ridiculous.
How something small has become so big.
Come on, I can't consider this.
I can't consider this is how it's gotta be.
I'm counting on the music to get me through the day.
I'm counting on the anti-histamine so I can breathe.
I'm choking on opinion. I'm coughing up conceit.

Drove twice through the same hour.
Flew right a day. Still it's not enough for me.

NoNoNo,"From this high
You look like
Someone I could fall for
So look down
If you dare
I'm not scared
Let's fall boy
And it feels like flying
I can see the earth turning around
Hold on me really tight
Baby I want you with me when we hit the ground

I wanna feel alive again
Let's make it real
Just tell me when
You never know unless you try
Just hold your breath and close your eyes

I wanna skydive tonight
Flying is a frame of mind
Close your eyes and jump


Let's get mine
broken heart
My wings are in repair
So I stay
On the floor
When love is in the air

And it feels like flying
Standing on the edge of the atmosphere
Hold on my really tight
Baby it's a long way down from here

I wanna feel alive again
Let's make it real
Just tell me when
You never know unless you try
Just hold your breath and close your eyes

I wanna skydive tonight
Flying is a frame of mind
Close your eyes and jump

Close your eyes and jump

Close your eyes and jump

I wanna skydive tonight

And let me pour it in
All the knowledge and feeling
Of these five deadly sins
That your mother would not
Let you see on TV
So you creep to your basement
And lie about being asleep
All alone where the rats colonize
With their tea
As they sip and they watch
You give into the sound
It just takes you and rips
At your soul
This piper is playing and hypnotizing
A funky ass street tempo
The forces are lining
The ticking the timing is off
You're resisting
But it's all for nothing
The piper is playing his song
Can you hear it It's ripping it's gripping
And pulling your spirit
From your inside chest
Your heart it collapses
From the depths, the pits , the gutters, the shits
That make you scream
Scream, scream, scream, scream,
Scream, scream, scream, scream,
Scream, scream, scream, scream
Scream, scream
Line up it's role call
Head is clear
And even though I wrapped you up in butterflies like evenflow
Jeremiah spoke to the masses
And in flash he caught a fist
And broke his glasses
The pipers tune is different
From the boom that you listened to
In your room
Better check your speakers
Their weaker and their trip
Is coming harder
Than a booyacka-booyacka
Coming from your father
Hypnotized, mesmerized, cauterized
With his eyes the surprise is
Start to fizz
Realize that control is his
The pipe is strong
The trip was long
You hit the bong
To concentrate on the song
And before too long
You're under his control
What the fuck?
The children are listening
The temper is ringing
Constantly clinging
To that hydroponic feeling
If you give him the chance
He'll take your mind away
And as the rhythm fades

He is everything you needed

Their jackets tied, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another (Stick it up!) and another (Stick it up!) Michael Jackson (Stick it up!) Stevie Wonder (Stick it up!)

I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith

Well I tried them all and then some

Where it is that your really coming from

I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith

Now in my day I've made some foolish moves
But back then I didn't worry about a thing
Now and again I still wonder to myself
Was it the sweet love, or the way that she could sing

Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away

I might have known you had found another love
I sat at home all night
Baskin' in the lonely pale of my bed stand light

Through a tear in a curtain in a cheap motel
I saw with jealous eyes
You made the call to lie
Deceptively yours

I saw a black cloud, I didn't hear a sound, only the shell on the ground
Was a scream somewhere and in the thick night air
I put the pedal down, as the sirens wailed, and I sat alone and prayed
Not knowing what was to come

Through the tear in a curtain in a cheap motel
I saw with jealous eyes
You made the call to lie
Deceptively yours

I tried not to believe the scene that I could see
It felt like days passed by
Before I turned away, I felt a dizzy sway
And the gun in my hand, stood before a judge

He cleared his throat to say
I won't give you no bail
Shackled with chains of love
I knew that I had bought my own coffin nails

As I stare from a six-foot cell

I can't remember when it's time to go
When I look in the mirror
Tracing lines with a pencil
I remember what came before

I wanted to think there was endless love
Until I saw the light dim in your eyes
In the dead of the night I found out
Sometimes there's love that won't survive

New York City
Such a beautiful disease
New York City
Such a beautiful,
Such a beautiful disease

Laura kept all her disappointments
Locked up in a box behind her closet door
She pulled the blinds and listened to the thunder
With no way out from the family store

We all told her things could get better
When you just say goodbye
I'll lay awake one more night
Caught in a vision I want to deny

And did I mention the note that I found
Taped to my locked front door
It talked about no regrets
As it slipped from my hand to the scuffed tile floor

I rode the train for hours on end
And watched the people pass me by
It could be that it has no end
Just an action junkie's lullaby

New York City
We were full of the stuff that every dream rested
As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky
Caught up in the whole illusion
That dreams never pass us by
Came to a tattooed conclusion
That the big one was knocking on the door
What started as a mass delusion
Would take me far from the place I adore

And you're gonna be missed

Here we go like, yes yes, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Ain't no sleep, y'all, to the break of dawn
5 o'clock in the morn, we keep rockin' on
The workin' people runnin' like the stop clock is on

We got it poppin' in the meat market
Chicks take a seat, park it
By the bar so they can meet the Vick
With deep pockets
And them dudes by them cars that turn 'em in to sweet objects
Of desire big rims and them tires

We finna drop it like it's heavy as hell, the clan of the cave bear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air

Come through like the cable guy, get her done
That 'ole hit 'n run, turn 'em into bitter ones
Tonight it's catch me if you can, you can taste the gingerbread
Ain't nothin' like wakin' up with a stranger in your bed, nope

Soon a new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
""Were am I? What's your name?
Gotta go, I'm glad you came""

But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon a new day breaks the dawn

Puttin' on some Airs, king for a day
Hard to face your fears, we wear the mask like Cory McKay
You have a ball today, it's all a masquerade
Shorty, paint her face like a clown but can't take away the frown

Found under the make up
I asked her, ""What's your passion?"", answered, ""What's the paper?""
She sleepin' they don't want her to wake up
Maybe they should realize their own beauty
Baby, you a star and not just a star on some dude's home movies

Soon a new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
""Were am I? What's your name?
Gotta go, I'm glad you came""

But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon a new day breaks the dawn

Yeah, steppin' out, I got my best outfit on
We gotta get it in, I'm slippin' in the darkness
Like most of the day is gone
We up all night, I wonder if you can hang
We used to hang from a tree
Now we hangin' behind the rope, we V.I.P.

We do it B.I.G., ain't no need to See I.D.
The entire scenery shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery, six girls to every three dudes
So you have half a chance if you ask to have a dance

The ones ready to freak off don't need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them hungry eyes, you know sensual trance
At a glance the alcohol got you sexually advanced

The truth is so boring, you gotta pretend a little
The antidote's more colorful than the rainbow that end the Skittles
In the quest to trap the cat, game is your Tinder Fiddles
To get the Bruce to say the sky's fallin'
Like your Chicken Little, come on

Soon a new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
""Were am I? What's your name?
Gotta go, I'm glad you came""

But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon a new day breaks the dawn

But tonight you will be so fun
Soon a new day breaks the dawn
But tonight you will be so fun
Soon a new day breaks the dawn

Soon a new day breaks the dawn
Soon a new day breaks the dawn
Soon a new day breaks the dawn

And the catfish play 
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Maybe I'll go back there again
Maybe I'll see some of my friends
Maybe I'll be happy again
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels saving dimes
Working til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times 
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine 
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where that girl of mine
By my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh some sweet day
Gonna take away 
This hurting inside
Oh I'll never be blue

I know there's a perfect girl out there for me, cause I see her
In my dreams

Dream girl, you're a fantasy, you're the only one
Out there for me
My love

Dream girl you amaze me all dressed in paisley
Love how not one but both eyes are lazy
When I first saw you you were drivin' the bus
Thick skin, strong nose like a rhinoceros

Dream girl so beautiful, lips all crumby
Skin like asphalt, nose so runny
Thick thighs, no waist, not a care in the world
You not crazy girl, you just my baby girl

If you envision in sweats with the neon patch
Half eaten squirrel hangin' outta your mouth
Rainbow poncho, the female tonto
Hear a loud noise drop a bucket like a bronco

Dream girl, you're a fantasy, you're the only one
Out there for me
My love

You got your cellphone ring set to Sex and the City
You like a hot bowl of gritz only way more gritty
Straight drippin' your turquoise my Santa Fe queen
One short leg you got the Santa Fe Lean

It's music to my ears when you scream in your sleep
And when you lift your skirt in public yo I can't help but peek
You like Cleopatra with the eyes of a pig
Love to watch you in the backer when you go out to dig

Girl how'd you get those mouse traps glued to your neck
Little rascal, how'd you get screwed to the deck?
You put away slurpees like a trash can

Your smiles all stainy and your not too brainy and
I like that!

Talking to your shoes lke it's your friend
I like that!

Yellin' at the walls of make pretend
I like that!

Tellin' you to stop it then you don't
You said you gonna stop it in my sleep
But you won't!

Last week thought I saw you on the straight turn that was a bag of trash
Just a big ol' bag of trash
I thought you look like a bag of trash

Dream girl I pitch a tent when you stomp in the room
Like a hell-bound turkey mixed with a baboon
Your sexy and your spicy like a bowl of Chex Mix
And I always feel safe when I'm in your flesh mitts

Your teeth so clean could of swore you were British
Never take the Chex Mix cause you always get skinnish
Open clamps with both feet cause your ambidextrous
No point cuz we know you eat nothin' but Chex Mix

Chex Mix number one food snack in the land
It's the cereal taste that you eat with your hand
Chex Mix at your local grocer buy your box
Your family will all say
CHEX MIX rocks!

Chex Mix, your the snack for me, your the only one
I'll ever eat or buy
Chex Mix your delicious, you got 60% less fat than potato chips

And dinner and take you to the park at dawn

And though you'll never take a shower together
I know you'll never make me cry

Gun down werewolves wherever we go

Creased white pages torn right from the spine
Kissed my neck with a crooked, cracked fang

Busted gasket in a field full of liars

Lost the chance to wind the key

What a waste, I could've been your friend
Perfect love is like a blossom that fades so quick
When it's blowing up a storm in May

Travel south until your skin turns, woman
Travel south until your skin turns brown
Put a language in your head and get on a train
And then come back to the one you love

Yeah you're great, you're just part, of this lifetime of dreaming
That extends to the heart of this long summer feeling
Quiet night, you see the TV's glowing
Quiet night, you hear the walls are awake

Me and you are getting out of the party crowd
Can I see what's underneath your bed?
Can I stay until the milkman's working?
Can I stay until the cafe awakes?

Do you hate me in the light?
Did you get a fright?
When you looked across from where you lay

Yeah you're great, you're just part, of this lifetime of dreaming

Dead ends plain, sadly showed us our ways
Of never asking why

Cast down it was heaven sent and
To the church, no intent to repent on my knees
Just to cry

Until you travel to that place you can't come back
Where the last painting's gone and all that's left is black

Grey nights he's coming to me and
Some day they'll punish my deeds and they'll find
All the crimes

But then they ask when they gonna see them
Then they gonna ask to feel the ghosts, the walls, the dreams
We'll I've got mine

At last those coming came and they never looked back
With blinding stars in their eyes but all they saw was black

Fooled them hoping to seem
Like a slave of evil but the product of greed and
It's not a mass so be honest with me
We can't afford to ignore that I'm the disease

Some sad luxury
Of when I escaped
It's just I

Can't see through this hazy view
And all the doors are locked
We're only alive when we can be
Defectors from the clock
The clock of all time

She comes and she goes
But where no one knows
And when Her Highness grows
She shakes me

In the dead of the night I found out
Sometimes there's love that won't survive

Such a beautiful disease
New York City
Such a beautiful,
Such a beautiful disease

Laura kept all her disappointments
Locked up in a box behind her closet door
She pulled the blinds and listened to the thunder
With no way out from the family store

We all told her things could get better
When you just say goodbye
I'll lay awake one more night
Caught in a vision I want to deny

And did I mention the note that I found
Taped to my locked front door
It talked about no regrets
As it slipped from my hand to the scuffed tile floor

I rode the train for hours on end
And watched the people pass me by
It could be that it has no end
Just an action junkie's lullaby

New York City
We were full of the stuff that every dream rested
As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky
Caught up in the whole illusion
That dreams never pass us by
Came to a tattooed conclusion
That the big one was knocking on the door
What started as a mass delusion
Would take me far from the place I adore

Over all the weary world

Above its sad and lonely plains
They bend on hovering wing
And, o'er its Babel ancient sounds
The blessed angels sing

Oh, you beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low
Who tore among the climbing way
With painful steps and slow

Look now for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wind
Oh, rest beside the weary road
To hear the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2012

Come away with me
And I will write you a song
 
Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us, with their lies

On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
So won't you try to come
 
Come away with me and we'll kiss
On a mountaintop
Come away with me
And I'll never stop loving you
 
And I want to wake up with the rain
Falling on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is for you
To come away with me in the night

Norah Jones,"T'was in the merry month of May
When flowers were a-bloomin'
Sweet Willie on his deathbed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen

He sent his servant to the town
The town where she did dwell in
Saying ""Master dear has sent me here
If your name be Barbara Allen""

Then slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she went to him
And all she said when she got there
""Young man, I think you're dying""

""Oh don't you remember the other day
When we were in the tavern?
You drank your health to the ladies there
And you slighted Barbara Allen""

He turned his face unto the wall
He turned his back upon her
""So long, farewell to all my friends
Be kind to Barbara Allen""

She looked to the east, she looked to the west
She saw his corpse a-comin'
""Oh sit him down for me"" she cried
""That I may gaze upon him""

The more she looked the more she grieved
She bursted out a-cryin'
Sayin' ""Pick me up and carry me home
For I feel like I am dyin'""

They buried Willie in the old churchyard
And Barbara in the new one
From Willie's grave there grew a rose
From Barbara's a green briar

They grew and grew to the old church wall
And could not grow no higher
And there they died in a true love-knot
The rosebush and the briar",Barbara Allen,2013
Norah Jones,"Down in the Willow garden
Where me and my love did meet
As we sat a-courtin'
My love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of Burgundy wine
My love she did not know
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below

I drew a sabre through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
Which was a dreadful sign
My father often told me
That money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connolly

My father sits at his cabin door
Wiping his tear-dimmed eyes
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high
My race is run, beneath the sun
The scaffold now waits for me
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly",Down in the Willow Garden,2013
Norah Jones,"""I'm not in your town to stay,""
Said a lady old and gray
To the warden of the penitentiary
""I'm not in your town to stay
And I'll soon be on my way
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Oh warden,
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail""

""I tried to raise my baby right
I have prayed both day and night
That he wouldn't follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide
And I feared that he had died
But at last I've found my baby here in jail
Oh warden,
At last I've found my baby here in jail""

""It was just five years today
When his daddy passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold and white
T’was then I bowed to take his ring
And his gold watch and his chain
Then the county laid his daddy in the grave
Yes warden,
The county laid his daddy in the grave""

""I will pawn you his watch
I will pawn you his chain
I will pawn you my diamond wedding ring
I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes warden,
If that will get my baby out of jail""

Then I heard the warden say
To the lady old and gray:
""I'll go bring your darling baby to your side""
Two iron gates swung wide apart
She held her darling to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
But smiling,
She kissed her baby boy and then she died

""I'm not in your town to stay,""
Said a lady old and gray
""I'm just here to get my baby out of jail

Norah Jones,"The lightning express from the depot so grand
Had started out on its way
All of the passengers that were on board
Seemed to be happy and gay

But one little boy who sat by himself
Was reading a letter he had
You could plainly tell by the look on his face
That the contents of it made him sad

The stern old conductor then started his round
Taking tickets from everyone there
And finally reaching the side of the boy
He gruffly demanded his fare

""I have no ticket"" the boy then replied
""But I'll pay you back someday""
""Then I'll put you off at the next stop we make""
But he stopped when he heard the boy say

""Please Mr. Conductor
Don't put me off of this train
The best friend I have in this world sir
Is waiting for me in pain
Expecting to die any moment sir
And may not live through the day
I wanna reach home and kiss mother goodbye
Before God takes her away""

A girl sitting near was heard to exclaim
""If you put him off, it's a shame""
Taking his hand, a collection she made
The boy's way was paid on the train

""I'm obliged to you miss for your kindness to me""
""You're welcome,"" she said, never fear
Each time the conductor would pass through the car
The boy's words would ring in his ear

""Please Mr. Conductor
Don't put me off of this train

I saw an old mother with silvery hair
She seemed so neglected by those who should care
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

A life of hard work was the story they told
And I thought of angels as I saw her there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

Bless her old heart, do you think she'd complain
Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry that cross that is more than her share
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

It wouldn't take much just to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there

That's why I ask the Lord 
In Heaven above
Just what is this thing called love?

Once there were valleys where rivers used to run;
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above;
Once they were part of an everlasting love.
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields.

Greenfields are gone now, parched by the sun;
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run;
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart;
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart.
Where are the greenfields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away.
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me,
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see.

Nordisle Bois Orchestra,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1987
Nordman,"(Py Bäckman & Mats Wester)Öppna dörren så går vi ut, det ljusnar och vinden är varm I ångande jord förvandlas den tid, 
Som gömdes I mörkrets tid
Hör bjällror klingar vid sjön, 
När lockropen stiger mot skyn
Och där bland blommande rönn, 
Går hjorden så makligt och lugnt ner till byn Öppna dörren, se ängens ljus där älvorna dansat I natt 
De strödde sin skatt, små pärlor av glas, på tuvor och blek konvalj Se solen letar sig fram och daggen blir vågor av guldDet väcker något till liv, som sov I en längtan att sona sin skuldÖppna dörren så går vi ut, det ljusnar och allt är ju härSom vintern har fött, I dag har vi mött det löfte som ljuset bärDet blev ristat I en sten, det tecken vi skulle förståSå bär det inom dig nu och låt det berätta om visdom och frid

När en stjärna faller då ser man att den fanns
För den lyser starkast när den dör på våg till någonstans
Och I skenet väcks en dröm till liv, som har slumrat I min kropp
Jag ser seglet fyllas av en vind mot den dag som andas hopp
För idag när båten glider ut så blir jag fri igen
Det är bara vintern som är slut - nu lever sommaren
Vad är det som väntar, det känns att allt är nytt
Ska jag hitta dig som den do var med allt do har betytt
Vi blir ett med allt, när allt blir ett, liksom stjärnor utan namn
Inte ser do om det fattas en den som förde mig I hamn
För idag när båten glider ut så blir jag fri igen
Det är bara vintern som är slut - nu lever sommaren
Ser do himmelen är blå I dag när molnen blåst förbi
Tag emot mig för nu kommer jag när do ser mig är jag fri

Norrskenet bleknar på himmelen, skuggorna är på jakt igen
Såg do en bild från en annan värld
Ljuset föll ner som ett hotfullt svärd
Grät do när hästarna föll I sken, skrämda av himmelen som brann
Sprakande kastades natten ner, mitt I din väg - då allt försvann
Jag är här, jag är inte rädd I natt
Det finns sånt som skrämmer mig mer
Jag är här, jag ska ta dig hem I natt
Om do blir evig - vad händer då
När do sett allt - vart ska do gå
Fattar do allt - så blir inget kvar
Frågorna dränks I alla svar
Skräms do av svärdet som bröts itu
Var det en dröm så vaknar do
Ekot blev kvar I en frusen skog, men det blev tyst när vinden dog
Jag är här, jag är inte rädd I natt
Det finns sånt som skrämmer mig mer
Jag är här, jag ska ta dig hem I natt
Kom till mig nu, nu händer det inget mer
Hotet är störst från det do inte ser
Jag är här, jag är inte rädd I natt
Det finns sånt som skrämmer mig mer
Jag är här, jag ska ta dig hem I natt

I only shoot for those that'll shoot for me 
I used to be in D.C. with my poetry 

Niggers said I'm on some other shit crazily 
I used to sell cracks from the front streets to back 
Then I got locked up wicked Jake popped up 
And the Jake he seen my style before 

But I'm stayin lyrical behind my door 
I'm in the yard God where niggas try to test me hard 
But my vocal's too powerful law, it's too potent 
I kick one verse, the whole cypher stood frozen 

Now them niggas want to parlay with me, general 
I'm smooth like them niggas that, don't blow trial 
I come on home to a new leaf, no beef 
Jose Luis yo I'm ill like an Indian chief 

And my dress code, ill like, indiglo

Aiyyo we thugged out what, and we let y'all know 
we keep it thugged out, catch us at, every show 
Let's get the jump off jumped off, here's the bang out 
Yo at every fuckin club, yo we got octane out 

I need, nuttin but cash, I'm out in the stash 
Extra acres, Caribbean seeds with no crabs 
Fuck hunger, I'm gettin no younger, cop this half 
brick til my pocket just thick, sit back and laugh 

with the out of towners, keepin money around us 
Four pounders, flippin wiggies, to the sirens around us 
Cars and jewels, inside moves, three day cruise 
Booted from Beijing, ?brought? our ventures to ?use? 

The entrepreneur, droppin cock in your whore 
Keep pussy open like a nigga sniffin coke in the hall 
I do it all for y'all, basketball, or rims 
Fiberglass that hold guns when I play old friends 

Learn how to act around a playa who spike tracks 
Doublin the pressure if your Empire Strikes Back 
We savages.. break you up like marriages 
Stick you in public and hide the thrills in baby carriages

The way I grace shit so swift, play it tenacious 
but smooth like a fugitive who move with a facelift 
I stay lit, passin Branson, finesse no less 
Reppin at random, forever at my best when I'm trancin 

niggas make me want to focus with emotion 
If you notice, the vultures I bring they sting so swift 
Your quotes is from Maze, my bang'll tip with any rapper 
these days, spittin venom when my wordplay sprays 

and claimin half this cash regardless, dome my target 
from the heart spittin my flow while slow niggas process 
Blow the spot rock aggressive, mac eleven shots in 
twenty seconds, flood money stashed kept in fed mint 

What is that monkey tail you trust with your math 
to lush your cash, rush in your path, bust you then dash 
That's why I'm never fast with the street shit 
Driftin in this deepness, with each step 

breath taken make you niggas speechless 
Distinctive, mad different's how I kick it 
Some niggas recognize I'm individualized when I spit it

What what what what what!

New kid, War Report, dunn blew out the court
He claim righteous, the God was jeweled down wit ices
My man locked up, in the beast, hit me on the Jag
(Aiyo son, I need loot in this piece)
I got you, already blessed up, caught hard Tommy Hill
Guess appeal, accept collect call, and keep it real
But I was locked for three, son you didn't know me
Your bitch had you sue, told you, don't send me no loot
But I survive in 'Green, shorty sent me cream, Adine
Moms like, the niggas ain't real in your team
Bring the court rap, my first weak, beef wit the staff
Son, where was you at?, called you on the jack
Heard you moved from Iraq to Iran and cold ran
Ran on me, but you supposed to be my family
Tables turned, I'm in Zoo York, you up north
I'm in the cockpit, coppin Averate shit
You in the P now, straight foul wit crocodile
Pretty boy, my little man you like a little boy
Taught you the crime life, you blame me, you weakling
Yucked up, commissary low, now you thinkin
While you locked, I got the block lock wit padlock
Jealousy and envy, towards me
Word got back to me, you got somethin for me
Musolini, yo come and see me

[several samples from The Jones Girls ""When I'm Gone""]

[Royal Flush]
Now when you got locked up, livin plush, sneakers as such
Always flipped it up, on the phone line, you ran it up
Say you stressed as such, few niggas you had to touch
Plus the shit's rough, sendin you balloons, read it up
Thug it up, keep it tight, 'cause your girl on right
It's all a struggle in life, to sell things and pay the price
But I'm wit you, can't let you down son, I miss you
But back on the streets, the police want me wit you
It's official, I'm tryin to blow them lands like a missile
Holdin my pistol, to keep it real when I'm wit you
Commissary a hit you, like Kings try to rip you
Suffer razors an issue, blowin niggas like a whistle
Geo.'s 'a try to snitch you, watch the beam before they fish you
So just lift weight, I'm layin low until release date

[more samples from The Jones Girls ""When I'm Gone""]

[Royal Flush]
Direct sale, judge face to face, no bail
Take it to trail, spend a year on the Isle
First day, Sing-Sing, walkin through the gates
Stuff's a shame, wild nigga walkin wit the length
We was cellblocked, think about, Flush want the top
Put my pictures up, relax for a minute, kick it up
Watch the top cat, La Familia got the coke in that
I need a part in that, fine tango, just give 'em cash
Soup 'em up, make 'em feel wild as fuck, now what up?

[Noreaga]
I know my real family, new people try to be around me
Try to surround me, goatee, ganja leaf
Locked up chief, well let that be
Doorags and cuffies, gave me a razor, recruit me
Now I'll slang, and catch a band, til the bing
You workin in the kitchen, ice pick and now ya snitchin
You Scarface, lost ya face, is laced up
So what, you got cut, then you told police
Keep it real in the beast, same thing in the streets
Wild cats tell, play PC inside a jail
Yo me, did three, never in PC
Stand freely, Musolini, we just a heemy
Life in exile, people like we, penitentiary
Did time, all evolve wit crime
Desert mind, police hit strip, caught mine

Niggas came with hoods again
Thinking that it woulda been
Saw us, from what we first did

Now we twist another wig, a mother lose another kid
But it's beef now, keep it short
Real brief now
Strike vigorous, no intentions of missing it
They sent the message, or example, whatever
Set it up man on man
Only to score we apply the plan
Quickly explain why you ran in this dark land

I shot a nigga did a bid nigga all of that
So now I kick back and get paid for raw rap
Nigga 'Pone ain't home not yet (not yet?)
Yo it don't matter 'cause we's all on the same set
Me and ??? kick it on the here and there
The really head to tough but the love is there
My pops died on July 3rd, '98
So now a nigga need mad herb
'cause my pops is here yo he loved his son
Matter of fact my pops the one that showed me a gun
And said Popi, you gotta protect ya moms
Even if that means that you gotta strap up arms
He used to make me hit the punching bag
My dad, he was a boxer god
And he really was glad yo the boxing the golden glove
He just a thug and I love him yo
So I'ma spread that love

I cock and pop 3 in the air for my niggas not here
Locked it wit me, your legacy live on with me continuously
Tremendously I blow weed deep in my memory
You still breathe, your face show through your seeds
And who know it that you go so quick
We all felt hopeless, through blunt smoke
My pen spittin and I show this
I swore an oath you would notice
I go to lengths with my rap strengths
When I think about my past friends K-Rock and D-zo
Primo from the same block as me since we was shorties
The pain and project glory
I get touched it all absorb me like a weed head rush
Keepin the thorough for my passed he-ro, I must
All my peoples street and physical
I still see you featured in my heart sometimes it might wrinkle
Much drinkin when I'm thinkin, its like I feel a hush over the skies
Touched by dead guys speakin

Hit-Hard Todd and Smiley, T-Bone too
And plus, my nigga Raheem, from ?
You know I poured out beer for Fernando too
And I still smoke my bogeys in the rest of the crew
Yo ain't nothin changed still play ball the same
I like to cheat a little bit just to run in my game
But y'all niggas ain't here, can't believe this shit
Thought you'd always be here, though we'd always be clique!
But y'all niggas not here no more, it ain't fair no more

But yo your men should know
That my crew, we intend to blow
Treat you cats like Martin Lawrence
And motherfuckin end your show

What don't you understand the N or O
Like that nigga Jigga said
Yo, you either friend or foe
So respect my wish 
I'm a perfectionist
And wit the gun
Is the only time a nigga plays catch or kiss
Check the list, how many necks I twist
Who expected this, Exodus
Blow over night, or even sex a bitch
But she catch feelings everytime I hit her off
On my dick so bad I need Cochran to get her off
Ask my nigga Digga
Or my other nigga Mr. Ross

Like they bout to crush a nigga
I get a nigga mad enough to when he snuff a nigga
No need to boast 
Yo, I fuck around and bust a nigga
You got to love a nigga 
The way I rhyme what
Cause out west they fuckin throwin gang signs up
Wildin all out and not carin where they wind up
Next day same ice grill along the lineup
Ya'll niggas' time up
No mean to trouble you
I'll snatch your kids quicker than B.C.W
What you mad about?  I see a lot of tightened jaws
I got a lot of hoes, but I'm really, really liking yours
Not to nag her, wonder if I can bag her
It ain't if I can have her, it's HOW I'm gonna have her
I'm a lay her like a quarterback
On her back
On the mat
Found out that you want to act
We ran through her
You want her back?
Come on wit that
You kiss a hoe
But when the bitch leaves
You fuck around and miss the hoe
Oh, I'm the type to kiss the hoe and diss the hoe
Choke and threaten to kill her, like her last name's Carlissimo
Listen yo, trick the hoe and get her dough
That was Pryor like Richard yo
See I done been around the world
See I met Puff and I know Mason
But still the best nation
Nigga is donation
So let me hold somethin
Yo, you can't change my livin
This robbery's a holiday
Call it Thanksforgivin'
Cause you a turkey
Talkin bout you sell weight
Nigga you had soul mates, I had cell mates
But now I've been in the same three hummers
For the same three summers
And my dice game loves me
and stays on the same three numbers

Yo we praise those, however you make your pesos 

Keep the shit tight just like, Jose Canseco's 

Batting stance, a majorly we glance, 

and gotta yell ""What, What!"" 

'cause thug niggas don't dance yo 

I told niggas, that you did it for show, 

but niggas thought you was ill yo 

Even your hoe, yo for real youngblood I'm really afraid so 

Your colors got revealed and now you buy dough 

Impost-o's, locos, morenos, go-golos, boriquas, platin-o's

Weak niggas wanna stick, you but that ain't fair
You we down in vegas, money, skies too courageous
And yo, I'm on the run, but still rip stages
And call me animal thug, when I'm in cages

That won't ask questions but will blast anybody

Not a cell or a prison or in hell's armageddon 
Just a little ghetto 
Where my niggas control the middle 
We know the riddles of life where others know only a little 

Yo, yo been in rich places, sick places 
Seen my story on six thousand six hundred and sixty six pages 
Wages, I wrote six aces 
And at the same dice games, I caught six cases 
All over big faces, now it's tipped laces 
Ready to dig faces, but the bang it ain't 
Bitch spaces, niggas loading up they rib cages 
Cats like to rip places 
Bloody lip tastes, but the Cam is in big races? 
But I stay in import the pig places 
But the world know the girl though 
I fuck her off a furlough 
She'll be up, hook me up 
All your sales could be luck 
Only question for these ducks is 
Baby girl can we fuck 
You the type that need a wife 
Thought L-o-x told y'all the key to life 
Asshole, yo I don't play around 
I lay it down 
Fuck around, I spray around 
Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it

Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this 
(bust off) and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips 
Like 2 thirds of a brick (penaro and kiss) 
And kiss the crystal white fluffy part in the back of a whip 
See the plan is to stash all, and cash y'all 
The weed so strong, they gotta put it glass jars 
Niggas try to smoke me out, mope me out 
'cause the rims on my new joint be poking out 
I'm about to have no feelings 
Shit is deep, do they dance with the devil when they sleep 
I wake up gripping the air, wishing the hit 
Shit that they kick in ya ear 
When your soul be drifting in air 
My gift is half-rotten when I spit it tears 
That shit'll drop down my eye, I'm too tired to cry 
And I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die

In a minute, I won't claim no set
Yo, you can't find me, gotta hit me on the Internet
W-W-dot-Nore, if not call me
I used to dream of, gettin' out of this rough shit
Now it seems I'm trapped inside of thug shit

For my thug niggas, just livin' they life
drivin' expansive cars, always got one wife
where they could hide the work at, how to eat plus to work that
Most of y'all hoes know y'all not worth that
And ya know me, type a nigga play no D
I'm feelin' like my man Hollywood
Green chronic make me feel good

Now these niggas actin' outta place, talkin' out they fuckin' face
Screamin' how the real when they the snakes
Yo, this Titanic bullshit, overdose shit, nap shit
48 hours left to clap shit, crack shit, bogard like Bogota
While ya imbosiles still really think y'all real
Just because ya bust a gat don't mean you keepin' it real
Yo, I'm ill wit' the heat, and I'm ill wit' the pill
On the street, or on the mic, dick what you like?
While y'all jealous niggas hatin' me just on spite
I'm like Digital Underground, do what you like

At every show what, got y'all hoe's pushin' up Daisy's

Yo a crib, the diamonds, plus a whip 
Yo I went to the crib, to put it on 
Aiyyo, and on the real, woulda put her on 
But even when I wrote it, yo the bitch couldn't quote it 
I found it real foul, like she demoted 
One thing she could do though, is deep throat it 
But I kept it real, bitch still ain't got a record deal 
Mention my name, keep it simple and plain 
She was, off the meter when she seen wood grain 
Told the bitch maintain, now we do the same

Noreaga,"Yo I grew up like the regular thug sold drugs 
Wasn't proud about it, but this is what I gotta do 
I copped the Jordan's, and the Fila's, too 
Yo, I loved the Bo Jackson's, the orange and blue 
Used to snatch Lee patches, now I wear Cartier glasses 
Thinkin' that the earth's axis, 
Revolves around my waist.. and how the fuck I feel 
Yo I played ball for Vince, yo I handled the pill 
Then it dawned on me, came strong on me 
I belonged with these, niggaz thuggin' with me 
So I switched crews, started rollin' with the older dudes 
Drinkin' brews, did what they say, and paid dues 
My hands dirty, trying to keep little Lea 
And got jerked, the first time I tried to re-up 
People my age, tried to say slow my speed up 
'Cause I smoked bogies, staked on weed up

I love my life (Love my life, yo) 
Sold drugs my life (Did it all in my time) 
Its my whole life (Live it up) 
I sacrificed (Sacrificed twice) 
This game we play (Play for keeps) 
I live and pray (Control the streets) 
Hear her say (Yo, just live your life, baby, live your life,baby) 
Ooo, yeah 

These is the days of sparkin', I used to roll with Rob Profit 
Troy Outlaw, Freddie Bedrock, and Joe Wood 
Runni'n in Timbo's ???, shine shoes 
Section Two, part of Iraq I grew up at 
Had to learn how to slapbox, instead of a gat 
I never knew rap, all I knew was crack 
Yo there's rules to this game, and people to blame 
When you see another little brother doing the same 
As you used to 
Growing up like you 
Palyin' skully, with his heat out, cellular phone 
Getting little drug money, but got the world sewn 
I recall, cause he gonna die 
Yo, I cry 
It's hard to, get tarred up with God jewel, part two 
Smily got shot up to (Rest in peace) 
Aiyyo, you realize that you miss a nigga (miss him) 
When you realize (realize) that you never gonna see him again 

[Chorus]

Aiyyo, its totally, up to the team, to me 
So don't, make a move if you don't ask me 
I'm, casually known, halfly blown 
In Miami, cause now Uncle Wise came home 
Jello, copped me a Role', copped them one, too 
You keep it real with a person, keep it real with you 
Use confidence, Thugged Out aimed for dominance 
Nostradam' in this, he slits wrists just like Glomerus 
??, Grenad', iced out for Tito 
Puerto Rico, we live life now cause we know 
The other side of the fence stay friendly 
Its just war in there, done, there ain't no Henny 
I can't live that, déjà vu, I did that 
I gained stats, rumblin' cats over Kit Kats 
Now I spit raps, park my Benz where the chicks at 
And just live with a big stack

Why steps from his H on, shades beyond the grave 
Golden braids hang from my physical 
Bitched scare me 
Move mystical enchanting branson weed at me 
I'm like fan of be	 
Vanish from the scene in a blur 
But barely seen, clearly heard in my action 
And act civil, my palm sizzle from the heat in my hand

What the hell you niggaz just shot at? 
Yo they missed her blazed most fired pistols 
Now it's our turn to play calypsos 
Yo me and you meet me by the two 
A war goin' on that's involvin' the crews 
Bring both your arms Rel and Moose down in St. John's 
I wish my nigga was home the black Fonz 
Yo we rock charms as big as Vegas 
Different crews of different size try to player hate us 
Top of the league like Bulls and y'all cats is Lakers 
Trash since Magic left, but he was the greatest 
Aiyyo we call Shan, yo Shan peace God 
You and Maze got the info? 
Them cats that tried to shoot Moose's hitmen yo? 
A nigga named Ricky, from the Bronx, cold wop city 
Thugged out, shoot his gat mad sickly 
I laid low, called Big Pun and Fat Joe 
Them niggaz my click, we three amigos -- they said 
that they knew the cat, exactly where he live at 
And when I get there, just blaze God and don't look back 
Cause Ricky got no kids and no wifey 
So when I get there God it's like more than likely 
There's Ricky like Ricardo, plus Renaldo 
So when I get there, take the coat, plus the cargo, what?

We strong-arm, blazin firearm long kong 
When the beef come niggaz storm on 

Yo like a day pass, I'm bandana'd up with a mask 
Just shot up the whole spot, crib to grass 
Pissed in his toilet, on his walls, in his halls 
Cut Ricky from his neck to his balls 
Anyone can bust a gun and stab a nigga is real 
Cause you gotta have the guts for the way that it feels 
Word got back, them niggaz said Ricky a rat 
All that, coke we took yea we cooked the crack 
The police don't really want us, they want the coke back 
It's impossible, just ask the word by the hospital 
Across from the mall right in Hoffman Park 
It's in tennis bags, guarded by a hundred Iraqs 
Yo we swerve low, beside the Jake, there go, Roberto 
The brother of Ricky, he 'posed to be wild, it's gettin deep 
How he knew where I'm at, how he knew how I eat? 
The fools pulled out, no doubt, Roberto grabbed the sick ? 
We hit the spot, then we hopped in the whips 
Now it's a chase on the highway, the L-I-E's 
Yo them fools ?, niggaz drive by me 
Iraq banner, not he, ? aqui 

We strong-arm, blazin firearm long kong 
When the beef come niggaz storm on 

Aiyyo we just crashed into the pole, now we roll 
another Dutchie, calm down and stroll 
on foot, my whole click, got control 
of the whole output, now we roll 
Yo any nigga be a man for a minute why'know 
Then he, turn around once he know you got dough 
It's like a cycle, that read psycho, man in the mirror 
like Michael, my whole click down to snipe you 
Since then, Roberto had beef, with melanin men 
Every nigga he hate, was darker than him 
Older niggaz than him, stay buggin on him 
Tellin him he weak, he ain't touch my skin 
But once again CNN prevail, tho-rough 
Cause even the G-est don't really understand Hell 
I did this, from Iraq, to livin the cell 
So y'all niggaz know, what? Meet you back in Hell what?

Noreaga,"I'm, I'm actually waitin on the bus now
He said we have some kind of special assignment or something
He's supposed to be callin' me, like any minute now, any minute
Hold on, hold on, lemme get the phone
Hello? Jackson here
Ya, what? you found Manuel Noreaga?
In the Phillipines?
He has a mansion?
Ok, we on it, on it, right now,  right

What

Ayo, we light a candle
Run laps around the english channel
Neptunes, I got a cockerspaniel
We on the run now, yo, it ain't no fun now
And where I go, you niggas can't even come now
You hate the law, nigga break it, I don't care
And when ya get caught, remember that I don't care
N.O.R.E., blow you off the atmosphere
Yo for now we on the run, yo if that ain't clear
Weak niggas wanna stick, you but that ain't fair
You we down in vegas, money, skies too courageous
And yo, I'm on the run, but still rip stages
And call me animal thug, when I'm in cages
I used to proof phrases, rolled dice with no aces
Now I'm just included in the oasis
Gotta take faces, no time  for car races
Check my sky, tell I got five pages

What

Yo hit Lousiana, then Atlanta, Indiana
Forget a city slicker got country grammar
Ayo we goin places, where my sound scan ain't tough
So when I say I ain't Nore, yo it ain't that rough
I leave the jake in my fake, askin all this stuff
I gotta keep my mouth shut and don't say what, what
But yo its hard to, Netherlands got the heart to
Yo from New Orleans, L.A., V.A. to Queens
The I-95, now we hit the Phillipines
But now its different, we gotta stay sober
Yo, communicate, startech, motorola
Keep it on the hush hush, don't talk to much
Thugged out entertainment, you know we touch
All our whips got navigation
While you whips is just garbation
Is you knowin what you facin?

What

This is the life yo, of a superstar
Fly ass mansions, and a million cars
Gotta get the cash yo
And its live or die
The Neptunes and Noreaga
The limit is the sky hit em'

Yo, lemme, do it again, do it to win
Last album was a eight, this one is a ten
And when Capone come home, we gon' triple the cent
Yo I love my family, treat my folks of kin
Rockin air and better, like a Mexican
Shottin' at my pops, cause yo next to him
He told me every thug nigga is a gentlemen
So I took heed, take my time sitll won't speed
Yo a nigga got kids, so my family need
A little more than they used to get
Real, not the duplicate
Takin no fours, makin y'all just recoupin' it
Doin' it up, tell me whatcha wanna do wit' it
Capone's plan, passport to foreign lands
Overseas in  Japan, politickin with Chan

One for y'all y'know what I mean? Yo ya know? Its crazy. We all together. 

I used to cut pies in front of my girl, now I apologized 
The reason why: (My fault) she seen the red in my eyes 
When I was cuttin it, feelin like the archives 
Choppin it down, thinkin I'm, choosing my prize 
Never hit the street with out my heat, boo, told me not to 
Said, ""Paps, we know the jake 'ill try to knock you"" 
You do your thing, boo, I'll still be there, don't mean to knock you 
I know its hard fuckin with a thug nigga like me 
Thinkin would I get locked?

Lets get real high, light it all at the same time 
Stop holdin, (hold it up) babe its your turn to roll it 
I used to spend time outside with my dime 
She be, rocking my chain, thinkin she shine 
Straight beautiful, yo, I'm really glad that she mine 
Kiss you on the forehead, cause yo, boo 
This one for you 
The stupid shit I did in the past, I didn't mean it 
You know a nigga skinny, cause a nigga 'nemic 
But when you cook, the way that it smell, the way that it look 
Cause chef, plus you look good, that's off the hook 
You go to school to 
Sit back, or respect dude 
Work you part-time, spendin your time around mine 
I'm lovin you, that's why I wrote this rhyme 
Flying in to Bell Harbor, when we need to shop 
It's Cartier, Gucci, Gaultier, shit won't stop!

It even flipped, when I was down in Miami 
Called me on my cell phone, Jones like I'm still home 
Tell me what your wearing girl, or what you look at pillin girl 
Step into my life now, share my world 
That's what I like about you, you got faith in me 
Be shining by yourself, with little lace with me 
The only thing I love more, gotta be the kids 
You got the real hair, while other chicks rock wigs 
I can remember back then, quite distinctively 
When you friends kept saying not to get with me 
But you couldn't help it, I know the both of us felt it 
The both us melt it, the both of us dealt with 
The rumors and the lies, your eyes on dies 
Is enough for a brother to cut off ties 
To any other chick I used to mess with 
Keepin it real, cause you the real one, that I want to step with 

This song right here, is dedicated to all of y'all, y'know what I mean? Cause, 
We know how we are, we know how we make y'all feel sometimes. Knowing that we 
Ain't doing it purposely. We're just being the person that we are. Hanging

I only shoot for those that'll shoot for me 
I used to be in D.C. with my poetry 

Niggers said I'm on some other shit crazily 
I used to sell cracks from the front streets to back 
Then I got locked up wicked Jake popped up 
And the Jake he seen my style before 

But I'm stayin lyrical behind my door 
I'm in the yard God where niggas try to test me hard 
But my vocal's too powerful law, it's too potent 
I kick one verse, the whole cypher stood frozen 

Now them niggas want to parlay with me, general 
I'm smooth like them niggas that, don't blow trial

we keep it thugged out, catch us at, every show 
Let's get the jump off jumped off, here's the bang out 
Yo at every fuckin club, yo we got octane out 

I need, nuttin but cash, I'm out in the stash 
Extra acres, Caribbean seeds with no crabs 
Fuck hunger, I'm gettin no younger, cop this half 
brick til my pocket just thick, sit back and laugh 

with the out of towners, keepin money around us 
Four pounders, flippin wiggies, to the sirens around us 
Cars and jewels, inside moves, three day cruise 
Booted from Beijing, ?brought? our ventures to ?use?

Keep pussy open like a nigga sniffin coke in the hall 
I do it all for y'all, basketball, or rims 
Fiberglass that hold guns when I play old friends 

Learn how to act around a playa who spike tracks 
Doublin the pressure if your Empire Strikes Back 
We savages.. break you up like marriages 
Stick you in public and hide the thrills in baby carriages

The way I grace shit so swift, play it tenacious 
but smooth like a fugitive who move with a facelift 
I stay lit, passin Branson, finesse no less 
Reppin at random, forever at my best when I'm trancin 

niggas make me want to focus with emotion 
If you notice, the vultures I bring they sting so swift 
Your quotes is from Maze, my bang'll tip with any rapper 
these days, spittin venom when my wordplay sprays 

and claimin half this cash regardless, dome my target 
from the heart spittin my flow while slow niggas process 
Blow the spot rock aggressive, mac eleven shots in 
twenty seconds, flood money stashed kept in fed mint 

What is that monkey tail you trust with your math 
to lush your cash, rush in your path, bust you then dash 
That's why I'm never fast with the street shit 
Driftin in this deepness, with each step 

breath taken make you niggas speechless 
Distinctive, mad different's how I kick it 
Some niggas recognize I'm individualized when I spit it

On stage holdin my dick 
In front of all y'all bullshit ass niggas

Ain't nuttin changed since the album I'm still whylin 
I'm still violent I've been waitin for this moment 
like Phil Collins, for all my life I've been trifer than trifer 
Hyper than hype, when fightin to fight 
It's like, tonight is the night 
And I ain't even tryin to let a nigga slide 
I've been dyin to get a gat 
I dared to try now prepare to die 
I rush your crib like Jehovah's Witness, blow up any 
soldiers, infants, hold up, did you notice my heroic entrance? 
I'm so relentless in this field of rap, everything is real in fact 
Fully backed by bullies who be peelin caps 
I sack the rapper like li-nebacker, play my rhyme backwards 
you can hear the Devil speak his mind with fine graphics 
Things get drastic, Express for my plastic 
I pack clips, between my nuts and my fat dick

Snatchin niggaz out of the booth, unpluggin it

Yo it's a strange thing, a nigga never had a suit 
Yo so bust what happen, remember the unknown's a clap-man 
Cat stackin, move out the hood that's in Manhattan 
Got big headed, misleaded, then dreaded 
Yo the beef deaded, his whole squad afraid to set it 
Yo I heard son, son is rockin iceberg Dunn 
Got up out the hood, wouldn't believe that, this cat would

This stud bumped into me, beef it was fin' to be 
My Appetite for Destruction is finnicky 
He was an industry type, influenced by magazines and snipes 
Rocked Adidas but he had no stripes 
I could tell in high school that he had no fights 
Hold dick better than he hold mics, he spiked his punchlines 
with current events, called for backup 
like one time when he heard it was Sense 
that deliver words with intents to kill 
Whether the hip-hop type, country rapper, or big wheel 
I peeled some raps back, that peeled his cap back 
Fucker thought I was Abstract, now his life is backtracked 
In the center of the party his crew identified the body 
Left him signin the wait-list sayin, ""I can't take this 
fake shit"" (echoes)

Look out your people on a blood shoot baby blues
Look at my geezmo got shot and barely made it news
How many crews I gotta run through when it comes through
Getting raw I'm the predator, I'ma Hunt you
Niggaz think is something sweet on the fuckin street
But I'll be there busting my heat, when there's nuttin' to eat
Fuck it I cheat cus that's the ghettos anthem
I know the devils laughing every time he hears somebody's metal clappin'
Ain't no napping in the city cus it never sleeps
Wake up like what happen when I bust a cap on your feather geez
I led at least a thousand caps, with a thousand raps
With how many acts, actually ever really come out of wax

 Thinkin long term, not thinkin on some weak s***

 They crucified him now they inject us refuse to fry em 
 The pendulum state of death is my fate, cool I'm dyin 
 If that's my destiny it's meant to be, just remember 
 to bury the motherf***in that bent me right, next to me

 Let's fight then, I'm hype blend, comin with the thunder

 Nights on the storm, put knives in your moms, right up in the Bronx 
 Mic in the palm, it's the Ghetto God 
 I tear a n**** heart, out his frame, when I scream, Terror Squad

Noreaga,"You never hear that we buckle
Beef? we chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything up on my money, man, I gotta see double
Unless you want trouble
Oh, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Crack the hen rock style, give me the foul
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they met my balls
Right after I played ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. hear what I say y'all?
O.k. y'all. ask aj y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like stacy, damn, she was eatin' tracy's ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up desert storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the don fall
But I'll come inside the tunnel, nigga, wit pope john paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on street soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep two bones and two phones in each rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace to lorey actins, but I get buck wild like corey jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin nicholi nigga, like volkof
Know what I mean yo? notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like el nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta lex coupe
With jimmy jones right next to me in the benz truck too

Fuck all y'all non-believers
I roll wit god, the squad and ts
Out wit the b.s
We platinum, they even doubted jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brainbolic wit knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around wit gold by the pound
Frozen down wit diamond bolders all in the crown
Talk of the town
Soakin' you down wit the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and put your corpse in force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk in the ghetto
Even spark your metal and get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than kung fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit

Now it's a symphony
Without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My crew shit on cats without tiffany
N-o-r-e, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the wip on any street
I fuck wit clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' nore lay pretty low
But them niggas ishomos like the maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of chico debarge
Thugged out's 1st lady (let's go half on a lady)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thousandon my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the president is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get hed too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, go head boo
Thugged out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, cam'ron and punisher too
And the beats are usually done by duro and clue

Who in the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign
Far from being borin'
My style is hard like cancer without mccorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like aids cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a street fighter like jean claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the desert storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in porches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit
I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of canibus that's side effectless
The type of shit that get the question-mark man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on mcs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, clueminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call swat
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the national guard
Ready or not like the fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what clueminati did to you
The maximum lyrical
Nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you ??
Motherfucker clueminati 98'

Yo I'll be ready to ride and I'll be ready to die

Ay yo my word is bond long as I'm alive I'mma put it on
Could'a gone to gee shit, thug nigga till I'm gone
Weight of the Bronx I'm flippin, five boroughs thoroughly reppin'
Lets unite the city and step to the world as a weapon
Cause everybody's checkin for Pun second to none
Cause Latins going platinum was destined to come
The inevitable, heavenly better than whatever you do
We eligible, TS is incredibly credible
For the revenue we gettin you open with lyrical dope
And these breaths that are potent is like an injectional dose
And it never quits
Take it from TS's top terrorist
Rapper slash hijacker bombin' tracks ever since
I was young, I wasn't always Big Pun
It wasn't always this fun, ayo I rose from the slums
I had to pay my due, lay a few
But I ain't sayin who, stayin' true to the game
No names, playin' it cool just me and the crew
Holdin' it down long as we round

Ay yo ain't nothin' changed I'm still the same
The way you remembered me since the centipede
Harder, big blacker back in the seventies
Try to remember me from my aggressive will
The way I kept it real is more important than any record deal
I used to chill on da block with Cuban and Seis
I still do but now it's in the blue convertible eight fifty
My true niggas'll always be wit me
The shifty kiss me, tell me they miss me, then try to diss me
Cause I'm rispy crispy for life sixties the price
Another fifty for the Cuban twisted in ice
Niggas is sheist but I psych 'em out
Though they like to doubt I make em all believers once I let the Tyson out
Cause I can vouch for only a few only the crew
From the old school I consider loyally true
I morally grew from a fool to a scholar
Follow the rules on how to spot a plotta that's cool for a dolla
I wanna holla at my peeps that's reppin' the streets
Wrestlin the beast of chest restin' in peace
Blessin' my seeds and watchin' over us
Til I die I'll align the souls with mine and shine for all of us

Well you talk about fat gats
You can't rap nigga stop that, got that
You want to act like you cock back

Keepin' it close, put it in a post
E.T. the coach, niggas want to be me the most
You boast and brag and sport the sag
Cause I dope rhyme, niggas never want to quote rhymes
Try to bite and then you choke rhyme
Rollin up a smoke rhyme
Comin' out with your wrote rhyme
Ain't nothin' but some broke rhymes
Me I got the right rhymes, always comin' out tight rhymes
Break a nigga see the light rhymes
Want to fight rhymes? Naw nigga not tonight rhymes
Get your girl I just might rhyme

Old block rockin' locked quick
Rhymes shined with hot spit
Why'all speak about shine I write rhymes
Then I burn clicks, and give em this
Your platinum plaque's counterfeit
You shipped gold, is what I was told
Your airplay was bought hits
Payola Motorola cell phones
Where you spent all these ends, then he's gone
In the wind poof, ain't no proof, a super sleuth
Couldn't find his shoes
I wrap heads, like bad news
And bust bass and blow a fuse
Then I move to Baton Rouge like, Snoop on the move
I'm like Megatron, an underground rap shit phenomenon
I blow up in my Prime (And after that?)
Then I move to Cybertron, with Omega Supreme
But it seems that I gotta sit back and pray (Back and pray)
To God that these niggas won't take me away (Why?)
I say it seems that I gotta sit back and pray

On the sky-tel with big type, and bring the ounce 
Clip on niggas, niggas just be seeing me cussing 
How you dig up with my style, the way I be rushing 
Just to style you head in 
You drove to a dead end 
So what you gon' do now, once I but lead in 
I say what, what, now y'all say what, what 
I say, that I'm a thug, now y'all want to be thugs 
And I admit that I'ma hustler just hustling drugs 
Yet I do this shit because crime pays 
I'lI rock a cescear and doo rag 
And I don't got waves 
(Don't got waves, don't got waves, don't got waves)

Yo,yo,yo, niggas want to turn states 
Just hand me the eight 
Have a crib in Iraq, for the Memph escape 
Where the D's won't find me 
Trees is lime green 
Hoes give head just to ride and watch springs 
Niggas gon' hate, 'cause we trying to get rich 
My steak got A1, I can taste the chips 
Give them facial hits, from the chrome thou flip 
With the serious scratch, get them pinacles back 
You can take some nigga, you wouldn't take some of these 
My bullets heat up and burn, nigga, feel my sting 
For the 9 double 9, these streets is Bleek 
All my niggas on the run just got to eat

Across the border border, seargeant slaughter slaughter

And we both, from the ghetto, so we kick it the same 
You call your weed chronic, we call our weed hydro 
You call your shit doja, we call out shit gamble

Well you talk about fat gats 
You can't rap nigga stop that, got that

Spittin that upon the red eye, flyin to the n.Y. 
Niggaz high from coast to coast 
Keepin it close, put it in a post 
E.t. The coach, niggaz want to be me the most 
You boast and brag and sport the sag 
Cause I dope rhyme, niggaz never want to quote rhymes 
Try to bite and then you choke rhyme 
Rollin up a smoke rhyme 
Comin out with your wrote rhyme 
Ain't nuttin but some broke rhymes 
Me I got the right rhymes, always comin out tight rhymes 
Break a nigga see the light rhymes 
Want to fight rhymes? Naw nigga not tonight rhymes 
Get your girl I just might rhyme 
And the story go, for the thugs even nore know 
The gory flow, can't be faded 
Prayed it down, laid it down, and I'm gone 
Take double-steps turn around and show em 

Now it's that crooked letta hot shit 
Old block rockin locked quick 
Rhymes shined with hot spit 
Y'all speak about shine I write rhymes 
Then I burn clicks, and give em this 
Your platinum plaque's counterfeit 
You shipped gold, is what I was told 
Your airplay was bought hits 
Payola motorala cell phones 
Where you spent all these ends, then he's gone 
In the wind poof, ain't no proof, a super sleuth 
Couldn't find his shoes 
I wrap heads, like bad news 
And bust bass and blow a fuse 
Then I move to baton rouge like, snoop on the move 
I'm like megatron, an underground rap shit phenomenon 
I blow up in my prime (and after that?) 
Then I move to cybertron, with omega supreme 
But it seems that I gotta sit back and pray (back and pray) 
To god that these niggaz won't take me away (why?) 
I say it seems that I gotta sit back and pray 
To god that these niggaz won't take me away

Drinkin Brandy straight out a tall ass glass 
They call em Maurice's I'm wit E 40 
Mack 10 yo and that nigga W.C. 
Yo in the lobby of the hotel it's off the hook 
They got no more rooms cause the shit all booked 
But last night I'm wit Wesley Snipes 
Gettin drunk in Cheetah's just feelin aiight 
I had to bounce early though, gotta catch a flight 
Told Swizz Beatz give a pound to him and his peeps 
I had to bounce in the limo, get somthin to eat 
Ay yo, I'm bouncin in the limo gettin somthin to eat

And then this cat pulled up in a pure white five 
He said he hate me and he wished that I'd die 
I rolled the window down and I said what's up 
I said fuck you, then I rolled the shit back up 
I paid it no mind, just drove off tough 
And then the driver said to me, yo they followin us 
Now I'm a little scared 
But I'm still prepared 
I'm like one deep wit one gat, nigga I'm here 
Then I thought to my self, yo I'm near LaGuardia 
Let me cut through the hood and have my niggas just body it up 
Have my niggas on the block playin the cut 
Call em up, when you see the white five fire it up 
At this point I'm poppin shit, knowin I got it 
""Come On Motherfucker!!!"", out the sunroof I yelled 
Hopin these niggas still follow me and still don't bail 
It go...

My niggas was on the block like I planned 
They hit the passenger side up and killed his man 
I hopped out the limo and just spinned around 
Hit the ground, my niggas tried to hit the clown 
I said chill, he say he want to see me die 
So let me hit the nigga up, blow him kiss good-bye 
Adios! 
Now I just gotta be ghost 
I gave my niggas a pound, and then I just hand em the toast 
The limo driver got scared and tried to bounce on me 
And yo besides the heat, I had an ounce on me 
Bullet proof vest feelin like an couch on me 
I called the hood cab, oh-5, came real fast 
I had to bounce real quick, get up off da ave. 
And yo motherfucker that's what I did 
Ay yo, I still hit the airport and caught the flight kid

{Fuck a bitch, make ya beef ya wife, 
'n these fiend for the cream til they team is tight}

Yo at Miami, at the Rolex, the strip bar club
Even at Cocos, the strip bar club
Sometimes at Medallions, the strip bar club
Always with dubs, 5 and 10's, cappin' battles of Don
For the crazy, spend my cash
But you know I never pay for the head and ass
Were my niggas at? gettin' lap dances
Smiles on they face, feel good my niggas be laced
Used to be on the block, just sellin' they rocks
Now they chillin' with me gettin' legal knots
Double L techs, ain't nigga be Vex
Rockin' ice burn, never too good to wear Guess
Makin' it happen, seein' my niggas makin' it rappin'
While ya niggas be broke and ya never be laughin'
We on jet ski's and scooters, private jets
Don't you know we still have our ties to the projects

[Chorus:  2X]

Every nigga that you talk to, ain't ya man
And every nigga that you hang with, ain't ya fam
See a snake like a mile away, niggas say I'm weak now
And I ain't even hungry
So listen up, yo this is what I gotta say
I still hungry yo I eat like twice a day
But ya can suck my dick like Mart LeMay
Cool and honest, now a nigga really be arogent
My nigga Outlaw who used to live up in Faragent
We got niggas from all around the world
We even got hoes now, better ask ya girl
We can drink with weed, I'll make ya hurl
Straight twisted, with hydro and how ya be lifted
I told you to hit it light, before ya hit it
But you ain't listen so ya ass is corse
But you can't hang with me 'cause ya ass is soft

[Chorus: 2X]

Aiyo one's for the money, two's for the bitches that suck dick
Three is for pops and shit, rest in peace mambo
Yo I love you daddy
Soon as 'Pone came home, yo he cop the Caddie
Tell Bob My Weave, we doin' are thing
And we got like a whole lotta money to bring
Do are thing with the bent, plus we grown as men
Feedin' like 15 niggas, that's next to kin
Sprung niggas out the hood with us
Yo when we do shows, we still got the hood with us
I know you love that, see us on stage, all drunk, with a thug hat
Mic check, so much henny moet
That's BK on the wheels, cuttin' up the steels
The niggas bring gats still, just to keep a rep
So don't disrespect, ya won't see the tech
Mano-a-mano, probably see ya niggas tomorrow

Holla when you hear me, respect me or fear me
Love me or hate me, but you gotta just hear me
Listen to superthug, listen to sometimes
Listen to halfbaked, and listen when thugs rhyme
I ain't the best yet, but i'm next in line

Noreaga,"Evening, is the time of day
I find, nothing much to say
Don't know, what to do
But I come to

Here's why they call me the ghost, I'm half live half dead
And when there's beef I bring all of the toast
And I got more guns than most of New York
And I ain't got to say shit 'cause the toasters'll talk

Holiday Styles ignorant nigga
Tre pound four pound still tearin' off your ligament nigga
I'm the hardest rapper out bitches diggin' a nigga
And like anybody who beef can swim in the river

When I walk through the door all the children'll shiver
It's like, He's so gangsta, y'all so pussy
I murder y'all faggots so y'all don't push me
All I know is goin' through hell, blowin' a shell

I got, down so hard I thought no one'd tell
But I was damn wrong, I hold it down like my man's gone
I shoot anything I get my fuckin' hands on
To leave y'all coward niggaz bloody like a tampon

Evening, is the time of day
(Yo, E Nicks where you at nigga?)
I find, nothing much to say
Don't know, what to do
(Uhh, uhh, yo)
But I come to

I'm sick and tired of rappers talkin' 'bout, all this cheddar
And when you see them in the streets got a bullshit Jetta
I'm like dog stop frontin', you shouldn't be braggin'
And why the fuck you got rims if you push a Volkswagen?

I spit vicious, let my bank account switch digits
And if money was height, you'd be midgets
(Go on nigga)
I spit hard save it, sinner nigga affidavit
And next to God, I'm most niggaz mom favorite

Y'all talk gangsta but you notice the mob
And I could bring you to the hood and get, both of you robbed
You see I live in the streets, I sleep in the streets
Fuck it, I probably got, more guns than police

Niggaz say I'm too hard, them niggaz too soft
Straight pussy, I heard they suck dick up North
And it ain't so foul so, hold your breath
And you probably still real just a gangsta left

Evening, is the time of day
I find, nothing much to say
Don't know, what to do
But I come to

All I can say this the game I chose
For this European car and these name brand clothes
Get respect from these niggaz, spit game at hoes
Come down with a bounce and a strange-ass flow

I got bigger than I thought I would, I did shit that I thought I could
Act rowdy 'cause I fought that good
Them blocks is mine I bought that hood
They know I squeeze, smoke trees, and blow bo-dies

And your boss even know, that y'all niggaz can get it
Have y'all skeleton cracked, and some holes in your fitted
Have your body chopped up, in six different lakes
And you ain't even safe right in front of the Jakes

They call me Stan Still, 'cause I fuckin' just stand still
And most of y'all niggazs run, plus your mans will
Folded up in a corner, behind a van still
And your hoes can get it, then your mans will

Evening, is the time of day
I find, nothing much to say
Don't know, what to do
But I come to

Ya, what? you found Manuel Noreaga?
In the Phillipines?
He has a mansion?
Ok, we on it, on it, right now,  right

Ayo, we light a candle
Run laps around the english channel
Neptunes, I got a cockerspaniel
We on the run now, yo, it ain't no fun now
And where I go, you niggas can't even come now
You hate the law, nigga break it, I don't care
And when ya get caught, remember that I don't care
N.O.R.E., blow you off the atmosphere
Yo for now we on the run, yo if that ain't clear
Weak niggas wanna stick, you but that ain't fair
You we down in vegas, money, skies too courageous
And yo, I'm on the run, but still rip stages
And call me animal thug, when I'm in cages
I used to proof phrases, rolled dice with no aces
Now I'm just included in the oasis
Gotta take faces, no time  for car races
Check my sky, tell I got five pages

What

Yo hit Lousiana, then Atlanta, Indiana
Forget a city slicker got country grammar
Ayo we goin places, where my sound scan ain't tough
So when I say I ain't Nore, yo it ain't that rough
I leave the jake in my fake, askin all this stuff
I gotta keep my mouth shut and don't say what, what
But yo its hard to, Netherlands got the heart to
Yo from New Orleans, L.A., V.A. to Queens
The I-95, now we hit the Phillipines
But now its different, we gotta stay sober
Yo, communicate, startech, motorola
Keep it on the hush hush, don't talk to much
Thugged out entertainment, you know we touch
All our whips got navigation
While you whips is just garbation
Is you knowin what you facin?

What

This is the life yo, of a superstar
Fly ass mansions, and a million cars
Gotta get the cash yo
And its live or die
The Neptunes and Noreaga

Rockin air and better, like a Mexican
Shottin' at my pops, cause yo next to him
He told me every thug nigga is a gentlemen
So I took heed, take my time sitll won't speed
Yo a nigga got kids, so my family need
A little more than they used to get
Real, not the duplicate
Takin no fours, makin y'all just recoupin' it
Doin' it up, tell me whatcha wanna do wit' it

Overseas in  Japan, politickin with Chan

Noreago,"Shut 'em down

Yo shut 'em down start the violence
We wilin' wilin' sling back his body found
Washed up on Coney Island
When I rolled up  this niggas heart slowed up
That killa froze up, when I pulled up jumped out with the pump-pump
Thirty-two shots and ducked out
So look out
Left that cat for dead his body smoked out
Cause when I fall y'all killas a kill me kid
I'm goin' all out
Lifes a bitch, fuck it, got the gun bust it
Game play, gotta play by the rules or your own cannot be trusted
Don't try to test, abide your chest, put five inside your vest
Have you layin' with a dead rest
Shoulda known when you was lookin' in the eyes a death
And I swore forgiveness when I did this
There was not no witness but he should understand
Cause even God got a shit list

Beat downs anonymous
I spit like a shiny silver nanabus
Niggas fond of us
We the kind that rush, those that hold back
Takin' your whole stack
Grimy street cats
Niggas bald head like Kojak
Go gat for gat
Coat that
You could smoke that
Or cut black dust
Makin' your whole fuckin' stove crack
Betta know me
1-3, one and only could be never phoney in any ceremony
I'll tear you homey
Shut 'em down
Shun sees takin' your time
Makin' your mind
Got this nigga on the low
Defecatin' with rhymes
Breakin' your spine
Got you movin' from the flurry, time to worry
I'm a bury the bullshit
Feel my full clip

Shut 'em down

Hey yo I bet you this motherfuckin' double barrel will blast his face
Be on the look out for a basket case
Niggas pumped you up to watch you get beat
Had you thinkin' shits sweet
Now you up shit's creek
Cause your shits weak
How mich is your life worth to someone important
Cause I be extortin'
Kidnap for ransom is some shit you don't want to get caught in
From back in the days of Gordon
Niggas was gettin' robbed
The guy from Rikers Height stayed on his job
With his own little mob
Was it worth goin' back to the Earth so soon
Worth makin' my shit go boom
To your own doom, from the graveyards
Till there's no room
Fuck you know about a pine box
Money goin' out with nine Glocks
On top of that same nigga when they pull with they nine shots
Feel like killin' for your crew
I ain't gon' rest
It gonna take a whole lot to put up your best
Then watch your loins spill out your vest
You best get on some act your age shit
You a little kid
That run for faces
More niggas get killed like that

Mad man Sticky F-I-N-G-A-Z
The crazy cajun blazin' bullets for days and days
Grazin' amazin' I'm the glazin' ason purple hazin'
Hard to be pahsin' Lord with all this hell I'm raisin'
God of the Underground, I'm gunnin' 'em down with a thunder pound
We gonna shut 'em down
We turn shit dumb quick gun click
Lyin' in the vine
Pursed the line on your dick
In the morgue admit it dogs
I'm the Rottweiler my Glock holler
Fuck cocaine killer I sniff gun powder
So all you real willies throw your Roleys in the sky
And all the crooks rob the place outside
I'm so hype, I take your life, betta have my doe right
Fuck five mics, I don't need no mic!

Se encojona si se lo hecho afuera 
La segunda tiene la funda 
Y me paga pa' que se lo hunda 

La tercera me quita el estrés 
Polvos corridos, siempre echamos tres 
A la cuenta de una le bajo la luna 
Pero ella quiere con Maluma y conmigo a la vez 

Estoy enamorado de las cuatro 
Siempre las busco después de las cuatro 
A las cuatro les encanta en cuatro 
Y yo nunca fallo como el 24 

De los Lakers siempre es la gorras 
De chingar ninguna se enzorra 
Estoy metio en un lío, ya estoy confundio 
Porque ninguna de mi mente se borra 

Me pongo las gafas Cartier saliendo del aeropuerto 
Vestio de Osiris, zapatos en pie 
Tú tienes tú mi cuenta de banco y el número de la Master Card 
Tú eres mi mujer oficial 
Me tiene enamorado ese culote con ese pelo rubio 
Pero tengo otra pelinegra que siempre quiere chichar 

A veces hasta le llega al estudio 
La peliroja chichando es la más que se moja 
Le encojona que me llame y no lo coja 
Peleamos y me bota la ropa y tengo que llamar a cotorra pa' que la recoja 
Tengo una chiquitita nalgona con el pelo corto

Me tienen en un patín 
Comprando en San Valentín 
Ya me salieron más caras que un reloj de Ulysses Nardin 
Es que la babies están bunny ninguna las 4 se ha hecho completas 
Dos tienen maridos y ninguna de las dos al marido respetan 

Cuatro chimbitas 
Cuatro personalidades 
Dos me hablan bonito 
Dos dicen maldades 

Diferentes nacionalidades 
Pero cuando chingan gritan todas por iguales 
Quiere que la lleve pa' medallo 
Quiere que la monte en carros del año 
Que a una la coja 
A la otra la apriete 
Y a las otras 2 les dé juntas en el baño

Y de tu hechizo no puedo escapar (De La Ghetto)
Qué ganas tengo de buscarte
Y de volverte a besar
Por más que traten de alejarte
Baby, conmigo tú te vas (Tienes que ser valiente, baby)

Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar

Si pregunta dile que yo soy tu cuate, yeah

Botellas de champagne o copas de vino
Chanel, Louis Vuitton y Gucci o Valentino
Alexander McQueen o Moschino
Me gusta verte en cuatro, no apagues la luz
Hoy te voy a sacar el jugo como un Bubbaloo
Tu jevo está atrasao' parece un razer con bluetooth
Pues no te complace, eso lo dijiste tú (Ok, buenas noches a todos)

Quiero que conmigo te escapes
Y que con besos me mates
Que con caricias me maltrates (Imagínate)
El magnate, dentro de un yate
Y tú bailando empapada en chocolate
Dale baby, toma la decisión
Y sólo aprieta el botón (Valiente)
Tú sabes, el de la seducción (Quiero que te relajes)
Alto por ciento de pasión
Tráeme el aceite pal masaje y se fue la tensión
No tengas miedo, te toco porque puedo (Duro)
Algo me pasa cuando contigo me enredo (Algo bien loco)
Se chupa los dedos y yo no retrocedo

Te quiero comer, te va a encantar
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar

Damas y caballeros, La Maravilla
Si te escapas conmigo será otra historia
Momentos inolvidables en tu memoria
No hagas caso a comentarios ni a la escoria
Vuela conmigo, ven te invito a saborear la gloria
yeah, contigo me saque la lotto
Eres caliente, en tu mirada lo noto
Tu cuerpo es la nave
Y en este caso especial, yo vengo siendo el piloto, yeah
En el espacio de tu ser me quiero perder
Y aprender todos los secretos que esconde tu piel, yeah
Quisiera ver contigo un nuevo amanecer
No en la tierra si no en el aire a 30 mil pies
Atrévete, yo voy a ti, deja la timidez
Y vas a ver como de nuevo querrás otra vez
Asómate por la ventana y dime qué ves
Sólo nubes blancas y una vida sin estrés (Remix)

Ok, que tal si baby yo te busco en el europeo
Que tengo medio phillie ya en el cenicero
Relájate, que te acaricien lo' asiento' de cuero
Te hablo claro, tú sabes que yo te soy sincero
Te veo triste y también un poco perdida
Será por los problemas que has pasado en tu vida
Escápate conmigo, vacaciones extendidas
Pa' recorrer el mundo desde Egipto a Argentina
No quiero que esto vaya a terminar
Quiero que te quedes un poquito más
Tú eres algo que yo no puedo olvidar
Y contigo yo me vuelvo a escapar

Escápate conmigo esta noche bebé
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar (Señores, Noriel es peligroso)

Ya me cansé de pensarte en mi cama
Hoy voy a buscarte pa' matar las ganas
Tu cuerpo y tu alma me llama
Me tiran la mala porque la que no gana, siempre difama
Tú sabes cual es la meta
Yo soy el único que entiende to' lo que tu cuerpo interpreta
Vivimos jugando en una ruleta
Pero por ti lo dejo to' y me pongo a buscarte por to' el planeta
Yo estoy loco con tu foto y como si fuera poco
Sabes que de ti soy el piloto
Ni tú, ni yo tiene el corazón roto
No estamo' enamorados pero na' más quiere conmigo y no con otro (Almighty)

Llenaste a mi corazón
Porque antes era inútil como un iPhone 7 que no tiene chip
Quieren hundirme el barco en el que vamo' juntos
Y yo que soy un experto en el Battleship
Soy un player, tú eres mi championship
Quiero darte besos, 
quiero como darte todos los días, tenemos un partnership
Que nadie se meta más que dañe la relationship
Hoy me vestí de blanco, todo blanco pa' ti
Me bañé del perfume que te gusta
Escápate conmigo y quítate la ropa
Que desnudos vamos a grabar un feat

Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé

Una es colombiana
La otra es de RD
Las dos están ricas de cabeza a los pies
A las dos les tengo ganas
Pero no se puede
Hasta que no me decida
El problema aquí es que

Me enamoré de las dos
Quiero estar con las dos
Una me mata con la mirada
La otra con su voz
Me enamoré de las dos

Una me lo mama rico

Austin Baby
Y yo quiero estar con las dos a la vez (con las dos a la vez)
Vamos a intentarlo, no peleemos más (no, no)
Qué tal si nos vamos y vivimos los tres (vivimos los tres)
Mudémonos juntos, resolvemos y ya
Una tiene el booty grande
Y yo loco con ese culo
La traje importa de la Habana, cubana
Y le gusta sin disimulo
La otra es dominicana y fuma marihuana como campeona
Vive pendiente a mi phillie como si se fuera a morir la cabrona
Una me hace el desayuno
Y loca con su papi, lo lleva a la cama
La otra no cocina un carajo, pero es que me gusta cuando me lo mama
La menor tiene disciplina y va a la Universidad
La otra no hace un carajo, solo me chapea qué fatalidad

Yo no quiero soltar a ninguna
Por eso a las dos yo les bajé la luna
Una me lleva al cielo
La otra pa'l infierno
Pero pa' mí las dos juntas hacen una
A una la veo de noche, a la otra de día
Una se exhibe, la otra es escondía
Se hace la que no me conoce
Cuando todo su cuerpo ya me conocía
Una vive en paz y la otra en guerra
Entran a mi cuarto y no quieren salir
Les gustan decir las verdades
Pero les encanta mentir
Tal vez no sea lo correcto
Pero entre una y la otra, cubren sus defectos
Si estar con las dos es la causa, pues que se joda yo aguanto el efecto

Si una te da problemas
Imagínate tú tener dos
Y es que ahí está el problema
Que yo quiero estar con las dos
Y yo, no quiero soltar a ninguna
Porque las dos lo hacen cabrón
Son diferentes en la cama chingando
Y por eso es que yo

Me enamoré de las dos
Quiero estar con las dos
Una me mata con la mirada
La otra con su voz
Me enamoré de las dos

Que te encanta cada vez que lo hacemos 
Y aunque tú y yo no nos queremos, lo vamos a fingir
Yo sé que quieres una noche como la de anoche 
Y la cierro con broche, vístete de Dolce que paso en la Porsche

En ti no confío, pero te lo quiero 
Meter hasta que no me queden más ganas y mi alma se vaya pal' cielo
A ti te encanta que te mienta 
Esa carita de diabla me tienta
Si el día tiene 24 horas, yo contigo quiero chingar 30

La confianza se gana, tú nunca ganaste pero me encantas en la cama 
No sé si me muera mañana pero antes de morirme yo se que tú vuelves y me llamas 
Por más que te pinte de sana, sé que por dentro estás llena de maldad
El que vive en la mentira, tarde o temprano se muere en la realidad

Yo en ti no confío bebé
Pero me encanta cuando lo hacemos
Vamo' a hacerlo toda la noche fingiendo que nos queremos 
Di todo lo que quieras de mí

Lo tiro pal' mar, solito se ahoga

Mejor que cuadre los chavos completos o voy a prenderte en la cara el juguete

Alone where we have walked together

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

'Ere we are for a photograph

Took a trip to Gretna Green
There's always been a photographer

When man was in his prime
And what went on we only know
From the snaps he took at the time
When Adam and Eve in their birthday suit
Decided to get wed

The man with the cam'ra said

As he floated through the air

Including Anne Boleyn
And he kept an album of their lives

As 'er 'ead rolled off the block

And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

And every stop that we made

Then I really felt blue

Looked at the track

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

It's taken me some time to work out what to do
I weighed the whole thing up before I came to you
I have no thought at all about my own reward
I really didn't come here of my own accord

Just don't say I'm
Damned for all time

I came because I had to, I'm the one who saw
Jesus can't control them like he did before!
And furthermore, I know that Jesus thinks so, too
Jesus wouldn't mind that I was here with you
I have no thought at all about my own reward

Damned for all time

Annas, you're a friend, a worldly man and wise
Caiaphas, my friend, I know you symphathise
Why are we the prophets? Why am I the one
Who see the sad solution, know what must be done?
I have no thought at all about my own reward
I really didn't come here of my own accord

Just don't say I'm damned
For all time

Cut the protesting, forget the excuses
We want information, get up off the floor

We have the papers we need to arrest him
You know his movements, we know the law

Your help in this matter won't go unrewarded

We'll pay you in silver, cash on the nail
We just need to know where the soldiers can find him

With no crowd around him

Then we can't fail

I don't want your blood money

Oh, that doesn't matter, our expenses are good

I don't need your blood money

But you might as well take it, we think that you should

Think of the things you can do with that money
Choose any charity, give to the poor
We've noted your motives, we've noted your feelings
This isn't blood money, it's a fee, nothing
Fee, nothing fee, nothing more

If Jesus came to your house to spend a day or two
If he came unexpectedly I wonder what you'd do
When you saw him comin' would you meet him at the door
With arms outstretched and welcome to your heavenly visitor

Or would you need to change some things before you'd let him in
Like to burn some magazines and put the Bible where they'd been
Oh I know you'd give your nicest room to such an honered guest
And all the food you'd serve to him would be the very best
But what about your family conversation would it keep up its normal pace

And would you find it hard each meal to say a table grace
Would you be glad to have him meet your very closest friends
Or hope that maybe they'd stay away until his visit ends
Would you be glad to have him stay forever on and on

Or sigh of great relief when finally he'd gone

We'd both be sorry if I did go home to your wife and your kids

We were poor but we had love that's the one thing that daddy made sure of

Mommy rocked the babies at night and read the Bible by the coal oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a wash board everday
Well I've seen her fingers bleed to complain there was no need
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way

In the summer time we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From the mail order catalog money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere

Yeah I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter I remember well the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard at night we'd sleep cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leavin' Butcher Holler

A girl who's life you filled with love as if a heaven's planned

You're so heavenly heavenly being loved by you makes this world heaven to me
I hear church bells ring I hear angels sing
When you're with me cause you're so heavenly

I didn't thing I'd do but now I know I can
Forget the loneliness that I'd knew and be a happy woman
Heaven blessed me with your love and made my life complete
The world is better place to live when true love is so sweet

Being loved by you is so heavenly",Heavenly,1971
Norma Jean,"I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes
When you take you got to give so live and let live or let go
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover so you better think it over
If sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter but what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes

I never promised you a rose garden
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
Look before you leap still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out

Norma Jean,"A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labor camp
Stands out in this memory I revive
Cause my daddy raised a family there with two hard working hands
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes
He dreamed of something better and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just too young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted but it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try

She only wanted things she really needed
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size
Just a little loss of courage as their age began to show
And more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted...
I still recall my mama's hungry eyes",Hungry Eyes,1972

I wish I was a Teddy Bear and I'm wishin' I hadn't fallen in love with you

I wish I had a wooden heart and a sawdust smile
Then your mem'ry wouldn't come around hurtin' all the time
I'd have a sewed on smile and a painted twinkle in my eye
And I never would've ever had to learn how to cry
I wish I was a Teddy Bear not livin' nor lovin' or goin' nowhere...

I wish I had a string you'd pull to make me say hi I'm Teddy ain't it a lovely day
Then I'd know everytime I spoke the words were right

I'm just looking for a dream that I can share
I'm sinking fast but no one hears my SOS I'm just pursuing happiness

Almost everyone I know has someone to worry
Someone to cheer them when they're low
So if I walk by you in too big a hurry it's because I got no place to go

I found the shirt he'd worn when he held me in his arms for the very last time
The shirt I knew that he'd never wear again
As I took it from the rack all my dreams came racin' back
The faint perfume of sweet love filled the night
I could see his face again he kissed my lips as then
And I almost felt his arms around me tight
A shirt that even the Gods must envy
For its arms once encircled the dream that only heaven can bring
Inside this shirt had beaten the most wonderful heart in the whole wide world
And forever each thread shall remind me of him
I turned down a rolled up sleeve and I scaresly could believe
When I looked and saw a strand of my own hair
It was clinging like a vine to the shirt he left behind
As if to let him know that I still care
I walked to the window sill and my eyes began to fill
And I thought I heard the soft wind call his name
And the shirt across my arm grew strangely soft and warm
As if I'd reached and held it to a flame
And there I stood hearing only the beat of my own aching heart
Lost in the dreams that might have been
And the shirt seemed as sorrowful as I and just as empty body and soul",The Shirt,2000

Don't speak.
You nailed down all your words on me and it felt like a blind guide.
Leading me into quicksand.
So fight fair, fight fair.
Not all you hear is noise.
Fight fair, fight fair!
I've earthed this seed so many times.
Deeply held in this skin of bark.
Branches made of ash and forests born aflame.
Restless and full of poison.
Shattered by a sea of dialogue.
Rabid speech, like dogs with teeth.
Words like a beggar.
That don't speak.
Crouched and bent out of shape.
Rip this tongue out by the root.
Shake the walls of this pale grave.
A blaze, a blaze is set upon the hills.
An open grave from which a great forest will rise, the fire collapses.
The corpses I've made.
This should not be.
Oh, how we curse.
The tongue is a flame.
Let there be grace.

We are smashed men, still moving
We tried everything in the book
No stranger to failure
Death with a steady heartbeat

Scratching into any surface it wants
Joy and beauty rejected so many times
A world of hurt, a heart of false hope

And while we thought
That we were learning how to live
We have been learning how to die
I should have known, we will be legends

Our homes and dreams
And our worst nightmares
Our worst nightmares have now come true

Tonight when this detain falls on men
Driven by an instinct more powerful than life itself
From horror to hope
From hope to devastation

And while we thought
That we were learning how to live
We have been learning how to die
I should have known, we will be legends

Overfed and concerned
It came with taste and claw
Oh, hated form of emotion

O God loves a drunk, come raise up your glasses, amen

Does God really care for your life in the suburbs?
Your dull little life full of dull little things
And bring up the babies to be just like daddy
And maybe I'll be there when he gives out the wings

But God loves a drunk, although he's a fool
Oh he wets in his pants and he falls off his stool
And he can't hear the insults, and whispers go by him
As he leans in the doorway and he sings sally racket
He can't feel the cold rain beat down on his body
And soak through his clothes to the skin
O God loves a drunk, come raise up your glasses, amen

Will there be any pen-pushers up there in heaven?
Does crawling and wage-slaving win you God's love?
I pity you worms with your semis and pensions

Oh you can't help but laugh as he gags and falls down
But he don't give a curse for what people think of him

I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more!
More more more more!

I thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.
To him!
To him!",See,1994

Norma Winstone,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Norma Winstone,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

And laughed before, and loved before

God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Norman Blake,"Lord I been hangin' out of town in that low down rain
Watchin' good time Charlie friend is drivin' me insane
Down on shady Charlotte Street the green lights look red
Wish I was back home on the farm in my feather bed

Get myself a rockin' chair
To see if I can lose
Them thin dime hard times
Hell on Church Street blues

Found myself a paper friend who's read yesterday's news
Folded up page twenty-one and stuck it in my shoe
Gave a nickel to the poor my good turn for the day
Folded up my old billfold threw it far away

Lord I wish I had some guitar strings Old Black Diamond brand
I'd string up this old Martin box and go and join some band

Norman Blake,"Can you tell me what happened to the blossom
Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy 
Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush 

When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom 
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow 
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses 
And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow 
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon 
Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush 
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush  

I was picking berries when that crow flew above me 
Carrying my lover so far away 
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom 
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay 
The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard 
With weeds growing over in the old graveyard 
And the day settles down to an evening hush  
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush",Blackberry Blossom,1990
Norman Blake,"I've traveled over this country wide seeking fortune fair
Up and down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere
From Portland East to Portland West back along the line
I'm going now to the place that's best that old hometown of mine

Chorus  Eight more miles and Louisville will come into my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the hometown of my heart

 

There's bound to be a gal somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a traveling through the land
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand


Chorus


Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam
The place that's right for that love sight is in those bluegrass hills
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville

Norman Blake,"Oh it's raining, raining, raining here this morning 
As I sit in jail and hang my head in shame 
With a smile I try to greet each early dawning
But they've given me a number for my name 

Many a little raindrops are falling close to me 
Makes the streams and rivers just as muddy as can be 
It's raining, raining, raining here this morning 
As the Mississippi flows on to the sea 

How I wish that I could see my little darling 
And hold her in my arms just as before 
I used to tell her every day I loved her 
But now she doesn't love me anymore 

She knew that I was guiltless of this one crime 
And said that she'd be waiting there for me 
But she has found somewhere else to wander 
Where the Mississippi flows on to the sea 

Its raining, raining, raining here this morning 
And I am just as weary as can be 
I wish that I could follow all the raindrops 
Down the Mississippi toward the silver sea 

But there's no way to prove that I'm not guilty 
So I will have to suffer all the shame 
Go and tell her for me little raindrops 
That they've given me a number for my name

",It's Raining Here This Morning,1990
Norman Blake,"Twilight falls, 
Evening shadows find,
There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine.

The moon on high seemed to see her there,
In her eyes was a light shining ever so bright,
As she whisper'd a silent pray'r.

Ev'ry word revealed an empty, broken heart;
Broken by fate that holds them so far apart.

Lonely there she kneels, and tells the stars above,
In her arms he belongs, then her pray'r is a song,
Her unending song of love.",A Maiden's Prayer,1999
Norman Blake,"Here upon the quiet country village stood the maple on the hill
There I sat with my Jeannie of long ago
When the stars were shining brightly we could hear the whippoorwill
As we sat beneath the maple on the hill
We would sing love songs together when the birds had gone to rest
And we'd listened to the murmur of the leaves
Then you throwed your arms around me laid your head upon my chest
As we sat beneath the maple on the hill
[ piano ]
Now we're getting old and feeble and our hair is turning grey
We no longer hear the rippling of the leaves
Still I always love you darling as I did those stary nights
When we sat beneath the maple on the hill
Don't forget me little darling as they lay me down to rest
Will you keep this final promise that you gave
While you linger there in silence thinking only of the past
May your teardrops kiss the flowers on my grave
Even now i hear the angels coming o'er the hill
So goodbye my little darling, yes the time has come to part
I must leave you and the maple on the hill
",The Maple on the Hill,1999
Norman Blake,"One evening as the sun went down
And the jungle fire  was burning,
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
And he said, ""Boys, I'm not turning
I'm headed for a land that's far away
Besides the crystal fountains
So come with me, we'll go and see
The Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
There's a land that's fair and bright,
Where the handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night
Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
On the birds and the bees
And the cigarette trees
The lemonade springs
Where the bluebird sings
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
All the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
And the barns are full of hay
Oh I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the rain don't fall
The wind don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
You never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol
Come trickling down the rocks
The brakemen have to tip their hats
And the railroad bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And of whiskey, too
You can paddle all around 'em
In a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
The jails are made of tin
And you can walk right out again,
As soon as you are in
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws or picks,
I'ma goin' to stay
Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the Turk
That invented work

I'll see you all this coming Fall

So won't you come back and make me happy

once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

Don't you know that the blood in your vein is as lifeless as yesterday's rain?
It's a game where we come to conceal the confusion we feel
But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless
You cried when we kissedIt was nothing but shadow and mist
Two illusions who touch in a trancemaking love not by choice but by chance
To a theme that we tore from the past to a tango we swore was the last
We are shadows who dance
We don't exist
We are nothing but shadow and mist
In the mirror we look as we pass
No reflection's revealed in the glass

I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see

Your touch pours like honey on my skin, smooth it lingers
You, the cure the 'cause, of my blues
My only flaw

Your sea it can freezing, I thought I'd float
I sink deeper blue, by you I'm consumed
Oh I'm such a fool thinking I won't get caught in your downhill flow
Swept away, what good is a beautiful day, I'm alone
And you, the cure and the 'cause of my blues

You keep needing, keep calling
The cure and the cause
You keep needing, keep calling
The cure and the cause
You keep needing, keep calling
Even from a shut door
You step from view
Can still see you, your shadow tells me more

Don't take your love away, your love away

And you, the cure and the cause
Of my blues
My only flaw

Don't take your love away, your love away

Cure me, cure me
Cure me, please cure me

Just a few things before I head on my way

Norman Doray,"Man, women, boy, women, girl
Women without a man is nothing
Without her, man is nothing
Women have their faults
Men only have two
Everything they say and everything they do
Men who have pierced ears are better prepared for marriage
They've experienced pain
And have bought jewelry
Women have two weapons
Cosmetics and tears
I'm a perfect house keeper
Every time I leave a man I keep his house
No women has ever hated a man
Enough to give him back his diamonds
Why don't women blink during foreplay?
They don't have time
Man, women, boy, women, girl
Men forget everything
Women remember everything
A girl can wait for the right man to come along
But it doesn't stop her from having fun
With all the wrong ones in the mean time
The real reason why it's so difficult to find men
Who are sensitive, caring and good looking?
Is because they all have boyfriends already
A successful man is one who makes more money
Than his wife can spend
A successful women is one who can find such a man
Man, women, boy, women, girl
Women driver really means
Someone who doesn't speed, tailgates
Swear, make obscene gestures
And has a better driving record than men have
It's a guy thing really means
Irrational, illogical, stupid and extremely low
Oh don't fuss I just cut myself, it's no big deal
Really means I'm about to die but before I die
I want you to remember me as a strong proud man
Who never cries
Man, women, boy, women, girl
If you want to learn more about women
Watch 'Sex in the City'
If you want to learn more about men
Take a good look at Homer Simpson
The difference between light and hard
Is that men can sleep all night with a light on",Reach [Yin Yang Dub],2011

Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Norman Faye,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
And as I go my way alone,
I find it hard for me to carry on.
I need your strength, 
I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
From this old world I try to hide my face,
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place.
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell,
in darkness with memories I know so well.
 
I need your love more than before,
I can hardly carry on anymore.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe, 
without you babe,without you babe,
My mind and soul have felt like this,
Since love between us no more exist.
And each time that darkness falls,
if finds me alone with these four walls.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.

That's the time the festive chink starts to wink his other eye, 
Starts to wink his dreamy eye, lazily you'll hear him sigh.

See that broken wall street sport, still thinks he's a millionaire. 
Still thinks he's a millionaire, pipe dreams banish every care.

Where the lights are low,

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

Her only answer is one little smile,
