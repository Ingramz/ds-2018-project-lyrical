Soopa Fly,"You know it ain't over
I said it back in '82
I'll be a player for life
I'll never say I do

I done tramped bitches
That most niggaz would marry
I like to pimp bitches and
Most niggaz be scary

Get a bad bitch
And you can't say no
You're at the mall buyin shit you can't pay for
Then you wonder why all these hoes want to switch

Best friend on the under
Fuckin' your bitch
Pussy you ain't cared 'bout that when you had her
But now you wonder where she's at

I know your heart broke
But it don't show
'Cause all I heard from your mouth
Was ""fuck that ho.""

But deep down inside I know it hurts a lot
I know you can't go on but it's worse to stop
You daydreamin 'bout your x, tryin to figure what's next
Other females can't compare to her sex

I'm tryin' to picture me, all in love with these hoes
But when I meet 'em, they just want to lick my balls
You can't tell me shit, fuck that
You're just another fine ass bitch with nut breath

I met you on friday, I fucked you on saturday
I can't hold back bitch I'm still rollin' that way
Carry you across the threshold in my new house?
You better try to stick this big dick in your mouth, bitch",You Might Get G'eed,1999

Live in the place to be
Soopafly, comin at ya
I don't stop and I don't quit
Comin with that dogg pound gangsta shit
Yea, peep game
Check, I break a nigga neck
I keep a nine in my pocket and a home deck
I like to rock a show
I'm stackin see-notes
It's soopafly mothafucka if you didn't know
Now peep so sweet unique I doubt if you could top the peak
Keep em in check
No sweat cock back fist connected to cheek
They sleep
Kick em in they ass wake up, uh now
Let me take you on a journey block to block
Show you how to pack heat, drop and 6 4 hop
Cut it up, chop, my homie got it, Tray don't stop
Had them bitches dope fiending like I'm slangin them rocks
Straight from the L we don't take no shit
We off in the cut waitin for y'all niggas to trip
We the last mothafuckas you want to fuck with
When you in close range you best to duck quick
Or get smashed your last chance to forfeit
Game over
I knock a nigga from drunk to sober
I hope I don't have to maneuver the choker
If you want to dance I do the polka
Stickin fuck bitch made Soop look like a switchblade

Can I ride in your car?
Girl I've gone too far
Can I smoke on your weed?
Nah, that ain't what you need
Can I borrow a dollar?
No, but you can eat this dick
While I smash my shit and I pop in my car
Can I give you my number?
Yea, next summer
But I'm hungry baby
Sh, me too, that's crazy
So open up the door 'cause I'm ready to go
Aight then, but I ain't got no money
Ain't you treatin baby?
Hell no
Bitch take another route, you ain't even what this song's about
Bitch, I'm on a ride, dip and glidin through the hood
Smokin until the sun come out

Bitch please
Got her speakin in Chinese
They like please
Yea, just pluck em off
Mothafuck all you hoes
Fuck em all
This is nothing but true game
This stainless thing got stained
The bitch gobble the best 
She won a contest for the best jaws in the west
The homie said, ""Watch my head""
But instead, I got a 45 caliber lead spitta
A nigga feelin bitter
Shitty as some kitty litter
Take off, got a Adolf Hitler
Center of attraction
Multiplications then subtractions
From the blast then the smash and the cash and the credit
The bitch on my dick
I'm like bitch, forget it
Let it loose bitch, won't you let it
For ????? I get a bad bitch from Connecticut
A typical hoe
I'm only in it for the blow
The bitch was only in it for the blow
I gave her some blow then let her blow
Then she turned blue
On the speed I grabbed the heater and then flew

Can I ride in your car?
Bitch I'm gone too far
Can I smoke on your weed?
Nah, this ain't what you need
Can I borrow a dollar?
Nah, but you can eat this dick
While I dip in my shit and uh, pop my cop off
Can I give you my number?
Nah, maybe next summer
But I'm hungry baby
Yea, me too, that's crazy
So open up the door 'cause I'm ready to go
Aight, but uh, I ain't got no money
Ain't you treatin baby?
Hell no
Bitch take another route, you ain't even what this song is about
I'm on a ride, dip and glidin through the hood
Smokin until the sun come out

Now all salute the supreme general that got style
And watch how I rock and lock the block down
Tightly to fight me will cause disaster
No chance to surpass the vocab I master
As the sun rotate, took my guns off safe
Been a thug since 8, always drug my weight
I state the facts, mothafuck a platinum plaque
Always got my stack jackin off from havin a sack
Niggas act as if they back is stiff and can't put work in
Shake the turf then get to tuckin they shirts in
But I'ma stay bangin
The game that I'm claimin
Gold chain swangin
While the six trey hangin
Back bumpa
Impact the dumpa in the stash spot mash out
Knock it locked up with the ass drop

Can I ride in your car?
Bitch I'm gone too far
Can I smoke on your weed?
Nah, this ain't what you need
Can I borrow a dollar?see
Nah, but you can eat this dick
While I dip in my shit and uh, pop my cop off
Can I give you my number?
Get at me next summer
But I'm hungry baby
Yea, me too, that's crazy
So open up the door 'cause I'm ready to go
Aight, but I ain't got no money
Ain't you treatin baby?
Hell no
Bitch take another route, you ain't even what this song is about

[Jayo Felony]
I had so much beef I should've fucked in my colon
But I sent them off deprived, with both their fucking eyes swollen 
Everything stolen, and it still risked rolling
niggas can't see me cause I kill shit blowing
I let loose like ain't no tomorrow with bomb beats 
A K 47 street
Quick to get ya, my lyrics like missiles to hit Hitler
Mother fucker stay up out my cool-Aid pitcher
You don't want to see my style like click click pow 
Make you bow to my wicked style, make you my child
The enemy want to diss nigga but how could he?
With hookers and hoodies with a bag full of goodies (what what what what?)
What?  Now take that for what it's worth
I terrorize your territory and take over your turf
All these niggas is rob, but they was soft as a nerf
Nasty as after birth they say ooh after the verse

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm commercial, universal with no rehearsal
And when I'm in the hood I'm just so controversial
niggas know me homey, the O G
West Coast Don I smash on anyone

I move the dubs and let D move the 2 1's

So to kick a style you gotta kick me down
Every nigga from the pound getting paid now
Hey now, big bow wow honey child

All my niggas get	(Gangster With It!!!)
Tick tock		(Crip Walk)
And prepare to get ill when the gangsters talk (hey hey)
Sagging and flagging with the 7 tray rag
Smoking like a dragon with the 4 - 4 cannon

Soopafly,"Ruff rugged tha incredible one,  Soopafly come wit tha bomb
A pound to brake a muthafucka down
Surrounded, by subliminal thoughts to keep me criminal minded
You'll find its hard fuckin' wit a dog that'll scar 
Your whole mind body soul approach 
Devastated, elevated your shit never made it
However can one dare to compare a style rare from ground, to air above
Showin' no love, now it's tha pimpin' flow
Interests show, that you ain't hittin' no mo
Your shit's gettin' old,  forget tha past
Don't let tha past pave a way to tha world
Occupied by MCs that I slay
Affect tha first when I select a verse
To hit you with tha worse intention
Blast in three dimension, sharp like a Ginsu
Then you will understand that I split niggas to fragments of a man
Differential from pots to pans, opposition at a glance
I rate,  and takin' chances quick to brake like branches
I'm like a banchy on a midnight get right or get even
You're Wondering like Steven running from day light to evening
Time, 'cause I bust shots to injure 
I stay black and smooth like a ninja
It's Soopafly quick to throw them thangs 
I get tha money and rings,  muthafuckaz can't hang 'cause

[Chorus]
I don't hang with no bustas
I don't hang with no fags
I don't hang with no connivin' ass niggas who ain't out
There makin' cash
Sho nuff don't hang with no snitches
Sho nuff don't fuck with no bitches
I'm only out for my riches
So muthafuckaz stay tha fuck out my business

I'm unexplanatory like Rogaine
What's your name was mine?
Soopafly game do or die
Death becomes those who oppose and run up
Muthafuckaz get done up, on a one two come up (come up)
Evidently you've been bitin for years
All skills to adapt to (nigga I'll pimp slap you)
My rhyme trap you, attractin bitches and hoes
Then developin tha 51 flows
I suppose, I got you runnin' like your nose
Like threat,  shot, to my niggas that can't get wet
Betcha, I spoke a lecture
I let cha think everythin's fine
Then react inna blinks time
Over-done, I'm rated number one contender
Tha war zone engage or surrender
Now if tha kicks fit nigga wear that shit
Give me a stage and microphone I'm bound to tear that shit
Tha fuck up,  now what cha gon do?
Take a seat,  or step to my mystic well then pack tha concrete
Now how you gonna act? I'll lay your ass flat
It's Soopafly comin' with tha shit like that (like that like that)

""I gots to have it,  'cause I want it,  and I need it"" 
""I gots to have it,  'cause I want it,  and I need it"" 

Now only I control thee unfold thee 
Uncut and uncensored floatin vinta, it's ah 
Sort of like a mixture, can you picture
One calm and cool one that burn like the sun
The one two two to three
Soopafly rolls freely (freely)
High to the sky, muthafuckas can't see me (see me) 
I'm skulls like a beanie (beanie)
I'm disappearin' like a genie (genie)
Intoxicated off tha Remy (Remy)
Martin I'm startin' to box up fools by tha carton
It's tha one, incredible fly
I fly by day, droppin' bombs on thee E.P. 
With Dat Nigga Daz still representin' D.P.

Waitin' baitin' for my ass to flip flop but I don't flop

Soopafly,"Verse 1:

It's been a while since I seen you smile
It's been a minute since I been up in it
But who can say, the sky's the limit
I seen a pretty bad woman, made me stop and pivot
Body, hair, face, nails lookin' so exqusite
Now what is it
That a pimp who never sent the key tip to the game
Now when I jump skip, a you could find me

""I am the one, blazin'
Stayin' high, Soopafly is so amazin'
I'm your baby
The penny a what the gold weighs in
Pimpin' from black, white, Puerto Rican, and asian""

Now welcome back, now wave yor hands if your feeling that
Gettin' down, smoking a pound with the mini stack
Back up, I creep up on them till they crack up
Take my time, movin' in slow but never slack up
Baby was serving me but couldn't keep the knack up
Upset cause she was drinkin' all my yack up

""Like splittin' a blunt, for you a what you want
Women don't have to front, I bid from once a month""

Three times a find ??? with Ginuwine ability to keep it coming
Now when your butt's running I'll be there to get ya (ahhh)
I play like Kodak and get the picture
I'm all down for stickin' but I can't kick it with ya
So what's poppin', you walkin', or the boots knockin'
Yeah I hear you talking girl, but I'm only down for one option

Hook:

We can fuck around a little, gettin' down a little, roll around the town a 
little
Or we can fuck around a lot, let me hit the spot, tell me if you like it or 
not
repeat
La la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la
repeat

Verse 2:

I stepped in the club lookin' dippa dap
Soopafly the pimp rapper, unique with heat like the gun clapper
Comin' out the cut, from the root, and done with laughter
Quite exquisite, I make the ladies come and pay a visit

""What is it you need, baby the weed
Baby got enough to carry the feed, baby now take heed baby""

I fuck around with top notch, top ho's
Ho's with top clothes, money hungry now stop ho
Just because I walk in the club don't mean I'm spending a dub on you
This money's mine, think I'm actin' funny fine
I can lay back and sip the wine
She's down, you can tell her for real, I work for mine
You confused

""What can't you find, feelin' past your prime ??? your time away
Given the time of day""

Whoever can display the sweet smooth array
Soopafly will never pay, make 'em say hey hey hey
Get enhanced, to get to know me you take a chance
Tree by my top, leave or

""We can fuck around for a minute or two""
To get with you is like I'm
""feelin' it, dealin' it""
And later on I'm
""killin' it""

Baby told me her clit was like ice so let me chill on it
Hit that ass until it was blue, had her crip walkin'
Knocked her ass out no doubt, no more shit talkin
Who can deny that Soopafly was at your door knockin'

""Let me in""

You can even invite your friends, but this shit costs baby (costs baby)
Don't get lost baby (don't get lost baby)
I'm only here for the cash it's not for you
I want to keep it true, like a nigga supposed to do

Hook

Verse 3:

Now would the game be different or the same
If I surcame the temptation to play a ho
Kick it in to lay a ho
What that for, hell motherfuckin' no
Give them money that's mine, hell motherfuckin' no
Ho gotta pay me to play it, let alone lay it
Just because I'm runnin' this town you picked the wrong mayor
Couldn't even get me to pitch in on a telly
Askin' from me, ha ha I broke her down like R. Kelly
 I said, no no no no no no no, no no no no no no no (everybody)
no no no no no no no, no no no no no no no
Not even cheeseburgers
no
Didn't know that Soopafly can sing, shinin' like these diamond rings
Who keeps bringing the heat
Who dropped her off in the street
Who rock it unique
Who popped the soft in the freak
Whoever it be

""Livin' in the world  ??? probably""

It's definitely livin' the dream, definitely you could check the means
Why I don't pay
ain't no limit to tellin what Soopafly might say (might say)

Fuck a mask, you bustas duck when I blast
I take the cash, and put a cap up in that ass

And if ya run up on that man trynna do-low
That's when he, pull out his homey, who, you know
Man I been through so much and I'm still goin' through it
But fuck all that, I got ta stay into it

But now's I gots ta represent for me and my Doggs

Yeah, '94, became a D-O, double-G, P-O, U-N-D, Gangsta
Now you can see me smokin' dank in neighborhood, pranksta'

When I'm in front, they watch behind me
Mission: Crush, ready to bust, grab the Tom-my
Gun, keep one, I role with the heat-seeka's
Stash the gauge, pass the .9 to my nee-ga [nigga]

We give it to why'all, us niggaz give fuck naw
It's like everyday, I greet my niggaz with a grin
They pull out the dice, starting grinnin and shake it twice
But I don't gamble, I pull a bitch like a door handle
Let that bitch leave nothing but toe sandals
and a map, it's like that
I ain't payin nothing until she bring they pipe back
It's like twice that, my niggaz fell to semm they like that
Fuck rap, fuck a around and you get snatched
What a tight match, and Tray Dee, Soo' and Style
When I say tight, they ""Ha"" like Juvenile

[Lil see Style]
Bust a regal, livin life illegal
time to say whut up to all my people (Whut Up, Whut Up)
Eastsidin, did my first crime with an automatic nine
And every since then I known about to grind
Tryin to rap, and slang at the same time
That was then, and look at me now
Ballin like a motherfucka, puttin it down

With a limp from the limp of my clip
Plus this heavyweight peace with all the diamonds that drip
Bitch, you best recongnize how we ball day
All day every day, ain't no playin a tray
I'm like an ace of space, I bust I'm doin too much
Catch her in traffic I'm scoopin her up
Jumpin out the white with the park lights on
High as a kite, shootin dice all night long
I stay hustlin and mustlin to keep my effect
Smoke a quarter or a half, fuck a cheap dime sack
I'm livin to the limt or don't live it all, get it and ball
Nigga look at me and my doggz

Today I'm better than I was yesterday with this 
Don't test touch my fast hand draw
If my strap is in the car, I'm going bomb to the shore
We the number one supporters, drugs, gang love
Smoke the weed, throwing up gang signs, we gangstas
Got to love, got to thugged it up for our mouth
I be on this every single day, no doubt
See me, I'm worth about 450 and ounce
I drop sixteen bars, and go buy me a car
I'm just an local universal with my vocal
Put the hip hop fan base in a choke hold 
My gang Dogg Pound, a gang of gangstas and entertainers
Sign an autograph, bangin, and we rich and we famous

Unlike any other record label, we plan to get green
And keep it clean and stay oh, so mean
So rough, so tough

What is it? This for them, suckas
Nigga, I came from a long line of playas
That ain't scared of nar' one of y'all, motherfuckers
I see these niggas wanna see me catch a case and get struck out
But I'm laughin' 'bout to knock they ass the fuck out

Bitch, quit actin' like a stuck up clown
That's why yo raggety ass attitude is fucked up now
Suga Free, bitch swingin' on my dick sayin', wee
The pimpin' is crackin' so I feel like mackin' tonight
(Aight)

Now them seventy niggas? Thirty gon' hate us
That's why I play the role, keep control
And throw them off wit' these dirty gators
See time was torn

'cause if I bought me somethin' to eat, shit
I bought you somethin' too, what's mine is yours
But now you'd rather bring me down and see me fall
Walkin' wit my head down, straight, dependin' on y'all

The call me Honcho, I like to sparkle
I'm 'bout to barbecue a bitch like the charcoal
Am I a star? No, ya' in my car? No
My name is Soopafly, bitch so ya' all know

Now heffer don't act stupid, 'cause ya'know who I am
The nigga quick to talk shit and don't give a damn
I tell that hoe run, man that hoe better scram
I pimp across the land, better read ya' motherfuckin' press telegram

Snoop Dogg told me that
Now blow me back while I'm pimpin' on this funky track
Bang ES, we givin' it up, got the bitches singin' the rest
We blastin' motherfuckers, run up and come test

Better, hide yo chest and fasten yo vest
No bullshit, take yo bitches so quick and so fast
(So fast)
Fuck wit' us, I'll put a foot up yo ass

Collect calls from the pen so I catch it in the kitchen
The homie say, send him naked pictures of bitches
And if they talkin' backwards, he'll have a homie's jack up
That nigga fucked Pat up, fuck havin' a homies tack up

We slap hoes that step on toes of our dada's
And ask them niggas in the Source Awards
When I caught them while y'all was pacin', the homies
Was bringin' up situations, eliminating fake niggas while I'm paper chasin'

Dippin', hittin' switches bouncin' over ditches

Trap or dap and clap niggas, I'm young gottstra

For shizzle my nigga Kurizzle was nizzle my nigga
Like a bitch or a busta, bust a, four fizzle
Surface the air miss wit a homie, wait for the whistle

And separate them by five's and light up the skies

But I'ma tell 'em Lil' Goldie don't play, nigga

Yeah, it's the genius of the click
Known to sleep a nigga quick
So watch how ya' gums bump speakin' on the wrist
I drew the diagram how to mash the game
Never hesitated when it came to blasting thangs

From the knuckle shoes buckle when we lock and strap
I'm a real rider nigga you can drop the act
I got stripes and bars from a life at war
Twice as hard, as niggas claim they sheisty y'all

Criminal, lay 'em down for their stacks and sacks
For the mic, used to trife with the mass and gats
Do or die to survive from my time of birth
Then I'm out for gettin' mine till I ride the hearse

Ain't know body I know checkin for you

It's a million and one ways to what people say
They gone say what they say but they fail to display
Where I went wrong, can't I do right
In the city I face snitches, with no britches
Quick to judge and hold a grudge
and all this time I showed them love

Like this (yeah, it's so easy to do)
Grab a honey, take her to the floor and do it just like this
(You can do it, you can do it just just like this)
You don't have to break it down to the floor (c'mon, yeah)
All you gotta do is keep moving your hands like this
(Like this, you do can do it, you can do it too)
Like this (c'mon, you can do it, you can do it too)
I feel player when I move and dancing to the song
All I wanna do is get my groove on like this

I throw my hands like Marvin
Sorta like James Brown how I ""Get Down""
I'm holding my chain so it don't swing
I'm sliding my feet, staying on the beat
I dip low then bring it back slow
If you didn't wanna dance, why you on the flo'?

Damani's on the go and Mr. Lucc on the catch-up
Soopa Doopa behind, and baby this a set-up
Two-step with me, call your girls
I got two ref's with me, they call the game quickly
Big boy smooth, I'm too cool for the runway
Playa of the year, my gear's set for Sunday

Wait right here girl I'm coming back Monday
Slide right in front of me
Get our dance on, Fred Astaire, Faye Dunaway
Eyes on us while we move to the clap
I'm nice with the dance and I'm smooth with the rap
We in the zone with the lights and glamor
Glass full of Patron, the code is grammar

Coat made of panther, excuse me miss
Let me show you how to do it

Like this (like this, it's easy to do)

Bigg Snoop Dogg, king of the coast, bitch
Walk with me, stay focused
Put it on me little mama, let me see you stroke this
It seems like, the mo' hits
On a slow drift, bubble like a fo'-fifth
And everybody everybody notice
So to cool cool Calvin Broadus
And every woman is a goddess
And every rapper is a artist
Yeah right, you're dead wrong, just sing along
It's Godzilla for reala my nigga, King Kong
Giving niggas the blues
As I'm walking on these fools in my blue suede tennis shoes
I'm two-stepping with my weapon close
On the dance flo' loc, cause you never know
Yeah baby girl, she's strapped, but she cool
'Cause we ain't come, to act no motherfucking fool
We just chilling like a villain, got my hands to the ceiling
And I'm feeling the feeling, come feeling like this

Soopafly,"Ha, ha

Don't worry about a thing cause my niggas goin' do it all just like that

[Chorus:Repeat x3]
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Ahhh, bend over, bend over

Indeed I am
Flossy like gangsta shit
I got pounds of weed and keys
Sittin' on G's
Catch a breeze
When I ride by high
Sittin' on Tonas 
Tearing up spots
And blocks in my hood ain't got no corners
Cause we done chipped 'em all off a proper piece
Bustin' rocks and glocks
And gettin' ghost from the Police, 
No peace
So, he gets served with no concern
To who gets burned and one day they'll learn
Not to be fuckin' with the nigga
Buckin' with the trigga
Nothing you could figga
Could help you escape
From this mind state
That I create young nigga
Yeah! and it's just like that

Boom, boom, boom, boom
My rearview mirror's vibratin' cause my speakers go 
Boom, boom, boom, boom

(Soopafly)
Now I rock
Some will talk
It don't stop
When that funk shit drops
To make your shit go pop
Now let that beat ride 
In your 'G ride
We gettin' me right
Hittin' with that Dogg Pound ""see"" life
Now its I, with that stylish flow
So niggas step back or heads get cracked
And I won't let back
Who coming with that gangsta shit
The shit that only gangsta's get gangsta with
Now quick to bust your ass like the cop
Waiting, debating for my ass to flip flop
But I don't flop
I just flip the script
When I did and set trip
Keep the clip close to my hip
And don't say shit
When I blast 
I done told your ass
Slow the fuck on down

From the archives
I arise off the Long Beach streets
Will be complete to the do is done to all that competes
Don't be alarmed as I swarm through
I warned you and your crew see wax
So, what's that?
A known fact
Battle that the habitat our men is deadly
You can get diluted 
Or depends on where your head be
Striving for what your in for
And for your info mo' flow
Than the tightest nigga flowed in Ninety-four
So, stand and deliver
Watch nigga's shiver
Quiver in they boots
As I mob with my troops
Through the east
Where the phonies get deleted
Be seated, and all the G's I know
Stay heated

[Tray Deee]
See I was born to be known as a thug and thief
So anyone with beef
I gotta slug to sleep
Peep, I'm not no nigga
Figga' he can come up
By getting a job so I mob
Not givin' a fuck
I'm the drama
Mama warned all they kids about
I mash up strapped
Get my dibs n' out
Hustler musn't trustin' a gat
To keep me fat, seeking victims
Pick 'em and then I stick them in track

With the cereal number scratched out
Don't wear a glass shield but
You'll still be assed out

Enemies that want to see me

Go tell them Busta's 
Up at Bad Boy records
That tricks got a big mouth
Busta better check it
I can see it plain as day
This game I play wide open

Soozie Tyrell,"Pour me a drink Theresa in one of those glasses you dust off
And I'll watch the bones in your back like the stations of the cross
'Round your hair the sun lifts a halo, at your lips a crown of thorns
Whatever the deal's going down, to this one I'm sworn

[Chorus]
I'll work for your love dear
I'll work for your love
What others may want for free
I'll work for your love

The dust of civilizations and love's sweet remains
Slip off of your fingers and come drifting down like rain
The pages of Revelation lie open in your empty eyes of blue
I watch you slip that comb through your hair and this I promise you

[Chorus]

Well tears they fill the rosary, at your feet my temple of bones
Here in this perdition we go on and on
Now I see your pieces crumbled and our book of faith's been tossed
And I'm just down here searching for my own piece of the cross
In the late afternoon sun fills the room with a mist in the garden before the fall
I watch your hands smooth the front of your blouse and seven drops of blood fall

[Chorus: x 2]",I'll Work For Your Love,2007
Soozie Tyrell,"We took the highway till the road went black
We marked Truth Or Consequences on our map

Who'll be the last to die for a mistake
The last to die for a mistake
Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake

The kids asleep in the backseat
We're just countin' the miles you and me
We don't measure the blood we've drawn anymore
We just stack the bodies outside the door

The wise men were all fools
What to do

The sun sets in flames as the city burns
Another day gone down as the night turns
And I hold you here in my heart
As things fall apart

A downtown window flushed with light
Faces of the dead at five (faces of the dead at five)
A martyr's silent eyes
Petition the drivers as we pass by

Who'll be the last to die for a mistake
The last to die for a mistake
Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break
Who'll be the last to die

Who'll be the last to die for a mistake
The last to die for a mistake

Strung up at your city gates

Soozie Tyrell,"A letter come blowin' in
On an ill wind
Somethin' 'bout me and you
Never seein' one another again

And what I knew had come
Stars struck deaf and dumb
Like when we kissed
That taste of blood on your tongue

Don't worry, darlin'
No baby, don't you fret
We're livin' in the future
And none of this has happened yet

Woke up election day
Sky's gunpowder and shades of grey
Beneath the dirty sun
I whistle my time away

Then just about sun down
You come walkin' through town
Your boot heels clickin' like
The barrel of a pistol spinnin' round

The earth it gave away
The sea rose towards the sun
I opened up my heart to you
It got all damaged and undone

My ship Liberty sailed away
On a bloody red horizon
The grounds keeper opened the gates
And let the wild dogs run

Alone I limp through town
A lost cowboy at sundown
Got my monkey on a leash
Got my ear tuned to the ground

My faith's been torn asunder
Tell me is that rollin' thunder
Or just the sinkin' sound
Of somethin' righteous goin' under

None of this has happened yet
None of this has happened yet
None of this has happened yet
None of this has happened yet

Soozie Tyrell,"I got a coin in your palm
I can make it disappear
I got a card up my sleeve
Name it and I'll pull it out your ear

I got a rabbit in the hat
If you wanna come and see
This is what will be
This is what will be

I got shackles on my wrists
Soon I'll slip and I'll be gone
Chain me in a box in the river
And rising in the sun

Trust none of what you hear
And less of what you see
This is what will be (This is what will be)
This is what will be

(I'll cut you in half)

I got a shiny saw blade (a shiny saw blade)
All I need's a volunteer
I'll cut you in half
While you're smilin' ear to ear

And the freedom that you sought
Driftin' like a ghost amongst the trees
This is what will be
This is what will be (This is what will be)

Now there's a fire down below
But it's coming up here
So leave everything you know
Carry only what you fear

On the road the sun is sinkin' low
Bodies hanging in the trees
This is what will be (This is what will be)
This is what will be",Magic,2007
Sopa,"Yesterday got a page and it said that my daddy died 
But I couldn't cry we had a fight long time ago by the liqour store 
Said I didn't want to see your face no more see

I pulled up about five to see my people at my mamas house to see what they was talkin' 'bout 
I haven't seen 'um in a long time (baby are you doin' fine) 
Now it's time to tell 'em what's been on my mind 
Who was there to wipe my tears away and who decided not to show up on my weddin' day 
So y'all tell me what am I supposed to do I just need to hear from you

Livin' in this world ain't easy you want to give up sometimes and even though

And be there to take the pain away

You can't get back all the years that's past so while you have the chance you better make it last didn't get the chance to say goodbye and I wish that I could see you one more time

And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

But I'm not the only one

And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

I told you when I met you, that I had someone in my life.
""I won't tell if you won't tell"" is what you said that night.
Do you remember it started as a game.
But when you play with fire, sometimes you can't put out the flames.
You said that you's a big gurl: undertood the circumstances.
Never took for granted- sneak away romances.
Tonight's the last night, I can't go on like this.
Got you crying on muh sleeve, trying to beg me not to leave.
Por favor no llores.
Gurl I gotta go. Estoy perdiendo, tu llanto rompe el corazon.
And if I stay 5 minutes I just might give in.
It's a battle I can't win.
More than just a sin. Made a promise to myself plus someone else.
From this day 'till the end I gotta be somebody else.
Forgive me mama if I'm making you cry.
I never meant to change your life but I gotta say good-Bye.

So many times you make mistakes, lying to the ones we love.
I should've seen this coming, but I choose to be the selfish one.
Muh mind is thinking I'll just see her one more time.
No more sneaking away to the hotel, telling these lies.
But every time we see eachother, I can't let go.
Still muh thoughts are saying you got a good gurl at home.
A good mama to the kids after she works all day.
Does she deserve to be mistreated and lied to this way? No.
But on the other hand I got you on the phone.
Telling me you can't wait to have me in your arms.
DAMN. I'm going crazy, loosing muh mind.
I shouldn't see you on the side, but it feels so right.
Maybe after tonight we can say Good-Bye.
And I'm thinking to myself this has got to be the last time.
Ya no llores baby gurl, don't cry.
You deserve somebody better, that's gonna love you right.

Spanish eyes and soft brown curls

Her and me at the breakfast table

I let precious time go by

There's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt
I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
Well some of that we did
But most we didn't

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me",Thank You for the Music,2004

Don't know where to go

They're on my track, three Dads,
One lover
Thinking nothing can stop them now
Should I want to
I'm not sure I would know how

This is getting crazy
I should tell them so
Really let my anger show
I feel like I was trapped within a
Nightmare
I've got nowhere to go.

Still undecided I suppose

Yes, it's what I wanted

Staring down the deepest well
I hardly dare to think of what would happen
Where I'd be if I fell

And death is all around me tonight
I miss you making love to me right
Beside myself I'm holding you tight
Someone is waiting for me to rise
And dive into the ocean I cried
And I cried and I cried my baby to sleep
Beside myself my soul to keep

Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always

Right beside you I stand

Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always

Driving into town with the top down
Sun sinking low into the water I can feel your speed
One hand on the wheel one hand on my knee
I can tell you what I want you can do what you need
Darling nights are getting cooler in the city so close
There's a place we can do it somewhere right along the coast
We'll arrive on time just a little bit late
It's not a matter of style just a lesson in taste

I remember when I was your child
You made me up to be your lover
Now I'm standing right beside you
Other people still exsist
I don't pretend to love them less but darling
When you drive this way I lose my breath

Banging on the big drums for your love

Talked to me like your best friend

Hansel and Gretel are holding hands deep in the forest. They are lost. This is
Their own story. The two have fallen in love, and so, after a long quietness
Amidst the creatures of the night, they begin to kiss. Traveling like heat
Through each other's bodies, they pass through centuries of insecurity and into
A rhythm where they are not afraid.

Mamma has led these children into the wild unknown for reasons, known, with
Father's help, of course, they tried very hard to get back home, but of course,
They could not.

And so, they find themselves through the darkness, through the sadness, making
Love, making peace, making music. They find themselves, through the chaos,
Making sense. This is what they want. This is who they are. These are the
Things they need.

I want you, I want you,

I'll never let you go.
Walk the line
I'll walk inside you

You'll never let me go",Lose Your Way,1999
Sophie B. Hawkins,"I want your hand
Across my belly
I want your breasts
Upon my back
I want your pain
To rip right through me
I am your death
You are my wrath

I'll take your hand
Beyond the threshold
I'll take your gifts
As art of fact
I'll take your tongue
Right down to my throat
You are my loss
I am your map

I find your eyes
They give me shelter
I find your lips
They give me peace
I find your need to take me over

Open my heart
I'll tell you stories
Open my legs
I'll read your mind
Open my mail
I'll tell you're forty
You are my fate
I'm your design

I'll lead you o'er
The city burning
I'll lead you home
To Provincetown
I'll lead you down
The soft dunes yearning
You're my vision
I am your sound

I long to be
Your handsome woman
I long to feel
The crease of time
I long to free
Medusa's stallion
I'm your water
You are mine

I need to carve
Your face in pavement
I need to die
In your embrace
I need to keep

Never knew
I was unkind
'Til I met you
So how
Can I believe
You will suffer with me
If I should ask you to

Bare the weight of me

Stare into space because of me
Dare to let nobody take the place of me

I long to be the one
You have a handle on

For I Never cared
To be led
Beyond my despair
And how
Strange to now see
Crumbs of deceit
Following me
So how can you

Bare the weight of me

Sophie B. Hawkins,"(You can do it baby... you know you can do it baby)
You were always the darkest childe
Making all the grown ups sweat
Driving both your parents to distraction
With the sweetness in your head

You're the one who raped your superintendent
On the rooftop tied his hands and feet to the fence
You sucked his cock and fucked the man immobile
You paid your daddy's rent

You are the darkest childe
You spread your angel wings
And fly through the night into the dreams of ancient ruins
And make them sing

Lost lover shameless girl
Bury me in your sultry curls
I'm in the wilderness alone
Let me kiss you until the dawn
Let me put your wilde things on
I've been howling in the fog so long

You are the darkest childe
You have a sacred duty to perform upon this blessed Earth
You must cradle those thoughts of the lustful lonely
Inside your wicked warmth
And you must
Get off

You are the darkest childe
And evil will never stop you
And people will mock you and try
To pop pop pop you into the market place where you cannot be bought
Understood you will be missed
There will be sadness
For the darkest childe

So long

So long to the darkest childe
Waiting in patient anguish
For the scent of someone's wilderness
To howl against the smog screen
Of accolade smoothies
Goose bump burgers and Christ-like fries
How long can this world keep fucking itself up the ass
Wonders never cease
How long would it have to be
Anyway

Long enough to cause hysteria
Wide enough to cause great pain
I am in the wilderness alone

Oh god

Let me kiss you until the dawn
Let me put your wilde things on
I've been howling in the fog so long",The Darkest Childe,1999
Sophie B. Hawkins,"A silent woman parts her lips
To speak before she ought
She makes a cross of her emotions
And a panic of her thoughts
Out of her mouth she comes in rages
Like Vesuvius in heat
She runs ahead of her intentions
Though she's programmed for defeat

By the hunger and the hatred
The prostitution of her nature
She has given and forgiven for to give her
cunt forgave her
To the longing for a loving hand
Or fist or cock or spike 
But you know you cannot reach her
'Til she's taken back her life

A lonely child of fourteen
Finds her future in a drum
She plays for present day omissions
And for whom she must become
Out of her passion breaks the stillness
Of a solitary mind
A strict devotion to the rhythm
With a substitute for time

She looks out of her window
At the changes in the sky
She never wants to leave her sanctuary
Bedroom, books and lies
But she's grown up on the outside
With an instinct for the pain
That drives the men inside her wild
And women wanting her insane

Both lovers bring their cameras
To the beach on New Year's eve
They are expecting nothing other
Than to see what they believe
Four feet walking toward the lighthouse
In the freezing winter rain
She flashes stately in the distance
Humming her somnolent refrain

""You are here now, you are here now
There is nothing left to fear now
"" With each step the sunk is sinking
Though the truth is less unclear now
They have won a thousand battles
They have wrung their own demise
Now they are standing still and weeping
For a love they can't despise

A silent woman and a lonely child
Have nowhere else to go
But to the lighthouse in December
Before the New Year takes its toll
They have found inside each other
What they had lost within themselves
Now they are bonded to forever
In their search for something else

Generations like the water
Shape the face of every stone
A pedigree's an invitation
To discover you're alone
Out in the kitchen or the courtyard
Or the bedroom or the bank
It only takes a fateful moment 
To become the one you thank

And light shall lift them
Higher and higher
And dreams shall carry them on
And loss shall lead them
To life's final hour
Where death shall overcome",Help Me Breathe,1999
Sophie B. Hawkins,"I wanted to be loved

I wanted to be young
As a child
I wanted to feel myself

You shot like star dust through me
And I wanted you to be

And I sail the seas of destiny's song

But you'll reach and I'll be gone

You'd think we were from the same womb
We don't like talking in the morning
And we dream all afternoon.

We're like balloons we're like balloons

Sophie B. Hawkins,"Nightmare bring me to the dawn
I must ride your body on
Deep inside me I know you can't hide me from harm
I'm the secret that you bear
Born of anger and despair
Who will strangle me
Who will untangle my hair

Come to me I can see
Through the holes in your eyes
When I scream out in terror

But we're free when we're wild",Nocturne,1999
Sophie B. Hawkins,"I want to walk beside you
Nowhere that I have ever been
And of the dreams inside you
I am the one you have not seen

You make me feel a school girl
Restless to take your point of view
Into my mystery world
Finding that one is more than two

I feel abused
By my own mind
I can't refuse
An offer to make love to you

How come your words affect me
I have not wanted to be bound
And yet I may be set free
Before the meaning was the sound

In your refrain
I hear the chords of love in vain
How can I help but call your name

I'm haunted
By your demon song

Sophie B. Hawkins,"I met a woman from another time
I couldn't think
But a drink from her eyes
Was like water to wine
She wet my dreams with her distinctive mind
I search the desert for a treasure
And a measure of life denied
I'm driven by cars and guitars and her voice
Ripping up and down my spine
And now I'm giving my life for her sight

To be mine
And in her presence
My fate unwinds
For when her essence
Draws me too near
I can taste her with tears
On my tongue
Like the sun
In my mouth.

I met a man who kicked my front door down
He blew in with the Santa Ana winds
And a half cocked hound
He fits my body like a one horse town
And I was drunk like a vagabond on his street
And I lay face down
And I rode his joy like a child on a merry-go-round
I was young in his eyes
I was sweet on his thighs
I was profound
I was shot like a free bird in flight
To the ground.

I woke this morning from a deadly dream
He was my lover he was my filler
He was my chocolate-colored killer
He was me
I'm built to run
My will is to deceive
But you penetrate severely
I am walking insecurely
On my knees
And I will wait through Winter, Spring and Summer
If you'll Fall in love with me
I will dance so slowly
You will hardly know I
Breathe
From Rome
To Madrid
To Paris

On the breeze
My scent will find you
Lost by degrees
From time to time you'll
Sing
With my lips
Or my hands
On your hips
Or my tongue
Like the sun
In your mouth",Your Tongue Like the Sun in My Mouth,1999
Sophie B. Hawkins,"In our lives Love has hid her face to save her heart from breaking
Into feeling
In your eyes

What would we be
We long to feel free
And in our dreams
We see
What we need

I hardly recognize myself it's such a strange thing
To find another woman walking in my blue jeans
I've come so far and I've been so long away from home
I'm like a photograph who's image is still changing
The letter that I never sent to you explaining
All I want is a place for my heart to belong

In our minds
We have weapons and cures for disease
And a light year in the instant that it takes us to conceive
Without each other
Where will we go
Someday we will know
And if we want to
We will grow Closer and closer together

The way you toss your hips and things you've said

Gazing out my window on the bus
(On Washington Square)
I saw New York crack a smile for us

Blue, I hope you like me too
I've been painting pictures on my wall of you

Blue, I don't believe this is a tease
You could rule my world baby if you please
Skipping down the streets of Harlem
I hear your sweet soul calling me
If I could play the violin I'd make a symphony in

Blue, I hope you like me too
I've been painting pictures on my wall of you
Oh, blue, blue, won't you come dance with me?
There's a party in full swing right down the street

When you strut like an Italian Movie star
Taking your Cappuccinos into the park
Everybody wants to know who you are
Writing poetry until it gets dark

Dropping your dirty laundry off once a week
The delivery boys compete
But you never let them past the stoop
'Cause you know that you're the neighborhood scoop

And dreamt she heard them bleating
But when she awoke, she found it a joke

Then up she took her little crook
Determined for to find them
She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed
For they'd left their tails behind them

Into a meadow hard by
There she espied their tails side by side
All hung on a tree to dry

And over the hillocks went rambling
And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should
To tack each again to its lambkin

Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, ""How do you do?""

It’s all okay, you give me young blood
It’s coursing through my veins, it’s real love
Here inside my heart it’s crystallised
Like it’s framed in time and never tainted

Yeah, it’s alright, you give me young blood
Before the world I may be old enough
There’ll be a day to take the best of us
But till then we have young blood

Somehow
I never saw it coming
I’m caught
And it has set me free

Remember when we used to talk of growing old

Before the world I may be old enough
There’ll be a day to take the best of us
But till then we have young blood

Oh

On and on you give me young blood
It’s coursing through my veins, it’s real love
And here inside my heart it’s crystallised
Just like it’s framed in time and never tainted

Yeah, it’s alright, you give me young blood
Before the world I may be old enough
There’ll be a day to take the best of us

But till then we have young blood",Young Blood,2014
Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"Darkness ain't a sin
It's the visions in your head
Leave it on the windowsill, it's for them now instead
Do you think they know your heart?
It wouldn't be a big surprise

Because the pendulum will swing
Whenever night arrives
13 go a-wandering from grandma's hands to mine
And I'll never be alone
I'm cursed and I am blessed
It's all and it is less

You would not believe the tales they tell
The good, the bad, the hurts like hell
Burden those who live the shaded path
They won't betray their wooden mask

Find them, hide them, keep them safe
Those 13 little dolls
One for each mood of the day
Those 13 little dolls
Cross your heart and dare to sleep
Leave them out to play
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 little dolls

See I was told a tale
Of witches in a box
Lift the lid and spirits rise,
And I see them now, of course
Now they're here beside the bed
I feel 6 and 20 eyes

Because for every twist and turn
Those dolls will catch the mystery
Tell them every fear I have and let it set me free
It's a black magic but a friend
We're locked until the bitter end

You would not believe the tales they tell
The good, the bad, the hurts like hell
Not apparent to the naked eye
But with the third, it all takes flight

Find them, hide them, keep them safe
Those 13 little dolls
One for each mood of the day

Ich bin der Stern, der gefallen vor dem Himmel liegt
Ich bin der Stern, an dem du nachts die Sonne siehst
Ich bin dein Stern, Berlin, Berlin

Elli war 13
Achtundreißig, Berlin Weißensee
Der Vater darf nicht arbeiten, als Kinderarzt
Er weiß nicht mehr wie's weitergeht
Die Mutter träumt von Herzls Altneuland
Palästina, sein Herz hängt an Deutschland
Dem Deutschland Rilkes, Manns und Schuberts
Nicht dem Deutschland, das diese Angst hier zulässt
Er wird sie fortschicken
Es lässt sich nicht mehr ändern
Achtundreißig
Die letzten Tage im September
Berlin, Anhalterbahnhof
Sie winkt dem Vater durch die Scheibe und sie fahren los
Er ruft ihr nach, man soll keine Tränen weinen
Wenn man ins Land seiner Väter reist
Sie versteht nicht gleich was das heißt
Lies sie den Vater nicht zurück, eben an jenem Gleis?
Und die Welt verschwimmt vor ihren Lidern
Versinkt im ""für immer"" und ""nie wieder""
Und sie fahren in die Nacht
Sie findet Schlaf, weil sie fühlt, dass er über ihr wacht
Und in ihrem Traum hat er Flügel
Sie träumt er fliegt in den Süden
Fliegt ihr nach in den Frieden
Nach Tel-Aviv, Hügel des Frühlings

Ich bin der Stern, der auf deinem Boden schlief
Ich bin der Stern, der gefallen vor dem Himmel liegt
Ich bin der Stern, an dem du nachts die Sonne siehst
Ich bin dein Stern, Berlin, Berlin

Acht Tage und acht Nächte auf'm Boot
Wenn der Novembersturm tobt
Hier über'm Meer und daheim in Berlin
Wegen 1000 Pfund Sterling kann der Vater nicht mehr fliehen
Und sie ausgestoßen in diese kalte Welt
Betet zu 'nem Gott den sie in Frage stellt
Während sie die Tage zählt
Die sie den Vater nicht in'n Armen hält
Und sie hegt die Dinge die ihr von zuhause bleiben:
Der Rilke-band, ein paar Kleider, ihre Geige
Auf ihrer Reise, Flucht ohne Zuflucht
Nur diese Furcht vor der Zukunft
Und er wills nicht glauben bis sie nachts vorm Haus sind
Doch sie schlagen und sie plündern, sie verhaften Tausend
Achtunddreißig, Sachsenhausen
Ein Brief aus Tel-Aviv, er ist nur froh dass sie raus sind
Die kleine Elli Weinrebe
Und dieses Heimweh, ob's irgendwann vorbeigeht?
Für das verlorene Land, dort im gelobten Land
Und sie träumt sich weit weg
Und in ihrem Traum hat sie Flügel
Sie träumt sie fliegt aus dem Süden
Fliegt zurück in den Frieden
Nach Berlin, von den Hügeln des Frühlings

Ich bin der Stern, der auf deinem Boden schlief
Ich bin der Stern, der gefallen vor dem Himmel liegt
Ich bin der Stern, in dem du nachts die Sonne siehst
Ich bin dein Stern, Berlin, Berlin

Ich bin der Stern, das Funkeln in den Ästen
Ich bin verloren, im Rauch über der Landschaft

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream 
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will

Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

Sophie Milman,"When I was young I lived in a world of dreams
Of moods and myths and illusionary schemes
Though now I'm much more grown up
I fear that I must own up
To the fact that I'm in doubt of
What the modern cynics shout of

They say it's spring
This feeling light as a feather
They say this thing
This magic we share together
Came with the weather too

They say it's May
That's made me daft as a daisy
It's May, they say
That gave the whole world this crazy
Heavenly, hazy hue

I'm a lark
On the wing
I'm the spark of a firefly's fling

Yet to me
This must be
Something more than a seasonal thing

Could it be spring
Those bells that I can hear ringing
It may be spring
But when the robins stop singing
You're what I'm clinging to
Though they say it's spring
It's you

If poets sing
That when a hard sympathetic
It's merely spring
Then poets plights are pathetic
Though I'm poetic too

They say it's spring
For lovers, there's where the lure is
That evil thing
For which September the cure is
This, they are sure is true

Though I know
That it's so
That my fancy may turn in the spring

With the right
One in sight
One can find a perpetual thing

Did I need spring
To bring the ring that you bought me
Though it was spring
That wondrous day that you caught me

Darling I thought we knew
That it wasn't spring
'Twas you",They Say It's Spring,2016

Sophie Tucker,"Of things I should be thankful for I've had a goodly share 
And as I sit here in the comfort of my cozy chair 
My fancy takes me to a humble eastside tenement 
Three flights up in the rear to where my childhood days were spent 
It wasn't much like Paradise but 'mid the dirt and all 
There sat the sweetest angel, one that I fondly call 

My yiddishe momme I need her more then ever now 
My yiddishe momme I'd like to kiss that wrinkled brow 
I long to hold her hands once more as in days gone by 
And ask her to forgive me for things I did that made her cry 
How few were her pleasures, she never cared for fashion's styles 
Her jewels and treasures she found them in her baby's smiles 
Oh I know that I owe what I am today 
To that dear little lady so old and gray 
To that wonderful yiddishe momme of mine

You'll miss your honey
Some of these days

You'll miss my kisses
You'll miss me, honey
When you go away

Sophie Tucker,"I've often heard it said and sung 
That life is sweetest when you're young
And kids, sixteen to twenty-one 
Think they're having all the fun
I disagree, I say it isn't so 
And I'm one gal who ought to know
I started young and I'm still going strong
But I've learned as I've gone along.......

That life begins at forty
That's when love and living start to become a gentle art
A woman who's been careful finds that's when she's in her prime
And a good man when he's forty knows just how to take his time

Conservative or sporty, it's not until you're forty
That you learn the how and why and the what and when
In the twenties and the thirties you want your love in large amounts
But after you reach forty, it's the quality that counts

Yes, life begins at forty
And I've just begun to live all over again

You see the sweetest things in life grow sweeter as the years roll on
Like the music from a violin that has been well played upon
And the sweetest smoke is from a mellow, broken and old pipe
And the sweetest tasting peach is one that's mature, round and ripe

In the twenties and the thirties you're just an amateur
But after you reach forty, that's when you become a connoisseur
Then it isn't grab and get it and a straight line for the door
You're not hasty, you're tasty, you enjoy things so much more

For instance, a novice gulps his brandy down, he doesn't understand
Observe a connoisseur, the way he holds it in his hand
How he strokes the glass, fondles it, warms it as he should
Smaks his lips, aahhh, slowly sips, hah, boy, it tastes good

Life begins at forty
Then it isn't hit and run and you find much more fun
You romance a girl of twenty and it costs you all your dough
But when a forty thanks you, she hates to see you go

And girls of twenty, all they want are big men
Big men with strong physiques
I don't say that it's bad
But you do get tired of those damn Greeks

Life begins at forty
And I'm just living all over again

",Life Begins at Forty,1992
Sophie Tucker,"When the whole world seems wrong
Just learn the words of a simple song,
Of blue skies above,
Be a troubadour and all is love.

And singin' in the rain's the thing
That those happy days again will bring.

So, everybody sing, everybody sing!

Go Do Re Mi Fa So La Si Do
Do Re Mi Fa So La Si Do

Everybody sing, everybody sing!
Let the sound of your voice turn winter to spring.
Sing before breakfast, help the birdies along.
Before you have your buttered toast, have a song.
Sing before breakfast, never quiet a thing.
Before you eat your shredded wheat, sing, sing, sing!

Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds baked into a pie.
When the pie was opened and set before the king,
Four and twenty blackbirds started into sing.
Sing a melody of love, a song will win your lady fair.
Sing a song that mentions love and you will yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

Sing a song of cheer again,
The skies above will be clear again,
Those happy days are here again,
Sing a song of cheer again.
If you worry, if you fret, if you're getting deep in debt,
Let your frown turn summerset, get yourself a good quartet.
In the evening by the moonlight
You can hear those darkies singin'.
Sing good, sing bad,
Sing loud, sing soft,
Sing sweet, sing hot,
Sing!

So why do you?
You're blowing on the ashes
That's what I think you do

It's been a secret that never got
That deep inside
So it hurt the spot at any time
But deep inside
To hurt the spot at any time

After all this time
Why would I turn around for you?
The truth has faded into a lie
Among all things that I could do

I obviously still bother you, why do I?
I'm just wishing you could forgive

I know that it was rare

Den heulenden Jubel erkenne ich nicht,

zerbricht.

der süßen Lust.
Sein Körper bewegt sich nicht...-
I'm Traume sich endlich
sein Zwingen vergißt",Abschied,1995
Sopor Aeternus,"Nothing in this world 
Can be as immaculate and pure
As the love of us Cold Ones for the dead.  
Our love lives only in those fleeting moments 
Of recollection
Memories we're fearing to forget.

Our love knows neither kiss nor touch, 
We are embracing dust, air or ourselves 
When visualizing what we've lost. 
Awoken by a sound or scent,  
Some visions call sad phantoms, floating, 
Wrapped in fading colours our  lament. 

And then there is the all-devouring dread: 
""some day I might not bring  him back..., 
When my feeble mind can't help but lose 
The contours of his face"".  
Lost forever, lone and sad, 
Gone forever to the dead...
So far beyond the barriers of the opposite space.

Yet, alas, despite it all
Walking through these deserted  halls
It's easy, still, to love the dead
It's easier to love the dead.",Transfiguration,1995
Sopor Aeternus,"From far beyond the veil of sleep 
some ancient voice does seem
to whisper my forgotten name 
weakly, yet solemnly. 

So remotely that one might think
it had been but a dream, 
echo of some illusive call 
of fleeting memory.

Yes, to believe such vain idea
no problem it would be,
if there was not this inscrutable
unrest within me... 

As if out of the deepest sea 
some creature seeks to rise, 
to wish its long denied existence 
back into my life. 

My secret name is whispered 
by a half-forgotten sigh 
and out of nothing, across my face,    
which is all petrified. 

Hot tears are running without end. 
A deeply troubling pain 
pulls me together inwardly, 
to be no more the same... 

From far beyond the veil of sleep 
some tune, ne'er before heard, 
is trav'lling on a fragile breath,    
to shake my frozen world.",Across the Bridge,2000

Imagine Madagascar et ses montagnes d'ordures
Imagine tes 8 ans et tes pieds sans chaussures
Imagine tes mains dans les détritus
Pour un bout de pain mais tu t'y habitues
Imagine Paris et son périphérique
Quelque part sous un pont pas loin du trafic
Imagine toi sous un duvet sale
Luttant contre le froid, luttant contre la dalle

Karl, imagine toi sans la musique
La santé abîmée par les 3-8
Les aller-retour aux ASSEDIC

Saïd, imagine toi sans cette réussite
En galère, juste le SMIC
Prisonnier de cette tour de brique

Imagine toi sans Sniper
Moi sans Psy 4 et ces bons moments que d'autres ne connaissent pas!

Imagine un peu nos vies sans tout ça
C'est pour ça ! Remercions Dieu pour tout ça
Pardon pour tout les jours où je me plains
Les jours où je ne vois que moi, mon nez et pas plus loin!

Pardon pour toutes ces fois où j'ai grossi mes problèmes
Toutes ces fois où j'ai fais tourner le monde sur moi-même

Ferme tes yeux juste une seconde
Vois la misère du monde
Et ta place dans tout ça

Prenons conscience de la chance qu'on a
Et tu verras peut-être
Que la vie est belle!

Ça n'arrive qu'aux autres, on ne réalise pas tant que ça ne nous touche pas

C'est Sopra M'Baba, bordélique ambulant pour les mecs d'en bas
Flow décalé pour les mecs qui ne comprennent pas que ça vient d'Massilia

Passe moi un mic et des baffles, une paire de Nike, un beat et une basse

Les quartiers nord sont tous dans la place

Les Marseillais prennent toute la place
Ils veulent du rap animal, MC normal que t'aies mal
Mon rap s'écoute dans les prides
Le tien dans les gay-prides
J'ai à peine pris le mic que tu commences à faire la shahad
Normal je ballade ma rime, me ballade dans les hit-parades
So-Pra-Ano pour les mecs qu'on a mis au cachot
Pour les mecs qu'on la force de porter la grosse vie d'un mec du ghetto
Bédo à la bouche très tôt, une mère qui se couche très tard
Un père qui n'a plus le contrôle sur un fils qui finira au mitard
Métro, boulot et dodo, c'est ce qu'est la vie du ghetto

Soprano,"Trop jeune pour se laisser mourir, faut être fort et plus que d'habitude
Un pour ceux de notre brûlante génération, deux pour la cramitude
Quartier attitude à l’accélération, Soprano, Lucianozi

Suffit pas d'être vrai faut le rester
Faut plus de courage que d’expérience et de respect
C'est la loi du plus fort sur le plus faible, les vies n'ont plus de freins
Qui veut durer doit faire front c'est à celui qu'a le plus faim
Si t'as le temps mon frère fonce c'est le grand jour ouvre les yeux
Y a pas d'avenir dans le crime les jeunes claquent plus vite que les vieux
J'viens du quartier et je connais les règles, c'est du marche ou crève
Défendre de vrais valeurs, le monde est monde est à nous qu'un putain de rêve
Le monde d'aujourd'hui nous oblige à être forts
Car la peur est la prison du cœur et qui craint la vie, vit comme un mort
Quartiers chauds en première ligne, vrai pour de vrai
Du mauvais coté ou du bon coté du calibre
On garde la foi l'instinct sauvage des grands fauves
Dis hamdoullah même quand c'est pas la grande forme
Notre reflet reflète ce que nous sommes
On trouve les nerfs en prenant route sombre, plus rien nous stoppe
Putain de monde instable dans mon crâne c'est Woodstock

Quoi que l'époque t'impose, reste fort digne et vrai pour de vrai (juste fais-le)
Tu es fier et tu veux survivre (juste fais-le)
Question de vie ou de mort, d'amour ou de guerre, de vrai ou de faux (juste fais-le)

Je viens tatouer mes feuilles pour faire évader mes frères de taule
Mon bloc c'est Fox River avec des paraboles
J'suis qu'un jeune rêveur dans ce pays Nazi
Où c'est dur de garder son calme avec des Sarko-Materazzi
On m'a dit résiste fais ton truc, mais sois dur
Ici le poids d'une auréole peut te briser la nuque
C'est avec le regret des anciens que je m’éduque
Et grâce à ça aujourd'hui, mon Bic me sert d'oléoduc
Pour combattre mes doutes, j'fais des pompes sur un tapis de prière
La voix c'est le visa de toutes les frontières donc j'lutte
Pour être meilleur qu'hier
Pour voir mon avenir sur un hamac mais pas sur une civière
Écoute, le vie est dure si on veut du rêve
On veut tous une part du gâteau mais être le seul à y trouver la fève
Donc lève-toi et sois un dalleux
Sache que le bonheur est une décision qui se prend donc juste fais-le

Quoi que l'époque t'impose, reste fort digne et vrai pour de vrai (juste fais-le)
Tu es fier et tu veux survivre (juste fais-le)

Trouve le vrai toi (juste fais-le)

On sourit avec l'envie de faire mal cachée derrière
Affronte la vie présente en préparant la vie dernière
On pardonne mais s'rappelle car l'histoire se répète
Si on oublie le passé ouvrez les portes notre destinée appelle
Vrai car un jour vaut cher
On a besoin que nos proches soient prêts 
car dans l'monde comme on le voit la famille c'est de l'or en chair
On est pas ce qu'on est on devient vrai
Quartier chaud danger, pour les nôtres gueule d'agneau, pour les autres l’œil du berger

On fait la fête car tout va mal dans nos têtes
Normal envers Allah on s’entête
On claque notre temps à faire des truc bêtes, mec
On utilise que les neurones de notre zgeg
On se prend la tête que quand les billets ont la couleur à Shrek
Faut qu'on arrête, d'assumer ses désirs plus que ses devoirs
De partager ses péchés plus que son savoir
Faut essayer d’être vrai pour de vrai
Donc pour la famille se mettre à œuvrer

Reste vrai pour de vrai, juste fais-le
Juste fais-le, juste fais-le
Reste vrai pour de vrai, reste vrai pour de vrai

Soprano,"Bonsoir à toutes et à tous,
Bienvenus à notre réunion hebdomadaire des mélancoliques anonymes.
Réservons un accueil particulièrement chaleureux aux nouveaux,
Pour qui ça n'a certainement pas été facile de venir jusqu'à nous.
Nous allons débuter cette réunion par un témoignage.
Qui veut se lancer?

Moi

Toi? Et bien nous t'écoutons

Merci,
Bonsoir je m'appelle Saïd

Bonsoir Saïd

J'ai 27 ans et je suis mélancolique
Je suis de ces artistes qui écrivent leur vie
Comme on laisse une dernière lettre prés d'une boite de prose à vide
Ça a été très difficile pour moi de venir ici
D'accepté ma dépendance à la mélancolie
Le déclic a été de voir ma mère recraché en larme
Tous ce qu'elle a bu de mes bouteilles à la mer
Je m'en veux de la voir si triste
Alors qu'elle n'a jamais été la lame de mes cicatrices
Ni personne de ma famille d'ailleurs
Mais leur tailleur est noir à chaque fois qu'ils écoutent mes disques
J'ai pris le risque de faire de la musique
D'étaler ma vie au public pour soigner un mal de vivre
Je prend conscience de mon égoïsme
Quand je vois comment ils subissent le succès de mes lyrics
Je remplis mes vers de rimes mélancoliques
Et ma voie frise le coma italique sur-rythmique
J'aime la pression qui mousse mes thèmes
Un ivrogne qui s'empègue avec des paques de peines

Car j' ai trouvé mon bonheur en chantant mes malheurs
Réappris à rire à travers mes pleurs
Mais je réalise que je fait du mal à ceux que j'aime
Depuis que je bois des verres de mélancolie pour être moins triste
Réappris à vivre en étant sous terre
Retrouvé mon cœur après l'avoir eu en pierre
Pour ma famille, je suis chez les mélancoliques anonymes

Au début je rappais pas pour en vivre
On rappait tous dans un bloc autour d'un poste pour le délire
Je partais en impro, j’enchaînais les mots
J'allumais le mic et ma bouche était un chalumeau
Je taffais mes jeux de mots
Je ne dormais plus
Toutes mes nuits étaient blanches pour que mes feuilles ne le soit plus
Je fesais rire mes potes grâce au petit robert
Mais tout à changé depuis qu'on ma volé le rôle de père
J'ai eu mal au point de vouloir me couper les veines
Fallait me voir poser je t'aime à la haine
Fallait entendre ma mère pleurer toute la nuit
À cause des coutumes qui on poussé mon père à la polygamie
C'est vrai que je suis sorti de l'ombre
Mais le monde est tellement stone que je ne pouvais écrire que ""la colombe""
Plus tu grandit moins tu sourit
Le temps souffle et détruit
Ces châteaux du sable qu'on avait construit
Vous savez aujourd'hui une femme m'a mis en cure
Depuis j'ai moins de degrés dans mon écriture
Je suis moins en état de tristesse
Mais je fais toujours autant péter ce putain de mélancotest

Car j' ai trouvé mon bonheur en chantant mes malheurs
Réappris à rire à travers mes pleurs
Mais je réalise que je fait du mal à ceux que j'aime
Depuis que je bois des verres de mélancolie pour être moins triste
Réappris à vivre en étant sous terre
Retrouvé mon cœur après l'avoir eu en pierre
Pour ma famille, je suis chez les mélancoliques anonymes

Merci beaucoup Saïd. Merci pour ce témoignage.
Quelqu'un d'autre peut être veut prendre la parole?

Moi je veux bien

Nous t'écoutons.

Bonsoir je m'appelle Mélanie

Bonsoir Mélanie

J'ai 26 ans et je suis mélancolique aussi
Je suis de ces jeunes filles qui haïssent leur vie
Artiste malgré moi parce que les psy' ont faillit à leurs titre
Depuis toujours le mal de l'encre me démange
L'amour me manque mais me dérange
Alors je chante mes cicatrices",Mélancolique Anonyme,2007
Soprano,"Oh wow oh
Talk to me

Oh wow oh
Talk to me

Fils, si aujourd'hui j'te parle à travers ce disque
C'est pour que tu puisses savoir que ton père existe et qu'il s'appelle Saïd
J'suis triste depuis que ta mère t'as mis à la DASS sans me le dire
Sans que je puisse te voir vu que t'es né sous X
J'sais pas si t'es encore en vie en tout cas jour et nuit j'prie
Pour que chaque Février tu puisses souffler sur tes bougies
J'réagis souvent comme un temps de pluie quand je vois un gosse de ton âge
Et dire t'as 8 ans aujourd'hui
A l'heure où j'écris c'texte les tentatives pour te retrouver on été un échec
Mais j'lache pas le steak j'te le prouverai un jour j'serai
Devant toi avec des années d'cadeaux à rattraper
Même si je sais que j'recuperai jamais les années qu'elle m'a volé
Avant j'comprenai pas quand mon père me prenait la tête
Quand il savait pas où j'étais et maintenant je sais c'est quoi d'être inquiet
J'passe mes nuits au fond d'une couette les yeux ouverts à ma demander si t'es au chaud
Quand arrive ces terribles hivers
J'mange très peu quand j'sais pas si tu manges à ta faim
Et j'pleure en écoutant ""Comme un fils"" de Corneille l'orphelin
Au volant d'ma caisse, sur la corniche, je n'rêve pas de d'vnir riche
Mais plutôt, de te dire ""Ich liebe dich""

Parle moi de toi, de ses heures sans moi
De ses rires manqués quand tu me manquais prends moi
Dans tes bras et appelle moi ""Papa"" papa

Parle moi de toi, de ses heures sans moi
De ses rires manqués quand tu me manquais prends moi
Dans tes bras et appelle moi ""Papa"" papa

Moi mon gabarit est celui d'un coton tige, ton grand-père l'était aussi
Mais il a grossi depuis ses 50 piges, j'te le dit direct tu seras maigre
Fais pas comme moi, fais des pompes pour qu'une femme te dise que t'as des pecs
Envoies pêtre, ceux qui te pointeront du doigt parce que t'es noir
T'es Comorien, là bas la lune allume la ville quand il fait noir
J'y suis allé qu'une seule fois, à 14 ans
C'est une île paradisiaque ton arrière grand-père était encore vivant
A 19 ans, j'ai eu le BAC après l'avoir raté une fois
Puis j'ai fait 2 ans de BTS mais c'n'était pas ma voie
J'pensais qu'à la rime, qu'à sortir des disques
Depuis j'l'ai fait en remplissant des salles et en faisant des sacrifices
Mon caractère, j'suis plutôt timide, j'suis d'nature solitaire
Et j'regarde le monde avec un œil humide
Ta mère on m'a dit qu'elle a refait sa vie, avec des mecs avec qui
Elle ma trompé pendant 9 ans de ma vie
Tu sais, si t'es comme moi va falloir que t’apprennes à souffrir
Car j'suis de ceux qui donnent de l'amour sans réfléchir
Mon coeur s'déchire quand j'dit ça car j'ai trop été déçu
Mais bon puisqu'il faut vivre j'assume
Aujourd'hui j'ai une femme qui m'aime, qui m'aide
Elle me dit t'auras bientôt un p'tit frère
Et qu'elle veut faire une grande fête
Inch'Allah qu'j'te retrouve avant pour qu'tu puisses être là
Pour que tu le prenne dans tes bras et que, et que

Tu lui parles de toi, de ses heures sans moi
De ses rires manqués quand tu me manquais, prends moi
Dans tes bras et appelle moi ""Papa"" papa

Parle moi de toi, de ses heures sans moi
De ses rires manqués quand tu me manquais prends moi
Dans tes bras et appelle moi ""Papa"" papa

Dédicacé à tout ceux qui savent c'que c'est d'être loin d'son fils, loin d'sa fille

A tous ces pères divorcés
A ceux à qui on a volé le rôle de père
A tous les enfants de la DDASS",Parle-Moi,2007
Soprano,"Passe moi le mic que je représente tous ces quartiers de France,
Toutes ces sentences, tous ceux qui subissent l'intolérance,
L'inégalité des chances,
Toute cette misère que les médias maquillent en déliquance!

Passe moi le mic que je représente ces femmes de ménage,
Ces pères au chantier, ces fils dans l'usinage,
Ces mères isolées, ces grands frères alcolisés!
En gros tous ces foyers détruits par le manque de monnaie!

Passe moi le mic que je représente les sans papiers,
Les exilés, les expulsés,
Toutes ces familles qui vivent dans l'insalubrité,
Ces familles colonisées qui voyaient la France comme un terre de liberté!

Passe moi le mic que je représente cette Islam de paix,
Cette mixité entre communautés, la richesse du métissage,
Cet arc-en-ciel qui fait que la France a aujourd'hui le plus beau paysage!

Passe moi le mic que je représente cette sœur avocate,
Ce frère médecin, ces frères à  la fac, ceux qui taffent au black,
Ces patrons de snacks, ceux qui touchent le smic,
Tous ces bac +8 qui squattent l'assedic!

Passe moi le mic que je représente cette jeunesse qu'on empêche de rêver,
Cette jeunesse qui a besoin d'exprimer sa liberté est ses idées,
Qui a besoin de s'évader, cette jeunesse qui a besoin d'exister!

On prend le mic pour ceux qui ont pas la parole!
A la vie, à  la mort, quel est notre rôle? (On représente!)
Toi qui porte les douleurs de l'époque,
Quelle que soit ta couleur, peu importe! (On représente!)
Le poing levé mais jamais à  genoux
Vu que personne ne fait pour nous, on représente!

Passe moi le mic que je représente cette Afrique endettée,
Ces français pas encore intégrés,
Cette solidarité entre peuples affamés,
Ce père tirailleur qui attend encore d'être indemnisé!

Passe moi le mic que je représente ces cousins du bled
Qui font la plonge pour envoyer de la thune,
Tous ceux qui viennent pour faire des études
Pour eux l'école c'est des ailes alors que pour nous ça reste une enclume!

Passe moi le mic que je représente cette file d'attente
Devant la poste tous les 5 du mois,
Ces coups de blues qui fait que mes frères dans l'alcool se noient,
Ces victimes de bavures policières qui me font crier",Passe-Moi le Mic,2007
Soprano,"Yeah
Puisqu'il faut vivre, autant le faire avec le sourire
Se dire que le meilleur est à venir
Que le pire permet de construire ce vraiment à quoi on aspire
Se dire pendant la chute qu'il y a toujours espoir de bien atterrir
La vie ça ne se respire qu'une seule fois
Et le bonheur ça se vit sans aucune loi
Être libre, voilà mon véritable combat
Tout faire pour que ma colombe intérieure ai enfin le cœur qui bât
Mais des fois je lâche, dans ma tête c'est le désordre
Je trouve la force que pour faire le nœud de ma corde
Comme ce fameux 3 décembre
Allah pardonne moi d'avoir voulu mettre ma vie en cendres
Un suicide c'est lâche et égoïste
Ça prend le cœur de ceux qui t'aiment vraiment et ça le trempe dans l'acide
T'as raison, Kery, pourquoi on fait du mal à ceux qu'on aime?
Aujourd'hui c'est pour eux que je vis
C'est pour vous que je rappe, à bout de forces au milieu de l’arène
Au milieu des corps de ceux qu'ont voulu abattre mes rêves
Toujours debout, les pieds levés, qu'ils viennent
Un coup d’œil dans les tribunes, car c'est dans vos regards que je trouve de l'aide
Dans vos regards que je soigne mes plaies
Celles qu'on retrouve dans chaque phase de mes couplets
Aujourd'hui je me bats pour mes véritables besoins
Car celui qui se contente de peu ne manque de rien
Moi j'oublie rien, de toutes ces galères, ni d'où je viens
Moi j'oublie rien, mes potes savent que je reviens de loin
Je suis originaire d'un port d'esclaves
J'ai la peau couleur pétrole et ça les colons le savent
Je suis Comorien et je suis fier de l'être, porter ce sang est un honneur
Moi j'ai pas le droit à l'erreur, car les miens ont droit à l'or
Pour l'amour de cette femme, qui porte mon alliance et mon gosse
Je me dois d'être fort, yeah, yeah, yeah
Deviens ma camisole, et me laisse plus dormir seul
Je porte la solitude, comme un homme porte un linceul
Prendre de l'altitude m'a toujours donné le mal de l'air
Plus je monte, plus j'ai besoin d'une couette dans cette ambiance polaire
Ma colère envers les hommes est énorme
Comme tu vois, le monde est toujours aussi stone
Regarde, Sheitan a beaucoup plus de Stan
Et certains chants des stades me rappellent l'Amistade
A l'heure où les roses sont offerts aux morts plus qu'aux vivants
A l'heure où on est plus pris par le temps que par le vent
A l'heure où les médias font de la lessive avec notre cerveau
A l'heure où les bergers font de la laine sur notre dos
On se doit d'être forts, se battre contre l'injustice
Mais surtout se battre contre nos putains de caprices
Pour changer le monde, faut changer ses désirs
Puisqu'il faut vivre, faut qu'on résiste

Viva la révolution (yeah, yeah)
Viva la révolution (yeah, viva la révolution, yeah, yeah)
Viva la révolution (viva! viva! yeah, yeah)
Viva la révolution (viva la révolution)
Pour toutes nos générations (puisqu'il faut vivre, autant le faire avec le sourire)
Pour toutes nos générations (yeah, se dire que le meilleur est à venir, yeah, yeah)
Pour toutes nos générations (yeah, puisqu'il faut vivre faut se battre faut qu'on résiste)
Pour toutes nos générations (yeah, pour un meilleur avenir, yeah)

Puisqu'il faut vivre, yeah
Merci à tous ceux qui me suivent depuis le début
A ceux qui suivent psychiatre, yeah

Soprano,"Je n'ai appris qu'à perdre, qu'à mettre les mains dans la merde 
Qu'à n'être rien dans ma tête, qu'à faire la guerre qu'à mes frères 
Qu'à voir ma mère dans les dettes, qu'ils aillent se faire mettre, mec, t’inquiètes 
Le petit nègre sera riche avant qu'on l'enterre 
Je n'ai qu'un seul maître, qu'un seul modèle, pour être loin de votre matériel 
Et prêt de l'amour maternel, moi ma guerre à l'heure où on te parle qu'en modem, 
C'est niquer le système où on t'apprend à vivre au singulier mais plus au pluriel 
Plus rien sur terre m'attire, on s'écoute que quand ça tire 
La colombe ici s'enterre et les corbeaux s'en tirent 
La paix est une cause militaire qui sauve des vies pétrolières 
Car je ne vois tomber que des missiles de leur canadair 
Entre crises alimentaires et bavures policières 
Normal qu'avec tous ces poulets, les blocks aient la grippe aviaire 
Je déteste Marine comme Diam's mais encore pire son père 
Car je suis Tookie Williams et lui Schwarzenegger 
Aujourd'hui ils nous parlent tous des bienfaits des colonies 
Dès qu'on leur dit qu'on est français, ils nous disent d'arrêter nos calomnies 
Ils nous ont mis loin de leur économie

Tant que Dieu me donne la force d'être libre, 
Je rappe le ghetto 

Tant que Dieu me donne la chance de vivre, 
Tant que Dieu me donne la force d'être libre, 
Je rappe le ghetto 

Je rappe la noiceur de mon épiderme 
La famine d'un frigidaire 
Le silence d'un solitaire 
La lame d'un suicidaire 
L'histoire changée au cutter 
Les larmes d'un jugé à tort 
Celles de nos miradors 
La sueur de mes disques d'or 
La poésie du mesquine 
La poésie du Uzi 
La poésie de Mesrine 
La poésie anti skin 
Les dés pipés de l’État 
La fin des temps et ses signes 
L'état des frères m'guettah 
Nos pères tués à l'usine 
L'énorme manque de caille 
L'énorme manque de médailles 
La marque sur le dos du bétail 
La sincérité de Chiens de Paille

Tu veux savoir, dans l'idéal, mec, je rappe la persévérance 
Partage mes errances, en gras, marque ma différence. 
Je rappe par déférence. Hommage à mes référents. 
Capte, Mormeck, frappe dans le sac, moi dans la page blanche. 
Je rappe au nom des miens. Pas le droit que dans le son y'ait rien 
Mate dans mes calepins, c'est plein de Blap-Blap, je descends les chiens 
Au mic, défends les miens. Clap-clap quand je me sens bien 
Je te mets à l'aise, c'est juste du rap. Je nargue comme Hugo Chavez. 
Oh! L'humour est noir car l'humeur du Métèque est mate. 
Chill, c'est à toi, place l'échec et mat. 

On donne grâce et courage, la France rage et nous brade 
Les flics sur le terrain frappent, et les gradés nous parlent 
Bordel, on est des hommes, y'en a marre de jouer les coupables 
Y'a beau mettre les formes mais ces cons nous passent des dourags 
Qu'on se nomme Brad ou Mourad, le passé nous parle 
On tire la paix hors de la guerre, en étudiant les vers et Sourates 
Avec le plastic, le C4, ces cavés nous casent 
Trop de pression dans ce bled et nos fesses jouent les soupapes 
Si je voulais manipuler l'or, je serais député ou pape 
Qu'ils soient dégoûtes ou pas, ma vie est vouée au rap 
Rimes en XTRA large en déboutant les coulées pou-raves 
Assis comme un bouddha, écoute moi livrer des bouts d'âme 

Tant que Dieu me donne la chance de vivre, 
Tant que Dieu me donne la force d'être libre, 
Je rappe le ghetto

Je rentre en 2007 comme un éléphant dans une boutique de porcelaine
Le sheitan
Y a plus d'amour pur dehors
On la coupe à l'eau
La peur d'épousé une marjolaine
En voyant l’âme , moi la sik c'est ma reine
13 ans que je lui fait l'amour
En pantoufle, chez elle je me promène
Prépare ma gamelle
Car j'ai la dalle! Tu me fé rire

La bac! Tu rap! Blaa sur le qui vive

Oh! toujours le même qui se la ramène

Pour les frères des blocks qu'on ramasse à la pelle
Les temps sont dur en temps de guerre
Car l'amitié c'est comme les flics corrompus
Jusqu’à qu'on les enterres
Ou les morts sont des pirates au effet qui s'en melle
Comprend pourquoi on tombe arrivés en haut de l’échelle

Marseille (oh)

Je connais ce regard insolent et insouciant
Ce cocard et cet air menaçant
Toutes ces heures à passer dans un block à fumer
Avec ses potes, tailler les cours pour aller zoner
Je connais ces bagarres
Ces histoires de territoires
Ces histoires de respect qui se règlent le soir
Cette envie de croquer l'monde
Tous ces oeufs jetés quand les flics faisaient leur ronde
Ohh moi aussi tout comme lui
Je prenais le mic, rapais toute la nuit
Toute la flicaille était mes ennemis
Je haussais la voix sur toute ma famille
Ohhhh
Je calquais les gestes des grands du quartier
Me prenais pour l'Everest face aux p'tits des quartiers
Malgré tous s'qu'on dit, regarde un peu comment on a fini
Ohhh!

Tous ces jeunes en bas des blocks sans espoir
J'étais comme eux
Ceux qui gaspillent leur jeunesse dans un square
J'étais comme eux
Ceux qui avancent sans repères tard le soir
J'étais comme eux
Cette jeunesse qu'a pas appris le mot victoire
J'étais comme eux
C'est ohohoh 1.3
C'est ohohoh 9.4
C'est ohohoh 1.3
9.4 c'est

Moi aussi j'ai connu ces jours sans fin devant le hall
Les soirées sur un parking où ça fume et ça picole
Le week end j'allais chercher ma petite pochette sur Amsterdam
J'restais qué-blo devant la console toute la journée dans un local
J'ai fais des soirées, j'rêvais de gloire, de succès, de briller
De m'noyer comme picsou dans une piscine de billets
Je m'prenais, quand j'étais sous cuite, pour Superman
Alors que dans ma tête et dans mon cœur j'allais super mal
Pleins d'rêves dans la tête et pas un sous dans la poche
J'étais comme eux, rien à perdre dans la merde sous un porche
Moi aussi j'voulais devenir , mon pote, le boss de la ville, rouler en Porsche
De ne vivre que d'argent facile
J'me posais pleins de questions sur ma vie et sur ce monde
J'rêvais de faire des feats, d'entendre ma voix sur les ondes
Comme lui je rentrais tard, j'ratais tous les repas du soir
Toujours fourré dans les histoires, dans les sales coups, dans les bagarres

Tous ces jeunes en bas des blocks sans espoir
J'étais comme eux

Et moi aussi la météo scolaire ne m'a prédit que des intempéries
Un avenir tout gris
Les problèmes de famille m'ont isolés
Le manque de fric m'empêchait de m'envoler
Ohh

La conseillère d'orientation m'a envoyé en galère
Elle m'a mis dans une branche que j'voulais pas faire
Quand j'allais au cinéma man j'rentrais par derrière
Dans la cité roue arrière, africaine la bannière

Mais j'ai aussi appris à travers ces nuits blanches
Que la vie n'avait pas de traîneau ni d'barbe blanche
Ohh

Moi aussi elle m'a appris qui faut s'montrer fort et patient
Utilise tes connaissances et ton savoir à bon escient

On se morfond sur nos regrets
Boy reste debout

Malgré les galères qu’on vit chaque jour
Malgré les échecs, malgré nos doutes
Il faut savoir se relever, rester debout et ça malgré tout
La, la, la

Un jour on m’a dit que l’homme était insurmontable
Que la patience et la foie étaient rentables
Que tout était dans le mental
Qu’il fallait rester fort pour mieux recevoir nos médailles
Que tu verras dans le miroir celles
Tu te rappelleras de cette victoire celle
Qui te réveillera d’un cauchemar
Car c’est dans l’erreur et dans la douleur et que la vie s’apprend
Dis toi que le bonheur est une décision qui se prend
Car c’est dans l’erreur et dans la douleur et que la vie s’apprend
Dis toi que le bonheur est une décision qui se prend

Malgré les galères qu’on vit chaque jour
Malgré les échecs, malgré nos doutes
Il faut savoir se relever, rester debout et ça malgré tout

Soprano,"Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières

Vous venez chaque année
L’été comme l’hiver
Et nous on vous reçoit
Toujours les bras ouverts 
Vous êtes ici chez vous
Après tout, peu importe
On veut partir alors
Ouvrez-nous la porte

Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières

Du Cap à Gibraltar
Nous sommes des milliers
A vouloir comme vous
Venir sans rendez-vous
Nous voulons voyager
Et aussi travailler
Mais nous, on vous a pas
Refusé le visa

Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières

Nous aussi on veut connaître la chance d'étudier, 
La chance de voir nos rêves se réaliser, 
Avoir un beau métier, pouvoir voyager, 
Connaître ce que vous appelez liberté. 

On veut que nos familles ne manquent plus de rien, 
On veut avoir cette vie où l'on mange à sa faim, 
On veut quitter cette misère quotidienne pour de bon, 
On veut partir d'ici car nous sommes tous en train de péter les plombs !

Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Laissez-nous passer ...
Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières

Y'a plus une goutte d’eau
Pour remplir notre seau
Ni même une goutte de pluie
Tout au fond du puits
Quand le ventre est vide
Sur le chemin de l’école
Un beau jour il décide
De prendre son envol

Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Laissez-nous passer ...
Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières

Ouvrez la porte, ici, on étouffe, 
On est plein à vouloir du rêve occidental, 
Ouvrez la porte, ici, la jeunesse s'essouffle, 
Ne vois-tu pas que pour nous c'est vital !

Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Laissez-nous passer ...
Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières

Vous avez pris nos plages
Et leur sable doré
Mis l’animal en cage
Et battu nos forêts
Qu’est-ce qu’il nous reste
Quand on a les mains vides
On se prépare au voyage
Et on se jette dans le vide

Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Laissez-nous passer ...
Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Laissez-nous passer ...
Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Laissez-nous passer ...
Ouvrez les frontières, ouvrez les frontières
Laissez-nous passer ...",Ouvrez Les Frontières,2010

Je suis prête à me battre encore si ça ne suffit pas

Combien de fois dois-je leur dire que ma musique existe?
Et qu’elle mérite un respect à la hauteur de nos prises de risque?
A la hauteur de nos ventes de disques

Qui leur permet de ne pas perdre la raison
Pour eux j’avance de mes propres moyens
Car je sais que votre soutien est tellement chaud qui tend la main
Donc je joue mon rôle sans faire le comédien
Car j’ai promis aux miens de le faire à la bien cousin

Moi j’essaie, d’avancer, si tu les écoutes, tu mets ta vie de côté
Sans jamais t’emporter, sinon espoir est mort je vais y resté

Un drapeau blanc à la main droite et une kalash à la main gauche
Il écrit au bord des larmes quand il voit l'état du monde
Il écrit au bord des flammes en espérant que la pluie tombe
Il fait des pompes, pour porter les fardeaux de sa jeunesse
Il décrit le stress, des frères, qui n'ont qu'la violence comme S.O.S
Il écrit avec tout l'encre de ses yeux
Il bat de ses ailes en haut d'un bloc pour essayer d'éteindre le feu
Il croit en Dieu, sa philosophie est dans l'dîne, aucune vulgarité, pour ne pas salir l'image muslim
Boulimie d'sincérité à chaque fois qu'il pose ses rimes
Anorexie de vanité même, même quand il fait platine
Il a une flamme olympique à la place de la rétine
Il fait de l'égotrip avec le langage d'une chevrotine

Mon rap a les racines d'Afrique, le tronc de France, les branches des quartiers
Des feuilles pour écrire c'que la jeunesse pense
Ses fruits sont dans les bacs pour les affamés de gros son
Il n'a pas poussé dans un parc mais dans une forêt de béton
Il est parfois un saule pleureur ou parfois un chêne
Pour le déraciner dites aux bûcherons qu'ils peuvent ranger leurs chèques
Il préfère arroser les deux banzaï de son jardin
Il aime le naturel, il laisse les guirlandes aux sapins
Il prétend pas être le meilleur des hommes, comme tout le monde
Il essaye de remettre son auréole à chaque fois qu'elle tombe
Toujours le même après la thérapie de son album
Il se bat pour le confort de sa famille et de sa tombe
Il a connu la gloire et ses revers
Les ""je t'aime"" et les repose en guerre
Le bras bouffé par ceux a qui il a tendu la main
Le cœur bouffé à chaque fois qu'il a déçu les siens
Comprend le bien, il est pas là pour faire la star ni le comédien
Le cerveau plein, il rap avec les tripes ses problèmes du quotidien
Frérot, il est venu faire son boulot avec une colombe dans la plume et un corbeau dans l'flow
Lui demande pas d'rapper c'que tu penses, s'il n'le pense pas
De faire du rap que t'aimes, s'il n'aime pas

Je serais parti revivre la naissance de Lenny et d'Inaya
J'aurais été à Sanaa Boycotter le décollage de l'A310 de la Yemenia
J'aurais été voir mon grand-père une dernière fois
Dire que je m'occupe de sa fille, qu'il ne s'inquiète pas
Je serais parti voir Martin Luther King
Après son discours, lui montrer la photo de Barack Obama
J'aurais été au temple d'Harlem
Pousser Malcolm de la scène avant qu'une balle l'atteigne
J'aurais été dans la cellule de Mandela
Pour lui dire 'tiens l'coup,
Tes idées seront président du Sud-Africa

J'aurais été au combat de Mohamed Ali à Kinshasa
Puis, j'aurais été fêter l'indépendance de mes Commores
Dans les bras de mon grand-père avant sa mort
Puis, un petit tour au Paris-Dakar en pleine savane
Pour boycotter l'hélico de Daniel Balavoine
Moi qui aime les vérités de ceux qui portent un nez rouge
J'aurais été crever les pneus d'la moto à Coluche
J'aurais été accueillir Mahomet à Médine
Puis aller voir la Mer Rouge, laisser passer Moïse
J'aurais été à la naissance du fils à Marie
Deux heures après, faire la marche du sel avec Gandhi
J'aurais été m'asseoir auprès de Rosa Parks
Puis à Woodstock pour vivre un live de Jimy Hendrix
J'aurais été à l'anniversaire de la Motown

Jeter les caméras de la dernière interview du commandant Massoud

Pour aller dire à l'équipe d'Adebayor de ne pas prendre la route
J'aurais été à Clichy-sous-Bois
Débrancher le transpo d'EDF avant que Zyed et Bouna arrivent
J'aurais été chez Kunta Kinte ou sur Gorée
Pour leur donner des fusils avant que les colons arrivent
J'aurais été voir les tirailleurs africains
Pour leur dire qu'on traite leurs enfants de sales immigrés
J'aurais été en Autriche,
J'aurais tout fait pour que les parents d'Adolf Hitler ne se rencontrent jamais

Même si j'avais eu le pouvoir de Nakamura
Qu'aurais-je pu pour Haïti, le tsunami ou Katrina?
Qu'aurais-je pu pour l'Alaska?
Tout ce que la nature nous a donné
La nature le reprendra

On cherche souvent le bonheur avec des jumelles
Des fois même on prend des fusils pour aller le chercher dans d'autres planètes
J'te jure, dès qu'on assouvi pas un caprice on se croit seul au monde
Et on fait souffrir ceux qui nous aiment vraiment, tu sais
Donc voilà un bouquet de rime pour mes plus belles roses

Tu sais
Je t'ai vu porter mes croix
Je t'ai vu porter mes larmes
Je t'ai vu porter mes erreurs
Je t'ai vu me sortir des flammes
Toi, ma mère, ma fille, ma femme
T'es la seule rose qui tient debout
Quand tout autour de moi se fane
Je t'ai vu porter mon treillis pour faire face à mes ennemis
Je t'ai vu porter mes nuits pour soigner mes insomnies
J't'ai vu porter mon alliance
Pour le meilleur et pour le pire
Me faire des révérences pour me montrer mon empire
Je t'ai vu fermer les yeux quand j'te faisais souffrir
Demander à Dieu de pouvoir me nourrir
Je t'ai vu porter neuf mois, ce qu'on n'trouve pas au paradis
Je t’ai vu dans mes bras, toi, le vrai sens de ma vie
Je t'ai vu cacher tes larmes pour me voir sourire
Décharger mon arme pour m'empêcher de mourir
Vous m'enlevez ces larmes beaucoup trop près de mes veines
Vous, les clefs de mes chaînes
Moi, je voulais vous dire

Si le soleil ne te souris plus et que la vie ne t'offre que la pluie
Je serai là, je serai là
Si les éclairs te font trembler
Et que la nuit tu n'trouves pas la paix
Je serais là, je serais là

Bien sûr, je sais pertinemment que je pourrai jamais
Rembourser tous les pansements que t'as collé sur mes plaies
Ni effacer toutes les fois où j'ai levé la voix sur toi
Ni oublier toutes ces fois où t'as noyé tes joues pour moi
Tu verras j'ferai du feu pour que tes hivers soient moins dur
J'aurai tes cernes sous mes yeux pour payer toutes tes factures
Y aura du ciment sur mes mains pour bâtir ton avenir
Y aura du sang sur mes mains si un homme te fait souffrir
J'te jure, t'auras la lune à tes pieds si tu me le demandes
Si tu veux une grosse fortune j'aurai une cagoule dans une banque
Si la chance te manque j'irai fouiller le ciel pour t'offrir une étoile filante
Pour toi l'impossible je le fais
Toi mon plus beau trophée
Même si je dois voler le soleil pour t'réchauffer
L'impossible je le fais, pour toi ma vrai fée
T'as toujours été là pour me sauver

Si, si le soleil ne te souris plus et que la vie ne t'offre que la pluie
Je serai là, je serai là
Si les éclairs te font trembler
Et que la nuit tu ne trouves pas la paix

Soprano,"À chaque fois que j'vois ces oiseaux de métal déchirer le ciel
J'repense à mon grand frère et son rêve occidental
Tous les soirs il nous lisait les lettres venues d'la Tour Eiffel
De son pote Moussa, parti pour aller faire une fac de lettre
Il disait qu'il était riche, qu'en France l'argent pousse sur le sol
Là-bas on te soigne gratuitement et même les pauvres vont à l'école
Il faisait rêver mon frère, lui qui voulait d'un autre avenir
J'ai perdu mon plus gros repère quand j'ai entendu mes parents lui dire

Pourquoi tu quittes la maison, là-bas les hommes oublient l'essentiel
Pourquoi tu quittes la maison, ne crois pas que tout est mieux là-bas

Tout le monde, te demande, on a besoin de toi
Ne nous quitte pas, on a besoin de toi
Laisse pas tes parents, l'avenir du pays
Tout le monde te demande on a besoin de toi

Depuis qu'tu nous a quitté, toutes les nuits on vit les yeux ouverts
Depuis qu'tu nous a laissés, tous les jours on attend une petite lettre
L'océan la peut-être mangé, ils savent peut-être pas nager
Le coeur nous a lâché, quand son petit frère est venu nous dire :

Papa je quitte la maison, là-bas les hommes utilisent leurs ailes
Mama je quitte la maison, ne pleure pas ton fils va vivre ses rêves

Tout le monde, te demande, on a besoin de toi
Ne nous quitte pas, on a besoin de toi
Laisse pas tes parents, l'avenir du pays
Tout le monde te demande on a besoin de toi

Maman j'suis de retour, là-bas j'croyais faire mon envol
Après l'école j'taffais au black, non l'argent n'pousse pas sur le sol
Y'a qu'au football là-bas qu'on n'regarde pas la couleur de peau
Au pays d'la liberté, y'a un berger et un troupeau
J'ai vu aussi mon grand frère, il vit avec Moussa loin d'la Tour Eiffel
Ils on stoppé la fac de lettre pour remplir l'assiette
Loin du soleil africain, tous les matins sur le marché
Les larmes aux yeux il se souvient quand vous lui disiez

Pourquoi tu quittes la maison, là-bas les hommes oublient l'essentiel
Pourquoi tu quittes la maison, ne crois pas que tout est mieux là-bas

Tout le monde, te demande, on a besoin de toi

Des devoirs qu'on néglige

Oui mec j'ai connu la dalle, faut qu'mon fils connaisse la graisse
Comme tout le monde j'ai fait du mal, faudra bien que j'me confesse
Avant que tout s'écroule, à ma mère lui faire un building
La vie ça donne des coups laisse-moi faire du body-bulding
Besoin d'avoir du standing, avoir une standing mec, ovation!
Après le ding ding dong mec, pour nos zones
Faire le tour du monde, avec mes camarades
Squater les hits parade, avec mes Kalala!

Pas des bougies d'anniversaire qu'on éteint avec des soupirs

J'ai plus de temps car je dois m'en aller loin de là
Avant que je fly, fly, fly
J'ai besoin de time, time, time
Briller dans le ciel, devenir un symbole
Déployer mes ailes que je m'envole

Oui mec j'ai besoin de time avant que mon âme fly
Tu sais j'ai pas la voiture, moi de Marty Mcfly
Donc dis toi bien qu'c'est maintenant que je dois bien faire mes baills
Si la vie me crève les yeux, t'inquiètes je la vivrais en braille
Y a tellement de choses à vivre, tellement de choses à voir
Moi j'ai besoin de vivre, trop-trop besoin de gloire
Car avant de remplir mon bide, je dois remplir celui du bled
Aider mon bidonville pour qu'il se pince après un rêve

J'ai besoin de voir où le soleil se couche
Quitter ce goût de goudron qu'on a tous dans la bouche
Tellement de promesses à tenir, de choses à accomplir
Besoin d'emmagasiner de magnifiques souvenirs
Mais dis-moi qui au monde sait quand je partirai
Donc laisse moi vivre à l'ombre, sous une belle palmeraie
Avec tous mes potes, ma famille à mes cotés
J'ai besoin de leur love pour savoir que j'ai existé

J'espère que tu portes une coquille car mon rap te lâche des low-kicks
Vas coucher ta petite Dora, je fais la magie noire de Poudlard
Ne m'appelles pas Nakamura, ce soir appelle moi Sylar
Mon rap te lâche des mollards, ouais tout droit venu de Massilia
Transforme ton rap Godzilla en petite Chantale Goya
Appelle moi S.A.W, je suis venu défoncer la prod
Dis-toi que je serai le dernier à brandir l'épée de MacLeod
Oui mon rap est tellement sauvage que tes dents me serviront de bling-bling

Effrite ce que tu veux
Ce soir je vais leur parler de De mon One Love , Kamarade!
C'est le corbeau
Je me rappelle la première fois que je l'ai rencontré
Elle était dans les bras d'un certain Jackson
Elle faisait danser des zombies et allumait le sol
C'était l'époque où sur les ondes y'avait que son côté rock
Moi dans ma chambre je passai mon temps à danser le moonwalk
Chez moi on se prennait pour les Jackson Five
Pour moi elle etait pas d'ici comme E.T. et Alf
Sous le charme de son côté Black Américain
Encore plus quand j'ai vu le côté Jamaïcain
Je la voyais pleurer dans les bras d'un certain Bob
Elle était rasta et ne chantait que le Love
Elle parlait du monde, elle parlait des pauvres
Ses messages ont donnés naissance à ma colombe
Elle faisait de la poésie dans l'hexagone
Jean-Jacques Golman disait d'elle, Qu'elle était bonne
On disait aussi qu'elle adoucissait les moeurs
J'ai pris une feuille en esperant avoir, mon premier flirt
Je me suis promis qu'un jour je lui ferais des gosses
Promesse tenue, Quand j'ai rencontré son côté Hip-Hop

Elle m'a donné la voix
One, one love
Celle qui s'impose à moi
One, one love

Mon Hip-Hop, mon royaume, mon home sweet home
Il falait m'interner après les freestyle de Time Bomb
A cause de deux petits, je mettais mes baggys à l'envers
Grâce à deux grands je n'avais plus peur de crier ""N*que Ta Mère""
Là où je vis les métèques et Mat squattent le banc
Où sont diplômés à l'école du micro d'argent
On traînait à trente comme le Wu de ODB
On rêvait Queens grâce à C.N.N &. M.O.B.B
On croyait que Lacoste était riche grâce à Lino
On était tous les enfants seuls de Puccino
Une pensée poour 2Pac et Biggie
Le débit de mon Corbeau c'est du Bone Thugs-N-Garmony
J'avais la furie et la foi de la F.F
J'étais Mafia K'1 Fry quand Kary parlait de L.A.S
Grâce à Dre j'ai découvert snoop et Slim shady
J'étais fou quand Nas à rejoint la scène Jay-Z
J'ai des frissons quand je te parle de cette époque
Sens-tu mon coeur qui bat quand je te parle de Hip-Hop hein!

Elle m'a donné la voix
One, one love

Leurs femmes écoutent mes sons pour soigner leurs libido

Depuis que Pac m'a passé les clés beaucoup de choses ont changé
J’ai vu la Swija rentrer en tongs dans des boîtes branchées
J’ai vu des fachos fâchés, le top hip-hop saccagé
La variété amochée, les grosses pointures déchaussées
Des tas d’oreilles arrachées, les ongles des MC rongés
Toute ma sueur remboursée, ma mère moins fauchée
J’ai vu le disque en danger, la bourse du monde menacée
Un noir au pouvoir et Oussama toujours caché
La chute du pouvoir d’achat, des CDI délogés
Des CRS à la charge, des étudiants enragés
Des pistons dans les CV, des fils de riches embauchés
Blanche-Neige vend des CD, son nain gouverne l’Élysée
Le proche orient enflammé, l’Afrique toujours affamée
Et nous, on fait la manche avec des Rolex au poignet
Arrête de me jalouser
Eh t’es tellement en bois que pour avoir de la chance tu devrais te toucher

On m'a dit mort après le feat avec Monsieur Eva Longoria
On m’a dit ""t'as changé ta SACEM à trop braquer Ikea""
On m’a dit ""c’est la crise, comment tu fais dans cette guerrilla?""
Mes vibrations sont celle de Katrina, pas celles d’un Nokia
Dès qu'y'a, des piranhas, Sompram’baba flow Cadillac

Avec des parents qui ne parlaient pas un mot français
Des problèmes financiers
Obligé le daron à rentrer du chantier avec le dos cassé
Pour être sûr de ne plus croiser les huissiers
Pour pouvoir les aider, j'ai taffé au lycée
Car on m'a toujours dit que les diplômes ramenaient un métier
J'ai passé mes soirées à bosser d'arrache-pied
Jusqu'au jour où je réussis mes examens avec succès
La fierté de la famille
J'étais la lueur d'espoir
Pour enfin leur faire quitter la cité
Mais malgré mon CV, toutes les portes se fermaient
Ils disaient trop qualifié, moi je dirais trop balzané
Je me suis mis à bosser, agent de sécurité
C'était provisoire pour assurer l'arrivé du bébé
Mais les années passaient, les factures entassaient
Je suis rentré dans une banque cagoulé et j'ai crié

Regarde-moi, je suis la France d'en bas

J'ai grandi loin des milieux aisés
Complètement français, de parents divorcés
A cause d'un père au penchant alcoolisé
J'ai dû stopper les études pour mieux aider la mama
A payer les couches de Johanna
Ma petite sœur à moi, mon bijou, mon karma,
Celle qui me redonne le sourire quand ça va mal
Je la voyais déjà médecin ou avocat
Mais le destin a fait pour ma sœur un autre choix
A 16 ans un bébé, un loyer à payer,
Le père qui s'est barré de peur d'assumer
Des dettes plein le cerveau toujours pas de boulot
Pour payer le lait, les couches de ce petit marmot
Elle se met à tiser pour pouvoir oublier
Le neurone explosé à force de fumer
Un soir de juillet le ventre plein de cachet
Sur le répondeur des pompiers elle se met a crier

Famille embourgeoisée
Je suis l'héritier d'une famille richissime dans le 16ème
Délégué dans une école privée, diplômé, sans forcer
Grâce au don annuel de mon Padre
Toujours bien sappé, Dior, Armanio, ou bien Dolce
Je fais le tour du monde en jet privé
Je fais sauter mes P.V car je déjeune à l'Élysée
Je passe mes soirées au cost, les narines enfarinées
Collectionne les nanas
Les belles Rihanna
Célibataire ravi
Je l'avais dit à Johanna
Mais elle m'a ramené un tout petit bébé

Soprano,"J’ai la peau couleur pétrole donc tu connais ma richesse
Beaucoup trop loin sont mes Comores donc tu connais ma tristesse
Même si j’ai poussé loin de la terre de mes ancêtres
Dis-toi bien que mon archipel, c’est la racine de mon être
Yes, j’suis français et fier de l’être
Mais quand je reçois ces lettres, j’ai le tsunami sur mes pommettes
Dans ma tête, des images refont surface
Le visage de mon grand-père, les mariages au village
Sache que je n’peux oublier l’odeur du poisson grillé
Quand j’allais me promener avec ma mère sur le marché
Pour me réveiller, l’appel pour aller prier
Puis sur un champ on trouvait des cannes à sucre à mâcher
Comment éviter, toute cette pauvreté que leur humilité essaye sans cesse de cacher
Je te vois encore pleurer les douleurs du passé
Pour te soigner, écoute tes enfants chanter

Afrika, gravée dans ma peau et dans mon cœur à tout jamais (À tout jamais)
Afrika, malgré les apparences, t’es présent dans mes pensées (À tout jamais)
Afrika, Même en feux de détresse le monde ne t'as pas compris
Afrika, tes atouts sont tes faiblesses, tes richesses t’ont appauvri

J’ai le cœur et la tête remplis de souvenirs
Après chaque passage au bled, j’m’enrichis grâce à nos terres, j'me le dois de vous le dire
Tout n’est pas si facile ici, mais les gens sont cleans
J’en conclus que la vie n’est pas difficile, on s'la complique
Loin de tristesse et peur, et des visages renfrognés
J'cotoie la richesse des cœurs et les sourires de la pauvreté
Je vois des cicatrices, des plaies dans tous les domaines
J’comprends qu'mes petits caprices sont la solution à leurs problèmes
A l’abri dès mon retour, recommencent les vas-et-vients
Et la vie de tous les jours reprend ses droits en me volant les miens
J’accorde aux miens que des coups de fils les jours de fêtes
Et mes souvenirs les plus précieux sont tous punis dans un coin de ma tête
Comment t’expliquer, j'me sens là-bas comme ici
Pas de regard inférieur, je suis à l’extérieur comme à domicile
C’est ça l'époque fils, des fois la vie nous piège
Français ou Comorien, j'ai le coccyx entre deux sièges

Afrika, gravée dans ma peau et dans mon cœur à tout jamais (À tout jamais)
Afrika, malgré les apparences, t’es présent dans mes pensées (À tout jamais)
Afrika, Même en feux de détresse le monde ne t'as pas compris
Afrika, tes atouts sont tes faiblesses, tes richesses t’ont appauvri

Je suis l'résultat des sacrifices de mes parents
J’me dois de réussir pour que leurs larmes n’aient pas coulées pour rien
J'vis le rêve africain, et je me dois de l’honorer
Afrika est une reine et j'suis là pour la couronner

Au beau milieu de leur rap pourrave
J'entends chanter: ""Hip hip hip Hourra!""
A chaque fois que je rappe le courage de ces hommes qu'ont changé le monde
J'ai changé la donne avec ma diaspora
Loin de ces rappeurs qui rappent à la Dora
Qui me donnent l'impression de rapper qu'avec les couettes de Ingalls Laura

Le moral est beaucoup plus qu'opé
Mon rap ne fait que les choquer
C'est développé, les mots, les flows demande ils méritent beaucoup plus de trophées, Sopra'
J'arrive d-dopé, et toi?
J'suis venu défoncer toutes les portes à l'heure où toutes les choses se corsent
Et pas que sous l'île de Beauté
Si j'avais eu le pouvoir de Nakamura
Je serais parti revivre les freestyles de Ill, Booba, Lino, Le Rat
Ne vois tu pas arriver l'orage à chaque fois que j'lâche les molards
Sur la face des phases à rafales qui parlent à la masse donc dég-dég-dég-dégage

Allez, allez oust!
En bas de nos couplets tu peux y voir un carré rouge
Vous êtes doux comme des agneaux, wesh les gars faites pas les oufs
On attire les critiques des titulaires du banc de touche
Quand on rappe ça fait mouche
Allez, allez, allez oust!

Eh mec, tu nous connais, venus pour tout dégommer
On tire on vise le sommet (Allez, allez oust)
Un flow qui fait décoller, pour tous les frères isolés
Un son pour vous épauler (Allez, allez allez!)

Soprano,"On voit beaucoup de conneries, j'pourrais vous en donner la preuve
Trop de choses horribles si bien que le voyant peut envier l'aveugle
Quand nous nous salissons c'est là qu'ça bug
En cas de trahison la mariée contrariée peut envier la veuve
J'ai vu la folie qu'un gars génère frero
Ici ça choque même plus qu'un quinquagénaire kiffe une Hello Kitty
Pour eux c'est trop limpide
J'attends le jour où la pédophilie sera une discipline aux Jeux Olympiques
J'ai vu des clichés car la paresse est active
Ils disent que pour fêter l'union chez nous les mariés se lapident
J'ai vu des couples se briser quand tout paraissait magique
Des mecs ivres et qui confondent la caresse et la gifle
J'ai vu d'la lâcheté chez ceux qu'on croit célèbre
Leur bassesse quand les élus nous rabaissent aucune de leur voix s'élève
J'ai vu un décor apocalyptique
Et des potos vendre leur âme au diable quand les enchères sont diaboliques

J'ai vu tellement de choses défiler dans son regard
Sourire et larme amour et haine là où les gens passent
Là où les hommes recherchent la paix avec les armes
Naissances, tueries, bravoure et peine et des meilleurs j'en passe
Même si c'est dans la douleur qu'on écrit son histoire
Ne vois-tu pas que le monde est fait de rire et de frayeur
Oui on y voit le pire et le meilleur

Va dire aux extraterrestres de ne pas se fier à nos cartes postales
Pour les accueillir y aura que des cris d'singes au stade
Révise l'histoire si t'as pas compris
Qu'ici trop regardent le monde avec l'œil de verre de Jean-Marie
J'ai vu l'anorexie, des complexes car ici
Trop regardent le monde avec l'œil d'un paparazzi
J'ai vu des jeunes prêts à tout pour réussir
Ici trop regardent le monde avec l'œil de Secret Story
J'ai vu des armes de l'Est dans des sacs d'écoliers
J'ai vu Superman voler mais qu'sur les pays pétroliers
J'ai vu en en Suède un mec jouer à GTA
J'ai vu le bling-bling de Nicolas nous coûter le triple A
J'ai vu le diable jouer ses gammes
J'ai vu Islam et terrorisme devenir un amalgame
J'ai vu des propos politiques avec une moustache hitlérienne
Le monde est conduit par des mecs au taux d'alcoolémie de Sue Ellen

J'ai vu tellement de choses défiler dans son regard
Sourire et larme amour et haine là où les gens passent
Là où les hommes recherchent la paix avec les armes
Naissances, tueries, bravoure et peine et des meilleurs j'en passe
Même si c'est dans la douleur qu'on écrit son histoire
Ne vois-tu pas que le monde est fait de rire et de frayeur
Oui on y voit le pire et le meilleur

J'ai vu de l'injustice à Guantanamo
Mais pas de nucléaire sous le sol irakien
J'ai vu des politiques qui souhaitent la mort à nos
Semblables et pas d'élus pour sauver les miens
J'ai vu des hypocrites qui nous mènent en bâteau
Et puis nous couler pour nous éloigner de la rive
A l'heure où tout le monde oublie les liens familiaux
Qu'il y a entre Isaac et Ismaïl

J'ai vu tellement de choses défiler dans son regard
Sourire et larme amour et haine là où les gens passent
Là où les hommes recherchent la paix avec les armes
Naissances, tueries, bravoure et peine et des meilleurs j'en passe

Perché sur ma planète paraît que l'critiques fusent
Rien à péter j'prépare mes missiles scud
Mec loyal cherche pas d'similitude
J'plane comme un aigle royal pendant qu'les pies discutent
Avoue qu'c'est dingue et puis qu'c'est bien nous on progresse sans arrêt
Je vous préviens j'viens prendre un flow com-com-complètement barré
Quoi ? Le client est roi? C'est pas moi qui vais l'avaler
J'lui vole sa couronne et puis transforme ton auditeur en valet
Les rappeurs ont chopé le virus du manque de cash mais
Cette maladie se soigne qu'avec du liquide et un cachet
Après cette phase on m'dira qu'j'suis un moqueur né
Pourtant c'est cette même ordonnance qui a soigné les finances du Dr. Dre
J'me dois de le dire, je m'en tape de leur bla-blas j'ai vu pire
Je fais sauter tous les barrages, pas besoin de kalash, ni-même de famas
Mes tires sortent de ma bouche et parfois je fais pire
J'suis venu pour faire un carnage et puis fuir
Je n'ai pas besoin de bla-blas, ni même de leur passe-droit
Ni même de leur case nazes, moi j'rappe comme ça me chante

Rapper ou chanter, l'important est d'être vrai
Avec tes idées, viens pas me menotter

Ne m'demande pas de me freiner, non poto ne me demande pas de changer
Quand je commence à rapper ou à chanter tu découvre la météo de mes pensées
Dansée, pleurée ou révoltée, ma musique a toujours été celle des opprimés
Je les vois jalouser ma liberté, derrière les barreaux de leurs street débilité
Ça fait des années que j'ai aiguisé ce style de fêlé
Ils sont fascinés, puis t'es déprimé face à mon CV
Rendez-vous après l'été, ce n'est pas près de s'arrêter
Bientôt le nouvel album de ma Psykatra! Ok
D'accord je reprends le débit sans limite mes gimmicks font crier
Les zéniths et l'Europe et l'Afrique et les blocs et publics par milliers
A l'heure où les ventes de disques sont pathé-thé-thétiques
Qu'on prend des-des risques avec mon équipe
Ça chante et ça kick, ça-ça ti-ti-tirs donc fuyez
Je les vois tous bâillonnés par les commentaires de Booska-P
Je les vois tous complexés par ces connes en pleine puberbté
Si être vrai c'est se mentir, hey, laisse-moi être faux pour être libre

J'rappe comme ça me chante, je chante comme ça me rappe

J'fais d'la musique comme un vrai schyzo
Que j'rappe ou chante, le biz' perd les eaux
Je les entends parler de Soprano
Normal mon dernier album les traite d'tous les noms d'oiseaux

Je débarque, et déboule, me démarque des fous
Pas de doute et pas besoin de les pomper
Ils divaguent, sont tous dans le vague et le flou
Rien à foutre, je ne fais que dans le concret
Non je ne marche pas à tâtons, soyez pas cons
Mais bon partons, laissez tomber
J'rappe comme ça me chante, rappe comme ça me tente
Ce n'est vraiment pas la peine de me dompter

Poto je chantais bien avant l'époque de Da-Daddy K
Des styles différents comme les types du groupe de Ma-Manu Key
Ton Beats by Dre est plastiqué quand je commence à kicker
Entre deux styles j'suis à cheval, mais t'inquiète j'suis un bon jockey

T'inquiète j'suis dopé, j'évolue
Mais si le flow est méconnu
C'est pour choquer qu'on est venu
T'as plus qu'à monter le volume

Soprano,"Yeah, bienvenue dans le labo de deux passionnés, qu'ont fusionnés
Pour donner le tournis à tous ces fous qui disait que Marseille avait coulé
J’viens leurs rouler dessus les rouer de coup de fouets et de flow de fou
Vas-y le couz’, à toi

Bienvenue là où les flow sont dévoilés sans arrêt
Déballés sans cesse on ramène des phrases complexes
On amène des phases qu’on n’peut comparer
Des fois même complètement barrées décalez-vous ça va faire boom
Allez couz’, à toi

Bienvenue là où les flows sortent d’Édouard Toulouse
Où les coups de blues et les coups de boules s’écoutent
Là où le fond et la forme roucoulent sur des prods lourdes
Où ça dégoute la concurrence qui veulent en découdre
À toi

Bienvenue dans notre labo loin des traitres et des collabos
Loin des mecs qui mènent en bateau pas de cadeaux
J’me démène my men loin des mêmes qui visent le magot

Car-pe Diem et les Psy 4!

Ok poto j’arrive et pose
La bonne formule qui explose
Tous les micros, toutes les prods et tous les mythos, tous les faux
Avec des punch’ et des proses, aussi rapide que Busta, pour les mecs en Lacoste
Ou bien les beaux-gosses en costards
Oui c’est un simple constat
Les partisans de la paix reçoivent des bombes et les gosses cannent
Car pour baiser les pauvres, ils sont malades à la Strauss-Kahn
Prix Nobel de la haine et de la guerre qu’attisent de grosses flammes
Artistes dans le massacre ils mériteraient des oscars
On bosse tard et on s’bat, les obstacles
Mais n’ose pas aller là où l’innovation est devenue un obstacle
Un instant, je m'installe, mon instinct est bestial
Oui quand il s’agit de mettre du MC dans mon casse-dalle
Quand il s’agit de rapper, taffer, frapper sans compassion
Mais dans les règles de l’art tant que c’est fait avec passion
Pas de cadeau ni de vieux récit dans le labo, (Quoi?)

J'répète : Pendez-les, pour ces rappeurs j'suis le Ku Klux Klan
Si t'es Luke, j'suis ton père donc vas-y excuse-toi

Mon flow fait des suçons avec Gilette Mach +3
Donc dég-dégage de là quand débarque des phases de barges
Venus découper toutes les têtes qui dépassent de ceux qui ne savent
Que faire que des clashes, oui qui me les cassent avec leurs histoires de coke et bédave

J'vous l'ai dit c'est véridique que mon équipe bosse
Que des rimes inédites, je débite, les beats morflent
J'déb-débite et riposte, loin des débiles des idoles

Oui j'pose et je kicke fort
Même en terrain miné mon ami je t'élimine j'ai plus de milles phases
J'vous l'ai dit les gars, là j'ai mis les gaz, illé-illégal
Que des rimes fines qui défient l’État
Qui défient aussi les pipelettes

Soprano,"J'ai pas de p'tites coupures, ils me comprennent par crainte du Seigneur
Et vu la tournure que les choses prennent, je crains le pire, espère le meilleur
Une fois parti dans ma lancée, le mal me ronge
Quand j'suis plongé dans mes pensées, j'ai tendance à m'noyer dans mes songes
C'est ça le malheur
Y'a rien de comparable, les hommes n'ont plus de valeur
J'regrette celui qui valait cent carats
Ils se croient imparables
Puis s'imaginent qu'on n'y voit rien quand ils considèrent nos pays comme des boîtes à rats
C'est ça dans l'rap on parle on kiffe la rime
Pour l'oseille on se bouge mais les oreilles on s'bouche quand les estomacs crient famine
Je le dis et le pense
La beauté de nos paroles
N'a d'égale que la laideur de notre indifférence
Y'a pas de confusion pas même un peu d'ivresse
Je donne mon opinion, tire des conclusions du haut de ma petitesse
Motivé comme pas deux je manie vos verbes
Mes couplets vous font des baisers baveux avec la langue de Molière
Je mène mon combat jusqu'à l'épuisement
C'est la richesse de notre culture contre la pauvreté de leurs jugements
Si parce que je m'appelle Mohamed le statut de français je le mérite pas
Dites à François Hollande d'aller se présenter aux Pays-Bas
Avant tout sachez qu'à défaut de l'avoir à l'extérieur
Je la recherche à l'intérieur la paix
À l'heure où la violence prolifère
Je repense à Zied mort dans un braquage à cause d'une balle policière
Le chant des bastos nous berce écoute
La violence est une drogue dure dans les rues de Marseille beaucoup de nos frères se shootent
Si t'as pas le cran d'aller au bout fais pas le bourreau
Faudra assumer le fait de te faire fumer comme une Marlboro
Je m'interroge sur la cécité de la justice
Et me dit qu'elle est loin d'être aveugle
Elle ne voit que ce qu'elle veut voir c'est triste
Y'a trop d'anomalies
J'annonce la couleur et ta défaite comme ce jury raciste qui sourit à Bonaly
J'te jure c'est fou tout ça me sidère
Mate bien ce qui m'énerve plus que tout c'est qu'ils nous considèrent
Comme des moins que rien
Et toutes ces merdes m'énervent
J'aimerais que sur leurs canaux nos paroles aient du poids comme celles de Pierre Ménès
Tu connais je suis le mec le plus cool de la Terre
Homme de raison j'peux devenir le plus fou quand j'la perds
Je suis ce gars sans doute têtu qui n'adore pas la thune
Man pour l'instant ma bouche s'est tue parole à ma plume

Désolé pour le dérangement ce soir ma plume est ivre
Non pas de cellule de dégrisement ce soir ma plume est libre
Libre de dégueuler ses sentiments sur la place publique
À l'heure où la liberté est une expression zemmouristique
Noirs sont les désirs quand il s'agit de leur justice
Celle qui met chez nous le stress du clip de Justice
Pourquoi j'suis si triste
Comment ne pas l'être quand je vois que les hommes cherchent le Paradis sous les pieds de Iblis
Cherchent l'armistice
Intérieur auprès d'une femme qui n'a pas les neurones d'Afida Turner
Ouais comme Will Smith
J'suis à la recherche du bonheur pour enfin prendre de la hauteur
Ou pire, atterrir comme Taïg Khris
Mec en temps de crise faut faire des sous
L'Afrique crie famine
La crise a fait qu'on est encore plus sourd
Ça crie au secours car le pouvoir d'achat baisse
L'Euro c'est le régime minceur de l'Europe voilà pourquoi on n'a plus de Grèce
Je presse la détente de ma plume à chaque fois que je stresse
Ou quand la Une entoure la vérité d'un peu de brume
Oui j'ai mis dans l'urne un bulletin SOS anti Jean-Marie
Ils ont mis l'Afrique en cloque et se prennent pour Cheb Mami
Non ne pleure pas Mamie je suis là pour vous honorer
Les darons étaient des kings
Les colons des Conrad Murray
Et j'ai juré que ma plume n'aurait jamais d'Alzheimer
Si la vérité est une mode j'suis son designer
Comme Teddy Riner
J'suis venu remporter des médailles
Et que ma famille ne soit plus sur la paille
Et grâce à mes bails faut qu'elle graille
Braille, rage, autant que tu veux
Rien à foutre de ton rap jeu
Faut du liquide, liquide chez moi pour pouvoir éteindre le feu
Ouais ouais poto j'ai grillé tous les feux
Que les puristes ont mis sur ma route
Je conduis une ambulance alors vos codes rien à foutre
En plus, ici ça joue les Pablo
Ils portent tous une chemise hawaïenne
Pas comme Tony mais comme Gbagbo
Ras le bol de ces clichés qu'on a sur le dos
Déjà qu'ici on a les mains sales même avec lodo
Marre de voir nos darons investir dans le Loto
Pourquoi ça coupe?
On est à l'époque du serato
Merde, je crois que ma plume a bu un coup d'trop
Faut qu'elle décuve
On va la prendre pour une alcoolo

Soprano,"On tend pas l'autre joue on compte rendre les gifles
Proche de la fin, en comptant qu'les chiffres
Pas besoin d'être muet pour en comprendre les signes

Me parlez pas d'swag, j'préfère graille grâce à la classe ouvrière
Ceux qui croient en l'égalité ne sont que simples d'esprit
On nous verra comme tel le jour où on soigne la mort chez le médecin légiste
Putain de vie bizarre, il pleut du liquide
Mais les vies d'chien n'trouvent pas refuge dans les niches fiscales

Fucking rap game c'est l'Carpe au rapport bâtard
Du fond d'ma crique, putain d'nègre, j'passe le bonsoir
Derrière ma plume, niggas, j'ai planqué la foudre
J'voulais parler d'amour mais dans nos rues y'a comme une odeur d'poudre
Une corde, une poutre, un pendu sur la place publique
Spectaculaire époque ou même la mort génère un public
Pétasse peu pudique, au nom de la femme libre
Putain d'théories d'merde gravées dans leurs livres

Et si on fait les choses, qu'on a une cause
Toujours à défendre, peu d'temps pour une pause

Ils pensent parler à des animaux comme Docteur Dolittle
S'en sortir c'est possible, sans sport et gros single
Dix piges, ça pense à l'argent aussi jeune ?
Résultat on a plus de péchés que dans Seven
On s’entre-tue à cause de frontières imposées
Et Place Vendôme, ils exhibent nos diamants en guise de trophées
Nous voir ça les rend malades
Ils ont dû attraper cette rage avec la viande hallal

J'viens en temps d'guerre, parce que la paix s'trouve six pieds sous terre
Oublie la trêve j'me trimbale avec une pelle, j'enterre mes rêves
Vu les risques j'vise l'essentiel
La chance s'fait rare y'a plus un rond au pied de l'arc-en-ciel
Ici les blessures saignent, quand les temps sont sales
Les temps sont barges, on nous parle de plan social
C'est grave comme si c'était si simple, on récolte ce que l'on sème
Plaide coupable et victime du système

Et si on fait les choses, qu'on a une cause
Toujours à défendre, peu d'temps pour une pause

Toujours à défaut, peu d'temps pour une pause
C'que vous pensez tout bas
Notre silence en touche un mot
C'que vous pensez tout bas
Notre silence en touche un mot

D'ici j'les entends parler tout bas, trop de méfiance et de coups-bas
De propos vides de sens, mon innocence ne peut être coupable
J'me méfie des traîtres, une personne qui manque de confiance en soi
Par définition pourrait être la pire des traitres
J'suis venu rapper tout haut car mon phrasé est pur
Ceux qui parlent dans leur barbe ne sont juste bons qu'à raser les murs
Averse de sincérité sur le sillon
J'arrive et crache mes vérités le rap s'abreuve de mes postillons

J'ai toujours visé le crâne quand ma plume crachait du plomb
Plutôt San Goku que Gad quand mon flow devient blond
J'rappe le fond de Gandhi avec la forme de Cassius Clay
Dans l'game les bandits c'est comme Bernard qu'ils sont musclés
Comme Wesley je snipe tous ces suceurs de sang
J'suis l'haut-parleur de ceux qui rêvent de milieux décents
J'fais pas l'apologie des polos chics ni des gros logis
Mes étoiles sont aux Comores pas sur le short d'Apolo Creed

Et si on fait les choses, qu'on a une cause

La vie ça met des claques comme Tyson dans Very Bad Trip
Ça pousse à bout comme le père de Malcolm dans Breaking Bad, vite
J'ai besoin d'une pause
De me payer des bons moments avec tous ceux qui me sont chérs car ça n'a pas de prix
Mon coeur palpite à chaque fois que je suis avec ma p'tite
Loin de ma vie d'artiste, partir
Avec on fils de l'autre côté de l'Atlantique
Ou faire du foot en salle avec tous mes galactics

Marre de faire la course aux loves
Marre d'avoir la tête sous l'eau alors que j'visais haut de ma vie de môme
De voir leur idéaux, ainsi que tous leurs clichés beauf sur la vie des halls dans leurs vidéos
Toujours entre riche et pauvre, flics et fauves
Les p'tits qui multiplient les fautes, quittent l'école
Se butent et justifient les pauvres
Triste époque vite et illi-illico j'demande une pause

Un arrêt sur image sans que rien ne s'y oppose

Hey! J'ai besoin d'une pause
Désamorcer ma vie avant que mon cerveau explose
J'ai trop abusé sur la dose
Besoin qu'une carte postale soit mon lieu de désintox'
Poto je n'ai plus la force, entre le boulot et les gosses
J'ai l'impression d'être dans la série Oz
J'ai besoin d'être fly comme le mec à Amber Rose
Besoin de dire adios, Kader qu'est-ce que tu me proposes?

Sopra j'ai envie de prendre le large, m'enfuir loin des bâtiments
Fuir loin des gars qui envient, vite
Car ces temps-ci c'est plus comme avant ici
Ça devient navrant, ici le mal nous anéanti, oui
Et marre des non-dits de monsieur l'agent qui rit en me regardant
Jugeant que j'ai le mauvais profil
Ça joue les OG do-orénavant, ça s'bute pour de l'argent

Hommage a toutes les M.A.M.A.N

Je traite les femmes comme des princesses car je fût élever par une reine
Je me fous de faire pleurer la leur tant que je fais pas pleurer la mienne
Dès que je trouve pas un t-shirt directe elle le ramène
C'est pire qu'une magicienne, je fais un trou elle le raccommode
Dis le a personne, je cache même des trucs dans sa commode
J'irais pas jusqu'à braquer le podologue

Pas de sacoche Lancel, ni de sacs LV

Elle t'aurait mis une lime dans le gâteau pour que tu scies tes barreaux
Pour elle la bande à Sarko c'est la race après le crapaud
Ouais c'est comme sa qu'elle dit

Mon plus belle exemple de dignité hé
Comment me faire pardonné, hé

Si tu lui portes les se-cour

Ma mère c'est ta mère, si tu lui pousses le caddy

Soprano,"Sur une arme les doigts noués
Pour agresser, serrer les poings
Mais nos paumes sont pour aimer
Y'a pas de caresse en fermant les mains

Longues, jointes en une prière
Bien ouvertes pour acclamer
Dans un poing les choses à soustraire
On ne peut rien tendre les doigts pliés

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Mécanique simple et facile
Des veines et dix métacarpiens
Des phalanges aux tendons dociles
Et tu relâches ou bien tu retiens

Et des ongles faits pour griffer
Poussent au bout du mauvais côté
Celui qui menace ou désigne
De l'autre on livre nos vies dans des lignes

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
(Suffit de rien dix fois rien)
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
A peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Un simple geste d'humain
Quand se desserrent ainsi nos poings
Quand s'écartent nos phalanges
Sans méfiance, une arme d'échange
Des champs de bataille en jardin

Le courage du signe indien
Un cadeau d'hier à demain
Rien qu'un instant d'innocence
Un geste de reconnaissance
Quand on ouvre comme un écrin

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Soprano,"Toi et moi ça a tout de suite été le coup de cœur
Malgré nos différences les soucis et les coups de gueule
On a cru en nous, en notre coup de foudre
Saïd c’est toi et moi le reste on s'en fout
Avec la patience aujourd'hui nous voilà unis
Devant Dieu et nos familles on s'est dit oui pour la vie
Fusionnels dès le début
J'ai jamais aimé si vite
En l’amour je ne croyais plus
Mais quelques mois plus tard le rêve devient un cauchemar
J'apprends que mon cœur de jour en jour s’affaiblit
Trop belle était l’histoire je n'ai plus d’échappatoire
Il me faut un donneur au plus vite

J’ai juré devant Dieu
De faire la guerre à tes côtés
Oui de ne jamais déserter
Face à tes problèmes de santé
Bébé sans toi je suis rien du tout
La vérité
Tu es cette chaise sous mes pieds quand une corde me tient le cou
Kenza, t'as toujours été le pansement de toutes mes plaies
Quand dans ma tête c’était le feu
Tu venais jouer le pompier
Aujourd’hui je ne suis pas prêt
D’entendre les médecins
Pour toi je me battrais
Jusqu’à ce que Joe Black me tende la main

Je sais mais le temps passe, je me demande ce que tu fais
Tu n'es plus présent je me sens comme abandonnée
Sûrement avec tes potes à trainer dans les halls
Pendant que je porte cette maladie seule sur mes épaules
J'attends toujours que sonne ce foutu bipper
Je vois la fin tu es absent
Et j’ai si peur
L’espoir fait vivre
Mais d’après les docteurs, il en reste si peu
Je dois me préparer au pire

Prends ma main
Serre-la fort
J'ai si peur
Reste auprès de moi mon cœur

Prends ma main
Serre-la fort
J'ai si peur
Reste auprès de moi mon cœur

Allô c’est moi, mon bipper viens de sonner, j’ai un donneur

À ton réveil je voudrais que tu saches l’honneur que j'ai eu d’être à tes côtés
La chance de m'être levé à côté d’une telle beauté
J’ai passé les cinq plus belles années de ma vie
Mais l’ai-je mérité
Loin de vivre au paradis
Quand j’y réfléchi avec du recul
Nos engueulades, nos prises de bec, ridicules
Aujourd’hui j’en rigole avec une larme au coin de l’œil bébé
Repense à tout ça pour pouvoir faire ton deuil bébé
Pardonne-moi de ne pas avoir été à tes côtés
Mais quand j’ai su que j'étais compatible
Je n’ai pas hésité, 1 seconde à être le donneur
Désormais c'est pour la vie que je suis ton coup de cœur

Prends ma main
Serre-la fort
J'ai si peur
Reste auprès de moi mon cœur

Prends ma main
Serre-la fort
J'ai si peur

Qu’il était beau et riche, qu’il attirait toutes les gonzesses
Que dans son temps les jeunes avaient plus de politesse

Jupe léopard, maquillage de film d’horreur

Avec ce petit jeune qu’est majeur depuis 24 heures
Et là d’un coup un homme monte sur la table
Avec son accent bizarre il nous traite de macaques
Il nous dit qu’à l’époque il était formidable
Puis il tombe dans mes bras en pleurant qu’il est fort minable

Je te vois sur ce banc
Dans ce tout petit jardin
Le soleil nous sourit
Et le vent caresse tes cheveux châtains
Je m’accroche à chaque syllabe
Que tes lèvres jettent
Et mes yeux font les paparazzi
Sur tous tes gestes
Je me rappelle tes premiers pas, tes premiers mots
De ces couches qui t’faisaient marcher comme un sumo
T’avais ce petit air, innocent et fier
Te petits yeux clairs
Prouvaient que ta mère était une bijoutière
Mais ma fille, pourquoi tu te lèves, pourquoi tu pars?
Mais ma fille, pourquoi tout d’un coup tout devient noir?

Je dors que dans ta chambre
Au milieu de tes poupées
C’est peut-être pour ça
Que ta Maman m’a quitté
Mais rien à foutre
Ils comprendront jamais notre relation
Ils auront beau crier que j’perds la raison

Oui toi tu es mon sang, ma perfusion

Comment faire la monnaie surtout comment la dépenser

Métro, boulot, dodo, la femme et les bébés
Trop besoin de trouver la paix avant de vouloir tout plaquer

Des tas d'causes et puis que tu pourchassais

Et puis tous les apartheids

C'est fou même au parquet
On ne voit que des sourires coupables avec des larmes innocentes
Réalise qu'ils ont cloué ton clapet
Par peur que tu ne les pénalise

Trop d'acteur, beaucoup de bandits
Qui se jouent du droit et se font passer pour des victimes

Inégalité entre la petite délinquance et puis les grands députés
On est pas tous logés à la même enseigne
Mais sur le même pied d'égalité amputé
Pas de limite et puis pas de pitié
C'est la loi du plus fort
Mort est celui qui mord à l'appât
On le voit dans les hall, les couloirs
C'est évident, ma foi
L'homme au pouvoir est un loup pour l'homme qui n'en a pas
Ils sont tous omnibulés par tous leurs dollars
Au lieu de voir l'individu par la couleur de l'âme
Ou la couleur des larmes

Témoignent de la douleur de l'homme

Que j'ai compris que t'étais vraiment plus là
Tu sais, j'ai toujours cru que j'allais enterrer mes parents

Encore une étoile qui vient de s'éteindre
La nuit devient de plus en plus sombre
Comment consoler cette mère
Qui sait ce soir ce qu'est la fin du monde
On enterre ses parents mais pas ses enfants
C'est ce qu'elle m'a dit en pleurant dans mes bras
Ici c'est la Saint Valentin
Les kalash ont encore offert des roses
Au pied d'une tombe, une rose arrosée
Dans les larmes d'une mère victime d'un cœur dévalisé
S-O-S-O-S, S-O-S-O-S-O-S
Combien de fils faut-il encore perdre
Pour qu'ils répondent enfin à l'appel
Faut-il que ça parte guerre civile
Ou bien pire, en génocide?
Ici les armes ne sont pas factices
Et nos p'tits anges se diabolisent
Le paradis est sous ses pieds
Pourtant on lui fait vivre l'enfer
Encore un fils qu'on enterre
Entend les cris d'une mère en détresse

Yeah, dis-moi comment vivre avec ça?

On enterre son père mais pas son mari
C'est c'qu'elle m'a dit en pleurant dans mes bras
Ici c'est la Saint Valentin
Les kalash ont encore offert des roses
Papa où t'es, papa où t'es?
C'est ce qu'il pleure, alcoolisé
Dans un bar du quartier
Il se promet d'aller tous les shooter
S-O-S-O-S, S-O-S-O-S-O-S
Ici la vengeance est un boomerang
Et les armes à feu la seule langue
Pour répondre à cette violence
Que le système ne peux plus masquer
Des billets dans la poche d'une balance
Il démarre en deux roues casqué
Une voiture à l'arrêt, une détente qui se presse
Encore un fils qu'on enterre
Entends une autre mère en détresse

Yeah, dis-moi comment vivre avec ça?

Besoin de payer le restau' tous les soirs à mes khos

Madame veut la dernière tenue de Nicole Richie (oui!)
Avec les accessoires, bracelet, collier, sac assortis (oh oui!)
Après deux-trois heures à tourner dans la même boutique
Elle me dit, ""Bébé je veux tout ça mais sauf ce haut de bitches""
Fous la robe de mariée qu'avait Monica Bellucci (oui)
La lune de miel romantique sur les plages de Tahiti (oh oui!)
La baraque avec jardin, garage, piscine, terrasse, cuisine,
Des chambres à haut standing (Surtout avec un immense dressing)
Mon petit faut pas qu'ils deviennent enfants gâtés-pourris
Mais il leur faut du Ralph Lauren et du Burberry (oh oui!)
Des vacances en famille chez Donald, Mickey et Mini
Les anniversaires, les Noël, des cadeaux à n'plus en finir
Les impôts sont là (ouais)
Taxe foncière est là (ouais)
Les amis, va falloir oublier Marbella
Il nous reste la Ciotat, avec DJ Houss négro!

Soprano,"Attends, avant de commencer l'album
Mej tu peux mettre un peu de l'encens, yes
Nico tu peux monter un peu ma voix
OK!

Que Dieu pardonne mes écarts, mes excès, mes manquements,
Mes yoyo dans la prière, mes péchés, mes battements
De cœur pour la musique, pour la chair, pour l'argent
Qu'il accepte mon repenti avant le dernier jugement
Qu'il me donne l'endurance pour combattre mes démons
Qu'il me donne la patience quand je traverse le mauvais temps
Qu'il me donne le courage, la force et le ciment
Pour bâtir à mes enfants le bunker d'un régiment
Oui je rappe depuis mes 15 ans
La chanson m'a évité la prison
Une pensée pour Papou on t'attends à la maison
Les procès, les décès, la rue nous a bien baisé
Mais la vie, c'est comme le rugby, t'as le droit à plusieurs essais
Donc j’essaie même blessé par les mauvaises relations
A cause de tous ces couteaux j'ai le dos d'un hérisson
Mais t'inquiètes, j'ai grandi
Je ne suis pas de ceux qui se vengent
Mais plutôt de ceux qui croient en Dieu, trop gentil,
Trop naïf, voilà mon plus gros défaut
Mon grand cœur, une gamelle qu'a rassasié des corbeaux
Oui j'en souffre, oui j'en pleure car je suis quelqu'un d'entier
Si la richesse est dans le cœur dis toi que beaucoup m'ont ruiné
J'ai souri à la mort croyant que la vie me snobait
Dieu merci ma famille m'a prouvé que je me trompais
J'ai connu les coups de crasse, les angoisses
Mais j'espère que ça roule pour toi mais sans joint de culasse
Des kilos d'Exomil pour camoufler mes paniques
Un sourire factice pour cacher mon Titanic
J'ai rappé mes blessures, ma haine envers l'être humain
J'ai pleuré tout mon encre pour le sol africain
J'ai chanté le malaise de toute la France d'en bas
Je suis l'enfant du peuple donc tu connais mon combat
Même si j'ai fait de l'argent, j'oublie pas mes HLM
J'ai toujours été sincère, j'ai toujours été moi même
J'ai rappé pour la street avec des flow fantastiques
J'ai toujours fait le boulot et ça sur n'importe quel feet
C'était pas pour le rallye c'était pas pour la couronne
C'était pas pour être crédible car je le suis pour ma daronne
J'ai promis au daron d’honorer ses sacrifices
Pour devenir un bonhomme son histoire c'est ma notice
Ma famille et mes amis que j'ai depuis la 6ème
Je suis riche de leur présence plus que de la Sacem
Les artifices du show bizz ne collent pas à mes principes
Faudrait que je fasse le voyou pour plaire à des journalistes
Donc fuck you
J'dis ça avec enthousiasme
Je ne serai pas la caricature de tous vos fantasmes
Je garde mon image, mes principes, mes valeurs
En hommage à cette jeunesse qui se bat pour ses couleurs
A l'heure ou le FN a brandi le flambeau
A l'heure ou le FN me veut dans un grand zoo
Je combat le racisme et toutes ces idées grotesques
Prend garde à la banane à la Dani Alves
Au moins pour Inaya, Luna, Lenny
Au moins pour ceux qui croient en Cosmopolitanie",Préface,2014

Passionné de romance elle attend
Que le destin lui fasse un petit signe, que la chance
Lui sourit enfin
Oui, à elle qui a trop eu son cœur aux urgences
Mais une péniche arrive à contresens
Deux regards se croisent par inadvertance
Elle tombe sous le charme et puis elle brise ce silence
Et ciao vengo di France
Allons prendre un verre, faisons connaissance
Ils finissent au Pullman puis elle lui chante à l'oreille tendrement

Mais une péniche arrive à contre sens
Deux regards se croisent par inadvertance
Et d'un coup c'est le coup d'foudre
Oui son cœur devient fou

Ça ne parle que de femme et de gros sous
D'une destination pour le mois d’août
Avec un bon thé marocain à la main je me sens vivre, ouais ouais

Les désillusions et les coups bas

Toujours avec mes vrais gars, les mêmes depuis le dépars
On endurcit les fondations pour construire les étages
Et oui, et oui, et oui la vie nous a pas fait de cadeau
Une pensée aux frérots qui sont partis trop tôt
Rien à cirer, rien à battre réveillez moi quand tout s'arrête
En altitude y a assez d'air pour plus me prendre la tête
Sachez qu'la plume est bien plus forte que l’épée

Malgré les années à chanter mes drames, tu m'es resté fidèle
J'ai noirci des feuilles aussi blanches que mes nuits pour alléger un cœur trop lourd
Tu as toujours su lire entre mes lignes, sous mes faux airs de clown

On a connu des bas, des hauts mais pourquoi s'en faire
Ce qui nous tue pas nous rend fier

Mes sourires, mes larmes
Vous ont uni toutes ces nuits
Nos sourires, nos larmes
Nous ont uni pour l'infini

Tu me dis souvent que j'ai soigné tes plaies, que j'ai répondu à tes SOS
Mais si seulement tu savais, tu es la force de mes faiblesses

On a connu des bas, des hauts mais pourquoi s'en faire
Ce qui nous tue pas nous rend fier

Ouais j'viens manger ouais t'inquiète
Alors par quoi j'vais commencer

Si l'amour des tiens est ta seule quête
Si tu apprends de c'que tu regrettes
Si tu souhaite au monde entier ce que tu te souhaite
Si tu te relève 11 fois après 10 défaites
Si lorsqu'on t'offre un secret tu sais te taire
Si malgré ta fierté tu reconnais tes torts
Si tu sors une larme pour ceux qui te sont cher

Si tu es vrai au milieu de tout ces faussaires
Si tu te vends à ta juste valeur dans ce monde de la surenchère
Si avec peux tu as le cœur comblé
Si tu trouve l'équilibre au milieu de tout ces déséquilibrés
Si tu te juge avant de pointer du doigt
Si face à l'insulte tu restes courtois
Si face à la maladie tu restes un homme de foie
Si tu offre de la chaleur à un cœur froid
Si tu crois la deuxième chance, si tu crois en toi
Même quand ça part dans tout les sens tu restes droit
Si tu porte c'que Dieu te donne avec le sourire au lèvres
Si tu arroses avec ta sueur tes plus beaux rêves
Alors quoi qu'on dise
Tu seras un homme mon fils

Nan bébé j'ai pas finis
J'fais juste la der, ouais, pour les petits, j'fais vite, ok

Si pour toi l'amour est un voyage sans escale
Si tu portes le poids de ta famille jusqu'à l'hernie discale
Si tu provoque la baraka quand la poise t'escorte
Et qu'tu vends de la sagesse sur le marché de la discorde
Si le blabla de ton cœur est ton seul discours
Si la bravoure de tes principes répond aux appels au secours
Si tu évite les vautours qui te tournent autour
Si tu te pose sur une branche qui en vaut l'détour
Si c'est dans tes luttes intérieur que tu gagnes tes combats
Si c'est le mépris et la haine que ton cœur bat
Si t'encaisse les coups bas avec de la hauteur
Si tu pardonnes mais sans la maladie d'alzheimer
Si tu ne te surestime pas
Si le regard des autres n'influe pas sur celui que tu portes sur toi
Si le superficiel valorise pas ton habillage
Si ton charme naturel remplit ta trousse de maquillage
Si tu restes à mes côtés dans les moments douloureux
Ce jour ou la vie me donnera des coups de vieux
Si tu porte un treillis devant ce petit berceau
Si tu es aussi forte que celle qui te ressemble comme 2 gouttes d'eau
Alors quoi qu'on dise
Tu seras une femme ma fille
Vous serez des femmes mes filles

C'est bon j'ai finis, ah merde, attends 2 secondes, juste un truc, j'arrive

Pourquoi aller en concert, tu m'as tout mis sur Youtube

La vie m'a pris autant qu'elle m'a donné
Avec le temps elle m'a appris à sourire autrement
Parfois pour me cacher, parfois pour figer l'instant
Ces souvenirs qui nous rappellent tout ce qui est tendre
Ces cicatrices qui rappellent ces chemins à ne plus prendre
Ce passé qu'on s'essouffle à rattraper
Pire, ce passé qu'on s'efforce d'effacer car on a tous des secrets bien cachés dans le regard
Ces déceptions amoureuses qui nous ont fait montés la garde
Tous ces secrets de famille beaucoup trop lourds à porter
Toutes ces phrases douloureuses qu'on a jamais su digérer
Ces rêves d'adolescent que la vie d'adulte nous a volé
Tous ces gestes inconscients qu'on regrettera à jamais
Toutes ces peurs qui nous empêchent ouais d'aller de l'avant
Toutes ces larmes que l'on sèchent avec le mouchoir du temps
On vit avec ces émotions en oubliant que l'horloge tourne, non
Le présent ne fait pas de ristourne on l'achète comme il est
Avec ses bons et ses mauvais côtés
Moi, je dépense tout ce que j'ai à essayer de faire le bien du mieux que je peux
Me rapprocher des cieux, ouvrir les yeux sur tout ce qui m'est vraiment précieux
Jouer le jeu et bâtir mon monde à deux
Faire le vœu d'entretenir le feu, qui décongèle ce cœur si précieux
Je ne suis qu'un homme, des erreurs j'en ai faites
Même avec toute ma bonne volonté, des erreurs j'en referais
Combien de fois ai-je fait ce que je m'étais promis de ne jamais faire
Combien de fois ai-je confondu mon paradis et mon enfer
Tu sais je suis parfaitement imparfait
Mais quand je te mets au parfum, je pue la sincérité
Mon arc-en-ciel a peut-être du gris mais je suis le paratonnerre de ma famille car la météo du monde s'assombri
On cherche à éclairer une bougie dans cette noirceur pourtant le briquet est souvent caché dans nos cœurs
Quoi qu'on fasse, vivre sera toujours un risque mais dis-toi qu'à chaque lever du soleil nous sommes tous des Phœnix
Nous sommes tous des phœnix, nous sommes tous des phœnix
Toi, moi, lui, elle, nous sommes tous des phœnix

Renaître de ses cendres, voilà de quoi je vais te parler dans mon prochain album
On a tous une énième chance, Phœnix",Prélude du Phoenix,2016

Jamais j'oublierai d'où je viens je sais ce que c'est d'être un homme de couleur
Je sais ce que c'est de taffer deux fois plus pour pouvoir être à la hauteur
Si je chante la cosmopolitanie c'est parce que j'en ai vu de toutes les couleurs
On m'a dit, on m'a dit petit, réveille-toi t'es un peu trop rêveur
Petit tu as un trop gros appétit la réalité est fade et sans saveur
Oublie tes rêves d'ados, comme tout le monde suis le troupeau
Mais le têtu que j'étais avait de la détermination plein le sac-à-dos
Aucune de leurs dissuasions m'a mis le genou à terre
Aucun médecin au monde ne pouvait soigner ma fièvre
Tout est possible quand tu sais qui tu es
Tout est possible quand t'assumes qui tu es
Aujourd'hui regarde-moi contempler mes sacrifices au sommet de mon Everest

I spend my life climbing, hiding, and fighting for what I want
And I don't want my mind say, just my pain, my hunger and my cries
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I gotta fight, fight
Fight, fight for who I am, and I will

J'ai chanté, j'ai chanté, j'ai chanté l'amour et la paix pendant des années
Je suis ce mélancolique qui se soigne quand ses m-a-u-x se mettent à rimer
Un rappeur positif pour donner de l'espoir à cette jeunesse désabusée
À l'heure où on nous braque avec un AK, 49.3 pour nous faire plier
Ma famille, ma famille, ma famille tout roule pour moi car ce sont mes moteurs
Mon carré VIP c'est mon cercle familial, pour eux j'brillais avant les projecteurs
I love you Comoria, I love you Massilia (Alléluia)
Mon image, mon discours, mon parcours, mon combat, tout ça c'est pour pouvoir leur faire honneur
Le cancer m'a volé un frère il n'y a que mes gosses pour éponger mes pleurs
Toujours debout à chanter que l'amour est le meilleur fusil contre la terreur
Je le décharge quand je chante, dans une MJC ou dans les Restos du Cœur
J'suis de retour plus humain que jamais envoyez-moi des sourires plus que des fleurs

I spend my life climbing, hiding, and fighting for what I want
And I don't want my mind say, just my pain, my hunger and my cries
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I gotta fight, fight
Fight, fight for who I am, and I will

This time I know I fight for who I am
I know, I know, I know, I know
This time I know I fight for who I am
I know, I know, I know, I know
This time I know I fight for who I am
I know, I know, I know, I know
For who I am

I spend my life climbing, hiding, and fighting for what I want
And I don't want my mind say, just my pain, my hunger and my cries
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I gotta fight, fight

Introvertie et si naïve
Au milieu de trente élèves trouver sa place n'était pas si facile

Ça commence par un surnom puis les mauvaises blagues s'enchaînent
Il met du sel sur les plaies de ses complexes avec tellement de haine

À la surprise générale, elle commet l'irréparable

Pour elle, être aimée c'est d'être likée
Donc elle s'entraîne devant sa glace à faire un selfie, filtre beauté

Quelques cœurs sur sa photo
Mais surtout des commentaires
Des moqueries, des critiques des insultes, des emojis pervers
Toute cette violence gratuite devient pour elle insupportable
Donc elle éteint son portable et commet l'irréparable

I've got a pair of feet
That found a low down beat
Low down, down around a spot that's hot!

I've got no peace
I'm losin' my lease on livin'
Here's the how?
I'm tellin' you now to give in!

Oh, make 'em play that crazy thing again
I've gotta do that lazy swing again.
Heigh, ho, doin' the new low down.

I got my feet to misbehavin' now,
I got a soul that's not for savin' now.
Heigh, ho, doin' the new low down.

That dancin' demon has my feet in a trance,

I go into that dance

I'd like to bet you'll go insane to it.

Soprano Summit,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1994
Soprano Summit,"If you were the only girl in the world

Tierno, cariñoso y lleno de pasión

Pensando en los que ocurrio
Te heri con mis palabras?
Mi silencio te ofusco?

No quise que dudaras
No intente hacerte mal
Dices que juego con palabras
Dices que nunca ganaras

Me siento abandonada
Por la musa del amor
Crece esta grieta entre los dos

En una avalancha este amor se derrumba
Por fin venciendonos
Habra sobrevivientes
Habra un testimonio
De que este amor existio

Acaso nunca recuerdas
El principio de este amor
Que para estar conmigo
Arriesgabas todo sin temor


Ahora pido tu atencion
Pero tengo que luchar
Estoy gritando, no me escuchas
Perm'teme por fin entrar

Baby, now tell me am I clinging to a dream
Are you a fantasy or exactly what you seem to be
I need to know, before I fall in love

I'm walking down the street
Searching for something to entertain me
To keep my mind
From missing you
But nothing can satisfy me
The way you do without even trying
With your easy ways
And that look in your eyes 

Baby, now tell me am I clinging to a dream
Are you a fantasy or exactly what you seem to be
Baby, now tell me am I clinging to a dream
Are you a fantasy or exactly what you seem to be
I need to know, before I
I need to know, before I 
I need to know, before I fall in love 

And when it's late at night
Do you dream of me holding you tight
Cause I think of you all the time
And I wonder do thoughts of me invade your mind

Indeed to know before I
I need to know before I
I need to know before I fall in love",Need to Know,1996
Soraya ,"No matter what anyone says time doesn't pull you through
Cause there are nights when I still cry when I think of you
Sometimes it swallows me in this space I feel inside
But I think of how strong you were and it
Helps me to get by 

And all the times when you would come to
Me in my dreams
I thought I was losing my mind, but it's the
Sanest I've ever been
And on those days when life seems too much
I hear your voice and I'm comforted by your touch

On nights like this
I know that you're still here with me
On nights like this I know you're in a better place
On nights like this I pray

I may be with you again someday
On nights like this I pray
That I may be worthy someday

There's the anger that blocked out the light
There's the doubts that held me captive night after night
The endless hours I spent asking why
When there's so many evil people, it just doesn't seem right 

On nights like this
I know that you're still here with me
On nights like this
I know you're in a better place

On nights like this I pray
I may be with you again someday
On nights like this I pray
That I may be worthy someday 

And I remember the night when I held you in my arms
Trying to give you the strength, the will to hold on
And you looked in my eyes and said ""baby be strong
I don't want to leave you but it's time for me to go"" 

And at that moment, as your hand slipped out of mine
A tear rolled down as you closed your eyes for the last time
And all the pain that had been written on your face
Suddenly disappeared and by a smile it was replaced

On nights like this
I know that you're still here with me

Soraya ,"Saw a vision in the middle of the day
Reality slipped a million miles away
As my mind wandered its spirit embraced me
And brought me closer to this reason to believe 

Got a handful of burning questions
Living with the burden of good intentions
Having spent years reading between the lines
Hoping something would stir my mind

I've been looking for a reason
I've been searching for a way
For a reason to believe
For a way to be set free 

When I was a girl
And everything was still on my side
The urgencies of certain things were
Hugging at my side
Now the clock is ticking harder 
And the years are spinning by
Faster than I should want them to I find myself struggling
Against the same old fears
Through the years remained true

I've been looking for a reason
I've been searching for a way
For a reason to believe for a way to be set free
I've been looking for a reason
I've been searching for a way
For a reason to believe
For a way to be set free",Reason to Believe,1996
Soraya ,"Saw the ruins of a civilization fallen
Amidst the rubble I stood and haunted
How you and I once built a fortress
Tears shed to commemorate
The existence of a love that was so great
How you and I once thought we'd never hesitate

And the stones get rounded by the storms
So do my memories change as time rolls on

And as I walk through I see remnants of you that have
Survived the harshness of time
And as I walk through I see remnants of you all
These these ruins in my mind
These ruins in my mind

Through the corridors I followed
The beam of light and amidst the shadows
How you and I once knew what mattered

In the ruins I felt a history
Of what once was never again will be
How you and I once loved with such urgency

Soraya ,"As they were being said I wished those words were
Dead they grow and grow and grow in our heads
They linger, linger and haunt us days on end

It was all in a moment of anger these daggers that I threw
They're still deeply embedded into you
I swear I fear there's nothing I can do

Stay a while young is the night
Give me a chance to set things right
Don't you throw away those years of love

Don't you throw away those years of love
Over one night when the love went wrong

Mistrust has now replaced intimacy
I feel you drifting drifting far away from me

Give me a chance to set things right
Don't you throw away those years of love
Over one night when the love went wrong
Over one night when the love went wrong

I vow not to lose
I'll be damned if this destroys us

Soraya ,"A thousand eyes looking at me 
But yours is the look that goes right
Through me and I
Cannot hide from your stare
Should I let you in - do I dare
Some other hands have tried before
But yours is the touch that makes me
Want more and I
Cannot hide the urgency
To have you lying here with me because

Suddenly in my life
There's something that's got me
Mystified and I cannot fight it but ican try
To keep the wonder of it alive

A thousand words have tried to say
But yours are the ones that'll never
Fade away and I
Cannot hide from their sound
I am mesmerized spinning round and round
Some other hearts have tried to steal mine
But yours is the one that I now hold dear
I'll do what it takes to keep you here
I'm a selfish fool and I have no fear

Alone by pushing you away
Time after time and tear after tear
I find myself back here with you
A thousand visions have come to me
All promising serenity
And as I struggle to find the source of this peace
I always end up with your kiss

Soraya ,"I was pacing every room with no where to turn
wondering if some things should ever be learned
I never thought that things would end up like this
when the initial intentions led only to bliss

Then I called the only friend that I could trust
asked him for a little time
my father answered the line and without asking much
he listened and then spoke his mind. He said:

Hay cosas en la vida, that will swallow your pride
Hay cosas en la vida that might deceive your mind
Hay cosas en la vida that will try to break your heart
Hay cosas en la vida, from them you must part

For endless hours he heard me go on
about how everything started to go wrong
it´s ironic how my whole life Ive been
chasing after some romantic dream

Often jealously takes on a good disguise
and changes someone before your eyes
Baby, dont look back and dont drown in reget
Your life can quickly pass you by

(Chorus)
Sometimes things are not quite what they seem to be
sometimes answers hit harder than steel
sometimes trust is more precious than diamonds
and all that glitters is not always real

I sent him all my love as I hung up the phone
sitting in the silence I didnt feel so alone
its always those who love you that stand by your side
when all the others just leave the pieces behind

That morning after felt like two bottles of gin
I still cant remember where Ive been
Ill cleanse my soul of all this false love Ive known
and make my fathers words my own.",Cosas en la Vida,1997

Donde yo estuve una vez

Pense que iba a volver

Cuando veo a esa niña
Cuando veo su mirar
Aunque el esfuerzo es grande
Es imposible olvidar

Su recuerdo, su pasado
Lucho con el sentimiento

No tarda en encontrarme

Soraya ,"Anoche me dormí­ abrazando las nubes
Con almohadas de sueños en una cama de ilusiones
Desde niña me imaginé esta vida
Cruzando retos para llegar a mi cima
En un instante perdí­ toda la certeza
Las dudas y el rencor se marcaron en mi esencia

Será una pesadilla, no puede ser verdad
Me despierta un derrumbe
Empiezo a deslizar

Casi se me acaba la fe
Casi se me escapa el amor
Casi se me quiebra la inocencia
Se me agota toda la fuerza para luchar un dí­a más
Casi me rendí­ hasta que pensé en ti
Casi me rendí­ pero pensé en ti

Veo en mi reflejo un rostro traicionado
Frente al fantasma de un cuerpo cansado
Por qué hoy, por qué yo, por qué esto?
Preguntas con respuestas que vendrán solo con el tiempo

Será una pesadilla no puede ser verdad
Me despierta un derrumbe
Empiezo a deslizar

Casi se me acaba la fe
Casi se me escapa el amor
Casi se me quiebra la inocencia
Se me agota toda la fuerza para luchar un dí­a más
Casi me rendí­ hasta que pensé en ti
Casi me rendí­ pero pensé en ti

Cuando solo escuchas el latido de tu corazón
Encontrarás entre su ritmo y el silencio la razón

Casi se me acaba la fe
Casi se me escapa el amor

Soraya ,"I know you have your reasons
I know you have your ways
Doesn't make it any easier
To learn to walk again

And you said it would be better
As I swallowed back my tears
I could wait for you forever
I said what you wanted to hear

I gave my word
That I'd be fine
I promised you I'd never lie
But honestly, every time a thought of you
Crosses my mind

I lie through my teeth
I lie with a smile
I lie with the strength
Of a train running wild

I break the truth
Every time I breathe
With every lonely heartbeat
I lie, I lie for you

Beginnings are so easy
The middles such a climb
The endings are the worst of all
Someone's always left behind

Do you miss me when it's raining?
Is this yearning only mine?
I agreed because I love you
I was hoping that time might change your mind

I gave my word
That I'd be fine
I promised you I'd never lie
But honestly, every time a thought of you
Crosses my mind

I lie through my teeth
I lie with a smile
I lie with the strength
Of a train running wild

I break the truth
Every time I breathe
With every lonely heartbeat
I lie, I lie for you

I lie through my teeth
I lie with a smile
I lie with the strength
Of a train running wild

I break the truth
Every time I breathe
With every lonely heartbeat
I lie, I lie for you
I lie for you
I lie for you
I lie for you

En cada esquina de tu ser
Aun no es tan fácil
Empezar a comprender

Para ti fue algo obvio
Veo que en mi penal
Me cerraste como a un libro
Te dije lo que querías escuchar

Prometí no llorar
Sonreír para disimular
Pero en verdad cada vez
Que pienso en ti
Vuelvo a caer

Miento sin parar, miento al soñar
Miento con la fuerza de un tren al pasar
Miento por tus besos, miento en mi respirar
Miento para engañarme, miento para olvidar

El comienzo siempre dulce
Hay tanto por saborear
La despedida nos traiciona
Un corazón se queda atrás

Cuando llueve te hago falta
No me has podido reemplazar
Sigo fiel a la esperanza
Que un día la vida te hará regresar

Prometí no llorar
Sonreír para disimular
Pero en verdad cada vez
Que pienso en ti

Es la añoranza de un beso al amanecer
Es el recuerdo de un abrazo al atardecer
Entregar mi cuerpo al poder de tus manos
Con la esperanza de ser amado

Es mi alma inquieta pidiendo ternura
Son mis labios hambrientos buscando tu figura
Tus caricias que navegan con sumo cuidado
Con la esperanza de ser amado

Cierro mi ojos. . . caigo en tus sueños
Pido un deseo. . . escucho tu voz
Muevo montañas para estar a tu lado
Darle vida a la esperanza de ser amado

Es perderme en tus ojos y encontrar un hogar
Es tenerte a mi lado cada mañana al despertar
Ver caer la lluvia arropada en tus brazos
Con la esperanza de ser amado

Es bailar contigo aunque no haya canción
Es recibir un regalo sin tener ocasión
Abrir lo que siempre he tenido cerrado
Con la esperanza de ser amado

Cierro mi ojos. . . caigo en tus sueños
Pido un deseo. . . escucho tu voz
Muevo montañas para estar a tu lado

Es revelar un miedo y no sentirme aislada
Disfrutar cada momento como un día feriado
Con la esperanza de ser amado

Cierro mi ojos. . . caigo en tus sueños
Pido un deseo. . . escucho tu voz
Muevo montañas para estar a tu lado
Darle vida a la esperanza de ser amado

Soraya ,"se llama María,   es abuela con nueve nietos
sin diploma, sin un centavo, se ganó el corazón de un pueblo
sin conocer a sus padres, sin abrazar a sus hermanos

I stay up and think of you
And I wish on a star
That somewhere you are thinking of me too

'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room dreaming about you and me

Wonder if you ever see me, and I
Wonder if you know I'm there
If you looked in my eyes
Would you see what's inside?
Would you even care?

I just want to hold you close
But so far, all I have are dreams of you
So I wait for the day, and the courage to say
How much I love you
(Yes I do)

I'll be dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight ('Til tomorrow)
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room dreaming about you and me

Corazón, I can't stop dreaming of you
No puedo dejar de pensar en ti
I can't stop dreaming
Como te necesito
I can't stop dreaming of you
Mi amor como te extraño

Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I still can't believe
That you came up to me and said I love you
I love you too

Now I'm dreaming with you tonight
'Til tomorrow and for all of our lives ('Til tomorrow)
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room dreaming with you endlessly

De sentirme tan así, atado y sin salida
Sin poder lograr odiarte, tan sólo por un instante
Sin pensar en otra cosa, no hay nada más importante
Esta vez, te juro que esta vez no fallaré
No bastará lo que pueda decirte con palabras
Cómo poder decir lo que se siente
Si contigo descubrí, que ahora es que queda vida

Y que puedo respirar el aire que tú respiras
Y cambio mi vida entera el haberte conocido 
Y que si valió la pena, haber esperado tanto
Esta vez, te juro que esta vez no fallaré, no bastará

Encontré lo que esperaba
Alguien como tú!

Who's never left home, who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

[Chorus]
She needs wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the high stakes

She traveled this road as a child
Wide eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

She needs wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the high stakes

She knows the high stakes

As her folks drive away, her dad yells, ""Check the oil!""
Mom stares out the window and says, ""I'm leaving my girl""
She said, ""It didn't seem like that long ago""

And as I struggle to find the source of this peace
I always end up with your kiss

So take a look beside you 
My love is on the road to 
Lugar para escapar 
Sin nada que ocultar 
So tell me do you long to 

Taste all me fire

Yes, tonight we ride

Do you feel serenity? 
Tell me do you feel me floating near? 

Taste my fire

I'm coming up sun 
I'll never be done 
Yes, tonight we ride 
No digas que no 
A solas tu why yo

Sorrow,"Anger and bitterness growing
I'm not always feeling this way
But as time's end draws closer
Pain's a larger percentage of the day
To seek an answer for my grief
I must realize from the start
I'm trying to feel compassion
For a species with no heart
Misunderstood, I've tried to be good
But You think You all know me
Unknown to You, all that I do
Has meaning You probably can't see
Judged by looks, when You are the crooks
Because You steal my emotions
Within my state, there exists much hate
Forced into me by Your notions
Undetected sadness, my worst enemy
Forces tears, nobody sees
You leave me no choice
But to despise all Your worth
You cause my pain
Never will I give in
",Forced Repression,1992
Sorrow,"Curse the priest
Rape the nun
Kill Jesus Christ
Spit at the church
Sin - Unholy behavior
Blasphemy - Church desecration
Evil - Irreligious
Irreverent - Lack of reverence
Overwhelmed by hate
Ridicule the cross around Your neck
Set the torah a blaze
Religions are worthless and for the weak
Sin - Unholy behavior
Blasphemy - Church desecration
Evil - Irreligious
Irreverent - Lack of reverence
For God
For religion
For worship
Hatred and disgust
For the values You set
Ban all religions
Decay is all You get
Burn the churches and temples
Burn them to the ground
Who cares what they saw?
Rejoice at the mound
",Human Error,1992
Sorrow,"Fools! Stop waving Your flag
And clean the shit off Your glasses
Freedom of speech, a government lie
To calm and quiet the masses
Freedom of speech exists
If what You say is accepted by the majority
One will quickly lose
That right when they are part of the minority
All popular artists are the same
This is no coincidence
Maybe the public would not respond to
Deviants
That is an incorrect inference
People with money and power are blessed
But they can fund and promote
Subversive ideas they have intentionally
Suppressed
To insure the safety of status quo
If one's ideas pose no threat
They are the ones to succeed
Monetary backing they will get
By the claws of corporate greed
True freedom of speech
Occurs when all ideas
Are given equal viewing
To the general public
Censor art
Suppress reflection of society
Censor thought
",Illusion of Freedom,1992
Sorrow,"A humans thirst can never be quenched
Too much is never enough
Due to humans weak mind
Resistance is unbearably tough
Humans can not suppress their primal urges
Even in order to preserve their existence
In this enlightened age
Humans know what behaviour is safe
And what will lead to their own demise
The public ignores the facts
Instead they blame the scapegoats
To rationalize their acts
Putting Your life in someone's hands
The ultimate in naivete
Why would one be so trusting?
Why could You be so stupid?
Another's reassurance of safety
Supplies you with false security
Since the beginning of time
Humans have altered their sanity
First an occasional diversion
Then a constant necessity
You need chemicals to live
Chemicals need you to kill
The risk of one's actions
Can be greately reduced
Make a decision
Inconvenience or death
Govern Your life by intellect
Not by instinct
",Insatiable,1992
Sorrow,"Prejudice, does this word apply to you?
Categories, most likely to be friends
With someone just like You
Are You a human, or do You rely on
Separative adjectives?
Pride (Vox By Billy)
Why do You take credit
For what You were born into?
Do Your genes give You an advantage?
Favoritism
Taking care of Your own kind
Continuing
Your own kind
Words
SAy what You mean
Mean what You say
Hatred, afraid to accept
People different from You
Afraid to rethink
Your own values
Peace, it won't happen
Until barriers are eradicated
",Separative Adjectives,1992
Sorrow,"Time and time again
Throughout the centuries
How many times
Must it be repeated?
A countless number
Of treatise
And all too few
Have absorbed their meaning
Regarded as prodigies
But You ignore the messages
Of these few
Perceived as honorable
And You can't find
The inner strength
To take to heart
Our responsibilities
And You have seen
The results from afar
Of perpetual neglect
Without a trace
Of empathy
So it will continue
That the words of wisdom
Will be ignored
Leaving us back
Right where we started
Wallowing aimlessly
In a world of ignorance

Sorry About Dresden,"She was holding somebody?s hand, 
I forget who it was I am. 
Giving up the crusades for a while,
I can't crawl another mile. 
The rags are torn, 
The sheets are tattered, 
Rat-a-tat and all the tribes scattered. 
She'll be hanging out in hotel rooms, 
I'll be tucked away in underground tombs. 
Now I'm finally giving up crusades, 
When I realized no one could be saved. 
Dusty gashes we were seeing, 
This giant airfield came into being. 
The harnessed power and force of a million;
Faithful followers who sold their children.
Some return with souvenirs, 
Stick a heart in your boutonnière. 
Some return with tales of glory, 
All the fucking stories bore me. 
Now I'm finally giving up crusades,
When I realized no one can be saved. 
Say I know when I just don't know.
Say I love you, I don't just know. 
I was a pretender to the throne, 
I knew my cover?d be blown. 
Never could be that dogmatic, 
Whose to blame if I just heard static? 
Never known the truth of a zealot,
Whose to blame if I just can't spell it? 
Never known true righteousness 
Just the safety and vague red lust. 
I know I'll be back again someday.",Crusades,1999

Außer Beine breit machen haben Muschis doch nichts drauf

Hau die Keule an und lauf die Treppen runter, zwei Uhr nachts

Soufian,"Check meinen Cousin ab
Tonnen Haze, Treffpunkt Mitternacht, Rotterdam
Baba Ware vom Marokkaner
Der schon seitdem er vierzehn ist Hasch bunkert
In der Hood denkst du oft du hast Probleme
Keine Lösung außer Arbiat kiffen
Jacky pusht dir die Seele vorüber
Weil Kanacken neiden den Kanack, der Kies macht
Akhe, wer drückt Packs im Hochhaus
Vierundzwanzig Stunden lang auf der Jagd vor den Cops
Sie drehen durch, he, Ghettokids, chey
„Fick das System“ schreit Hakim schon mit dreizehn
Gib ihm Haze Tag für Tag, anders geht nicht
Ob die Sucht ihn gepackt hat für ewig?
Wey, ich weiß nicht, schon als Kleinkind
Störung im Kopf, ohne Eltern wie Freiwild
Chabo tickt groß
Juz-park Nordend im Barca-Trikot
Parasit, kafa ciao doch er muss 
An der Hölle vorbei, um zu finden sein Glück
Fick dieses Leben und lauf
Mach dir nichts daraus, mein Bruder, du bist schlau
Gestern kein Geld, heute CL
Am Ende des Tages (am Ende des Tages)

Bin in Paris mit Gaddafi

Treff' mich im Club nachts um zwölf, bitch
Auf Schnuff und Whiskey wie Elvis
Weil Hafti Abi jetzt Pelz trägt

In Fünf-Sterne-Hotels schläft
Kommen Nutten und wollen Selfies
Suite Presidential, Presidential Bentley
Komm uns nicht mit Handshake
Kopfnuss und du fällst bös
Solange sich diese Welt dreht, Bitch
Trag' ich am linken Arm 'ne R-O-L-E-X

Abgehörte Handys, Offenbach, wer kennt es

OF-City bleibt abgefuckt, Kanak zählt Euros
Im Kofferraum zehn Dinger J
Streck press es, weg, Kopf ist gefickt
Weil nur Patte den Kick bringt, akhi

Diese Welt ist Cehennem, keine Wahl auf der Straße
Mach' Patte mit Haschisch ese, Momo zieht immer noch Handys ab
Jetzt immer Playbacks sozial, bunkert Bargeld, Stoff und Geld
Koka, Koka, Fuffi – Fuffi
Koka, Koka, Fuffi

Zwischen Alk- und Drogensumpf kann es passieren, dass du schnell fällst
Der erste Schritt führt dich zum Zweiten, doch beim Dritten ist dein Ende
Kein Zurück mehr, Kopf kaputt, Kokain täubt deine Sinne
Lässt dich fliegen, bis zum Himmel – guckst da rauf, und wieder 'winnt der Hass?

Das Ziel sind Millionen
Auf'm Weg nach ganz oben – fallen viele Chabs, bleiben liegen und sitzen jahrelang
Lass' den Frust raus, doch wo willst du hin?
„Gefangen im Dunya“, flüstert die Stimme in seinem Ohr (flüstert die Stimme in seinem Ohr)
Schwere Zeit, alles tief - vorbei
Gestern Flouz und Neid
Rauchen Haze durch Drei-Part-Vape
Gib' ihm bös', akhi wir müssen Geld machen
Egal wie, Hauptsache viel
Ob mit Coke oder Haschisch, akhi
Auf Haze und Airmax, verflucht ist die Gosse
Akhi, diggi, allé
Der eine schafft's, der andere nicht
Momo sitzt, während Rashid tickt weiter
Jayjo's auf Alu's, paranoid so wie Pablo Escobar
Wer kommt im weißen Range Rover
Wer schickt die Opfer ins Koma
Chabo macht Flouz à la Sosa - Tony

Meine Jungs zählen E's, machen Money

Vollgas, drück' durch das Pedal ohne Stopp, doch geb' Acht auf die Cops
Diese Nutten hassen uns, als wären wir Kakerlaken
Spüren Kanaks auf Zentrale, während Kilogramme handeln
We-weyo dann wird's ekelhaft
Rammbock, Kripo, Mitternacht
Zehn Wagen beladen vor Haustür, wie kommst du da raus ohne Leichen im Hausflur
Ekho, wenn SEK kam
Die Wohnung voll Stoff ist nicht mein Golden Brown, lad die Scharfe schnell nach, chab
Jumpt über's Fenster, aus fünf Meter Höhe ungebremst, digga Engpass
Steig' in den AMG, fahr los, scheiß auf rot, keine Zeit-Cops im Nacken, akhi Spezial Bud
Auf der Flucht vor den Bullen, akhi
Auf der Flucht vor mir selbst, akhi

Ihn irgendwann kriegt und dann richtig zerlegt
Haftbefehl, Interpol
Vamonos, Marokko
Vier Jahre später die Patte ist weg
Verballert für Koka und Nutten Hayat
Auf Iblis sein Kopf Tschau möchtegern Sosa haut einfach zehn Mille aufm Kopf jeden Monat

Erzähl dir von Rashid, sein' Mama war Nutte, sein Vater wurd' Junkie
Mit dreihzen auf Arbia, sein Schicksal ist hart wie zehn Tonnen aus Maastricht
Trägt die Kappe tief, wenn er durch die Straßen läuft, Akho
Sein Leben ist'n schwarzes Loch mittlerweile
Bis er sechszehn, besessen von Neid geht zur Schule um Packs zu dealen
Jeden Morgen vorm Spiegel kommt die Frage hoch
Legt sich 'ne Spur auf die Karte und schreit „Gott ist groß!“ sein Herz 
Wie aus Stein, im Minutentakt rotzt er Stein für Stein weg, woh
Und er fragt sich, warum ihn das Leben gefickt hat (brr)
Mein Schicksal ist bitter, erst recht wenn dein Vater auf Stein von Balkon sprang, ihr Wichser

Mein Leben war hart, gab sich die Kugel, Hayat ist bitter
Familie nicht da, ein Zimmer zum Atmen, Feuer sein Schicksal
Geschrieben von Gott doch sein Leben sich nehmen heißt Hölle für immer
Geschrieben von Gott doch sein Leben sich nehmen heißt Hölle für immer

Geb' einen Fick auf das Martinshorn

Ich kauf' dich bar, Diggi - direkt
Schiffe fahren raus, schick deinen Arsch in die Tiefe
Durch und durch, baller' stetig
Zieh' die Sechser ausm GT
Kein Druck, mach' es easy
Voll Gold mein Cabriolet
Drei Schüsse fallen schnell
Wegen schwarzem Geld, abgefucktes Biz
Paar Cops so wie New Jack
Für die Gangs machen trainiert mit Hunden
Kokain wird zu Crack

Riech' am Moks mit 'ner Handvoll Weed
Baba Autos, aber jeder auf Hartz IV, Chab
Auf der Straße drehen krumme Dinger machen Millen
Kifft Haze, tickt Packs, doch fasst niemals das Flex an
Dreht ab ohne Jayj in der Blutbahn
Das Para gebunkert in Büschen
Lässt sich nicht ficken, sein Rücken ist Macht
Wodka intus auf Ex
Iba'ash Bruder, renn (Iba'ash Bruder, renn)
Du hast Packs an den Eiern im Park und das Beyda - achtzig Prozent (Koks, Koks)
Jeder will Para, Kanak riskieren alles
Knast oder reich - illegaler Handel

Wolken Haze im Zimmer vom Cousin
Mama nicht da, Papa ist auf Arbeit
Dreh' noch ein Besen auf die Jungs in der Heimat
Kornpacks, guck rotzfrech

Bonchance wie bei Assange
Knastzelle oder dicken Rolls Royce
Dein Leben ist kritisch, du weißt
Renn um dein Leben, Akhi, wenn es heißt:
„Stehen bleiben, Polizei, Hände nach oben!“
Im Mund ist noch Crack unter Zunge gebunkert
Sag, kennst du den Blyad? Sag, kennst du meinen Cousin?

Durch Kaufhof, rippt Nikes und schnell wieder raus
Bevor er reingeht, sagt er: „Geh ich lieber drauf!“
