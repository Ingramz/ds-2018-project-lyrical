Louis Armstrong & Friends,"Wait till you see him
See how he looks
Wait till you hear him laugh

Painters of paintings
Writers of books
Never could tell the half

Wait till you feel
The warmth of his glance
Pensive and sweet and wise

All of it lovely
All of it thrilling
I'll never be willing to free him

When you see him
You won't believe your eyes
You won't believe your eyes",Lover,2001
Louis Armstrong & Friends,"Folks I've just been down, down to Memphis town,
That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while.
Hospitality, they were good to me.
I couldn't spend a dime, and had the grandest time.
I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear,
They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed, all the band folks played Real harmony.
I never will forget the tune that Handy called the Memphis Blues.
Oh yes, them Blues.

They've got a fiddler there that always slickens his hair
And folks he sure do pull some bow.
And when the big Bassoon seconds to the Trombones croon.
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day, on Revival Day.

Oh that melody sure appealed to me.
Just like a mountain stream rippling on it seemed.
Then it slowly died, with a gentle sigh
Soft as the breeze that whines high in the summer pines.
Hear me people, hear me people, hear I pray,
I'm going to take a million lesson's 'til I learn how to play
Because I seem to hear it yet, simply can't forget
That blue refrain.

There's nothing like the Handy Band that played the Memphis Blues so grand.
Oh play them Blues.
That melancholy strain, that ever haunting refrain
Is like a sweet old sorrow song.
Here comes the very part that wraps a spell around my heart.
It sets me wild to hear that loving tune a gain, the Memphis Blues.",Memphis Blues,2001
Louis Armstrong & Friends,"Old rockin' chair's got me, my cane by my side
Fetch me that gin, son, 'fore I tan your hide
Can't get from this cabin, goin' nowhere
Just set me here grabbin' at the flies 'round this rockin' chair

Louis Armstrong & Friends,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Louis Armstrong & Friends,"To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
 
Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.",That's My Desire,2001
Louis Armstrong & Friends,"Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start
I tried to shower you with love and kisses
But all I ever get from you is naggin' and braggin'
My poor heart is saggin'

The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart
Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart

Louis Armstrong & Friends,"Is that you, Santa Claus?
Gifts I'm preparing for some Christmas sharing
But I pause because
Hanging my stocking I can hear a knocking
Is that you, Santa Claus? 
Sure is dark out, ain't the slightest spark out
'Pon my clackin' jaw
Who's there, who is it stopping for a visit? 
Is that you, Santa Claus? 
Are you bringing a present for me
Something pleasantly pleasant for me? 
Then it's just what I've been waiting for
Would you mind slipping it under the door?
Cold winds are howling, or could that be growling? 
My legs feel like straws
My-my, oh me-my, kindly will you reply? 
Is that you, Santa Claus? 

Yes, hanging the stocking, I can hear a knocking
Is that you, Santa Claus? 

I say, who's there, who is it, are you stopping for a visit? 
Is that you, Santa Claus? 
Oh there, Santa, you gave me a scare
Now stop teasing 'cause I know you're there
We don't believe in no goblins today
But I can't explain why I'm shaking that way
Bet I can see ole Santa in the keyhole
I'll get to the cause
One peek and I'll try there, oh oh, there's an eye there
Is that you, Santa Claus? 
Please, please, pity my knees
Say that's you, Santa Claus, that's him all right","'Zat You, Santa Claus?",2003

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two

Louis Armstrong & Friends,"Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way (ha ha ha)
Bells on bob-tails ring
Making spirits bright
Oh what fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Oh jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon miss fanny bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upshot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And, crack, you'll take the lead",Jingle Bells,2003

Louis Armstrong & Friends,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

As we dream by the fire

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2013

But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Since everyone spread the story 
With his own little personal touch

[Chorus]
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart, the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But, please, do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me
 
[Chorus]

Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""

While I'm alone and blue as can be

Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear

Louis Armstrong & Friends,"Baby, take me down to Duke's Place
Wildest box in town is Duke's Place
Love that piano sound in Duke's Place

Saxes do their tricks in Duke's Place
Fellas swing their chicks in Duke's Place
Come on, get your kicks in Duke's Place

You find yourself a seat, and when you want to eat
You look around and yell, ?Waiter?
You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up
You're jetting along with your girlie

It's after three o'clock, but baby, it's early

Take your tootsies into Duke's Place

In my bank account
I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'
But that don't worry me, confidentially

Each night I hurry to
A home where love waits, I know

Louis Armstrong & Friends,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Louis Armstrong & Friends,"I feel the autumn breeze; it steals 'cross my pillow
As soft as the willow, the wisp
And in its song there is sadness
Because there's no you

The lonely autumn trees as softly as they're sayin'
For someone's dying
They know that in my heart there's not gladness
Because there's no you

The pub that we walk in, the garden we tug in
Are lonesome, they seemed in the fall
The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the world

In spring we'll meet again, we'll kiss and recapture
The summer times raptured, we knew
And from that day nevermore will I say
There's no you",There's No You,2018
Louis Armstrong & His All-Stars,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,

Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free

Oh, what a couple in love
Frankie was loyal to Johnny
Just as true as the stars above

He was her man
But he done her wrong

Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was making love to Nellie Bligh

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

Now Frankie's dad was a policeman
She stole his old forty-four gun
Then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run

After her man
Who was doing her wrong

Now Frankie peaked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
She whipped out that old forty-four
And her rootie-toot-boom, that gal did shoot
Right through that hardwood swinging door

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

So bring on your crepe and your flowers
Bring on your rubber-tired hack
'Cause there's eight men to go to the graveyard
But only seven are coming back

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

And this is the end of my song

And she cries the whole night long

That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while.
Hospitality, they were good to me.
I couldn't spend a dime, and had the grandest time.
I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear,
They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed, all the band folks played Real harmony.
I never will forget the tune that Handy called the Memphis Blues.
Oh yes, them Blues.

They've got a fiddler there that always slickens his hair
And folks he sure do pull some bow.
And when the big Bassoon seconds to the Trombones croon.
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day, on Revival Day.

Oh that melody sure appealed to me.
Just like a mountain stream rippling on it seemed.
Then it slowly died, with a gentle sigh
Soft as the breeze that whines high in the summer pines.
Hear me people, hear me people, hear I pray,
I'm going to take a million lesson's 'til I learn how to play
Because I seem to hear it yet, simply can't forget
That blue refrain.

There's nothing like the Handy Band that played the Memphis Blues so grand.
Oh play them Blues.

Louis Armstrong & His All-Stars,"No use of talkin' no use of talkin'
You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.
There's jazz-copation blues modulation,
Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear.
Most everybody likes the blues

Here's why I'm ravin', here's why I'm ravin'
If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, 
Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, 
But Royal Garden Blues.","Royal Garden Blues, Pts. 1-2 [Live at Symphony Hall, 1947]",2003

Said, he'd be happy if his wife I'd be

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",Cuban Fantasy,2011

Blows across your pillow

But you ain't got nobody

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [From Stardust Memories],2000

Just like a torch, you set the soul within me burning
I must go on, I'm on this road of no returning
And though it burns me and it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

What good is there denying you're all that I desire?
Since first I kissed you my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be
Don't pity me, don't pity me

Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow

The evening sun go down

The evening sun go down

On my last lone round

Like I feel today

Warmer than the Summer night.
The clouds were like an alabaster palace,
Rising to a snowy height.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.

Il n'y aura que de bonnes nouvelles au paradis artificiel, ce soir
Et même si ce n'est qu'un cache misère, malgré le froid le plein hiver.
Y'a une chaleur particulière, ce soir.

Ce soir c'est Noël, tout le monde s'aime ce soir.
C'est pas comme demain, c'est pas comme la veille.
Ce soir c'est Noël, tout le monde s'aime ce soir.
Instant irréel, la nuit parallèle, drôle de phénomène
C'est pas comme demain, c'est pas comme la veille
Ce soir c'est Noël.

Louis Chédid,"J'pense aux enfants sans enfance
Aux hommes sans liberté
Toutes ces non-assistances
A personnes en danger
J'regarde toute cette solitude
Qui est devenue presque comme une habitude
Toutes ces âmes en souffrance
Condamnées dès la naissance

La vie du mauvais côté
Du mauvais côté
Du mauvais côté, du mauvais côté

J'pense à ces enfants sans rêves
J'pense à tous ces gens pris au piège
Dont la seule différence en fait
C'est d'être nés sur la même planète, mais...

Du mauvais côté, du mauvais côté
Du mauvais côté, du mauvais côté

Je sais bien que j'suis pas devenu fou
C'est pas une chanson qui va changer tout
Mais si l'on ne fait rien, si l'on ne dit rien
Si l'on s'en fout,
On n'est encore moins que rien du tout.",Du Mauvias Cote,1998

Toutes ces menaces qui nous minent

Des chaînes à nos serrures
Des alarmes cachées sous nos tentures
Des explosifs dans nos boîtes à chaussures
Toute cette hystérie, tout ce stress
Ca fait marcher le p'tit commerce
Y'en a qui louent des chiens-loup
Qu'achètent des revolvers
Qui voient des gangsters partout
Y'en a qui s'prennent pour John Wayne
Qui dégainent plus vite que dans les westerns
A trop r'garder la télévision, y'en a qu'ça rend d'plus en plus cons

On a la force tranquille
On vend des armes à l'Amérique latine

Louis Chédid,"Dans le sang 
Il y a un œdème qui me gène 
J'écris amer 
Pour me faire taire 
Pour me faire terre 

De toi à moi, 
Je ne sais pas aimer 
Sans pleurs tordu de peur, 
Se fânent les heures
 
Je griffe les murs, 
Pour me faire les ongles 

Lasse, lasse 
Je suis las de tous ces dîners d'amis 
Tout le monde s'embrasse 
Quelle folie cette comédie 
Chasseur de frime magnanime 

Je me plie électrique 
Sur mon œil dans le ventre 
Il faut bouger se laver 
Glisser sur la descente

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
No gal will ever make a fool of me
No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
",Runnin' Wild,1961
"Louis Cottrell, Jr.","""I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;",The Sheik of Araby,1961
