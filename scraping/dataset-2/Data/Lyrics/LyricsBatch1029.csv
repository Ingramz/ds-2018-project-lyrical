By, by, lully, lullay.
Lullay, thou little tiny Child,
By, by, lully, lullay.

O sisters too, how may we do,
For to preserve this day
This poor youngling for whom we do sing
By, by, lully, lullay.

Herod, the king, in his raging,
Charged he hath this day
His men of might, in his own sight,
All children young to slay.

Then, woe is me, poor Child for Thee!
And ever mourn and sigh
For thy parting neither say nor sing,
By, by, lully, lullay.",Coventry Carol,2011
Sonoya Mizuno,"You got the invitation
You got the right address
You need some medication?
The answer's always yes

A little chance encounter
Could be the one you've waited for
Just squeeze a bit more

Tonight we're on a mission
Tonight's the casting call
If this is the real audition
Oh, God, help us all

You make the right impression
Then ev'rybody knows your name
We're in the fast lane

Someone in the crowd could be the one you need to know
The one to finally lift you off the ground
Someone in the crowd could take you where you wanna go
If you're the someone ready to be found

you're the someone ready to be found

Do what you need to do
'Til they discover you
And make you more than who
You're seeing now

So with the stars aligned
I think I'll stay behind
You've got to go and find

That someone in the crowd

That someone in the crowd

Is someone in the crowd the only thing you really see?
Watching while the world keeps spinning 'round?
Somewhere there's a place where I find who I'm gonna be
A somewhere that's just waiting to be found

Someone in the crowd could be the one you need to know
The someone who could lift you off the ground
Someone in the crowd could take you where you wanna go
Someone in the crowd could make you
Someone in the crowd could take you
Flying off the ground
If you're the someone ready to be found",Someone in the Crowd,2016

Who that there, huh you ain't gonna ask no longer right?
You ain't gonna ask no longer right?
You ain't gonna ask no longer longer?
Who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go (they're saying)
Who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go

It's me, Jean Jacket with the chops lee
Showin' off a young homie (zzzz)
No no no I ain't doin' him
(Him him him him him)
(Na na na na na)
Doing me's me's me's me's
Grew up on the top I rap to
Really make you spit it
So if you see him kill it you ain't gotta ask who did it
Girls, they totally love the way I'm singing
I say baby that's the heart
They take the verses that I'm bringin like
About one year ago, I was all on my own
We was trying to get on, so I put the pen to my dome
Wrote the realest shit in my life
Then I put it all in a poem
Critics said that I was crazy, now they write their asses home

They're saying
Who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go (they're saying)
Who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go

It's me, never talkin' bout no molly
Or I rap about a hottie on my body like a goddy
I'm tourin' up in Cali but my roadies in the lobby
People ask me who I am I just give their ass a copy like
Take that shit and goodness baby I'm back
Ain't got no way and that's fact
You could tell by the way that I rap whoo
Came up in this motherfucker ain't nobody like it
Thought of what I thought you know I will write it
Get up in the booth and now it's time that I'll recite it
Fuck 'em any blow and I'll take the way I like it
Dollar up in my pocket, tryna make this my own
Critics call my ass crazy now they writing their ass home

They're saying
Who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go (they're saying)
Who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go

Cool kid, cool kid ay tell me what you see
'Cause if I see it I'mma be that too
Go ahead and follow me follow me
New kid new kid ay it's all I really be
Mama tell me way back I'm a star
Now I'm walking down the street everybody that sees says

Who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go (they're saying)
Who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go

I got too much on my plate
I second guess nothing for nothing
I throw this rap out the window
I'll make another like nothing
We built this shit from the ground up
I don't ask questions, I solve 'em
I'll get some money, then I'll spend it
But don't rap like I'm balling
My time ain't nothing but now now
My team been going from pow wows
I'll give 'em shit so real, the DJ's 'bout to do triple sow cows
Yeah, I've been singing and rapping
Rapping and singing and such
I look around, these dudes be focused on their look like too much
And I think it's time I calm it down just a little
Just a little, just a little, nah, fuck it
I don't believe in predictions, I just believe in conviction
And since I quit all my bitching, I heard 'em all start to listen

Oh man, what the hell he 'bout to do?
What the hell he 'bout to do right now?

Don't trip like KC and Jojo
You know this bro goin' pro though
I'll rock a jean jacket with a jean shirt and some jeans at the Soho
I don't fit in with no genre
I got some screws loose, it's true
Pops got that snare, make you drop like when Kendrick go doo doo
I made some boo boos to move you
I guess that's how I got through, though
My team ain't signing no papers
It's off the books, shout out Juju
I got some shit on my sleeve
I got some dirt on my hands
I got no yes men here around me that gon' say I'm the man
So I think it's time I calm it down just a little
Just a little, just a little... nah, fuck it
I don't believe in no luck
Like they don't believe 'til it's something
I dreamt this all my sleep and never woke up to no buzzer

One of us is right 
None of this is right

And he never understands, that the photo in the drawer
Is all you're looking for
Blue to gray, then back again
Watch the fading paper wall

Scratching at the window glass
Trees along the ledge, are they in your head?
Creepers beat, beat, beat tonight
Picturing the nest

The sight at sixteen
Of the son she never had
Once she had a dream
Of the ones she'll never have

Your ending, your ending
Your ending, your ending

You're only half a person now
So fold over what is left to be addressed
What you want when you wake tonight
Is it all in your head?

So you turn over, lie
Cradling this perfect mess, this home-made dress
You've seen what comes to those
Who put a picture in the nest

Curtailing ourselves, nothing lasts so very long

Dressed up, down the alcohol, feeling so much better

And why it take a death or a funeral to bring our family together 

Now look, we done lost a brother, your son done lost a father 

Life ain't promised us so tell somebody you love them 

You'll never know whether they'll be here tomorrow

Chorus",Goodbye to My Homies,1998
Sons of Funk,"[Magic]
Yo see-Murder, you believe all these people they call me hopeless.
[C-Murder]
They say when your hopeless your not expected to do good, be successful.
And it's by all means impossible to accomplish any goals.

[Lady TRU]
They say I'm hopeless
[Sons of Funk]
They say I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
[Lady TRU]
Like a bullet with a hole in it
[Sons of Funk]
Ohh, like a bullet with a hole in it, oh yeah

[Magic]
Look here, it's not easy I struggled to get in this position
Taking my people out the ghetto was my only mission
I was jacking and strong arming accomplished i done changed
Making money living good I'm out of the game
See as I refused to see good in my accomplishments
All I ever get is dirty looks, never compliments
I figure jealousy, wishing that why'all could be me
Cause I'm living larger then life at the age of twentythree (ha ha)
a lot of pessimistic people is speaking about my lifestyle
So when I enter the center I look for the smiles
Many expected me to go down the tubes
Now the same people wishing that they could be in my shoes
But I'm the one they call hopeless
Lord forgive em for thinking that I was worthless
I forgive and forget
And I learn from every life experience
I hope why'all feel every word cause this is real it gets
They call me hopeless

They say I'm hopeless

They say I'm worthless, worthless, worthless
[Lady TRU]
And I'm up to my head in it
[Sons of Funk]
And I'm up to my head in it, up to my head in it, oh

[C-Murder]
They said I'm hopeless and I never make it
They doubt it, call me an outcast because I'm bout it
Now why you want to label me and say I'm a thug
I never said I wasn't because this ghetto is in my blood
But I maintain through poverty and tears
My only wish was that I make it to see another year
I left my dreams up in the penn, feel my constant struggle
And one man against a nation, damn I miss my brother
I walk a path to a dead end cause I'm lonely
A childhood full of rainy days kept me homeless
I always wondered was I cursed
Since birth I felt I never had a fair chance in life on this wreched earth
My lonely memories of the past, they got me thinking
I don't want to see the future, but die in vain
I ask the Lord will he forgive me
Before I leave this world I want to live a better life because I'm hopeless

[Lady TRU]
They say I'm hopeless
[Sons of Funk]
They say I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless

They say I'm worthless

They say I'm worthless, worthless, worthless

And I'm up to my head in it
[Sons of Funk]
I'm up to my head in it, yeah

They say It's hopeless
[Sons of Funk]
They say It's hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
[Lady TRU]
For me to make it out the ghetto now
[Sons of Funk]
For me to make it out the ghetto

Feel my pain, feel my pain
This ghetto got me goin through some thangs
God feel my pain. (x4)

(fiend talking)

There comes a time, where uhhh, you have things of yourself, when you
Lose someone, how you gonna take that feelin away? I got sons of funk,
An me fiend, an my people, master p an silkk
They ready to tell you how I feel, trapped, everyday life.

Verse 1- (fiend)

Everytime I open my eyes, I thank God for wakin this soldier,
'cause in this cruel world it's hard to walk these streets bein sober,
It hurts, tryin to get over all the weight on my shoulders,
Mom used to be babysitters buyin boulders,
It's all on me to really except that I lost my brother,
An to be stong an juss to go on since we shared the same mother,
Pillows an covers can't smother the pain that I have,
Sometimes I feel like I lost my better half, so sad,
But that's the way of the ghetto,
See yo life is already made, it's an accomplishment to pass ""a"" grade,
See they hate my city, givin us the pushers an tramps for our highs,
Sellin they book of food stamps at night,
I light the porch lamp, until my lil cousin came in,
'cause I can't afford to lose another gender life,
But livin this bend you could lose it if it came today,
It rained away, you be wonderin how to take the pain away.

(chorus-sons of funk)

Tell me what we gonna do? the world ain't the same man,
The way we live is a shame, I can't hide this pain. (x2)

Verse 2-(master p)

Ughhh! lord the world ain't the same, from the cradel to the grave,
Dear mama keep yo head up I'm tryin ta get paid,
These ghetto tears got me out there wantin to scream,
My auntie 35, but bumpin 17 off a dope fiend,
I live my whole life to stack some chips,
An it's a shame when yo own homie, sank yo ship,
An mama cryin......'cause church's be packed,
An all yo family an friends dressed in black,
An it's a shame, to see homies leave this earth,
Some say ball, til you fall, now it's ashes an dirt,
Sometimes, I feel like I'm trapped between heaven an hell,
In the ghetto's ? ? ? tory, wit fiends an crack cells.

Verse 3-(silkk the shocker)

You might catch me, walkin wit my head down,
In the pourin rain,
Tryin to find answers to questions, no one can seem to explain,
I coulda been born son of a king,
Instead I was born son of a, killa, surrounded by dealaz an fiends,
Dear God I got some questions, that maybe you can answer,
Why my brother got shot, an my grandmother died of cancer,
Now through it all I tried to ball an keep it real,
They say they don't feel what I feel,
I guess 'cause they don't live where I live,
See my mom tried to be strong, my brother died
Didn't wanna see her cry,
But I seen her through the face of the mirror
Wipin tears from her eyes,
An my next door neighbor committed suicide, was it 'cause of stress,
An if it was, was it that bad that he had to choose death?

Listen up motherfuckers I got a story to tell
All you niggas out there holding hands with these motherfuckers street
Them motherfuckers behind doors holding meat
You might be holding a nasty ass

Chorus (2x):

Nasty bitch, gonna fuck my boy
Now how you gonna fuck my boy
That's why I don't love them hoes
You can't trust these dog ass hoes

Verse: 1

I was in love like a motherfucker with this bitch
But uhh, I wasn't doing nothing but making her rich (shit)
But damn, she used to played it so cooled
I guess she must take see for a fool
I swear the sex had my motherfucking mind gone
And I was tweeking like a fiend for that heroin
And when I put it in, the way that she moaned,
made me never ever wanted to leave her alone
The back rubs in the hot tubs, watching videos
It made me crawl when she took it all down her throat
Surprise, shit I hit her with a five karat
And later on we can talk about marriage (huh)
Ya name tatted on my chest, fuck them other broads
We hold hands when we walking through the shopping malls
My brother told me V charge it to the game
But uhh, listen up, cause it's a motherfucking shame

Chorus (2x)

Verse: 2

I used to page this girl about ten times a day
But after 9, she was hard to find
One-of-a-kind, huh, so I was blind with the problems we had
Found a number in her purse, said it was her dad
I got a phone call from my nigga Jubilee
He told me, he saw my girl in the movies
With another nigga, nut it wasn't me
I said man, you must be tripping, nigga it couldn't be
I thought it was love, but I guess the love was gone
So then I put up the phone and then I went home
Park the car, walked in the door, walked up the stairs
And I damn near slipped on her underwear
Opened the bedroom door, seen a ho,
with a nigga ro, bout to grab my fo-fo, hold
Damn, bitch I thought we loved each other
Nasty bitch gonna fuck my brother

Bitch, get the fuck out my house,
pick up your dirty ass draws, get that cum off your chest, 
and wipe your motherfucking mouth, and get the fuck out, biatch!
Fuck you gonna fuck my motherfucking boy
Ol' cheesy ass ho
I didn't like you anyway
Biatch
I catch you in the club, I'ma sneak your ass
Fuck, nasty bitch

Chorus (2x)",Nasty Chick,1999
Sons of Funk,"(Silkk)
??  how I miss my homies so
I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest
Just think about it
It only add 
More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
""Silkk, where my daddy at?""
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

(Chorus)
I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there
	(repeat)

(Silkk)
Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

(chorus2x)

(Silkk)
It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap
Rest in peace Biggie
Rest in peace Pac
And all them other soldiers
Make us see it??",End of the Road,1999

  Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
  I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
  You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

[Silkk the Shocker]
Last Year, I was the help, this year I'm the boss
You don't like it?  Fuck y'all, they'll find y'all niggaz lost
Fuck with real niggaz, mob figures
Not you niggaz that's soft
I'm talking about visiting some of you niggaz
Some of you, niggaz is talk
I always been a made man starting when I was, just a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don, put me down on his team
Told me to be, down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so, the world can be yours so I put my, life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game, but I learned quickly
Told me you could live good
But wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make, moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust anybody a 100 percent, realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without
Power respect, loyalty, is a way of life
You've been chosen, to be the Made Man
Everybody gotta turn
there's rules to this shit
That everybody gotta learn
To go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow. I rule the world

[Chorus]
I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I want to rule and I did, the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

I want the world and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, from the cradle, to the grave
I want to rule and I got my chance the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I want the finer things, the car, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it. (time will bring)
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it
I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I, thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with
them niggaz, wind up missin'
Used to be broke, but now I'm nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies but now if I get convicted
It's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was, never let it show
Cause of my baby face
I did a lot of crime but, they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever, leave no witnesses
If I gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothin' personal just business
A Made Man with a vision
Learned to, master the system
My family never see's me
I just send em, presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno, stock in a Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by, Valentino
I want the world, and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high, this time is, sky's the limit
Sometimes it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brothers
Never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

(Lemme holla at you dog) She done met up with a star, eye contact
I nodded, she nodded back, then we met up at the bar

And I'll still respect you tomorrow, and tonight I hit it
But you only got a couple minutes to choose
And my time is like dollars so I only got a couple minutes to lose

And um, ain't no dollars like the ones we fold
When we give somethin, call us, it's outta control

Sons of Funk,"Picture this, any man that hustle because like to is a fool.
Any man that hustle because he got to feed his family.... 
That's a real man.nYou see I hustle because I got feed me family 
I got families to feed, I got feed my mama, 
I got to feed big mama, I got to feed my cousin, 
I got to feed my lil' brother, I got to feed my sister, 
I got to feed my kids, I got to feed my people.

[Chorus]
The ghetto's got me hustlin' tryin' to survive
The ghetts got me hustlin' tryin' to stay alive.
The ghetto get me hustlin' tryin' to survive,
And I know I'm goin' to hustle until the day I die.

Uh!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggaz tryin' call da police tryin' to book us.
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

[Chorus]

It's like I'm rich and poor
I open the world and slang dop
It's the world changes know and changes I thorp.
I thank all my big brothers with out him I wouldn't made it through
So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride. 
Keep your head up!

Yo Yo Yo I never was the type to stress
Get It off my chest

y'all can fill in the rest
we both say yes
guess we were both like phony
jumped in too quick
ideally cus we both was lonely
we go 2 stores and you never peek at the price
Treat you right had a bad day i just greet you with ice
you know Silkk The Shocker hang with the thugs and the dealers
wasn't the realest Never the type to get in to expressing my feelings
I ain't gon lie It wasn't all bad
Some was good
matter fact it was all that'
Sometimes i feel like we just didn't match
Found a friend
But only friend till then you alwayz came first
Never type to creep Alwayz tried to make things work
What What

Chorus

[Silkk The Shocker]
I want to be with you but i can't hope you understand and all
Tried to make this thang work
Got knocked you'll be the first person i call
Now with you can be myself
with her it's like i'm living a lie
I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along
That wouldn't be fair
So if it's a puzzle
I think I maybe just missing a clue
Leave or Stay?
God tell me what's a nigga to do
What What What

For real, I know we from different sides and all
And I ain't even goin' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

[Chorus]
So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

[Silk]
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood

Now during sex lay there I'm a have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type

But I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it

Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with

Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You keep, keep on askin me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin in 
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won

You know what I'm sayin it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 

Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin trips to the east
Takin shoppin sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four

Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more...imagine that

That you were just too damn ghetto for me

Move that house on the lake for the kids and the wife
Check the bank account, it's seven figures
Who that Rolls in the video for, it's mines nigga
I got game, ask the players in the pro's
Who got shot, it ain't my fault 
(Ohhhh it ain't my fault) he owed me dough
Independent, black-owned, my world, my country
No Limit and Roc-A-Fella run this like drug money
So can I get a huh, huh? A what, what?
Pass the weed cause soldiers like to puff, puff
From the South to the East baby, baby
A couple of unggggh's now they gotta pay me
And flip bricks with ghetto chicks with no bicks
And nine's with no clips and sides wit no chips
Come fast or slow, from cheddar to dough

The rowdiest niggaz you know

Sons of Maxwell,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend

A clash of religions, as some failed conversations brought death in the end.

Used to a high school beauty queen

Wound up on the wrong end of a dream

And said never again

Started livin' life for the bottom line

Married her a man well past his prime

Forty million dollars and not much time now

She's payin' for the perfect crime on

All that's left is a heartache made of gold


He bought her a house in the Hollywood hills

There were parties and the room was filled with

Stars fallin' from the usual thrills

It was fun for awhile

But there's a prison in paradise

They never tell you when they throw the rice

That pretty mirrors don't look so nice

When you're standing on the desperate side of

The same faces come tricklin' in

She feels alone and she steps outside

Stares out at the valley lights

Pours a drink and she starts to cry

She's got it all and she can't get by on

Either gone or just not around
And I was wrong when I said I'd change

This morning I tasted doubt
As she kissed me on my way out
And it took me twenty-two miles, too many years
And one red light for it all to come clear

That kiss really meant goodbye
That's why I floor it

Just to see her face when I get there

To show her how much I care

Sonya Cohen,"My sister's name is puddentane.
If you ask me again, I'm gonna tell you the same.
My brother's name is Little Jack Horner.
He talked back to momma and she put him in the corner,

Sister told papa when he got home,
""Papa, papa, he's been sassing mom.""
Papa looked at brother with fire in his eye.
Brother started doing the hand jive. 

He called on sis and he called on mom,
Said, ""Look here, look here what this boy knows.""
Everybody was real surprised,
But brother had tears in his eyes.

Sonya Hunter,"4+20 years ago
I come into this life
The son of a woman
And a man who lived in strife
He was tired of being poor
And he wasn't into selling door to door
And he worked like the devil to be more

A different kind of poverty now upsets my soul
Night after sleepless night
I walk the floor and I want to know
Why am I so alone?
Where is my woman can I bring her home?
Have I driven her away?
Is she gone?

Morning comes to sunrise
And I'm driven to my bed
I see that it is empty
And there's devils in my head
I embrace the many colored beast
I grow weary of the torment
Can there be no peace?
And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease.",4 + 20,1998

Let my heart feel love again
Let her in
Don't you know how long it's been

On a coca-cola tray

Racin' cross the fresh cut lawn
And we were runnin' barefoot in the grass
Barefoot in the grass

When I was twelve I started likin' boys
She was still playin' with her toys
I pointed out that she was only nine
I didn't need her taggin' behind
Then I would jump on my red bicycle 
I'd look back, I'd get tickled
She was runnin' barefoot in the grass
Barefoot in the grass

It brings a smile to my face
Seein' her, no shoes in a foot race
Runnin' as fast as she can
Wavin' her hands and calling out my name
Little sister
Oh I wonder if she knows how bad I miss her

I remember being so confused
When mom and daddy broke the news
I never even saw her cry
Though I could tell she was hurtin' inside
But now I'm sure she has a full head of hair
And I know that somewhere up there
She's runnin' barefoot in the grass
Barefoot in the grass

It brings a smile to my face
Seein' her, no shoes in a foot race
Runnin' as fast as she can

On unseen things above
The Savior spoke unto me
And filled my heart with love

I'm gonna die on the battlefield
I'm gonna die in this war
I'm gonna die on the battlefield
With glory in my soul

I used to have some people
Who walked and talked with me
But since I've been converted
They've turned their backs on me

Some say give me silver
And some give me gold
But I say give me Jesus

It's hard to hear it when we never talk at all

So you walk on the wire over the fire
Your balancing act is still intact as you keep on stalling

You've got to take a leap and let your feelings show
Just loosen up and you'll get used to letting go

'Cause that's what love demands
You must understand
The laws of gravity do not apply to love

Well I like what I see when you look at me
And I do believe the possibilities are endless
Like breakfast in bed the comfort you get
From there being two instead of just you
But still you're apprehensive

There comes a time when you've just gotta act on trust
And baby that's what's got to be between the two of us

'Cause that's what love demands
You must understand
The laws of gravity do not apply to love

You go flying when you fall
But only if you risk it all

He could have chosen to break through the sky
With anthem and angel wing
But He knew we'd understand a baby's cry
And learn love from a servant King

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been so many babies to become a king
Only one King, one King became a baby",One King,2009
Sonya Kitchell,"My words ran away from me
Now I'm lost and they're out at sea
Sailing away

They come and go, like the breeze
Whisper sweet, burn like disease
They change with the day

And I seem to say
All the wrong things on the right day
And I seem to do
All the wrong things on the right cue
At least most of the time

My words took me down the wrong track
And now I want to take it back
So I'll run away

If only I could be free
Of the plague that my words seem to be
I'd thank the day

For I seem to say
All the wrong things on the right day
And I seem to do
All the wrong things on the right cue
At least most of the time

And Life can be
Such a give or take
Some laugh while they're dying
Some cry when they wake
But there are some words
That I could never do without
That paint pictures on polished walls
And dance away with doubt

My words came back to me
They stayed awhile, we had some tea
While time whiled away

I said, Please be kind and please don't go
They said, We'll try, but you never know

Feeling so lonely, feeling so lonely
Feeling so lonely, I could cry

I met a man with eyes so blue, that I
I could've sworn he saw right through the lie

He was a little too old, perhaps to bold

Isn't the season, how could he not know?

I saw a robin captive to the wind
Time, running thin
I said, ""Dear robin, what a state you're in
You can't get out again""

And just like that
Simple as the sight of feathered wings
The robin was gone
And only I saw this bird of spring
Sing one very last winter song

And who will miss you when you're gone?
Who will miss you when you're gone?
I will miss you if you go away
Please, don't leave me here

Whispering, darlin', go to sleep

Des flammes sur mon chemin, mes yeux cachent un cimetière
Oublier hier pour enterrer demain
Le malheur m'aime, j'ai l'amour qui crame
Seule Madame Courage prend sa place dans mes drames
Triste est la surface, sombre est l'intérieur
Vivre les cauchemars, les rêves restent inférieurs
Dans la gueule du loup, dans la cage du lion
Ni force pour m'en sortir, ni partage d'union
Ce soir, je pardonne personne, j'ai les yeux rougis
Croisé un démon qui a soufflé ma bougie
Réveille pas l'autre en moi va pas le faire rager
Dans une rue du 93, d'un quartier d'Alger
J'connais plus personne, ce soir j'ai quinze ans
Rien à branler comme de mon premier bain de sang
Le ciel me hagar, les étoiles se moquent
J'ai la vengeance des rues, le regard des blocs
Et rien ne va plus, les jeux sont faits dans les sommes
Pas un seul chapeau mais des sa7a les hommes
Lune détruit mes nuits, l'autre qui tue l'sommeil
Ce soir c'est fini, je verrai plus l'soleil
Fianso

Laissez-moi tranquille, ce soir j'ai pris Madame Courage
Laissez-moi tranquille, ce soir j'ai pris Madame Courage
Laissez-moi mourir, après tout ce que j'ai vu à mon âge
Laissez-moi souffrir, la vie a pris mon cœur en otage

Laissez-moi tranquille, ce soir j'ai pris Madame Courage
Laissez-moi mourir, après tout ce que j'ai vu à mon âge
Laissez-moi souffrir, la vie a pris mon cœur en otage

Je souffre déjà tellement, que j'ai rien senti quand tu m'as planté dans l'dos
Dix ans de prison dans les mains, demande à Youssef et Ali ce qui se passe à la Casbah
Me demande pas si ça va, demande-moi si aujourd'hui aussi ça va pas
Flingués dans ta kharrach, céllophanés, zatla, ghabra et Madame Courage
Wallah que mon cousin est venu à la nage
Marseille centre ville, Paris Barbès
Lah Yarhem, nos frères morts pour la survie
Algériens, Tunisiens, Africains, Marocains
On est mêmes pas morts, on paye, nous
On a été mis en sang dans du sang, nous
Coupable d'être africains, bougnoules
M3emmer les prisons de la France, koul youm
Mais j'sais pas qu'est-ce que j'suis venu faire, lalalala
Je sais même pas si c'est mieux de mourir ici ou là-bas

Laissez-moi tranquille, ce soir j'ai pris Madame Courage

Soolking,"On ira là où la dalle nous mène
Notre histoire, on l'écrira nous-même
Elle m'a dit: ""C'est pas pour ton buzz
Que je t'aime, oui que je t'aime""
Paroles, que des paroles
Ma seule patronne à moi, c'est ma daronne
Ils croyaient que j'étais mort, ils ont dit ""bon débarras""
Heureusement que c'est Dieu qui donne sinon, ils nous laisseraient nada
Donc j'ai quitté mon village, rêvé d'une vie juste moins minable
Moi, j'ai quitté mon village pour plus les entendre me dire que:

Personne te donnera de l'aide, de toute façon, t'es déjà dead
Tu passeras ta vie dans la merde et tes cauchemars remplaceront tes rêves

Je me souviens qu'ils me tournaient l'dos parce que j'étais pauvre comme papa
Rajoutent de l'argent à ceux qu'en ont et enlèvent à ceux qu'en ont pas
Dans la mer, ils rajoutent de l'eau, va comprendre
Et si tu meurs de soif toi, on t'abandonne
Si tu veux que ta vie soit bella, maquille-la toi-même
On veut le monde, on va le prendre, et puis salam
Un rêveur parmi tant d'autres et mes frères sont des millions
Nos rêves nous vivront, n'écoute pas ceux qui diront que

Personne te donnera de l'aide, de toute façon, t'es déjà dead
Tu passeras ta vie dans la merde et tes cauchemars remplaceront tes rêves

Préviens le monde j'suis venu le croquer
Prédestiné à rien exaucer
Aujourd'hui regarde-moi vivre de mes souhaits
Tout le mal-être de ma jeunesse
Je l'ai chantée avec mes complexes
Fils d'immigré j'ai dû faire la guerre
Pour que la rue de la paix devienne mon adresse
J'ai chanté ma mélancolie dans les quatre coins du monde sans jamais lâcher (ouais ouais ouais)
Eh tes mélodies qui t'ont fait danser sur des messages de paix (ouais ouais ouais)
Eh j'ai vu des stades entiers en feu sur mes refrains (ouais ouais ouais)
Rien n'a changé j'ai toujours le même rêve de gamin (ouais ouais ouais)
