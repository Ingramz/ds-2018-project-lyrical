The Tragically Hip,"I've often dreamt of a conversation
That just keeps coming up again and again.
We're sitting in the Baby Bar bereft
At a shadowy table out past the sentences end.
From until it's no longer fun
'Til that's no longer relevant.
From until we're no longer one
'Til the bona-fide embodiment of an endless
Emergency without end.
We're an endless emergency without end

We often stop in these conversations,
Things we say here stay here forever amen.
When everything seems either funny or lousy,
Funny or lousy, that's where it usually ends.
From until we're no longer fun
'Til that's no longer relevant.
From until we're no longer one
'Til that's no longer permanent.
From the last survivors of those terms
To the bona-fide embodiment
Of an endless emergency
Without end.
We're an endless emergency
Without end.
We're an endless emergency
Without end,

But
Your finger starts to wiggle
And
Landscapes emerge",Emergency,1995
The Tragically Hip,"You triumphed over will
You had immunity to kill
You had your dreams fulfilled
And I love you still
But there's a power beyond control
There's a fire in the hole
Ah the nights are getting cold
All your secrets will be told
Turn your lanterns low

As long as you can dig up proof
As cold as water through the roof
Brutal as depicted truth
That kid's a fuckin goof
Turn your lanterns low
But there's a power beyond control
There's a fire in the hole
Yeah the nights are getting cold
All his secrets will be told
Turn your lanterns low
Alright

I'd like to stand up soon and show
I'd like to let some people know
I'd turn my bucket over
I'd turn my lantern low
But there's a power beyond control
There's a fire in the hole
Yeah the nights are getting cold
All my secrets would be told
Turn your lanterns low
Alright
Alright",Fire in the Hole,1995
The Tragically Hip,"Greasy jungle metropolis noir easy tangles the easiest so far ah 
I drove down your road to hazeldean where I tasted your funeral
Home's sandwiches and coffee I saw your hands melt into one another 
I saw you grieve and grow care a lot about one another 

I stood at your sink and I felt your warm water I washed your dishes and 
I looked out your kitchen window where I saw a
Soulful gymnast melt in the air and shudder just above the snow 
Making moves that just weren't there ah velvet callow with wet

Hands I turned out the lights and breathing shallow hesitated then went upstairs 
Where I picked up your housecoat dried my
Hands and touched your hair and just then you awoke you could never really barely care 
Ah greasy jungle metropolis noir",Greasy Jungle,1995
The Tragically Hip,"I love you even when I don't even know I'm doing it 
And dismiss it out of hand cause I don't even know I'm doing it but your
Finger starts to wiggle and landscapes emerge 
Can you spare some change dear, we've only got three hundred feet to go

Roses are worth more dried than alive such a thing to say 
O how I adore you when you reinvent a rose cliche can you spare
Some change dear we've only got three hundred feet to go 
And with impossibilium for a payload we lift the rocket out of the
Pocket nothing can stop it

Roses are difficult everywhere you must promise me you'll stay
These long stems are freakish if anything but we can cut 'em
Down for the vase can you spare some change dear 
We've only got three hundred feet to go and with impossibilium for a Payload 
We lift the rocket out of the pocket nothing can stop it we can only watch it",Impossibilium,1995
The Tragically Hip,"Puffy lips glistening skin and everything comes rushing in we don't go to hell memories of us do

I get a sense of connectedness exclusive tight but nothing dangerous we don't go to hell memories of us do and if you go to hell
I'll still remember you

But I thought you beat the death of inevitability to death just a little bit I though you beat the inevitability of death to death just a
Little bit

Terry's gift is forever green it got me up and back on the scene we don't got hell just our memories do

Fantastic gap commom space open concept in your smiling face we don't go to hell memories of us do

And if you go to hell I'll still remember you",Inevitability of Death,1995
The Tragically Hip,"I had this dream where I relished the fray
And the screaming filled my head all day
It was as though I'd been spit here
Settled in, into the pocket
Of a lighthouse on some rocky socket
Off the coast of France, dear

One afternoon, four thousand men died in the water here
And five hundred more were thrashing madly
As parasites might, in your blood

Now I was in a lifeboat designed for ten, ten only
Anything that systematic would get you hated
It's not a deal nor a test nor a love of something fated

The selection was quick, the crew was picked in order
And those left in the water
Got kicked off our pant leg
And we headed for home

Then the dream ends when the phone rings
""You doing all right?""
He said, ""It's out there most days and nights
But only a fool would complain""
Anyway, Susan, if you like
Our conversation is as faint a sound in my memory
As those fingernails scratching on my hull",Nautical Disaster,1995
The Tragically Hip,"Interesting and sophisticated
Refusing to be celebrated
It's a monumental big screen kiss
It's so deep it's meaningless

One day you'll just up and quit
Yeah and that'll be it
Just then the stripper stopped in a coughing fit
She said sorry I can't go on with this

Yeah that's awful close
But that's not why
I'm so hard done by

It was true cinema a clef
You should see it before there's nothing left
In an epic too small to be tragic
You'll have to wait a minute
'Cause it's an Instamatic

Yeah that's awful close
But that's not why
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by

One day you'll just up and quit
And that'll be it
Just as the room became more dimly lit
As the emcee carried on with it
Yeah that's pretty close
Well that could be why

I'm so hard done by

The Tragically Hip,"Everyone's got their breaking point
With me it's spiders and with you it's me
Thugs in perpetuity
When we're excited little birds around the feeder
The cat's indifferent or he's just furious
It seems that he's never neither
I do the rolling you do the detail
I do the rolling you do the detail

Hair bird plucks a hair from a sleeping dog
To build her nest she said I've looked around
And I like your hair the best
I do the rolling you do the detail
I do the rolling you do the detail

Ruby, honey are you mad at your man?",Thugs,1995
The Tragically Hip,"One day in El Paso
The cops go into the crowd
Under a glaring bladder of light
And the music is so loud
And the tourists take their T-Shirts off
A busload of kids gives you the finger
Afternoon when the sidewalk's hot
And the shadows too chilly to linger
Walk past damaged goods and ugly trends
Past a strawman making a purchase
Downtown where the river bends
They're just waiting for you to resurface
Take a look at this photograph
Clearly his teeth were bared
He coulda been yawning or snarling
The story was never clear

One night in El Paso
The cops go into the crowd
Under a throbbing bladder of light
And the music is just so loud
And the tourists turn their TV's off
And a bat sees a bug with the sound of a linger
Night time when the shadows cough
And you're chilled to the tips of your fingers
Walk past damaged goods and ugly trends
Past ol' strawman making a purchase
Downtown where the river bends
They're just waiting for you to resurface
Take a look at this photograph
Clearly his teeth were bared
He coulda been yawning or snarling
He coulda been anywhere",Yawning or Snarling,1995
The Tragically Hip,"First thing we'd climb a tree
And maybe then we'd talk
Or sit silently
And listen to our thoughts
With illusions of someday
Cast in a golden light
No dress rehearsal
This is our life

And that's where the hornet stung me
And I had a feverish dream
With revenge and doubt
Tonight, we smoke them out

You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century

Stare in the morning shroud
And then the day began
I tilted your cloud
You tilted my hand
Rain falls in real time
And rain fell through the night
No dress rehearsal, this is our life

But that's when the hornet stung me
And I had a serious dream
With revenge and doubt
Tonight, we smoked them out

You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century

You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century
And disappointing you is gettin' me down",Ahead by a Century,1996
The Tragically Hip,"The sweet sound of patent approval comin' down in a not quite fog 
The sweet sound of patent approval comin' down in
Powdery sparks the sweet sound of patent approval 
Comin' down with holiday concern the sweet sound of patent approval
Comin' down in a world of hurt

In my opinion the drug is ready

The warm hand of abject approval comin' down with its' ropey veins 
The warm hand of abject approval comin' down to the
Fingerbowl

In my opinion the drug is ready

The cold eye of constant approval comin' down to freeze the blood

The Tragically Hip,"There's a cannon shooting
Coconut cream

The Tragically Hip,"Sled dogs after dinner
Close their eyes on
The howlin' wastes
Kurt Cobain, reincarnated,
Sighs and licks his face
Then they drift past strips
Of Serengeti and the gates
Of Sleepy Hollow too
You can pause in wonder,
They paused in wonder and
Yea, I paused in wonder too
Just don't wake daddy

They can lay their heads
On their futon-beds,
So many miles from home
You can teach your children
Some fashion sense and they
Fashion some of their own
For when the policy-weary
Commune on the untamed land
Through white sheers
Whispers in their ears,
You're damned
And don't wake daddy

You can stuff yer void
With the asteroid
That's hurtlin' toward the earth
You can drop the bomb
That restores some calm
Then promises rebirth
Just don't wake daddy

It's the perfect time now
For an eclectic choice
They're all asleep but us now
It's time to hear your voice

Sing to end all songs
To end all songs",Don't Wake Daddy,1996
The Tragically Hip,"Does it diminish your
Super-capacity to love

Walk like a matador,
Don't be chicken-shit
And turn breezes into rivulets

Flamenco-sweep the air
And weave the sun
And stamp your feet for everyone

Does it exhibit your
Natural tendency to hate

Maybe a prostitute
Could teach you
How to take a compliment

Maybe I'll go to New York,
I'll drag you there
You said, ""no one drags me
Anywhere""

Does it diminish your
Super-capacity to love",Flamenco,1996
The Tragically Hip,"The beautiful lull,
The dangerous tug
We get to feel small
From high up above
And after a glimpse
Over the top
The rest of the world
Becomes a gift shop

The pendulum swings
For the horse like a man
Out over the rim
Is ice cream to him
The beautiful lull,
The dangerous tug
We get to feel small
But not out of place at all

We're forced to bed
But we're free to dream
All us human extras,
All us herded beings
And after a glimpse
Over the top
The rest of the world
Becomes a gift shop

I don't know what to believe,
Sometimes I even forget
And if it's a lie,
Terrorists made me say it

The Tragically Hip,"Instructions from the manual could not have been much more plain the blues are still required the blues are still required again
Past territorial piss-posts past whispers in the closets past screamin' from the rooftops we live to survive our paradoxes

Men here of the secret they pass in upholstered silence they only exist in crisis they only exist in silence past territorial

The Tragically Hip,"Watch the band through a bunch of dancers
Quickly, follow the unknown, with something more familiar
Quickly, something familiar
Courage, my word it didn't come it doesn't matter

Sleepwalk, so fast asleep in a motel
That has the lay of home and piss on all of your background
And piss on all your surroundings
Courage, my word, it didn't come, it doesn't matter
Courage, your word, it didn't come, it doesn't matter
Courage, my word, it didn't come, it doesn't matter
Courage, it couldn't come at a worse time

There's no simple explanation
For anything important any of us do
And yeah the human tragedy
Consists in the necessity
Of living with the consequences
Under pressure, under pressure
Courage, my word, it didn't come, it doesn't matter,
Courage, your word, it didn't come, it doesn't matter

The Tragically Hip,"I left your house this morning
'Bout a quarter after nine
Coulda been the Willie Nelson
Coulda been the wine

When I left your house this morning,
It was a little after nine
It was in Bobcaygeon, I saw the constellations
Reveal themselves, one star at time

Drove back to town this morning
With working on my mind
I thought of maybe quittin'
Thought of leavin' it behind

Went back to bed this morning
And as I'm pullin' down the blind
Yeah, the sky was dull and hypothetical
And fallin' one cloud at a time

That night in Toronto
With its checkerboard floors
Riding on horseback
And keeping order restored
'Til The Men They Couldn't Hang

The Tragically Hip,"It was our third time in New York
It was your fourth time in New York
We were fifth and sixth on the bill
We talk a little about our bands
Talk a little of our future plans
It's not like we were best friends

That number scheme comes back to me
In times beyond our heartbeat

We hung around 'til the final band called
""Escape Is At Hand For The Travellin' Man""
You yelled in my ear, this music speaks to me
They launched into, ""Lonely From Rock 'n Roll""
Followed by, ""They Checked Out An Hour Ago""
Closing with, ""All Desires Turn Concrete""

Those melodies come back to me
Time beyond our heartbeat

I guess I'm too slow, yes, I'm too, yes, I'm too slow
But you said anytime of the day was fine
You said anytime of the night was also fine

I walked through your revolving door
Got no answer on the seventh floor
Elevator gave a low moan
The pigeons sagged the wire with their weight
Listening to the singing chambermaid
She sang, ""They Checked Out An Hour Ago"", and chuckled

Those melodies come back to me

The Tragically Hip,"If there's a goal that everyone remembers,
It was back in ol' 72
We all squeezed the stick and we all pulled the trigger
And all I remember is sitting beside you

You said you didn't give a fuck about hockey
And I never saw someone say that before
You held my hand and we walked home the long way
You were loosening my grip on Bobby Orr

Isn't it amazing anything's accomplished
When the little sensation gets in your way
Not one ambition whisperin' over your shoulder
Isn't it amazing you can do anything

We hung out together every single moment
'Cause that's what we though married people do
Complete with the grip of artificial chaos
And believing in the country of me and you

Crisis of faith and crisis in the Kremlin
And yea we'd heard all of that before
It's wintertime, the house is solitude with options
And loosening the grip on a fake cold war

Isn't it amazing what you can accomplish
When you don't let the nation get in your way
No ambition whisperin' over your shoulder
Isn't it amazing you can do anything

Next to your comrades in the national fitness program
Caught in some eternal flexed arm hang
Droppin' to the mat in a fit of laughter
Showed no patience, tolerance or restraint

Temporary towers soar
Fireworks emulating heaven
Til there are no stars anymore
Fireworks aiming straight at heaven
Temporary towers soar
Til there are no stars shining up in heaven

Don't tell me that they're talking tough
Don't tell me that they're anti-social
Somehow not anti-social enough, all right

And porn speaks to it's splintered legions
To the pink amid the withered cornstalks in them winter regions
While aiming at the archetypal father
He said with such broad and tentative swipes why do you even bother?

Don't tell me what the poets are doing
Those Himalayas of the mind
Don't tell me what the poet's been doing
In the long grasses over time

Don't tell me what the poets are doing
On the street and the epitome of vague
Don't tell me how the universe is altered
When you find out how he gets paid, all right

Away from the swollen city-breeze, garbage bag trees,
Whispers of disease and the acts of enormity
And lower me slowly, sadly and properly

Good enough for the frivolous""

This little silver boulder
This slowly falling star

Never getting older, where the moon-shocked curtains part

That is, I'll tell you like it is

Stop and treading water as the sun assimilated the words
For lighthouse fire
Burning down to embers' end

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Snug as a thug in a mugshot pose, a foul-mouthed rogue

Is this headboard hard? Am I a lap behind?
But to face doom in a sock-stenched room all by myself
Is the kind of fate I never contemplate
Lots of people would cry though none spring to mind

'When in Rome don't feed the lions'
What is meant I can't hazard a guess
But now I've learned my lesson I'm a better person
I'm filled up with high hopes and I'm fed up with soft soaps
Long in the tooth and short on wisdom
Up to here with the ache of it

And if the matchmaker calls hand in hand
With a catch of the day I'll rise to the bait
But it'll still be more than a heart can take
More than feeling great
More than a tongue can tell

I'd need to take leave of my senses to get a moment's rest
Following in footsteps
Foot sure in fancy dress
Head in my hands I'm making plans
Hoovering up for the day

When the matchmaker calls hand in hand
With the catch of the day I'll raise to the bait
But it'll still be more then a heart can take
More than feeling great
More than a tongue can tell

Has never been so hard to reach
With my hands tied behind my back
Shin deep in cement and sand
Just like the anchor man I broke loose
And crashed to the sea bed
Clutching the shortest straw

The Trash Can Sinatras,"That reminds me of the time I felt
It's time for sin and catholic guilt
Two years later to the day
I had reason to confess
With her hair a shining shade
Of bus-conductress blond
Tales of music and movement
Were told in grip and groan
But to put these thoughts
In songs like theirs
Of the honest truth
There'd be no trace
Just lying out loud

Meanwhile I'm back here in wonderland
A sorry sight with flowers in hand
Pours his heart out till his thirst
For college girls is satisfied
Standing there with ego
Proudly on tip-toe
All the time I'm thinking
Well, well, here we go

Another perfect song of greed
Brings the house down to its knees
By dying out loud

One more awful dancer
Steptoe's son a song and dance of love
When I think of soap operas
And what makes them so popular
The answer's posing in front of my eyes

Here comes our hero in hand-me-downs
And he's strutting to the strain of
'send in the clowns'
And troops his true colors
When no-one's around
And his desk-top tales
Are the best around but
Putting pain to paper reads
Like a lunge at fame and greed

The Trash Can Sinatras,"Always at the foot of the photograph - that's me there
Snug as a thug in a mugshot pose
Owner of this corner and not much more
Still these days I'm better placed to get my just rewards
I'll pound out a tune and very soon
I'll have too much to say and a dead stupid name

[Chorus]
Though I ought to be learning I feel like a veteran
Of ""Oh I like your poetry but I hate your poems""
Calendars crumble I'm knee deep in numbers
Turned 21, I've twist, I'm bust and wrong again

Rubbing shoulders with the sheets till two
Looking at my watch and I'm half-past caring
In the lap of luxury it comes to mind
Is this headboard hard? Am I a lap behind?
But to face doom in a sock-stenched room all by myself
Is the kind of fate I never contemplate
Lots of people would cry though none spring to mind

Know what it's like
To sigh at the sight of the first quarter of life?
Every stopped to think and found out nothing was there?

They laugh to see such fun
Playing Blind Man's Bluff all by myself
And they're chanting a line from a nursery rhyme
""Ba Ba Bleary Eyes have you any idea?""

The calendar's cluttered with days that are numbered",Obscurity Knocks [Shabby Road Demo],2004
The Trash Can Sinatras,"only tongue can tell
once upon a sign i read a warning and it said
'when in rome don't feed the lions'
what is meant i can't hazard a guess
but now i've learned my lesson i'm a better person
i'm filled up with high hopes and i'm fed up with soft soaps
long in the tooth and short on wisdom
up to here with the ache of it


and if the matchmaker calls hand in hand
with a catch of the day i'll rise to the bait
but it'll still be more than a heart can take
more than feeling great
more than a tongue can tell


i'd need to take leave of my senses to get a moment's rest
following in footsteps
footsure in fancy dress
head in my hands i'm making plans
hoovering up for the day


when the matchmaker calls hand in hand
with the catch of the day i'll raise to the bait
but it'll still be more then a heart can take
more than feeling great
more than a tongue can tell


and the itch to get rich quick
has never been so hard to reach
with my hands tied behind my back
shin deep in cement and sand
just like the anchor man i broke loose
and crashed to the sea bed
clutching the shortest straw
and if you threw me a line that's as smart as you think
it wouldn't stop me sinking down to cry
on what flashed before my eyes
what flashed before my eyes


",Only Tongue Can Tell [Shabby Road Demo],2004
The Trash Can Sinatras,"that reminds me of the time i felt
it's time for sin and catholic guilt
two years later to the day
i had reason to confess
with her hair a shining shade
of bus-conductress blonde
tales of music and movement
were told in grip and groan
but to put these thoughts
in songs like theirs
of the honest truth
there'd be no trace
just lying out loud


meanwhile i'm back here in wonderland
a sorry sight with flowers in hand
pours his heart out till his thirst
for college girls is satisfied
standing there with ego
proudly on tip-toe
all the time i'm thinking
well, well, here we go


another perfect song of greed
brings the house down to its knees
by dying out loud


one more awful dancer
steptoe's son a song and dance of love
when i think of soap operas
and what makes them so popular
the answer's posing in front of my eyes


here comes our hero in hand-me-downs
and he's strutting to the strain of
'send in the clowns'
and troops his true colours
when no-one's around
and his desk-top tales
are the best around but
putting pain to paper reads
like a lunge at fame and greed
just crying out loud

The Trashmen,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

The Travelin' McCourys,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

The Traveling Wilburys,"Tweeter and the Monkey Man were hard up for cash
They stayed up all night selling cocaine and hash
To an undercover cop who had a sister named Jan
For reasons unexplained she loved the Monkey Man

Tweeter was a Boy Scout 'fore she went to Vietnam
And found out the hard way, nobody gives a damn
They knew that they found freedom just across the Jersey line
So they hopped into a stolen car, took Highway 99

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

The undercover cop never liked the Monkey Man
Even back in childhood he wanted to see him in the can
Jan got married at fourteen to a racketeer named Bill
She made secret calls to the Monkey Man from a mansion on the hill

It was out on Thunder Road, Tweeter at the wheel
They crashed into paradise, they could hear them tires squeal
The undercover cop pulled up and said ""Everyone of you is a liar
If you don't surrender now it's gonna go down to the wire""

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

An ambulance rolled up, a state-trooper close behind
Tweeter took his gun away and messed up his mind
The undercover cop was left tied up to a tree
Near the souvenir stand, by the old abandoned factory

Next day the undercover cop was hot in pursuit
He was taking the whole thing personal, he didn't care about the loot
Jan had told him many times, ""It was you to me who taught
In Jersey anything's legal as long as you don't get caught""

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

Some place by Rahwey Prison they ran out of gas
The undercover cop had cornered them, said
""Boy, you didn't think this could last?""
Jan jumped out of bed, said, ""There's someplace I gotta go""
She took the gun out of the drawer, said, ""It's best that you don't know.""

The undercover cop was found face down in a field
The Monkey Man was on the river bridge, using Tweeter as a shield
Jan said to the Monkey Man, ""I'm not fooled by Tweeter's curl
I knew him long before he became a Jersey Girl""

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

Now the town of Jersey City is quieting down again
I'm sitting in a gambling club called the Lion's Den
The TV set was blown up, every bit of it is gone
Ever since the nightly news showed that the Monkey Man was on

I guess I'll go to Florida and get myself some sun
There ain't no more opportunity here, everything's been done
Sometimes I think of Tweeter, sometimes I think of Jan
Sometimes I don't think about nothing but the Monkey Man

Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her 
Tell Laura I may be late 
I've something to do that cannot wait

He was the youngest driver there 
The crowed roared as they started the race 
Round the track they drove at a deadly pace 
No one knows what happened that day 
How his car overturned in flames 
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck 
With his dying breath, they heard him say 

Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her 
Tell Laura not to cry 
My love for her will never die 

Now in the chapel where Laura prays 
For her Tommy who passed away 
It was just for Laura he lived and died 
Alone in the chapel she can hear him cry

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught

Leaves from the spring to fall

She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1984
The Triffids,"I knew him as a gentle young man
I cannot say for sure the reasons for his decline
We watched him fade before our very eyes
And years before his time

Surrounded himsef with shiny things
First night tickets, ermine, pearls upon a string
And disappeared in all the pestilence
That sudden pleasure brings

He never asks after her anymore
He made a point of losing her address
And every trinket that she ever touched
He keeps locked away
And just burns up in the furnace of his chest

Well I spoke to a man who says he's done it all
And the only thing that pleases or excites him now
Is hurting, hurting then hurting some more
There's someone I want to forget tonight
Don't you want to forget someone too?
I left him, and I can leave you too

Baby let's go out tonight
It will all turn out all right I'm sure
Don't want to drink at home again tonight
So let's go out

The Triffids,"Well, the drums rolled off in my forehead
And the guns went off in my chest
Remember carrying the baby just for you
Crying in the wilderness

I lost track of my friends, I lost my kin
I cut them off as limbs
I drove out over the flatland
Hunting down you and him

The sky was big and empty
My chest filled to explode
I yelled my insides out at the sun
At the wide open road

It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road

So, how do you think it feels
Sleeping by yourself?
When the one you love, the one you love
Is with someone else

Then it's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
And now you can go to any place
That you want to go

I wake up in the morning
Thinking I'm still by your side
I reach out just to touch you
Then I realize

It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road

So, how do you think it feels
When sleeping by yourself?
When the one you love, the one you love
Is with someone else

Much to your surprise
The blinds were down, the lights were dim
And love was in your eyes

The table lit by candle light
A record playing low
And from the room I heard a voice
A voice I didn’t know
Say, ""I need you, I need you""

Can you imagine how I felt?
To know like someone else
Making love to you in there
It should have been myself

I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t cry
My heart was filled with pain
And as I turned to walk away
I heard his voice again
Say, ""I need you, I need you""

I felt so sad, I had to take a walk outside
To find out what went wrong and if I'd really tried
To love you girl and be there when you needed me
In spite of what you’d done, I love you hopelessly

You’ve got such a pretty face
That's why you appeal to him
But he don’t know you like I do
‘Cause you say everything

You say that you love me
Now just look at what you’ve done
‘Cause you’ve got one more in your arms
The other on the run
‘Cause I need you, I need you

I need you, I need you, I need you

The Troggs,"She said, ""Meet me at the gates at 8
Leave now, don't be late""
She said one day she'd walk away
'Cause I was always late

Thought things were okay
Didn't care anyway
Say, ""Sorry babe
I had to meet a mate"", temptin' fate

We first met through a shared view
She loved me and I did too
It's now seven fifty, gettin' ready, better be nifty
Do my hair quickly, step out, it's cloudy

Mate bells me to borrow money
I got two Henry's and a dealer to pay
Call upon Geezers to rid these green trees of my reekin' jeans
Got a 'You think I care' air, outglarin' Geezers stares

I'm here and I'm there
Couldn't see past the end of my beer
What was gettin' near?
All the silence after the cheers

I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late, too late
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?

She said,""Meet me at the gates
Don't be late""
But pretty soon the day came for change
And I was glad she never walked away

So I'm choosin' what to wear
Doin' my hear with an hour to spare
When my life went pear
She'd been there with a thick stare

Big wheel climbed to the top
Geezers stares bounced off
Standin' at the top of this huge mountain
Smilin' and shoutin', spring flowers sproutin'

Not one inch of doubt in my mind
As I reached the gates
Came 'round the corner at a rate
Risked her love but I'm gonna set things straight

Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late

I didn't know that it was over
'Till it was too late, too late
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?

I said, ""Meet me at the gates
Leave now, don't be late""
I waited for a while listenin' to her voice mail
Mind set sail

Then the facts turned me pale
Wind, rain and hail
My fears unveiled
For my fair female

She'd walked away
Too little too late
I step up the pace
Walk past the gates

Rain runs over my face
Spirit falls from grace
I purchase a hazy escape
At the alcohol place in the chase

Sat down, I got a fat frown
Weapin' and drownin'
My senses
For this love game's expensive

I walk in a trance
Got a wounded soldier stance
The everyday geezers stares
Throw me off balance

Now nothin' holds significance
And nothin' holds relevance
'Cause the only thing I can see
Is her elegance

I didn't know that it was over
'Till it was too late, too late
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?

The Trophies,"It might be the way you move that keeps me up at night
Or the outline of your silhouette when you step into the light
Is it in the things you say or the message in your eyes
The urgency you feel from me cannot be denied
I wanted freedom, not some ball and chain
But now I feel like giving in
And I know what's to blame
It's just desire burning up my heart
I never want to let this feeling go
It's just desire
That makes me want to love you
All night long
I feel like there's a spell on me
That words just can't describe
It hit me like a ton of bricks
Right between the eyes
I swore I'd never take the fall
Now I'm hanging on the edge
Could you be my destiny
Or something I'll regret
This temptation just whets my appetite
I ain't hungry for no lasting thing
It's clear to me tonight
It's just desire burning up my heart
I never want to let this feeling go
It's just desire
That makes me want to love you

Beside an apple tree did grow

Long long ago

The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall

Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

The Troys,"I wear these old shoes with the holes in
To remind me of the million
Miles that I have walked beside you
Good and bad times we have been through

You know the car you drive
Keeps breaking down it never starts
But it reminds me of you and me in the back seat
Driving it home and now I'm all alone

What do you do? What do you do?
When everything is broken
What do you say? What do you say?
When no words fit the moment

'Cause you're not here and even if you were
All I could say is
What do I do? What do I do?
We're broken but I can't throw us away

Looking out the window
With the scratches on it at the sun
The world looks different when you're looking
Through a lens like a Picasso

The sky is bitter twisted just like you and me, I miss it
You snap it, bend it, burn it, break it
Then you find that you can't fix it
Fall back on whatever still remains

What do you do? What do you do?
When everything is broken
What do you say? What do you say?
When no words fit the moment

'Cause you're not here and even if you were
All I could say is
What do I do? What do I do?
We're broken but I can't throw us away

Breaking you in, breaking your heart
I was taking it all and I tore you apart
Breaking me in, breaking my heart
And the damage was done

But I took what you got
We were breakin' it, smashin' it
Takin' it, lovin' it, hatin' it
Drivin' it home and now I'm all, now I'm all alone

There's no more undead, it's nine lives

And call you my bitch, if you can't play the game fucker
Better stand outside it

Both you and your boyfriend in bed
Look at these faggots
How I beat them with just a touch of a pen
I could a smacked you hard,
But I tapped you bitch
And wrote this song instead
Like I said in story of a snitch
We are not best friends
I almost flew over the cuckoo's nest
I had to get shit off of my chest
You tried to push my ass
Off the edge ,

I heard her cry, the reactor flared
She grew and grew, I freaked and stared

All she did to get her kicks
Was step on all the men

She scooped me up, I could not win

Of the Limpopo River, 
There come the sounds of 
Female ecstasy (I shiver), 
Wet and wanton, their cries 
Caress by swollen ears, with building 
Fears, of this forsaken land of years. 
Visions of furious fire-goddesses wielding 
Blunt spits; figments of erotic escapades 
With all branches of armed forces. 
Surrounding, abounding, 
They stoop to conquer with sighs and 
Anxious whispers in a slow, steady rhythm.

How does their song go? 
Make a me wan mo, (Wild Women!) 
Wongo. 
No man can say no. 
Wild Women of Wongo. 
How does their song go? 
Like this... 

On the dank, steaming shores of Wongo; 
Its black sand beaches so bongo. 
Patterned with leech-ridden creatures; 
Bodies branded with cicatrix features 
That once screeched through the 
Heart of the Congo. 
Stacked and berserk 
They tower and flail all about. 
Wailing sounds in tongues only ancient 
Insects would understand or figure out. 
Wild, willing, wenches; strutting and 
Struggling, as they yank hanks of hair, 
Rooting and rutting in heat, 
As the earth heaves beneath their feet. 
And so on and on the lores of Wongo go, 
Throughout the sands of time. 
Singing their song of love, so rare, 
To only the chosen ones who dare. 
The course of events, time after time. 
The tradition remains the same. 
A bloodcurdling scream, one of pure 
Ecstasy, rings out; then it came --- 
The ultimate sacrifice. 
Their wasp waisted figures twitch and twine, 
Their sting is lethal, and I know I'm in for mine. 
How can I resist this onslaught of love; 
From over, from under, from behind and above. 
I wish I could",Wild Women of Wongo,2000

Do they bring you down

Do what I've gotta in a man's world

But this town don't scare me, I handle it heroically

Free at last 'cause now you're rearranging
All that was it hurts because
Sleepless nights remind you that you're standing
Still between the jump and where you're landing

Fires bum for just one night
They only give off so much light

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

It's not my fault she's too good-natured
My mind's set on getting wankered
So I drink myself into a state
With a silly grin upon my face

Don't wait up
Say don't wait up

And she'll be waiting by the phone
But it was her decision to stay at home
And all my thoughts for her are gone
But my thoughts for her are very wrong
And pulling weren't on my agenda
The fact I've got a bird just makes 'em keener

I don't care, my tool needs shining
She looks game for a bit of grinding
So we slither off like slithery snakes

There's faces I ain't seen in ages
They're all out to cane their wages

A little groove might ease the tension

Of your voice when I'm wound up
The choices I've been given
Keeping me driven

You blank out the sounds that I hear
Every time you pull me near
You take away all of my fear

They're trying to unveil my disguise
To uncover some truths and a couple of lies
Won't matter every tale told's been wiped
'Cos when I get found out, man, a lie is still a lie

And I feel like they're all sizing me up
I don't know about my punch but I've got a pretty good duck
That's a certain way to come unstuck
I can't carry on like this man it's too messed up

Since the panic set in I've never felt the same

I thanked her and called her back again
I said this song sure does fit me

What once was innocence turned on it's side
A cloud hangs over me, marks every move
Deep in the memory of what once was love

Oh, how I realized I wanted time
Put into perspective, tried so hard to find
Just for one moment I thought I'd got my way
Destiny unfolded, watched it slip away

Excessive flash points beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out, see what we can find
Valueless collection of hopes and past desires

I never realized the lengths I'd have to go
All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know
Just for one moment, hearing someone call
Looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all

Now that I've realized how it's all gone wrong
Got to find some therapy, treatment takes too long
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway
Got to find my destiny before it gets too late

Every morning I walk towards the edgeâ?¨And throw little things offâ?¨Like:â?¨Car parts, bottles and cutleryâ?¨Or whatever I find lying aroundâ?¨
It's become a habitâ?¨A wayâ?¨To start the dayâ?¨
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

It's early morning
No one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make
On their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
Imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks

When it lands
Will my eyes
Be closed or open?

So I can feel happier

And I knew right from wrong
Three can keep a secret
If two are dead and gone

Not alone, anyway
All alone, let us pray

",I'm Ready,2006
The Twilight Singers,"I am a fire starter, no ventilation, now I'm kneeling
As the smoke is swallowing
No need for water, darling, I'm dedicated to a feeling
I can't help but following

A slow roulette, a sweet duet
I can't forget, I'm tryin'

Feel the powder burn, tonight, tonight
There'll be nowhere to turn, it's alright, alright
And I burn, and I want that feeling again

I hear somebody calling
And now the fire's in the ceiling
There's no way to stop it now

A silhouette, of sweet regret
I can't forget, I'm tryin'

Feel the powder burn, tonight, tonight
Thre'll be nowhere to turn, it's alright, alright
And I burn, and no one can see me
And I yearn 'cuz I want that feeling again

A cigarette, the fuse is lit, I can't forget, I'm tryin'

Feel the powder burn, tonight, tonight
There'll be no self control, it's alright, alright
And I burn, and no one can see me tonight, tonight
And I yearn 'cuz I want that feeling, tonight, tonight, tonight

",Powder Burns,2006
The Twilight Singers,"Daylight is creeping, I feel it burn my face
I don't sleep here no more, so, my shadow walks in place of me
Like candy, your eyes, seetly, roll out of control
Like the singer, alive, but just barely holding on

far away, where you run, when it all becam undone
You'll be dust, realize, you were taken for a ride
But still you call that number, til you're crawling under
Them stones, assorted jones, and all alone

I'm alive, it kinda took me by surprise
But everytime I look away, there's no light
There's no sentry at the gate

far away, where you run, when it all becam undone
You'll be dust, realize, you were taken for a ride
But still you call that number
'til you're crawling under

",There's Been an Accident,2006
The Twilight Singers,"Take me to a place, high above the tide
Underneath the waves, where I can come inside
A reveille, told in fractured time
Only in this way, will I become alive

fill me with your love, I'm standing by
You and you alone, don't ask me why
There's an inner place, I cannot find

so s-o-l, and petrified
So, everytime, you blow your mind

I wait for you, you never come
You're bleeding through, I must be numb
And you are just a dream, I cannot find
From under what you see, don't ask me why

don't leave it alone, my love, my wreckage
I ain't to weak to run, tho slow, I'm coming

once I count the numbers down, to the end or there around
Free or thus, forever bound, for forever's coming down
And finally...

fill me with your love, I'm by your side
You and you alone, don't ask me why
For you I will be there, I just can't hide
From way beyond the glare, I'll tell you why

The Twilight Singers,"Once the feeling comes
You play the part
And break their hearts
Until you feel alive

Scratch through the ceiling
You love
To have your fun behind the gun
Until the fever dies

And

There's something at work here
There's something at work here
There's something at work here
Dark circles around your body

Soon you'll be stealing from
The odds and ends who once
Were friends, but now you
Demonize

Back to the meaning of
The way you are
You crash the car
To make the fever rise

And

There's something at work here
There's something at work here
There's something at work here
Chalk circles all around your body

Shiftless inside

What used to be your life

Slips your aching heart
And once again
Without, within
Will come to be invited",Be Invited,2011
The Twilight Singers,"You better shut your eyes
Here's where your life begins
There's something gone
Anesthetized again
I see you run
You're never coming back
You've lost control
So easy to distract

All come alive for the hesitant
The summer sun is blind and inveterate
Some seek a light
Some creep at night
Some run and hide

I do what I want to
I calculate
Forgot you were broken
My mistake
I look in the mirror
Time to pay
And nobody knows me
When I'm awake

I'm so sad
So keep it coming
You're falling down
I'll get your money
Walk in the room
And I see your ass has gone astray
You've lost your way
Come find your way

All come alive in the present tense
The summer sun has died of irrelevance
Some see the light
Some sleep at night
Some take their time

The Twilight Singers,"A little bit of smoke in the sky
It's late in the evening
And the end of the summer burns upon your skin

Never too late to cry
You sleep with strangers
I'll show you things that you've never seen
Then I'll take you home

Far below the city burns

They'll come as your friend and they'll warn you
About the rats in the barn
Come closer and when they disarm you
They'll ask you to sit in the front of their car

Cold blooded, but some like it freezing
I keep my blood in the bone
Just when you've forsaken me
That's when I turn my blinders on

And I'll make them bleed for my baby bird",Blackbird and the Fox,2011
The Twilight Singers,"Memories to crucify
Are sent below
I suppose
I suppose

To me
A truer lie was never told
Now you know
Now you know

Some speak of a light
Control of the game
But I leave the past alone

Beckoning in the night
And a wolf in the wings
I was the last to know

As rain turns a fire
To ember
There you were
There you-

And I feel that it's my
Turn to fall
Now you know
Now you know

They'll scream and recite
Your words from their cage
As I lead the lamb below

Reckoning
Do or die
In control of the same
I'll see you at the door

One more time, dear
This I know

One more time, dear
This I know

In a black sky
Where your dreams collide
Push your faith aside
And you'll realize

That you can't lie
What you feel inside
Nowhere to hide
You're melting

Your medicine is faith
And your flesh divine
Tethered to the flame
Of a dying light
Break you on the wheel
And your bones we'll grind
You'll love me

You're never gonna feel
Like you felt last night

Your guiding light?

With a second sight
You'll love me",Dynamite Steps,2011
The Twilight Singers,"Careful when you look into my eyes-
You'll turn to stone
And I am not that strong to let you go
And tell me, does it scare you
When I look the other way
And through the walls into your very soul?

I get lucky sometimes
I get lucky sometimes

Shakes me down for secrets
In the light of day, does she?
But I am not so dumb to let you know
Whispers and deceivers
Come divide the harmony
But I still have one card I've yet to show

I get lucky sometimes
I get lucky sometimes

Once you know the way down
The path belongs to you

Tell me, tell me
Why don't you tell me 'bout
The reasons why you're lying in
The dark when there's a

Y ahí me dieron la espalda
Ya con un pie en el infierno
Sólo un milagro me salva

The Twins,"Una mañana al despertar
Quise abrasarte ya no estabas
Abrí la puerta y te encontré
Con tus maletas arregladas
Sin preguntarte te escuche
Dijiste que te marchabas
Que ya tu amor no existe en mi
Que te perdone y es mejor así
Que continuar en mi morada

Esa mañana te perdí
Al comprender que me dejabas
Me diste el cuerpo y no el amor
Te di mi vida, cuerpo y alma
Y pensar que te quise
Como a nadie ame en la vida
Puse luto en mi cama
Y en mi memoria rosas blancas",Rosas Blancas,2008

The Twisters,"A long time ago, yeah
Before you was born dude
When I was still single
And life was great

I held this job as a traveling salesman
That kept me moving from state to state
Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
State of Louisiana

Wondering where a city boy could go
To get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
Catch a little bit of those Cajun girls
Dancing to Zydeco

Along come a young girl
She's pretty as a prayerbook
Sweet as an apple on Christmas day
I said good gracious can this be my luck

If that's my prayerbook
Lord let us pray

Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
State of Louisiana
Wondering what a city boy could do
To get her in a conversation

Drink a little red wine
Dance to the music of Clifton Chenier
The King of the Bayou

Well, that was your mother
And that was your father
Before you was born dude
When life was great

You are the burden of my generation
I sure do love you
But let's get that straight

Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
Across the street from The Public
Heading down to the Lone Star Cafe
Maybe get a little conversation

Drink a little red wine
Standing in the shadow of Clifton Chenier
Dancing the night away",That Was Your Mother,1986

Her heart is like a fortress.
She clings to her silence like a lover.
She wishes you were cold and heartless
So she wouldn't...
Wouldn't have to... feel.
Oh and when she lifts her head,
And your eyes meet,
She walks to your effortless,
With suffocating grace.
And you're caught up in the moment
And someone speaks,
And whisks it all away.

But this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends.
This moment never ends.

I've loved her forever, and in my dreams,
When the evening meets morning,
We're riding bareback moonbeams.
She belongs to different spaces.
She belongs to different times.

And this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

At these moments it was clear,
It's taken all my life... to get here.
Se waits for me at
The door way while I draw her pictures
Of my perfect world ...

And this moment never ends
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

The things that we learn and the things that we earn
Embarrassed and dazed at mistakes that we make

Jet streams in the sky
You're gone in the blink of an eye
Heavenly hugs and the shoulders you shrug
The bully, the boss and the priest and his cross
The letters we write and the wrongs you can right
The space that we meet in the loneliest weeks
Words in the wind
Repented our sins

The games that we play and the changes we make
The love and the light and the smiles you ignite
Skin on skin

The life that we chase, it feels like a waste

The U.K. Orchestra Ltd.,"How do you keep the music playing
How do you make it last
How do you keep a song from fading too fast

How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run out of new things to say

And if we know we're always changing
Why should it be the same
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear her name

I know the way I feel for you, it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes, I may not see forever, forever

If, if we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with everyday to make it better
As it grows, with any luck, then I suppose

We couldn't do it
Well we started like slow, see
Before I was able to give blows of three
My man Tone couldn't get shows for me
But that's alright cause we're here now; we're here now
From the first to the last of the elements included
I'm a flip it wiser, meaning with the prudent
Recollection of my naan lawyer brother and kids
Here's an example of what smotherin did
I was supposed to supposed to end up
Without a harvest but the crew spore finally
Of natural cause of course
Now when you hear the name U man, ask yourself who can
Duck a traitor kind of fast and easily?

Not another in this dimension

""Hey hey hey"" ""Here we go, here we go""

You try that puffin stuff, hell I had enough
Sometimes I've come and gone
I hear my old adversaries and they're singin my song
Hey-a hi-a hey-a hey
I wish and pray they'd stay, stay the hell away
Away away, dead upon the shores of the Staten

And flip my style and start to flow Tang-Wu

You had a chance to beat out but now your chance is gone

But you dissed me in fact, behind my back
So now my mark is set and I'm set to attack
I flow the facts, and here's the exact

I took a punch from school and got an easy diploma
All the boys and girls said ""Kim your life is over""
Even my lady girl held her part
Said I was a zero and it broke my heart
Cunnin are the actions of the few who dissed the U
(Try to blow us over with the compliments)
Too many complications have arisen from the fact
That you thought Kim was whack, way way back

The U.M.C.'s,"Castle on the borderline is surely like this
Approaching of a UMC is purely hypeness
(A fact) so I mention is again and again
(It's not necessary) those who comprehend my message very clearly
But not along the way to translucent
Throw your hands up for the man who sent
Invaders of my fruit basket, to a casket
Nina Dunnaway (see the fox run away)
So as a UMC, I ask myself who can be the leader
Resembling the saws ought to fall
(Well, it's you, Haas G.) and that's to find the coolest in me
At a whim, who would freeze blue cheese?
Spin a three-sixty on a runway
Stop, and hear many more than just one say
""U-N-I-V-E-R-S-A-L"" (Go on)
'Cause we gave 'em all one thought to grow on

I frame my method; my method is apparent
I see clearly this world's transparent
So I reach down deep
Deliver salvation to the hands of the weak
The meek, the mild, then tame the wild
'Cause that's how I'm styled
The wizard of rhyme; my symbol is AU
And lame is turned gold, so watch me shine through
A new zoo review coming right at you
And you, and you, Kim is coming through
I grow on, 'cause my strength is that of two
If rhyme's a boat, the beat must be my crew
A mental ingredient, all of which is alarming
Not harming, better said: disarming
As I disarm you, I neutralize your weaponry
To make you more appropriate to deal with me
And then I give you one to grow on

Grow on this when you're feeling kinda small
Grow on this to get through life all
Grow on this to have fun for the creator
Grew and grew, and when the time came play the
Old flow now, I'm wicked to the port of authority
You and I versus the majority
Here's what we're looking at, here
At the count of three, let's hear the UMC cheer

One, two, three... UMC's is the new way of being!

Grow on this to make you life seem great
Grow on this to take control of your fate
Grow on this until you finally understand
You done grew, and to the boys you the man
Sit beside the shoreline, and think about your woes
Read the whips and way; identify your foes
Then realize the sense of this existance
There's great resistance to the minds that mix this
Yes, I've made things no one would get them on the down low
'Cause it's obvious before I made the show
That I rule on three planes of reality
Universally, mystically, conceptually
Then in due time, you may find
That I'm living in the world of my design
And I gave you one to grow on",One to Grow On,1994

(Fear) is just a total disruption of my stunt
(You're being very blunt)
Now I'll unto a method that's new to start a hunt (How?)
Well, I kick it like so you see, I'm a UMC
Giving giving blows three forces of nature
Earth, wind, fire, let's negate the
Good cause I'm bad with the skill to create the
Quite slick, various tricks of the know how
Of a master like Faux Pau

Kick up, now that's just a common expression when I pick up
And start to teach my first lesson
(Arithmetic, reading, and writing) Not too exciting
I'll pick up on teachings that orchestrate my kingdom
Based upon elements of lyrics I bring them
Stone by stone (but did you build it alone?)
No kid was prone to seek it alone
From the kid who did, sell a party well
(Do tell) Oh well, I done told on
(Wait up hold on) Nah, watch him flow on
So on, so on, watch me grow on
I keep growing til I start to sneeze
(What's Mark salad's G's?) Blue cheese

Blue cheese is the topic at hand
Cheesy blue (true) elements can't stand
When I elaborate on the fake calobrate
Non potent forces of a food for a rodent
(Jokes?) Nope, just comes later
The procreator, I'm the one that saved the
Year of 1991, made it obvious for the entire world to find the fun
Or better yet we (kind of clever) get
The level said ""check"" all hands on deck
For the source of my skill is all real
Fashioned to eliminate the weak who are marked with the seal
Of blue cheese

Now back to the nest at the foot of the tree
One for the hype MC, the cool in me
The Kim, the cooling, I'm a slave for no man
Stand like Lo Pan, slam like Rodan
Who can? (You can?) Damn, I'm grand dad

Torturin' up whoever gon' stand in front of the savior
Rectifying everything niggas be having caged up
Open up the door to perception in different layers
Makin' critical thinkers from children stuck in thier ways huh
Inflatin' niggas ego who shriveled up like they rais-uhns
You need your ego to walk on this earth
God equipped you with everything that you needed since given birth
You ain't got nothing inside of your makeup, that shit ain't work
In this world niggas is born with their names all on a hearse
I'm moving just like the pope
Evolve with the faster growth
They livin' like animals
But masters don't bang with those
I'm focus on packin' these shows
And building infinite capital
Instead of thinkin' about catchin' hoes I'm figurin' out ways to wrap the globe
Around my fingers. Keep the god away from all these sinners
I'm a little different niggas be wonderin' why I'm distant
'Cause the goat a finna be the one person that gon' be snitchin'
So I keep my eyes open and guard the circle of winners
 
My niggas know
Heaven inside your soul
Keep me segregated from haters we just oppose
I just oppose all the glitter and gold
Will make a nigga think that he livin' 'til he expose
My niggas know

Keep me segregated from haters we just oppose

Step up and confine walls
Shout out to Yola
Though sometimes I feel the same, right here and outdoors
Praises to the up most
Only pray, when pain is up close
That be my generation, ain't no patience, it's just gun smoke

We oxymorons because we dumb woke
Crispen up the fronto
Don't need no other drug dose, we done those
She done doe, AK can switch it up and niggas want more
Like car shows, my flow excels, propel above your Bronco
Mayatose, I'm always about my cheddar like I'm Donatello
Even better spendin' no pretenders that ain't in my blend'in
Contender heads get severed no one stoppin' my endeavors
Gotta watch the snakes they slither, summer nights get cold like winter
Get up off me nigga, it's bad enough to cross me
I'm mutant offspring and your ex-man be an offerin'
She get exhaust, still the freshest ya'll niggas Carltons
Ya'll do the wrong thing, Spike Lee, he never talkin'
To be haunting trap my body can't steal my mind
Beat the signs, know we golly how we design
Only we define our reality through our minds
I don't feed off lies, GMO's can end your life
But I'm a Gemini I come back twice
I'm just like Christ
My conscious took a one night trip
I bring you light
You wife a bitch I one night with
Your brain ain't right
Sometimes you gotta feel the pain to know what's nice, uh

The Underachievers,"Problem, problem
It's hard to understand but it's a part of life
When you lost one and fallen
Still never a reason to go
It's hard when enough is enough
And only you know enough is enough
But really what's a problem? A problem
A seven letter word that can go

The world ain't ever cuttin' no slack
I've seen the smartest lookin' fall into the grips of a trap
But I'm illusive, been a victim of depression
But killin' myself is foolish
Though I contemplate existence, a nigga never gon' do it
I was gifted to the Earth to spread love, call me lil Cupid
Mendin' broken hearts, show them the truth, and watch them use it
I was built into perfection, been learnin', embrace your flaws
When I stand in front the mirror a nigga looking at God
That's some arrogant from the pacifist
Never been a pastor, shit
But I can move the masses like a pastor's wit
Finesse it 'til my casket dig
Rebellin' like I'm Kaepernick
Conscious captain, ask the kid
Put life into your mannequin
You man of king, I'm lightsaber dancin' like I'm young Anakin
I'm Kobe buzzer beatin' for three, fade away splashin'
Disaster, attack your life you tend to panic
I done learned to dance over the water like Michael Jackson, ay
Truth is I don't know the answers to the game
I've been readin' the instructions, the shit is fuckin' insane
So I made my own rules for the shit
There's not really many laws 'cause Karma's basically it
If you could understand, puttin' out is what you gon' get
Then you could prosper, 'cause energy remains at the end
Whenever time's up, the mind grows weary
Thinkin' of thoughts of death
But there's beauty in the thought of the power that will be left

Problem, problem
It's hard to understand but it's a part of life
When you lost one and fallen
Still never a reason to go
It's hard when enough is enough
And only you know enough is enough
But really what's a problem? A problem
A seven letter word that can go

Uh, lane switchin', I came up and made a difference
Had to distance all that negative energy out my system
I done witnessed people try to condition our way of living
Never givin', not at all, while I'm present to my course
Make myself into a boss, I don't follow baby I lead
So let ease, burnin' flowers, hypnotic, I'm livin' dreams
Wasn't promised but the light gave me guidance, now I achieve
Like a hyphen, how they try to divide us but now I see
We on the same team, different players, same league
But my progress ain't your progress, we ain't on the same speed
Clean my act up like a janitor, how I obtain keys
I was in the trap too, just told to set my chains free
Find a better way, no more meddling in these streets
Quick to split your melon, once gon' you tell 'em they gotta eat
Now my soul embellished when I express it up on a beat
Countin' every blessin' when I reflect on what used to be
Young AK had a vision and he never went astray
When I got rid of all the doubts is when I seen my ghosted plane
I was in a world of pain, a crowded mind, no room for gains
Then I staggered through the rain, that's when your boy became a king
It's more than entertainment, guard your brain, they tryin' tame it
I been ridin' solo, you get set up by the ones you hang with
Livin' for tomorrow been the motto since I was in cradle
When it's time to go I hope you get my message on the table, uh

It started out like any other day
But it was anythin' but
Somethin' 'bout the way the moon was shinin'
Somethin' seems so different, no

Got in my car but didn't have no reason
Swear I was drivin' but somethin' else was leadin' me
Lost all track of time, damn
The next thing, you won't believe

At 9 o'clock, I saw her
By 10, I had her number
11's when I called her
At 12 o'clock, it happened, I gotta blame

If she found out about us, would it be a good excuse?

Still here I know I'm in trouble
But I'ma finish what I started
My heart is tellin' me to leave here
But my body's sayin' stay longer

How you gonna get yourself outta this one

The local girls are not so pretty

A Johnny 7 or a cuddly toy?
No harm them glasses fit for a boy

So the years they passed in a hazy daze

I've traveled each and every highway

I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught

Where every day I had to pay another bill?
And if I'm not mistaken, dear, I pay them still
Remember me?

Who worries till he hurries home when day is through
