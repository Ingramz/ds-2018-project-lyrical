Dave Mason,"Eve, there's a woman in your eyes
Oh Eve you made me realize
Eve give me a smile
Oh Eve you're only a child

But it's making me turn my head all the time
'Cause looking at your face is like seeing the sunshine

Eve I'll never let you down
Oh Eve I'll always be around

And it's making me turn my head all the time
'Cause looking at your face is like seeing the sunshine

Eve give me a smile
Oh Eve you're only a child",Eve,2011
Dave Mason,"How much can a man really take?
When he's pushed himself too far
He knows that his mind is on the break.
And he's trying to reach that star.
How many times have I seen him fall?
How many times? Too many to recall.
Come on home!

He left his home in search of his soul.
A many miles he did travel.
Towards the east and distant shores.
For the mystery of life to unravel.
And many wondrous sights he did see, 
while passing through those lands.
But he cast a shadow deep and long
across the moving sands.

How much can a man really take?
When he's pushed himself too far.
He knows that his mind is on the break.
And he's trying to reach that star.
How many times have I seen him fall?
How many times? Too many to recall.
Come on home!

Fate was about to deal him a card,
from the bottom of the pack.
And he met his end in fair Nepal
with a dagger in his back.
So raise up your eyes and see that angel in the sky.
And remember when you're searchin' for your soul,
you're searchin' for to die.

How much can a man really take?
When he's pushed himself too far.
He knows that his mind is on the break.
And he's trying to reach that star.
How many times have I seen him fall?
How many times? Too many to recall.
Come on home! Come on home!
Got to get on home.",How Much Can a Man Really Take?,2011
Dave Mason,"Days are passing and the time is growing near
We all trying to figure out what we're doing here
Reflections and deception are creeping in
Feel your head and your mind start to spin

How do I get to heaven
Take me back to where the road begins
How do I get to heaven
You know you've gotta let me in
You just gotta let me in

Thoughts of you keep running through my head
I'm left with photographs, things I should have said
You'll never know until it's gone
The love you had was the love you lost

How do I get to heaven
Take me back to where the road begins
How do I get to heaven
You know you've gotta let me in, yeah

The things that made us blind to what we had in mind
Who could have known?
I'll never let you go, your memory lingers so
It won't fade away

The things that made us blind to what we had in mind
Who could have known?
I'll never let you go, your memory lingers so

Crazy how you make it all alright love
You crush me with the things you do
I do for you anything too
Sitting, smoking, feeling high
In this moment it feels so right
Lovely lady
I am at your feet
God I want you so badly
I wonder this
Could tomorrow be
So wondrous as you there sleeping
Let's go drive 'til morning comes
Watch the sunrise
To fill our souls up
Drink some wine 'til we get drunk
It's crazy I'm thinking
Just knowing that the world is round
Here I'm dancing on the ground
Am I right side up or upside down
Is this real or am I dreaming
Lovely lady
Let me drink you please
I won't spill a drop, I promise you
Lying under this spell you cast on me
Each moment
The more I love you
Crush me

Adore you

When my faith I feel
And I know
How I love you
Come on
Lady
It's crazy I'm thinking
Just as long as you're around
And here I'll be dancing on the ground
Am I right side up or upside down
To each other we'll be facing
By love we'll beat back the pain
we've found
You know
I mean to tell you all the things 
I've been thinking deep inside
My friend
With each moment the more I love you

It's an ugly old, dirty old disgrace

The truth from the stuff that they say

And says would you prefer the easy way
No, well o.k. then
Don't cry

I wonder if everything I do
I do instead 
Of something I want to do more
Question fills my head
I know there's no grand plan here
This is just the way it goes
When everything else seems unclear
I guess at least I know

Darlin' dreamin in the night
Shadows on the windows
Lead oh and everyone go
Well leave me on the night
I will give you lightning
I will not relinquish light

Oh little dreamer eyes open and raving here

Wait until I come and see you little girl
When we come I'll leave with you too
When we come I'll let you come low

Hey we'll leave it all behind
Oh and then the nightmares
I'll fill them in good time
Oh they will seat your mind
When the light hits
And you maybe'll ask me

Why do you run around here
Why do you come inside of me
Why does it rip me out in dream
Why then why then watch this little fuck

Going away

Why this lonely
Why this lonely
Why this lonely love

Like a diamond in the sky
How I wonder.
Satellite strung from the moon
And the world your balloon
Peeping tom for the mother station

Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite 

Satellite, headlines read
Someone's secrets you've seen
Eyes and ears have been
Satellite dish in my yard
Tell me more, tell me more
Who's the king of your satellite castle?

Rest high above the clouds no restrictions
Television we bounce 'round the world
And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling,
I laugh about the weatherman's satellite eyes.

Dave Matthews,"So here we are tonight
You and me together
The storm outside, the fire is bright
And in your eyes I see
What's on my mind
You've got me wild
Turned around inside
And then desire, see, is creeping
Up heavy inside here
And know you feel the same way
I do now
Now let's make this an evening
Lovers for a night, lovers for tonight
Stay here with me, love, tonight
Just for an evening
When we make
Our passion pictures
You and me twist up
Secret creatures
And we'll stay here
Tomorrow go back to being friends

Go back to being friends
But tonight let's be lovers,
We kiss and sweat
We'll turn this better thing
To the best
Of all we can offer, Just a rogue kiss
Tangled tongues and lips,
See me this way
I'm turning and turning for you
Girl just tonight

Float away here with me
An evening just wait and see
But tomorrow go back to your man
I'm back to my world
And we're back to being friends
Wait and see me,
Tonight let's do this thing
All we are is wasting hours until the sun comes up it's all ours
On our way here
Tomorrow go back to being friends

Go back to being friends
Tonight let's be lovers, say you will
And hear me call, soft-spoken whispering love
A thing or two I have to say here
Tonight let's go all the way then
Love I'll see you,
Just for this evening
Let's strip down, trip out at this
One evening starts with a kiss
Run away

And tomorrow
back to being friends
Lovers, love, lovers
Just for tonight, one night, love you
And tomorrow say goodbye",Say Goodbye,1999
Dave Matthews,"He said ""Oh my love. Oh my Antonia 
You with the dark eyes and palest of skin 
Tonight I am going from Santa Maria 
Wait for me till I'm in your arms once again""

She held me, she kissed me, begged me not to leave her 
To cross on 1he mountain my fortune to win 
But a letter now tells me she died of a fever 
I'll never see her in this world again

You are my sorrow, you are my splendor 
You are my shelter through storm and through strife 
You are the one I will always remember 
All off the days of my life 

I curse the ambition that took me far from her 
For a treasure not ever so fine or so fair 
As the flash of her smile or the touch of her fingers 
The fire in her heart and the smell of her hair 

She left me a note that cried ""Do not weep for me 
Behold you are with me as sure as the stars 
That rise in the evening to shine down upon me 
Behold I am with you wherever you are"" 

I can still hear him. he calls to me only 
What once was begotten shall come to no end 
But the road is so long and the nights are so lonely 
My soul just to hold him in this world again 

You are my sorrow, you are my splendor 
You are my shelter through storm and through strife 
You are the one I will always remember
All of the days of my life

Is where you'll find me if I get tickled

In my life I've loved them all.

But of all these friends and lovers,
There is no one compares with you,
And these memories lost their meaning

For people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them,
In my life I'll love you more.

Who told me of his crazy plan
He'd been walking there for twenty days
He was going to walk on
For twenty more
Said ""How about a drink or a bite to eat?""
He said ""No, my faith is all I need""
So then, save me
Save me mister walking man
If you can

You don't need to prove a thing to me
Just give me faith, make me believe
Come on, save me
Save me Mister walking man
If you can
Come on, save me
Save me Mister stranger
If you please save me
Save me
Stranger, if you please
Or am I too far gone
I see to get back home
To get back home

How about you take a ride with me
We could kill some time, shoot the breeze
He said ""every whispering wind and second counts""
Oh, maybe if you walk, but you should drive around

Save me
Save me
Mr. walking man, if you can
Come on, save me
Save me Mr. stranger, if you please
Save me, save me
Stranger, if you please
Or am I too far gone
To get back home
To get back home
I don't need you to stall for some time, no
I don't need you to turn water into wine, no
I don't need you to, to fly
I'm just asking you to save me

My head in the clouds

I hit this corner
With my foot on the gas
I started sliding, I lose it
Everything's different just like that

Oh my God, wait and see
What will soon become of me
Frozen heart
Screaming wheels
Does that screaming come from me
So damn lucky, when went on ahead
You say, you say
I see you later
I heard what you said a few minutes later
I'm sliding
Everything's different, again

Oh my God, wait and see
What will soon become of me
This frozen heart
Screaming wheels
But does that screaming come from me
I'm dizzy from all this spinning
Now I'm thinking that you did all you could
When you said my love
Take it slowly
OK, is what I said
Oh my God, wait and see
What will soon become of me
Frozen heart
Screaming wheels
But does that screaming come from me
Take me back, just before I was spinning
Take me back, just before I got dizzy

Black, and cold like the night
I stand with arms wide open
I've run a twisted mile

For fog in my eyes
I could not feel
For the fear in my life
From across the great divide
In the distance I saw a light

My body is bent and broken
By long and dangerous sleep
I can work the fields of Abraham
And turn my head away
I'm not a stranger

Standing there
With broken dreams
I have seen the flaming swords

Imagine eating with a fork and a knife;
How ritzy we'll be for the rest of out life.

If your heart goes bumpety bump;
It's Love-Love-Love!
If your throat comes up with a lump;
It's Love-Love-Love!
If your knees go knockety knock;

If you're coo-koo like the coo-koo in the clock
It's Love-Love-Love!","Love, Love, Love",2001

Go back to being friends
But tonight let's be lovers,

We'll turn this better thing
To the best
Of all we can offer, Just a rogue kiss

See me this way
I'm turning and turning for you
Girl, just tonight

Float away here with me
An evening just wait and see

I'm back to my world

All we are is wasting hours until the sun comes up it's all ours

I am at your feet
God I want you so badly
I wonder this
Could tomorrow be
So wondrous as you there sleeping
Let's go drive 'til morning comes

Watch the sunrise
To fill our souls up
Drink some wine 'til we get drunk
It's crazy I'm thinking
Just knowing that the world is round

Here I'm dancing on the ground
Am I right side up or upside down
Is this real or am I dreaming

Lovely lady
Let me drink you please
I won't spill a drop, I promise you
Lying under this spell you cast on me

Each moment
The more I love you
Crush me
Come on

You crush me

When my faith I feel
And I know
How I love you

And here I'll be dancing on the ground

You know
I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking deep inside

It was so hot outside
You could fry an egg

Licked my fingertips

Let the hours roll by
Doing nothing for the fun
A little taste of the good life
Whether right or wrong, makes us want to stay, stay, stay, for awhile

Then the clouds rolled over our heads,
And it began to rain
Oh we were dancing mouths open
Splashing tongue taste
For a moment this good time would never end

You and me
You and me
Just wasting time
I was kissing you
You were kissing me love
From good day into a moonlight

Someone was killed beneath the townhall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me

The judge said ""son, what is your aliby?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die.""
I said not a word, though it meant my life,
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife.
Oh, she walks these hills in a long black veil.
She visits my grave when the night winds wail.
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me.

Oh, now the scaffold is high, eternity is near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
And sometimes at night when the cold winds blow
In a long black veil she cries over my bones.
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me.

Oh, she walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me.

People walking by you wondering why
No one ever stops to talk or thinks about it, if they ever did
What if God shuffled by?

One day we might see
Doing not a thing
Breathing just to breathe
We might find some reason

But rushing around seems what's wrong with the world
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They'll only be there til you're dead
Dream

Lying on the roof counting
The stars that fill the sky I wonder if
Someone in the heavens looking back down on me,
I'll never know
So much space to believe

Funny when you're small
The moon follows the car
There's no one but you see
Hey, the moon is chasing me

I worried if I looked away she'd be gone
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They'll only be there til you're dead
Dream

Walking through the wood
No cares in the world
The world has come to play
She's all mine just for a day

There's not a moment to lose in the game
Don't let the troubles in your head
Steal too much time you'll soon be dead
So play

All fall down
It won't be so long now
Out of the darkness comes light like a flash
You think you can you think you can
Sometimes that is the problem
Dream little darling dream

Spinning on the wind
The leaf fell from the limb

But everyday should be a good day to die
Oh all fall down
It won't be too long now
Every fire dies

I think I can I think I can
Then again I will falter

In the park in the middle of a hot afternoon

Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now

We live and we learn, we crash and we burn
Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
You talk about trust, I talk about lust
Its not appealin as you truly speak your feelings
I be lookin at the ceiling, so concealing
I shoulda put my heart on the table
Knowin I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
If I could have you back best believe it'd be forever
Cause each and every day you would hear those four letters

These are different times but we feel the same pains
The blood of mankind runnin through the same veins

Same crimes even though they names changed
And we like different minds workin off the same brain
Passengers on different cars steppin off the same train
In the end, makin it rights the main aim
Different parts of the picture highlight the same frame

If you ain't happy with yourself you need to work it out (work it out)

I work it out when the situations seems unworkable
Unreversible but God is most merciful

With soul search sweat it out
When they tryin to work it out

Or we ain't, I already know what some of ya think

Demolished every nerd in my path

I'm sliding
Everything's different, again

Oh my God, wait and see
What will soon become of me?
This frozen heart
Screaming wheels
But does that screaming come from me?
I'm dizzy from all this spinning
Now I'm thinking that you did all you could

When you said my love
Take it slowly
Ok, is what I said
Oh my God, wait and see
What will soon become of me?
Frozen heart
Screaming wheels

But does that screaming come from me?
Take me back, just before I was spinning
Take me back, just before I got dizzy
Take me back, amazing what a minute can do
Just like you

Amazing what a minute can do

Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Dave McLean,"Waking together, you lifted your head
How would it feel if we laid back forever?
Travel the world from the bed where we lie
Floating above like the ash from a fire
Doesn't it seem like we've been here before?
Over an ocean the heavens will open
Nothing lives up to the visions we see
Everything's clear when you step through the mirror

Carried away to the fog in the distance
Breaking through the glass
Waking up at last
Are you still there?
Face up to the facts
The gasses that we share
Hot balloons of open air

Step out of rhythm and fall into place
Try not to think of the hours I wasted
Open the shutters, now how can it be?
When did this picture become so unreal?
Moving along on an endless supply
Somehow I feel like the only survivor
Try to remember the moment we spent 
Lost in the rain as we floated together

Carried away by the dream that we're sharing
Breaking through the glass
Waking up at last
Are you still there?
Face up to the facts
The gasses that we share
Hot balloons of open air

What does it matter, the world will still spin
Another day ends, and the end will begin again
Dancing in circles, and clapping out time
Telling the truth and forgetting the lines

Waking together, you lifted your head
How would it feel if we laid back forever?
Travel the world from the bed where we lie
Floating above like the ash from a fire

Dave McLean,"Walk out and don't look back
There's no love lost
Don't take me for a fool or
I'll keep the prize that we had split
The day I'll quit weighs on my mind heavily
Deceived, run short of luck, double crossed

Shot down, follow behind 'til I find you
Running ahead of me, let down
Tables have turned, and I see you
Staring right back at me

Walk, in silence you were gone
Now all is lost, you always said that I'd be the one
To cut you from the pack, I should have known
Seeing that dust where you've flown
My love has gone, it's way too late
You sleight of hand deceived me and sealed our fate
You've taken back the cards, lost one by one
And in the game we've begun, undone
Run short of luck, double crossed

Shot down, left on the ground but I see you
Staring right back at me, let down
Tables have turned, and I hear you
Walking away from me

Shot down, follow behind 'til I find you
Running ahead of me, let down
Tables have turned, and I see you
Staring right back at me

[Originally by Bob Dylan]

Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want babe
I'm not the one you need

You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong

Someone to open each and every door...

[Chorus:]
But it ain't me babe
No, no, no
It ain't me babe
It ain't me your looking for babe

Go lightly from the last pain
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want babe
I will only let you down

You say your looking for some one
Who'll promise never to part
Some one to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart

Someone who will die for you and more...

[Chorus]

Go mount back in the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
And anyway I'm not alone

You say you're looking for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call

And love you for your life and nothing more...

It ain't me babe
No, no, no
It ain't me babe
It ain't me your looking for ...

Sleeps beneath its veil of rain
My footprints' broken trail behind
Steals the nightlights from my mind

The dark deserted streets then clear
Today has lived and died in here
So I leave the chapel gloom 
To find the shelter of my tiny room

But it's alright while the lights of the city shine so bright
It's all right till the last winding train fades from sight
Then alone in my room I must stay to lose or win
While these wild bedsitter images come back to hem me in

The panelled patterns on the door
Chase shivering shadows to the floor
Upon the pillow worn and thin
The memories of hopes begin 
The carpet with its flowers and shredding
Spires a foot before my bed
The crack that won't return again
Advancing through my broken window pane

But it's alright while the lights of the city shine so bright
It's all right till the last winding train fades from sight
Then alone in my room I must stay to lose or win
While these wild bedsitter images come back to hem me in

The friends I've left back home all write
With laughing words that warm my sight
Saying, Tell us, how's the city life
I reply and say just fine 
(Oh, you must be something)

That you were ever any other way
With your white rose face and your orphan clothes
Embroidered jeans and silver chains
You're a well known face in all the hang-out places
Where the lost souls congregate
You sit all night, but you talk too fast
I don't know what you're trying to say

Oh Carol, I think it's time for running for cover, a-ha
Believe me, you're everyone's and nobody's lover, a-ha
You've got a one-way ticket for all your yesterdays

I know your daddy said he'd talk to you
But he never really found the time
And your TV mother with her cocktail eyes
Could never really reach your mind
So you fixed your star to a passing dream
And took a cocaine holiday
Now the years flow round you in a muddy stream
And you need another place to stay.

That the game could get that rough
But the stage is set, the exit's barred
And the make-up won't come off
So you make your bow to the balcony
You light another cigarette
And the lights grow dim as the music starts

Down metal snake corridors steely grey

And I have heard the news from Spain
Now you've found someone you don't have to be tied to
And he dried your eyes, and later he lay beside you
As the simple wine
Of the flow of time
Pulled us out of rhyme
In Carvajal

Into a taxi and down to the airport
In only the clothes I was standing in
A scribbled address, a toothbrush, a passport
The money we saved in the biscuit tin
Running afraid to a strange Spanish town
Searching the sands and the shoreline...

And I have heard the news from Spain

And the sea folds like a mantle on the beaches
And the crowds have gone
And I've left my song

Dave Nachmanoff,"I can well recall the first time I ever put to sea
It was on the old 'Calcutta' in 1853
I was just a lad of fourteen years, a midshipman to be
To make my way in sailing ships of the Royal Navy

By the time that I was twenty-one I'd sailed the world around
Weathered storms in the China seas with the hatches battened down
And made my way by starlight off the coast of Newfoundland
And dined on beer and herrings while the waves blew all around

I live in retirement now
And through my window comes the sound of seagulls
And sets my mind remembering
The evening stars like memories sail far beyond the distant trees
Way out across the open seas
I hear them sing

Oh the wooden ships they turned to iron and the iron ships to steel
And shed their sails like autumn leaves with the turning of the wheel
And I was given captain's rank and soon took under me
The proudest ship that ever sailed for queen and country

Ah, the old queen she passed away with the new born century
And I received my calling up to the admiralty
The sands ran through the hourglass each day more rapidly
As we watched the growing of the fleets of high Germany

So at last the Great War blazed
I waited with the passing days
The call to arms that never came
Writing letters

I may be old now in your eyes
But all my years have made me wise
You don't see where the danger lies
Oh call me back, call me back

But the war it ran its course, they could find no use for me
And I live in the country now, grandchildren on my knee
And sometimes think in all this world the saddest thing to be
Old admirals who feel the wind, and never put to sea

Now just like you I've sailed my dreams like ships across the sea
And some of them they've come on rocks, and some faced mutiny
And when they're sunken one by one I'll join that company
Old admirals who feel the wind, and never put to sea",Old Admirals,
Dave Nachmanoff,"The wands of smoke are rising
From the walls of the Bastille
And through the streets of Paris
Runs a sense of the unreal

The Kings have all departed
There servants are nowhere
We burned out their mansions
In the name of Robespierre

And still we wait
To see the day begin
Our time is wasting in the wind
Wondering why
Wondering why, it echoes 
Through the lonely palace of Versailles

Inside the midnight councils
The lamps are burning low
On you sit and talk all through the night
But there's just no place to go

And Bonaparte is coming
With his army from the south
Marat your days are numbered
And we live hand to mouth

While we wait
To see the day begin
Our time is wasting in the wind
Wondering why
Wondering why, it echoes 
Through the lonely palace of Versailles

The ghost of revolution
Still prowls the Paris streets
Down all the restless centuries
It wonders incomplete

It speaks inside the cheap red wine
Of cafe summer nights
Its red and amber voices
Call the cars at traffic lights

Why do you wait 
To see the day begin
Your time is wasting in the wind
Wondering why
Wondering why, it echoes 
Through the lonely palace of Versailles

Dave Nachmanoff,"Before the phone hits the receiver
You're halfway to the door
The voice said 'get out while you can,
There's just 1O minutes, nothing more'

Time only for the essentials
Better gather them and run
The false name inside the passport,
The gold bars and the gun

And once again they've come out of the past
And though your mind is cool your heart is beating fast
You've been through it all before
Each time you wish a little more that you could ask

""What do you want from me?
What do you need from me?
There's no rest for the running man
Why can't you let him be?'

It's a long and twisting journey
From the sweeping northern plains
To the outcrops of the jungle
Bowed beneath the tropic rains

In the customs hall the officer
Takes you to one side
And his eyes reveal no feeling
As you hand over the bribe

And once again you've bought a little time
And once again you're fading out of sight
Still the fox is growing older
As he calls over his shoulder to the night:

""What do you want from me?
What do you need from me?
There's no rest for the running man
Why can't you let him be?""

Here, come over here
Beneath a sympathetic moon
We'll sit and talk over old times without a fear
Another beer, from the cafes of the night

The tumbling rhythms of guitars ring loud and clear
One by one they've nailed the others
But you always got away
What it is that keeps you just that step ahead

No one can say
In one last raid the agents
Of the dawn break down the door
Of a house where you were standing

Maybe just an hour before
And still the thread continues to unwind
You take the hidden roads that only you can find
And should they come upon your tracks

There's just a question hanging back you left behind

What do you need from me?
No rest for the running man

Why can't you let him be?""

You wanna be a star, here's a gimmick and a style,
To mimmick and free clothes to help design your image.
I feel like the only way I'll see fame and wealth,
Is to kill myself the same week my record hits the shelf.
All you really need is a record label budget,
Then watch the machine force feed it to the public.
Hate it or love it, watch it or unplug it.
Careers disappear quicker than next week's club hit.
You're just a puppet on a string I'm your master.
You're not cut out to sing, you might as well be an actor.
Or write a chapter how sex sells music,
Nobody likes your songs, they watch your videos muted.
Mixed and diluted, polluted trashed will crash.
This prostitute music selling songs with ass,
I gasp for breath, Dead Celeb pass the test.

Overnight stars want credit? Forget it.
Yeah, you went platinum, but who bought your record?

It's like Gods become a shark in deep water.
You swim up to the mainstream, then you bite the author.
You could be a star, too, if you're near edges.

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black

Keep the beast in my nature

Dave Pearce,"Paula came from Washington with long golden hair
Twenty eight dollars in a fake silk purse and a leather skirt to wear
Shane came from Dublin town from the old world so green
Counterfeit ticket in to JFK in the land of his dreams

Street life's the only life they take a walk in the park
Even tough they only met that day they were lovers by dark
Laid out on the morning skies he puts a ring on her hand
He said listen babe we gotta take what's ours do it or die

Quit dreaming, this is real life baby
Real life's the only life what's it all about
Quit dreaming, this is real life baby

Way out on the dock that night, the colour is red
23rd victim of a gangland war takes his last breath
Outside the sister cried, she said the whole world's so mean
Heavyweight killer in the ring, turns killing machine

Quit dreaming this is real life baby
Real life's the only life what's it all about
Quit dreaming this is real life baby

All my love, you're my all
They way you move, you're in control
The way you talk, the way you dress
Your hands, your touch, your sweet caress.
All my love, you're the best,
Every little thing that I possess,
It's all emotion when you take control,
I can feel wild horses running in my soul.
Oh my love, all I see
The stars, the sun, the energy,
If this going to kill us then let it go,
Quit dreaming this is real life baby

Up high above a desert sky where the space shuttles scream,
Sixteen men from a dying earth take their last dream.

Quit dreaming this is real life baby
Quit dreaming this is cheap life baby
Real life's the only life what's it all about
Quit dreaming this is cheap life baby
Your eyes, your lips, the shape of your mouth,
It's a sweet life baby
All my love, you're my all
The way you move, the way you go
I'm all emotion when you take control
I can feel wild horses running in my soul.
All my love, you're all I see
The stars, the sun, the energy,
The way you move, you're in control

Dave Pearce,"I think its time 
To talk to you 
I think its time 
To realise 
Where is the love 

Are we gonna 
Stay together 
Or is it time 
To say goodbye 
Where is the love 

(Chorus) 
Give me a reason 
To hold on to 
What we've got 
Must be a reason 
To hold on to 
What we've got 

Time has come 
To set 
Things right 
Is it worth 
Another fight 

Tell me the truth 
Is there 
Something on 
Your mind 
Tell me what you 
Hide inside 
Tell me the truth 

(Chorus)x2 

Are there things 
That I should 
Know, will 
You stay or 
Will you go 
Where is the love 

Tell me is there 
Hope inside 
Gotta read 
Between the 
Lines, Where is 
The love

Nothing in my purse,

How lovely it was.

Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesí
A lovely señorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesí?

Bésame tu a mí
Bésame igual que mi boca te besó
Dame el frenesí
Qui mi locura te dió
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo enseñarte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Why la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir why amar
Que es mas que amor frenesí
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazón
Dime que sabes tu sentir

Quiero que vivas solo para mí

Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti

And the kids came from miles around to get messed up on the music.
And she drove down from Boden with a carload of girlfriends,
To meet some boys and maybe eat some mushrooms
And they did and she got sick
And now she's pinned and way too shaky.
She don't wanna tell the doctor everything she's taken
The paramedics hovered over her like a somber mourning family
They gave her activating charcoal, they flooded her with saline

Her:
""I got really hot and then I came to in the chillout tent,
They gave me oranges and cigarettes.""

He was rough around the edges:
He'd been to school, but never finished,
He'd been to jail, but never prison.
It was his first day off in forever, man
The festival seemed like a pretty good plan,
Cruise some chicks and get a sun-tan.
And his friend gave him four, but said only take one,
But then he got bored and ended up taking all four.
Ah, so now my man ain't that bored anyways,
The paramedics found him: he was shaking on the side of the stage.

Him:
""Everything was spinning and I came to in the chillout tent,
They gave me oranges and cigarettes.""
Her:
""I got really hot and then I came to in the chillout tent""
Both:
""They gave us oranges and cigarettes.""

He quoted her some poetry, he's Tennyson in denim and sheepskin.
He looked a lot like Izzy Stradlin.
They started kissing when the nurses took off their IVs,
It was kinda sexy, but it was kinda creepy.
Their mouths were fizzy with the cherry cola,
They had the privacy of bedsheets
And all the other kids were mostly in comas.

And I never saw that boy again.""

Dave Pomeroy,"Claire had all but given up,
When she and Edwin fell in love.
She touched his face and shook her head,
In disbelief, she sighed and said:
""In many dreams I've held you near,
""Now, at last, you're really here.

""Where've you been?""
""I've looked for you forever and a day.""
""Where've you been?""
""I'm just not myself when you're away."" 

He asked her for her hand for life, 
And she became a salesman's wife.
He was home each night by eight,
But one stormy evening, he was late.
Her frightened tears fell to the floor,
Until his key turned in the door. 

""Where've you been? ""
""I've looked for you forever and a day.""
""Where've you been?""
""I'm just not myself when you're away."" 

They'd never spent a night apart, 
For sixty years, she heard him snore.
Now they're in a hospital,
In separate beds on different floors.

Claire soon lost her memory,
Forgot the names of family. 
She never spoke a word again,
Then one day, they wheeled him in. 
He held her hand and stroked her hair,
In a fragile voice she said:

When a terrible explosion may ring down upon our land
Leaving horrible destruction blotting out the works of man

Will you shout or will you cry when the fire rains from on high?

He will surely stand beside and you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety and eternal peace and rest

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

See that broken wall street sport, still thinks he's a millionaire. 
Still thinks he's a millionaire, pipe dreams banish every care.

You were pretty

They howled out for more

Were singing ""Galway Bay""

You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed

You cheap lousy faggot

Dave Sayre,"To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there all night long
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans

Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang, oh

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

When I think about you, I think about seventeen
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night, Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark

Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio

Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear 'Born in the USA'
You relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about seventeen
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night

Dave Schildkraut,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1988
Dave Schildkraut,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Dave Schildkraut,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2000

Said the boy with the microphone
Else, I wouldn't be standing here today
Ever since I was a young a boy
I couldn't leave well enough alone
Always trouble standing in my way

Up, down, anywhere but in the middle
Off the wagon, under the wheel again
All or nothing, never could do just a little
Never could leave it alone

Hard living be the death of me
Lead me to an early grave
To die in the saddle must be my destiny
But to ride this rocking horse I must be crazed

Good clean fun is just my imagination
Down and dirty that's the way the game is played
This hard life has caused me aggravation
Never could leave it alone

They won't help you through
Only chance you got
When you hear those war dogs bark
Is to be one up on your brother
Like a blind man in the dark

Face to face we will meet again
But never eye to eye
Meanwhile, in your mania
Your four wings touch the sky
Fly too high the wax will melt
And you'll fall down to your knees

Come let the truth be shared, no one ever dared

Is a blessing with doubt without believe

Her up bringing real gloomy

Left room shadow
When thoughts about pout
Outlays with sulk
In disgust she's filled with void

Zerotonine, I'm in line to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Rings are gold and funds are mould
The story turns all to inconsistent, so bold
Now rise and unfold
All awhile I focus in the fiftieth mid
Wrapped to a person that could
Only be my dad

Versus regret

Many partners come and go
Before she wakes up
Those who stay
Make it tempo-free
Made a wish she said
If you buy yesterday
Who's faster, faster each day
And I stay on her finest array
Then I heard her say
I heard her say
