Uh

I feel a change coming over me
Oh, you changed my life
When I let you in, baby

You gotta be right
Or leave me alone

Some people say
The way we think
We should break up, but I know
We got everything together
Oh

I feel a change of loving you, baby
I feel a change, oh
You are my shining star
I said to myself
""Darling, come on home,"" uh

I hold the key
Between right and wrong
If you want me
You gotta be right
Or leave me alone

Leave me alone
Leave me alone

I tell who I want where to go
I forget about your lies and deceit
And your attempt to be so discreet

Maybe today, yeah
I slip away

And you can keep your symbols up, (?)
I pursued my own happiness
You can keep your clock and routine
Then I can mend my own shattered dreams

Maybe today, yeah
And I slip away
Ooh, slip away

'Cause you've been down on me far too long
And far too long I just put you on
I'm tired of lying
And I'm, I'm sick of trying

Merry Christmas muthafucka! 
Merry muthafuckin' Christmas and a ho ho ho!

Mendeed,"Holocaust - In the flames of fear burns fantasy, liberty is just another masqueraded lie. 
Break the world, set it all ablaze. 
With an iron fist you lead the way, conquering the lives of those who are on their knees. 
You preach your words of wisdom; ""heartfelt"" a ""peaceful savior"", 

You've sentenced us to death beneath a burning sky. 
As you dictate, your words encroached into our minds 
A thousand virtues betrayed. 
Guilty of waiting we bond together born to suffer, 

Only those ill fated eyes [can] liberate our minds. 
Behold the sign you are killing us. 
In a world of hate with bodies soaked in blood we are a living tragedy. 
Within this madness we must unite [and] 
Sever the chains of deceit and rise against the new world's impunity",Beneath a Burning Sky,2006
Mendeed,"On winds of death, hate filled and unforgiving, 
No life is spared, in death we are all equal. 
As cities fall, monarchs and clergy with them. 
Judgment has risen, prepare for death. 
Tears still dampen scenes of forgotten yesterdays; 
Drowning Edens portray the final sin to come. 
Judgment calls like a raven's crow in the night, 
Judgment calls to reclaim the day, judgment calls like a silent executioner, 
Judgment calls for the fallen souls. 

Despite you we could be the saviours of our time, 
This our righteous crusade, healing those who suffer 
There is nothing left for you to take here. 
This is ours, the second life, we've come back to stop you.
 
How more must die for us to see 
That reason is spilling from the lips of a liar. 
No more genocide. 
Weeping for a million devastation's, 
Burning nations, annihilation's, and children lost. 

If we damn the hate we will be here forever. 
Our lives will last forever. 
Our hearts will beat forever. 
Our love will bloom forever and time will be forever.",The Black Death,2006
Mendeed,"Scarred, emotion infiltrates my soul. 
Suffer, the hierarchy takes control. 
Insane, no matter where you run you die. 
Breaking the chain. 

In your eyes I see a void. 
Pain, the depths of terror spent. 
Haste, your friend when no-one cares, 
A wraith of evanescent hope. 

In your eyes I see a void. 
Pain, the depths of terror spent. 
Take this chance to fight or die. 
I can taste your fucking lies. 
Scream, Bleed, Dream, Fail. 
Free from torture, recite the pain, did you like it? 
Are you proud? 
It wasn't what you thought it was gonna be.",Chapel Perilous,2006
Mendeed,"Foul blanket settles, brings devastation. 
Hate in our hearts, blood on our hands. 
This fractured peace, raw bones defending. 
Black hearted war is never ending. 

For blasphemy we bleed, smash the cross of greed. 
We sever Satans' claw refusing to believe. 
Shrapnel lobotomy, unholy killing spree
From blank-eyed crusaders and remorseless invaders. 
The end of innocence, this crippled legacy, 
The sin of ignorance, the beast of violence. 
This fracture peace, raw bones defending. 
Black hearted war is never ending. 

Redemption is buried beneath a blooded field of rotten corpses. 
Surrender our instinct to kill or witness existence crumble. 
Turn to ashes, burn alive in scenes of suffering, cites fall into the hole. 
Cut the throat of our humanity, starve the child of our sanctity, 
Kiss goodbye to dreams of unity, 
Embrace the oath to destroy our brothers and our sisters. 

Slaughter their beliefs if they don't share our faith, 
If they are not our race, if their skin isn't ours and they don't share our tongue. 
What have we become? 
These racist wars of hate on streets and battlefields. 
It's our time to make a stand against the rule of the skeleton crown. 
We can't just watch as others crash and burn in our world. 

We are the victims of a war we did not want to see, 
It's our blood that stains the streets and the battlefields. 
We are the victims of a war we did not want to see, 
We cannot pass these reigns onto our children. 
Against their plague of hatred unite and stand our ground, 
Our will can't be defeated if we are one race. 
We can take back what is ours.",For Blasphemy We Bleed,2006
Mendeed,"Waking in floods of sweat, vision returning, my hearts in overdrive. 
I sink so low that hell is heaven, 
The high is gone I must escape this inner loathing that is my captor. 
Without my piece I have fallen to my knees. 
Temptation to seek you out. 
Fight for what I am. 
Nowhere to hide. 

I will not accept this downfall, 
I will cure myself I'm reaching for the strength to break you, 
Reaching for the strength to beat you, 
Fall onto my sword. 

Run with the light of an angel's wing, 
I'll question unity, 
I'll suffer no more pain, 
Without you born to be a king and with the strength of warriors of old. 
And I shall accept this war within, 
Arise against temptation, 
I will rise as the morning aftermath attacks, 
I am no victim, Arise.

 No life should be controlled, 
I will not be the victim of another chemical war. 
I am the lord of my life, my fate is shaped by me. 
Your call is getting weaker, my will shall always grow. 
Erase the misery, look to the future, 
Fell no pain, sculpt my effigy, 
Control my destiny, live my own life, Free.",The Mourning Aftermath,2006
Mendeed,"Poisoned hearts without a conscience. 
Bringing down your people with the hand of greed. 
Death resonates from your smile, backing the world into silence; 
Bringing us all to our knees with the olive branch. 
I don't believe in your truth. 
Without your militant, 
Without your government all you are is a worthless bigot spreading a disease. 

Begging to be heard as others want to kill you. 
Welcome to our world, we're glad to have you back. 
Take your penance and go in peace, 
Your damnation of the nations sacrificed the living in a bath of blood. 
No more hatred, your time has past. 
Your damnation of the nations sacrificed the innocence in crimes of guilt. 
So our patience with you has run out and we will hold you for what you have done. 

In your eyes we can see that you were sent to destroy us, 
This is our time to rise, this is our time to fight now. 
We can build a new kingdom, 
We'll eliminate oppression we can be one world. 
Save our selves with every devil that falls, 
We can end the feuds they gave us. 
We'll resurrect mankind.",Poisoned Hearts,2006
Mendeed,"Prepared to fight until I die, shadowed by fear in flames I stand. 
The reaper waits for me to call to him. 
This is the only life I have and my faith commands my strength. 
Honor awaits and glory lies. 

Deep beneath the storms' eye wakes 
Another reason to fight to save my life. 

I see you walking through the night, slowly you creep looking for weakness 
I feel my heart stop beating. 

Inside the darkness I find light, I will not fall without a fight 
I'll take the pain but you can't have my soul. 

The time to take control has begun, this is my time to live again, this is all I have 
This is all that I have. 

Bringing your night to smother my light my spirits shield and now the phoenix rises 
This feud has just begun. 

Dead silence lies beneath me like a mortuary where dead dreams linger. 
I have witnessed the solution, I won't suffer without fighting. 
Time won't stop if I wait.",The Reaper Waits,2006
Mendeed,"Leeching on life's crying vein sucking out the passion and the dream. 
This is the hour of need. 
Allies and foes unite or dark princes will prevail and our world will cease to exist. 
The remains of the day will drown under our blood, 
Poisoned, damaged, blackened, we lie. 

Servants of hell dance as they wait for us. 
We won't be sacrificed by clowns who wear a crown. 
We are the kings of our day. 
Poisoned, damaged, blackened we stand. 

Servants of hell dance as they wait to take us to the other side in thorns and flames. 
I cast them back through burning gates, slaying opposers of liberty 
And defend the honor of our kind throughout time. 
Poisoned, damaged, blackened we defy, don't forget that we all belong here. We are free.",Remains of the Day,2006
Mendeed,"Another kiss goodbye, another sorrowed eye, 
Another victim of the game, do what you can to make it seem alright. 
Kiss my ass, don't look back, you are lost, you are last, you are living a lie. 
Do our eyes deceive our minds in the search for light? 
Fuck you. 

Keep your self righteous life and watch me grow. 
Within the sequence of your mind the programme stops the progress 
This is another reason to follow my heart. 

You forced me to follow generic blueprints 
But I still live inside my dreams. 
As you hold me down, this is time to fight your grip. 
Without your misdirection my life wont end in heartache
Fight for my generations birthright to be amazed. 
You've told me my passion is just a waste of time. 

(I) won't live my life by your rules. 
Gouge out my eyes (and) as the blood drips from the sockets finally it's clear
Vision comes from the mind inside, 
The soul and the heart that binds the spirit and will for life. 

Signs surface everyday, the soul and the heart will show us (that) sadness can be defied. 
Reason calling out my name, (I'm) trying to escape from it. 
Reason denies the faith in me. 
Prepare to fall my hands are cleansed your on your own, 
You've had your time you can't deny it. 

You fall from grace, if time could speak would you believe? 
Or would you still be fucking blind? 
Your doubts won't cast shadows across my memories. 
You cannot take my memories.",Resurrecting Hope,2006
Mendeed,"Take my eyes, compare your own damnation, you are the same, a fallen soul. 
Breaking the soul my words are worthless fading through time my confidence deceased. 
Through my eyes winter fog, this is why, this is I. 
Fall damned and disgraced can you see now 
I will not believe darkness has taken my soul (reside in my thoughts). 

Haunted by visions, attacked by the serpents of doom, holding onto me, 
Craving the taste of my blood (seven years as beast I have been cursed). 
Fake a smile, wear a mask, hidden truths, hidden lives, this war will last forever. 
Fallen soul trapped in hell, darkness frees, light reveals. 
Push me back into the shadows. 

As I walk through the land of fallen souls ghosts rip me, savoring my flesh. 
Take me this time silent lullaby, show me wrath, show me pain, I will show you mine. 
Back through time my heart is broken, in my past my future burns. 
A black rose withered and torn stands alone never known, always knowing.",Withered and Torn,2006
Mendeed,"Blood lust altogether fight for honor stand united
We protect our brothers memories we never hide
Side by side never back away from pain when we feel it
Side by side we would crave the blood pour into our eyes
Wounded we fought against the odds sucking our faith
But we grew strong

Yeah we stood as one
We may be wrong
We were not blind
But we still fought
We could do anything blood brothers til death
Respect was the only compassion

Orders to slay a society living beside us
Kill reap what you sow
Suffer only the innocent die by your rules

Destroyed by evil an eternal crime

Histories of pain

I don't need to drink the cup of false hope
I can rise above and return to faith - in me

Freeing me from the curse of you

Run to the end ,end of all time

Evil shall fall to the good inside

Corrías de inmediato conmigo al hospital
Tu nunca dejaste que algo me pasara
Y si algo había que hacer lo hacías por la cara
Ahora deja darte un abrazo y un beso

Menelik,"Je me souviens ce matin là, amer
Le discours que me tins la femme qui me servait de mère
Je me souviens de mes frères, de l'expression de mes frères
Je suis parti, en silence ils me regardèrent
Le soleil brille à nouveau dans ma vie j'y vois plus clair
Aveuglé par les néons, comme Icare je perds
Donne-moi la main, maintes fois par toi j'ai voulu être choyé
Je me suis dévoyé pourquoi n'as-tu jamais su m'écouter
Je me souviens des discours qui enflammaient nos liens
Tout allait si bien mais il fallait recoller au quotidien
Ne dors pas car la mort se sert du somme comme appât
Je pars, pardonne-moi pour la paix que tu ne connais pas

Je me souviens

Je me souviens de toi m'écartant de ce monde malsain
Consciente d'aider celui à qui tu donnas le sein
Je me souviens de la tristesse des larmes dont tu t'armes
Si souvent pour toucher le coeur de ton enfant qui fout le camp
Je me souviens, c'est la pire torture, le meilleur remède
Aide-moi l'abandon gagne du terrain peu à peu je cède
Vos inquiétudes de me voir manipulé par les autres
Je me souviens à présent mon amour affleure le vôtre
Je me souviens, j'aimerais tant passer le bonjour à mes frères
Compagnons de galère et par dessus tout solidaires
Je me souviens toutes les fois où tu te moquais de moi
Je me souviens hélas le souvenir ne vous remplace pas

Je me souviens

Je me souviens mais désormais c'est loin bien trop loin
Le regret s'installe, je n'ai vu ma chance que quand elle passait au loin
C'est drôle j'ai peur, tout ces souvenirs mes fragilisent
Peur de vous perdre pourtant je n'ai agi qu'à ma guise
Le vent me grise, j'imagine le gris de mise
Le rituel respecté chacun lâche une poignée de poussière grise
De plus il pleut un petit peu, le ciel s'en mêle
Je me sens léger, je n'ai jamais autant souhaité avoir des ailes
J'ai froid frère même si les gens ici corps et âme se dévouent
Dans mes pensées, je me retrouve parmi vous
Je ne dors pas car la mort se sert du somme comme appât
Je pars, pardonne-moi pour la paix que tu ne connais pas

Je me souviens, je me souviens, je me souviens dis leur Armand
Yo, Armand n'est pas mort travelling avant, pause, gros plan
Vision d'un scène se déroulant tout le temps
Une mère pleurant devant ses enfants, la raison étant simple le manque d'argent
Contre-champs sur des ennuis croissants, un père absent
Spirale du tourment pour des enfants à peine adolescents
Dans cette jungle trop d'amis nous on quitté bêtement
La crise a eu raison des bons sentiments, yeah

A me morfondre
Dans quelque pub anglais
Du cœur de Londres
Parcourant l’Amour Monstre de Pauwels
Me vint une vision
Dans l’eau de Seltz

Tandis que des médailles
D’impérator
Font briller à sa taille
Le bronze et l’or
Le platine lui grave
D’un cercle froid

Et c’est comme un calice
A sa beauté
Elle ne porte rien
D’autre qu’un peu
D’essence de Guerlain

De ses poignets
Agitant ses grelots
Elle avança
Et prononça ce mot

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1996
Menno de Jong,"Got up early, found something's missing
My only name.
No one else sees but I got stuck,
And soon forever came.
Stopped pushing on for just a second, 
Then nothing's changed.
Who am I this time, where's my name
I guess it crept away.

No one's calling for me at the door.
And unpredictable won't bother anymore.
And silently gets harder to ignore.
Look straight ahead, there's nothing left to see.
What's done is done, this life has got it's hold on me.
Just let it go, what now can never be.

I forgot that I might see,
So many beautiful things.
I forgot that I might need,
To find out what life could bring.

Take this happy ending away, it's all the same.
God won't waste this simplicity on possibility.
Get me up, wake me up, dreams are filling
This trace of blame.
Frozen still I thought I could stop,
Now who's gonna wait.

No one's calling for me at the door.
And unpredictable won't bother anymore.
And silently gets harder to ignore.
Look straight ahead, there's nothing left to see.

As time came around, she came

You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring

They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day

Starting pistols and horses
Avalanches, divorces

And watched his marriage fail

¿Que es lo que te hare a ti según mejor que yo?
Una tarjeta verde ¿???
Sigo siendo ilegal, mente de criminal
why seguiré siendo un azteca siempre original
Porque yo represento a mi cultura why mis raíces
Es mi color oscuro es el orgullo de el que dices
Cruzando líneas absurdas llegado a otros países
Personas que quedan en el intento historias tristes
Ellos lo arriesgan todo por cambiar su situación
why a veces no hay salida solo desesperación
Entre la confusión why con la emigración
Una amnistía se convierte en su única ilusión
Nunca te dejes que nadie te humille why abajo te mires
Pues todos venimos del mismo lugar
No puedes juzgar, no puedes parar
Lo que mi destino me tiene no puede cambiar
Ni puede salvar
Las vidas de aquellos que tratan cruzar desiertos
why infiernos para aquellos llegar
why así continuar, sus sueños lograr
why así comenzar con una nueva vida
Por que tu sabes que la muerte siempre se termina
Por eso vivo yo la vida, why día a día
Le pido a Dios que me proteja why que me bendiga

La sangre se derrama cuando el sueño no se alcanza
Poniéndonos barreras discriminando a la raza

Es pura depresión que nos lleva a la perdición

why esta gente no a cambiado siempre son así
La gente dice que nosotros estamos invadiendo
Este terreno es el terrero siempre a sido nuestro
Te hacen menos porque piensan que no eres nada
why para trabajo pesado son una cagada
Te discriminan nada más porque eres piel morena
El que trabajes horas extra esa es tu condena
Te ago música cabrones sigo de ilegal
why el desmadre con mi raza nunca va a parar
why una amnistía tampoco no la quieren dar
why es que no pueden con nosotros ni nos detendrán

Veo retrato de mis ancestros
Me respaldo vivo luchando
Como Hidalgo pago un pacto why me destaco
why como malandro paro why salgo
Quieres ensayo yo te atrapo
Para que veas,  para que aprendas
why no te caiga de sorpresa
Ilegales o legales representan con firmeza
La sangre es sagrada why mas la mexicana
No importa lo que hagas
La vida se te acaba
La sangre se derrama
Día con día se van las almas
La muerte no me escama
Porque amenazas no me faltan
Pase lo que pase
Yo no paro en este jale

Soy criticado por la gente
Por que escribí un diario
Hablo de sangre, porque sangre corre por mis venas
En las escenas, las docenas, la envidia te quema
Por eso fumo why quemo mota, marihuana a diario
Para matar todo el dolor que me castiga a diario
Sin mi morrita, mi niñita que es mi corazón
Eso es mi inspiración para sobrevir' en esta prisión
Con la pasión agarro un cuete se la cerrajeo
La necesidad el más cabron
Aquí todo lo que debo
Ahí que pagar las deudas caras a mis camaradas
'I'd appreciate' todos los paros que me hicieron falta
I thank my homies for the back up in this
Cus they're involved in my shit
Now if it wasn't for my 'perros'
Then I wouldn't be shit
I want to let them busters know we 'locotes' for ever
Trying to come up in this game by slang'n the sticky 'loquera'

Don't get to close I'm out to clog this shit
Just watch out for ???
I'm rappin guns, you're rappin color pens
Here to represent again
So fuck the ones who copy

Time is running out and I'm still waiting
I'm so lost without you, I could die

Meral Güneyman,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home just meant for two

Meral Güneyman,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Merauder,"Crossfire killing the innocent, another victim will fall
Who said their time has come, is it our lord, the one who we bow
Down before

Parents crying, the life of their loved ones lay in death before their eyes
Casket bears a child of our future, another victim from the realms

Of cities' crimes
Caught in the crossfire
Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war
Wrong us and face our revenge

Silence will be our tool of trade, 'til our 9 shouts out
You're the king of kings on the street, yet your demise is near

Prick us, do we not bleed
Mirror reflects all that you have to fear
Caught in the crossfire [Repeat: x2]

Another name carved in stone, as they lay to rest

You're the one who made it right

Taken day by day - taking it all away
You're the one that kept me at bay,
Won't let me stray,
Brought me back from the dead - again

Más no creas que es por falta de tinta 

Solo quiero que al verla comprendas 
Que se encuentra mi vida marchita 

Si esta carta de luto te escribo 
Porque triste y negro es mi destino 
Pero al fin lograré consolarme 
Porque Dios me mando este camino 

Al llegar esta carta a tus manos 
Solo quiero pedirte un favor 
Que te fijes muy bien lo que dice 
Para alivio de mi corazón 

Cuando escuches sonar las campanas 
Del reloj que esta frente al panteón 
Solo quiero que mires al cielo 
Y que reces por mi una oración 

Si esta carta de luto te escribo 
Porque triste y negro es mi destino 
Pero al fin lograre consolarme 
Porque Dios me mando este camino",Carta de Luto [Banda],2001
Mercedes Castro,"Cuatro espadas me apuntan al pecho 
Por confiar demasiado en mi suerte 
Yo soñé ser feliz en tus brazos 
Pero tú me sentencias la muerte 
Una espada es que ya no me quieres 
La segunda es mirarte perdida 
Las que faltan las tienen tus ojos 
Que sin verme me quitan la vida 
Si el destino me trajo hasta ti 
Tal vez fue por castigo de Dios 
Cuatro espadas que hoy me hacen sufrir 
Nos tendrán que matar a los dos 

Que te cuesta volver a quererme 
Si bien puedes seguirme adorando 
Y con una mirada curarme 
Cuatro heridas que hoy siguen sangrando 
Si no puedes volver a quererme 
Me resigno al mirarte perdida 
Yo he de ver que a tu pecho sin alma 
Cuatro espadas le quiten la vida 
Si el destino me trajo hasta ti 
Tal vez fue por castigo de Dios

Nos tendrán que matar a los dos",Cuatro Espadas [Banda],2001

Como se quiere
Al primero amor verdadero,
Hazla que vueva,

With all your little toys

And your tears are streaming
Even when you're smiling
Please never be afraid to cry 

You're a beautiful boy
With all your little ploys
Your mind has changed the world
And you're now forty years old
You got all you can carry
And still feel somehow empty
Don't ever be afraid to fly 

All you beautiful boys
Creating multiple plays
You like to fence in your world
And settle down when you're old
You can run from pole to pole
And never scratch your soul

Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Mercedes Hall,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love,2007
Mercedes Martinez,"Yeah, sitting in the staircase, holding back tears
Looking over mad years worth of photographs
Pictures of some places I ain't never going back
Some people I used to love, why I ain't show them that?
The skies was overcast, when I was sober last
My head is spinning, couldn't tell you if it's slow or fast
It's starting to get too clear, I got to go and grass
To y'all it's a shame but life is what we know it as
Waiting, navigating the plot, without plans
In the car, it's hard to read as a clock with no hands
How your man's goin' get up and stop with no yams
All it take is one break, it could pop the program
Whether sinning or not, my back bending like I'm sentenced a lot
I feel some brothers is beginning to plot
It might have been a close friend I forgot
Who started up and ain't remember to stop
I bet these niggas going remember the shop

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know

Yo, I'm like Malcolm out the window with the weapon out
Searching for somehow to find a minute or the second now
Precious time is money that I ain't got to mess about
Need it from the horse's mouth or from my eye with less account
Lessons with my back to the wall, scoping my session out
Stay a little edgy at times when I ain't stressing bout
Haters don't know shit about me, they the ones that talk shit
Those that love me send it out, so I ain't got to force quit
Cause I'm doing better now, don't mean I never lost shit
I was married to a state of mind and I divorced it, man
I'm from where brothers moving product from the porches
People locking their doors, clutching to their crosses
The block hot by the law, there ain't too many choices
So what I do is for y'all, there ain't too many voices left
I watch my back, and watch my step
And I might forgive, but I will not forget come on

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know

Yo, living in turbulent times
The blind leading the blind
Some call it evolution, some say intelligent design
You say you want a revolution, you out of your mizind
Your sons' destitute, and their pops all in the prison
My man's back in the jam, he like the back of my hand
He just attracted to scam, he right back in the can
I never sleepwalking, you dig
You get your shuteye
I'm on the first thing in, I'm leaving on the red-eye
My brother back in rehab, just had another relapse
But fin himself, it's been like he's been fighting an energy
Half telling me nobody true when they pretend to be that
So closer than friends, that's where I keep my enemy at
To many parties concerned, it's time to live it and learn
Until we're able to grow, forever bridges we burn
My thoughts free as a bird, that's just about to emerge
And every action is heard, it speaks louder than words, yo

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know",Clock with No Hands,2006

Live with it, thats how I survive with it,
Talk jive with, you take dive with it,
Connive with it, depart and arrive with it,
Harsh thrive thats why its part I with it
I did it, make rhymes in 5 minutes,
Mind of a dentist, crimes of the diminished,
Press rewind see what you find in my image,
Take you nigga's back to that line of a scrimmage,
Riq you know we pull a freak with the flow,
Talks cheap thats why we speak with the dough,
Ill techniques sure I'm sleek with the flow,
Its cold outside niggas sleep with the snow,
I tweak in the low tone,freak when the o-zone,
I can't help hiding my seat oh its so known,
I only do what got to because its possible,
And climbing over whatevers known as an obstacle.

(Black Thought)

I can't help it, maybe I'm selfish,
Maybe the way I'm running is becoming a hell freeze,
All I can see is smoke from tortoise shells that sell shit
50's I feel like I'm making a sales pitch,
My head already so heavy its making the scales tip,
I got my own pressure and got everyones elses,
I'm rehabilitating and still feeling rebellious,
Candidate of heart failure more pills than Elvis,
In a layer cake, half chocolate half velvet,
I'm listening to some howe Melvin,
I got so many options theres so many toxins yo,
Didn't really tell what we killing ourselves with,
I lit a cigarette and then held it,
I'm thinking of some rhymes more illa than a threatin' illment,
I'm on some bomb threat in the mail shit,
Because of all things I dealt with, nigga I can't help it

[Chorus]

[Porn]
I never said I'm ready to die, but I accept it,
Never said I""m ready for war, but I'm protected,
I don't even know when its coming but I expect it,
Lost thoughts innocent hopes an now I'm left with
Nervous conditions, addictions, in addition
To prisons that mixed in to the wrong crowd,
My life is on a flight that going down,
My mother had an abortion for the wrong child,
With the time I felt loved, thats gone now,
Thats replaced with purples rays some storm clouds,
Misery love Misery, so why make friends lets make enemies,
An now I got a habit thats wasn't meant for me,
Now I'm in a marriage that wasn't meant to be,
One more reason to change identity,
The cars, the crime, K's, penalties.

Con tu mirada recordando el litoral
Tu suerte quiso estar partida, mitad verdad, mitad mentira
Como esperanza de los pobres prometida

Andando solo bajo la llovizna gris
Fingiendo duro que tu vida fue de aquí
¿Porque cambiaste un mar de gente por donde gobierna la flor?
Mira que al río nunca le falto el color

Carito suelta tu pena
Se haga diamante tu lagrima entre mis cuerdas
Carito suelta tu piedra
Para volar como el zorzal en primavera

En Buenos Aires los zapatos son modernos
Pero no lucen como en la plaza de un pueblo
Deja que tu luz, chiquitita, le hable en secreto a la canción
Para que te ilumine un poco mas el sol

Cualquier semilla cuando es planta quiere ver la
Misma estrella de aquel atardecer
Que la salvo del pico agudo, refugiándola en lo oscuro
De la gaviota arrasadora de los surcos

Carito yo soy tu amigo
Me ofrezco árbol para tu nido
Carito suelta tu canto que el abanico
En mi acordeón lo esta esperando

Se van perdiendo

Porque años atrás
Tomar tú mano

Robarte un beso
Sin forzar el momento
Hacía parte de una verdad

Porque el tiempo pasa

A nada digo que no

No sé si extravió

Pero no tengo más
Que un unicornio azul

Le ruego información

Hicimos amistad
Un poco con amor
Un poco con verdad

Con su cuerno de añil
Pescaba una canción
Saberla compartir
Era su vocación

Acaso una obsesión

Yo sólo quiero aquel

Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros

Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

Canta por el que no esta
Se oye un ladrido muy lejos de aquí
Y alguien que llora por mí

Que la tierra me haga un hueco
Y me acune el dolor
Y que me llene la boca
De un canto mayor

Sin querer llore
Era yo mismo y el alba
Lo dijo después

Te amo y te ame
Nunca un secreto tan hondo
Se llega a saber

De presentar el trabuco 
Y matar a sangre fría 
A quien defensa no tiene 
Con las dos manos vacía, si

Me pide contestación 
Yo pido que se propague 
Por toda la población

A rogar por sus abuelos
Por sus padres y hermanitos

Adentro de una amapola

El alma busca su centro
En el brillo de una rosa

En su cunita de tierra
Lo arrullará una campana
Mientras la lluvia le limpia
Su carita en la mañana

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma busca su diana
En el misterio del mundo
Que le ha abierto su ventana

Las mariposas alegres
De ver el bello angelito
Alrededor de su cuna
Le caminan despacito

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma va derechito
A saludar a la luna
Y de paso al lucerito

Adónde se fué su gracia
Adónde se fué su dulzura
Por qué se cae su cuerpo
Como una fruta madura

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma busca en la altura

Cortada con tal premura
La explicación de su muerte
Prisionera en una tumba

Mikao y aji en su cuerpo 
Pellin para calentarse del frió de los inviernos

Como el musguito en la piedra, ay si, si, si 

Mi paso retrocedido, cuando el de ustedes avanza 
El arco de las alianzas ha penetrado en mi nido 
Con todo su colorido se ha paseado por mis venas 
Y hasta la dura cadena con que nos ata el destino

Y va brotando, brotando como el musguito en la piedra 
Como el mus guito en la piedra, ay si, si, si 

Lo que puede el sentimiento no lo ha podido el saber
Ni el mas claro proceder ni el mas ancho pensamiento 
Todo lo cambia el momento colmado condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente de rencores y violencias 
Solo el amor con su ciencia nos vuelve tan inocentes 

Se va enredando, enredando, como en el muro la hiedra 
Y va brotando, brotando como el mus guito en la piedra 
Como el mus guito en la piedra, ay si, si, si 

El amor es torbellino de pureza original 
Hasta el feroz animal susurra su dulce trino
Retiene a los peregrinos, libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros, al viejo lo vuelve nino 
Y al malo solo el canino lo vuelve puro y sincero 

Se va enredando, enredando, como en el muro la hiedra 
Y va brotando, brotando como el mus guito en la piedra 
Como el mus guito en la piedra, ay si, si, si 

De par en par la ventana se abrió como por encanto 
Entro el amor con su manto como una tibia mañana 
Y al son de su bella diana hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín al cielo le puso a retes 
Y mis anos en diecisiete los convirtió el querubín

Que se consume lo mejor que tenes 
Te tira atrás te pude mas y mas 
Y llega a un punto en que no querés 

Mamá la libertad siempre la llevaras 
Dentro del corazon 
Te pueden corromper, te puedes olvidar 
Pero ella siempre esta

Estarás en mi memoria

Y en el molino terminas

Calle angosta, calle angosta
Si me habrán ladrau los chocos
¿Un tun, tun quién es? Ya estaba
A dos picos la tonada
Calle angosta calle angosta
La de una vereda sola

Frente cruzando las vías
Don Calixto casi nada

Y en homenaje de criollos
Siempre lo nuestro cantaban

Mercedes Sosa,"Será porque me dueles
Será porque te quiero
Será que estoy segura que puedes
Llenarme de palomas el cielo
Sera porque quisiera que vueles
Que sigue siendo tuyo mi vuelo

Será que estas en celo
Velando la alborada
O acaso acumulando desvelos
Por dudas largamente acunadas
Tan solo se levanta del suelo
El que del todo extiende sus alas

Amada mía
Querida mía
¡Ay patria mía!
De tumbo en tumbo
Se pierde el rumbo

De la alegría
¡Vamos arriba!
Que no se diga
Que estas llorando

Que tus heridas
Mal avenidas
Se irán curando
Defiende tu derecho a la vida
Y juntas seguiremos andando

Sera que ya no quieres
Sufrir más desengaños
Que vives levantando paredes
Por miedo a que la luz te haga daño
Si ya no vienen llenas tus redes
Tampoco hay mal que dure cien años

Quizás en apariencias
Te alejas o me alejo
El caso es que sufrimos de ausencia
Con un dolor ambiguo y parejo
Amor no significa querencia
También se puede amar desde lejos

Amada mía
Querida mía
¡Ay patria mía!
De tumbo en tumbo
Se pierde el rumbo

De la alegría

Que estas llorando

Mañana no vengas a trabajar
Que el pueblo estara de fiesta
Y no habra tristezas

Señora gracias por lo que me da
Pero yo no puedo esto llevar
Porque mi vida no es de Navidad

Señora cree que mi pobreza
Llegara al final comiendo pan

Me dira que Jesus es como yo

Sus pájaros en estrellas
Pero cuando canta el pueblo
Musicaliza mis venas

Yo nunca miro a la rosa
Por su color de quimera
La miro porque ella tiene

A sangre de los que sueñan
Porque en sus gajos florecens
Las manos del que la siembra

Si el canto no se levanta
Como la hoguera del fuego
Si no libera las penas

De los que están en la tierra
De nada sirve que suene

Caminando por la tierra

Mi copla es azul y estrellas
Y una guitarra encendida
En su corazón de pueblo

La vida sufre y agita
Con el perfil de sus bombos
Las esperanzas marchitas

Po eso canto a las cosas

De sol a sol por la sangre

Ni recordar lo que amaba
Porque son como dos muertes

El olvido y la distancia
De lejos me queda cerca
Volver cantando tonadas

Una ronda de torcazas
Le hace ronda a los sauzales
Y soy niño de nuevo
Magia en la tarde, pájaro y canto

Cueca en el polvaderal
A Mendoza enamorada
Mi canto regresara

Voy de paisaje en el alba
Y me parezco al paisaje
Por fuera, el verde del clima

Por dentro, el sol de la sangre
El paisaje va conmigo
Y es un hermoso habitante

Ya no sé bien que decir
Ya no sé más que hacer

Sin poderte ver
Pero si insisto, yo sé muy bien
Te conseguiré

Cerca de la revolución

Cerca de la revolución

Yo estoy cantando esta canción
Que alguna vez fue hambre
Yo estoy cantando esta canción

Y si mañana es como ayer otra vez
Lo que fue hermoso será horrible después,
No es solo una cuestión de elecciones
No elegí este mundo pero aprendí
¿A querer?

Pero si insisto yo sé muy bien te conseguiré
Si estas palabras te pudieran dar fe
Si esta armonía te ayudara a creer

Yo sería tan feliz, tan feliz en el mundo
Que moriría, arrodillado a tus pies
Pero si insisto yo sé muy bien
Te conseguiré

A los ciegos de la esquina
Y un cachorro del señor nos alucina

Háblame solo
De nubes y sal
No quiero saber nada
Con la miseria del mundo hoy

Hoy es un buen día
Hay algo en paz
La tierra es nuestra hermana

Marte no cede
Al poder del sol
Venus nos enamora
La Luna sabe de su atracción

Mientras nosotros
Morimos aquí
Con los ojos cerrados
No vemos más que nuestra nariz

Como mata el viento norte
Cuando agosto está en el día
Y el espacio nuestros cuerpos ilumina

Señor noche, se mi cuna
Señor noche, se mi día
Mi pequeña almita baila
De alegría, de alegría

No podrán detenernos

Que tu voz la levante
Que la suelte en el viento

Es de barro y de cielo
Es semilla y espiga
Es futuro y recuerdo

Con dolor y alegría
El mismísimo sueño

Quiero dártela ahora

Con el nombre de todos

Que la suelte en el viento

Your woman cries, your baby grows up alone
Talkin through a three inch glass on a two way phone

I pledge to never fall off the ledge
and blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

God prepared the table for us, in the presence of our enemy
Now we soon to be, one in unity
One two three I'm a G

I'm not considered, the one with a sensitive heart
When I say black man you say go
Black man GO black man GO

Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby

That's why October 16th we gon be right there like yeah
The same niggaz that you want gone
Well we about a million deep on your front lawn
It's goin on from here to Abraham Lincoln's statue
And every brother here thinkin yeah we need to holla at you
About this overdue bidness
With the Black Muslim, Christian Jew and Jehovah Witness
To get this out in the open the only way
Is for us to declare a black holy day

Plus we got family, forty miles up, controllin

Generates thoughts of born-awareness of the here-and-now
Buildin a poem with many spearin out

Equality rules you to love that equality

Take the devil's head through levels and bad truth can spread to mental dead

As we struggle in the jungle of sin, my thoughts are militant
Destroyin the ignorance, buildin the innocent
Teachin infants infinite knowledge
That wasn't taught in high schools or college
My representation is with the thirty million man destination
Washington, D.C., war with the masons
The only celebration is Satan's elimination
The past education at the present is revelations
The future's our creation, elevation of the nation

Killin warrior soldiers in D.C., you face Jehovah all over

LEFT RIGHT as I command all my sons 'cause I'm grand
(Pull his head, snatch land) See if I slide through the sand
Snakin those who choose to fake moves on Zoo, ya get bruised
(Bring ya crew) Opposin the chosen son of God, you get scarred hard

La eternidad fue breve
Duele soltar promesas
Que son hojas que viento mueve

Nos derribó de golpe el dolor
Y el cielo quedó desierto
No hay más que hablar
No pidas perdón por lo que ayer fue cierto

Mi corazón da un paso en falso y vuelve a ti
Sigue latiendo contra mi
No sé como enfrentar el tiempo
Ni la noche, ni el silencio
No hay solución
Sin ti perdí inspiración
Deje mi luz en un rincón
El cielo es tan pequeño
Que no caben ya mis sueños
Hoy se vuelve nada lo que sientes
Sabes bien que las palabras mienten
Nunca digas siempre, nunca digas siempre

Cuesta perder y esta soledad
Me enseña por las malas
Como volar si la realidad
Nos congeló las alas

Mi corazón da un paso en falso y vuelve a ti
Sigue latiendo contra mi
No sé como enfrentar el tiempo
Ni la noche, ni el silencio

Un cometa que pasó
Me quedo sin ti
Muriendo en esta habitación
Y aún no te puedo decir adiós
Nunca digas siempre

Stop the clock, see I'm runnin' out of time
And as I, tell myself, I'm a changed man
Dressed in black out to jack me a game plan
Situation critical, it's called creepy physical
Hella cold, I'm a gonna be off in hell old

Plus it's hard to focus, when you crooked and hopeless
I ain't home, but my mama don't notice
Nationwide with thugs, locked out it's just us
With the Feds and the police out to bust us
The most prominent, see we stay dominate
And stay wicked, and plus we keep it explicit
Abducted by the streets see it's hard to manage
End up on my block saying we the savage

So you made a little money, oh wow

So you roll on 24's, oh wow

You act hard round here you gonna get smacked hard

With savage dreams on my mind so repetative
Let it live, let it go, player do or die
'Cause fools on my side will tell the other fool to ride
Down to do what I gotta do, to satisfy the man in me
I pull illicit things, my family ain't understandin' me
So while I have kids beatin' up on the door
I'm gonna crack up and smoke with a corona

What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you got a record deal, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you pack a few gats, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
You fell in love with your bitch, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?

Try to make a couple stacks for' the days up

Why me atraviesa cuando me habla.

Soy invisible why me da la vuelta

Es su fuego enloquecido lo que da calor
Y la bruja su vecina, tarde y noche, un remedio buscará
Porque el fuego no lo calma ni el ventilador
Podría pasar mi vida con aquel gigante
Que todo el mundo teme

Me dice que es solo un ser humano

Queen bee shields my eyes
From the force inside of my mind
And the force they may you blind

On the imaginary side
Even bored it is exciting
Being a drone is better than being alone
Bees may not be reasons to believe in love
Can't you see to me she means the whole wide world
Ain't yourself that fingers mean fun
Shake a quarter flip in the air is gone
In your silent fears it's first
A little bit of help and the tournament's over [and you try and get sober?]
See the bladder bleed from an itty bitty hole

Something to plug up this snorry mouth
Since the day ['cause today?] she said to me (she saw slee smore)
This house moves more than you (show so snow)
So I tell her I sleep (so so still snore)
To keep from thinking it through (bless me)
Now it's all I can do (___shovel snow ___)
When you pull the sheets up overhead (sometimes so you know)
And she sends me out
To shove snow drifts in my bed (she sings sun she snore)
You'll reach for the door
Arms feel weak
You'll make a mistake
And fly fly ahead
And it's all I can do
When you pull the sheets up overhead
And send me out
To shove snow drifts in my bed
Today she said to me (sneer snore seer soar)
Wanna get even with you more (sneer snore seer soar)
So I tell her she can (so show sea shore)
Even more than before (full mouth sneer roar)
You'll reach for the door
And your arms feel weak
You'll make a mistake
And fly fly ahead
And it's all I can do
When you pull the sheets up overhead
And send me out
To shove snow drifts in my bed

You thrust up and down
Arms around my head
Pressures not mine
Both in spirit and time

Something to plug up this snorry mouth
So I bet she says to me (so show sneer snore)
Need to see [to my side?] (seal the sown shear stone)
But by the time I made the bed (sneer snore sheer shore)
Till you made up your mind (so so so so)
You'll reach for the door

Strange how you can change and end up at her feet
You keep telling yourself but you know you're not to be believed

In the distance the ships in the waves cash in their load
On the hill stands Colossus and your mind can feel
Clouds from your past now at last open to reveal
You and me and Hercules in between
You and me and Hercules in between
Cross the desert sand no one knows your name
And you wish you were somewhere else with some kind of fame

Resting on our hands

It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy
That swept that afternoon
To paint that love
Upon a white balloon

And fly it from
The top-est top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain

And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard
But the Captain shook his head

And away they soared
Climbing through
The ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

Better off with the butter than the bread
Then quick, before she breathes, so gently I'm seized
My ear to her belly, whoa, nelly

Better off with the butter than the bread

There's good times ahead

Open the dawning, cars are crawling
Their rides outside are snoring, and it's pouring with rain
And in the strangest way the night behaves
In patterns and shapes that suggest that I escaped

And I believe her when she says, ""I'm glad you never left""
Better off with a lover than a friend
Than quick before she speaks
So quickly I ease my lips to her cheek and thank Jesus

No more at the moment of truth 
The dream of achievement from twilight years with the setting sun disappears 
Opportunity came and went yesterday and taken or not left a price to pay

Our moment's not so far away 
A reconstruction of body soul 
And mind in preparation for the day we leave this life behind 
How we use this life of pain determines what we have to gain 
It's strange how we talk of the things that we'll do 
But can't seem to follow through 
And all that we should have comes perfectly clear when the hour of death is near 
No time for untangling the web that's weaved no time for claiming

Mercury Rising,"Am I winning the war? 
Are you winning the fight? 
Is this winning? 
And when this is won is it the end or beginning? . 
In centuries past we've justified our fears. 
But now the decades pass like years. 
As technology and science suffocate taboos art and religion often lose

Do I think for myself? 
Are they thinking for me? 
Are you thinking? 
Am I rocking the boat or is it rocking me? 
Are we sinking? 
Are you listening to me? 
Am I hearing you right? 
Are they hearing? 

Is time going by or is it the past disappearing?
For every time we try to fightthe final war there always seems to be one more 
For every sanction the name of human rights another lost soul dies tonight 
For every cure there is a brand new disease.
Mother nature's not so easily appeased.

All the steps we make to keep ourselves alive amount to nothing 
when the hour of death arrives
Tell me the truth and I will know the truth
Lies are stained with death 
Tell me the truth and let me catch my breath

Do I get what I want? 
Do you want what you get? 
Is it taken? 
Do I know what I dream? 
If I die do I know I'll awaken? 
Do I die for the cause? 
Does the cause live through me? 
Am I dying? 
Could a cure give me life or could life be the cure? 
Are you trying? 

Racing to find the answers 
Running to beat the hands of time. 
Pushing forward fighting back
Where's the finish line? 

I need to catch my breath

Mercy,"Wake up in the morning with the sunshine in your eyes
And the smell of flowers blooming fills the air.
Your mind is filled with the thoughts of a certain someone - that you
Love;
Your life is filled with joy when she is there.

Love can make you happy if you fine someone who cares
To giiiive a life time to you and who has a love to shaaare.

If you think you've found someone you'll love fooorevermore,
Then it's worth the price you'll have to pay (pay).
To have, to hold's important when forever is the phrase
That means the love you've found is going to stay.

Love can make you happy if you find someone who cares
To giiiive a life time to you and who has a love to share.

Breaking through an open door
Bring your rage, what to gain
All you ever bought was pain

I've got family, I got time
I've got hands to make it right
And I've got love and I will survive

Well, I've got anger
And it's in my soul
Well, I've got rage
But I've got control

Well, I've got patience
But you're on my toes
You light my fire
Now see me grow

I'm an undertaker
I'm a ghost in the night
I'm a coffin shaker
This graveyard site is mine
Take a look at the sky, see that evil eye
Tonight the moon is cold as ice
Oh yeah...cold as ice...oh yeah
There's a black horse waiting
Will HE be on time?
The graveyard's shaking
Should I turn my eyes and walk away
Take a look at the sky, see that evil eye
Tonight the Headless Rider rides
Midnight...let the churchbell ring
It's midnight, All Hallows Eve
It's midnight, All Hallows Eve
I see him rising from his grave
I see him rising from his grave.......
""The Chase""
On All Hallows Eve, Never to forget
He rides the open field
In search of his head
My GOD, he's so grotesque
Should I stay?
My GOD, a scythe in his hand
NO WAY
He's coming...I'm running
He's coming...I'm running
Deep inside I know I'm the one
He's coming...I'm running

Help me, I'm falling down

I can smell that he's near
Will I ever never make it
Will I shed a tear

Now my life is fading away
In this hollow grave
I see a bony hand
Don't you ever never take it

The mind in my headless body
Seems to be chained to the inside
I cannot move towards the light...
And as he rides away

I hear his laughter in the distance
Actually it's my laughter, he stole my head
Does this mean I'll be The One next year???

The battle's over, it's done

Somewhere in ancient Spain, close to what was baecula
There lay the battleground where many an angel was slain

9 units of demons bringing unbearable sin
9 units of demons coming for the people within
The ""House Of The Dead"" will soon live up to its name
600 people running deep inside
600 people trying to hide
From the Ancient Ones

Mercyful Fate,"The son of a shepherd, Abdul Alhazred
Traveling in the mountains, the mountains to the east
One night before him, there stood that giant rock
Three symbols carved in blood
He built a fire at its root 
To protect him from the wolves
The Mad Arab
He would understand
The Mad Arab 
It was in his hands
Later that same night, awoken by wolfen's cry
The Arab cold with fear, saw the rock began to rise
Rise
The son of a shepherd, Abdul Alhazred
Shivering he saw Them coming, the mountain's evil priests
Black robes came together, around the floating rock
3 symbols in the dark 
They all started chanting ancient songs
It was prayer in unknown tongue
The Mad Arab 
He would understand
The Mad Arab 
It was in his hands

Daggers held high to the sky
The chanting had turned to screams
From the pit where the rock had been 
8 snake-like monsters came
And the priests burned in red
And the priest had turned their heads
The blood running from their chests
Had the Arab scream in horror
Giving himself away
The Mad Arab
He would understand
The Mad Arab
It was in his hands
Run down that mountain side, oh but they had seen him
The priests had caught his scent
Running faster
They're chasing him
Can't go no faster 
They're still behind

1640. the caribbean sea, the wind was just a breeze

Heading for a western shore, the barque was sailing east
Close hauled into the eye
The ""unicorn"" was riding high on the tide
And the rum went down their throats...with a twist of wine

Just...after midnight, nobody saw the antigua shore
Just...after midnight, nobody heard the thunder roar
Ohh...they were heading straight for the reefs
Just...after midnight, they were caught by the storm

I'm sitting here alone, it's autumn
I'm looking at a yellow picture
You have been gone forever

Oh it's so very hard, growing old on your own, alone
I'm trying to remember, the days, 
When we were young

Since forever, I still remember your ways

I have been reading your letter, over and over again

Your warm juices color my throat
What unheavenly joy, turning yours into mine

Gone for a bite, food on his mind

Behind a town so full of pride
A sight Anna would never see again

Weights to her legs, what a holy cross
Her bloody hands tied to her back
Her golden hair burned to black

Thumbscrews they had used
To crush each tip of her fingers to a pulp
In the torture chamber, she couldn't feel much more
Of anything, anymore

Torture in the name of Christ, confess, oh you witch
Torture in the name of Christ, you witch you, confess

They already searched her body twice today
And it was all in vain

Off the horse, strapado for a friend
Up she goes, higher and higher

Confess, before you die

How can we sing when there seems no reason to
How do we smile when there's not much to smile about
When the world is down who are we to stand and shout
They wonder why we do the things we do

Since I've seen you smile

And there you will find
What never left

The day the angels sang
Praises to the Father
Who called you by name
The moment you surrendered
The moment you were saved

And all the above rejoiced

Remember the day
When God forgot your sin
Remember the way

There will be times

When you cannot find
A reason to stand and sing
But let this remind 
You time after time
You're a child of the King

But to a God who's calling out to me

Of filthy rags made clean
And if I glory let me glory

MercyMe,"The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell
It goes beyond the highest star
And reaches to the lowest hell
The guilty pair, bowed down with care
God gave His Son to win
His erring child He reconciled
And pardoned from his sin

Could we with ink the ocean fill
And were the skies of parchment made
Were every stalk on earth a quill
And every man a scribe by trade

To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry 
Nor could the scroll contain the whole
Though stretched from sky to sky

And happiness and cheer
Fun for all, the children call
Their favorite time of year

Snowflakes in the air
And carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share

Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
And Christmas time is here

Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

Christmas time is here
And we'll be drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year

Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray

O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father a blessed angel came

I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on Earth, good will to men

And thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on Earth, good will to men
I can hear them
I can hear them
I can hear them

And in despair I bowed my head
“There is no peace on Earth” I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on Earth, good will to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor does He sleep
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on Earth, good will to men

So You can sleep tonight?

Go to sleep my Son
Go and chase Your dreams
This world can wait for one more moment
Go and sleep in peace

I believe the glory of Heaven
Is lying in my arms tonight
But Lord, I ask that He for just this moment
Simply be my child

People asking me how I
Can praise You with all that I've gone through
The question just amazes me
Can circumstances possibly
Change who I forever am in You
Maybe since my life was changed
Long before these rainy days
It's never really ever crossed my mind
To turn my back on you, oh Lord
My only shelter from the storm
But instead I draw closer through these times
So I pray

Bring me joy, bring me peace
Bring the chance to be free
Bring me anything that brings You glory
And I know there'll be days
When this life brings me pain
But if that's what it takes to praise You
Jesus, bring the rain

I am Yours regardless of
The dark clouds that may loom above
Because You are much greater than my pain
You who made a way for me
By suffering Your destiny
So tell me what's a little rain

Its not what you give to me

Nothing can come between your heart and mine

A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man 
I was slap in the right place at the perfect time
Filled a gap--I was lucky 
But one thing I'll say for me 
No-one else can fill it like I can","High Flying, Adored",1995

I'd rather show you signs of peace

Meredith Brooks,"Prick of a pin, no blood on me
I've been tested, total wasted, in too deep
To the zone, I retreat
What doesn't kill ya makes you strong eventually
Blade to my skin, blurring the edge
Seven doves are waiting for me up ahead
I just breathe in, I just breathe out
I've taken every hairpin curve by now
I may crack but I'll never shatter
I may crack but it doesn't matter
I may crack but I'll never shatter
I may crack

Promised the world, dropped in a pool
Was it fun, did you enjoy acting so cool
Well, here's the thing, still have my head
I stumble hard but I'm not sleepin' in your bed
Saved by the sun, no shame on me
We come out screaming it's the only time we're free
I just breathe out, I just breathe in
I ride the wave until I come again

I may crack but I'll never shatter
I may crack but it doesn't matter
I may crack but I'll never shatter
I may crack but I'll never shatter
Cuz I still have a secret
In the dark I keep it close
I still have a secret no one knows

I may crack but I'll never shatter
Tested, wasted, over and over
I may crack but it doesn't matter
In the darkness I am the shatter
Shake down, twisted and tied
It's amusing that I'm doing fine
I just breathe in, I just breathe out
I may crack, but I'll never shatter

In the dark I keep it close

You're on a roll you can't explain
And then it all goes down the drain
Your cat's hit by a car
The ATM eats your card
You're wondering what changed from yesterday
Save me from, from going mental
Save me from just spinning out

Some days are better than lovers
Some days you just can't figure out
Some days you can't explain

My best friend and me one night
Were drinkin' at Pete's on Crescent Height
Just like that we end up in a fight
Like a yo-yo up and down
You're headin' north, you end up south

Save me from, from going mental
Save me from just spinning out

Out the door, you got no time for coffee
And I'm standing here rememberin'
When my kisses made you late
Only take a minute for my morning meditation
But I'm on the phone, call waiting, click
And I'm under an invasion
And I feel like I'm a spinning ball in a lottery cage

If we ain't making love, how can we be lovers
Gonna post a vacancy sign under the covers
Before it gets too late, I'm gonna say

Ooh, stop what you're doin' and love me now
Ooh, I'm makin' my move, come on and love me now

I come home so tired, wanna put my feet up
You watch Letterman and eat something old I heat up
And we both fall asleep before the rooster starts to crow

No time to fight, we pretend love is so sweet
When all we're missin' is what's between the sheets
We used to find an hour between the stop and go

Whatever happened to staying up all night
When the bed became an island, it was just you and I
Our troubles would slip away, when you'd say

Ooh, stop what you're doin' and love me now
Ooh, I'm makin' my move, come on and love me now

Time, time
Time, time, time

I'm done dyin' for the past

Say all's forgiven now
Let's call it even, shall we
Can't you judge me for my love and not mistakes I've made
I swear by who I am and not by yesterday

I'm done dying for the past

Meredith Brooks,"You were my wild companion
We were forever high, high, high
We burned the night around us
Sleeping could wait until we died
You wear the scars of passion
And since the crashing came
You've broken every promise
I walked away

I watched you fall
I was blind to ya
Was lying to ya
Like everybody else who watched you fall
Say they love you but they're laughing
When you crawl

It's such a weary feeling
When you've been stealing from yourself
Wishing the world away
Blaming someone else

No one can do this for you
Straighten your head, fix your faith
Take all the pain inside you
Wash it away

Stripped my senses
On the spot
I've never been defenseless
I can't even make sense of this
You speak and I don't hear a word

What would happen if we kissed
Would your tongue slip past my lips
Would you run away, would you stay
Or would I melt into you
Mouth to mouth, lust to lust
Spontaneously combust

The room is spinning out of control
Act like you didn't notice
Brushed my hand

Forbidden fruit
Ring on my finger
You're such a moral, moral man
You throw it away, no question
Will I pretend I'm innocent

Would your tongue slip past my lips
Would you run away, would you stay
Or would I melt into you

Can't wait until tomorrow

I just start being angry
Working day and night
What's he tryin' to hand me?

She walks in and the fighting begins

If you go with her tonight

You could be the lucky one
Fate turns on a dime

The only thing that will change
Are the lights when they get brighter
They replace the sun

Out the door you get burned
And there is no way back in
You got nothing snake eyes
The house always wins

A drowning man does not die silently
You can feel the final warning
And the black money follows
Through the veins of the shallow
Change the name to protect the guilty
You'll never leave Sin City
Where you are the King

In this room of shame
You could sink this town
And breathe another day

Where a kiss of hope can last",Sin City,1998

And recognized her pain

She may be much, too much

Spring in Manhattan
Never stays long
Still if you fall in love
She'll bless you with a song

And if you'll listen to every word
The song she'll sing will bring
Spring in Manhattan
To stay all winter long

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

But confess when your tire,
Is the candle worth the flame?

Change your ways and repent,

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain

Soothing and slow

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so

When lights are low

Why shouldn't we surrender

Like the ocean beats upon the sand

Meredith d'Ambrosio,"You give me your lips and your lips are so heavenly,
Stars in the sky are all free and they shine for me,
So does the moon in the blue,
All this is mine and heaven too.

You give me your arms and your arms are like angel wings,
Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,
All this is mine and heaven too.

I own each summer day, each mountain capped with snow,
The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

Deep in my heart I will carry this song with me,
You bring a love so divine, all this is mine

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

A moment of bliss we spent

And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

Waving a briefcase a hollerin'
There's mailman stumbling to his truck
With a dog on his leg that sure could use a collar and

Wish you had my point of view

I can see two skin-kneed boys down at the creek
Smoking daddy's cigarette butts
Down there's a man cussing me
'cause he got his car all washed and waxed up

But I ain't done nothing wrong
I'm just a bird singing my song

Looking down on the world below
Here they come and there they go
I'm a people watcher it's been a hobby of mine
For quite some time

And I might go out on a limb
Just to get a better look at them
Oh no, I'm a little too close
Better fly away

There's a See Rock City birdhouse
Where I like to hang out with but Johnny Shoots BBs
And Mrs. Cole's got a cement bowl
Where I'd like to take a bath but the cat might eat me

So I'll just stay up here
At least until the coast is clear

Lookin' down at the world below
Here they come and there they go
I'm a people watcher it's been a hobby of mine

And I might go out on a limb
Just to get a better look at them

There's a millions stories that I could tell
Some of them I keep to myself
Just remember no matter what you do
Somebody's looking over you, yeah

If all my worse fears came true
If I lost every dream I ever knew

You, you would be the faith that carries me
You would show me the grace to make me see
The truth, whatever storm I fly into
All I really need to get me through
Is you

So I can take my chances
I can swing from the trapeze
I'm not afriad of falling
I know that you'll catch me
And when my sky is running out of blue
When I just don't know what to do

You, you would be the faith that carries me
You would show me the grace to make me see
The truth, whatever storm I fly into
All I really need to get me through
Is you

When I don't believe anything
When I'm spinning in a hurricane
When the world is full of strangers
I've got you

Oh you, you will be the fate that carries me
You would show me the grace to make me see
The truth, whatever storm I fly into
All I really need to get me through
Is you

Whenever I'm lost
Whenever I'm down
Whenever all my dreams come crashing to the ground
All I need is
All I need is you, you",You,2001
Meredith Edwards,"I am as guarded as Alcatraz when I want to be
Never been disarmed by boyish charm
So darlin' you tell me
Why do I throw down my weapons
When you smile so harmlessly

I stay as calm as Mona Lisa
Keep my cool, come what may
The perfect picture of composure
So it bothers me to say
That I go wild as a Picasso
When you look at me that way

[Chorus]
I'm helpless
I'm breathless
I can't guess
Why you get to me
I'm fallin'
So hopelessly
You get-you get to me

I am as valiant as Galahad
In the face of fear
Never one to run from danger
So to me it isn't clear
Why I tremble like a coward
When you whisper in my ear

[Chorus]

I stand solid as Gilbraltar
Against life's rain and wind
A will of granite that nobody yet
Has made a blemish in
But I liquefy like quicksand
When your fingers touch my skin

[Chorus]

Your sweetness
My weakness
Can't fight this
You get to me
You thrill me
You kill me
I will be
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin',
I'm helpless
I'm breathless
I can't guess why

Meredith Patterson,"Sisters, sisters
There were never such devoted sisters,
Never had to have a chaperone, no sir,
I'm there to keep my eye on her
Caring, sharing
Every little thing that we are wearing
When a certain gentleman arrived from Rome
She wore the dress, and I stayed home
All kinds of weather, we stick together
The same in the rain and sun
Two different faces, but in tight places
We think and we act as one
Those who've seen us
Know that not a thing could come between us
Many men have tried to split us up, but no one can
Lord help the mister who comes between me and my sister
And lord help the sister, who comes between me and my man",Sisters,2006

Meredith Willson Orchestra,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

There's a little devil in your eyes.

No matter what I do I can't forget you 
Sometimes I wish that I'd never met you 
And yet if I should lose you

Those arms with me

Up on my knees to her I'm creeping

And while his hoof beats fall like rain

Merkury Burn,"Joey, baby - don't get crazy
Detours, fences...I get defensive

I know you've heard it all before
So I don't say it anymore
I just stand by and let you
Fight your secret war
And though I used to wonder why
I used to cry till I was dry
Still sometimes I get a strange pain inside
Oh, Joey, if you're hurting so am I

Joey, honey - I got some money
All is forgiven.  Listen, listen

But if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you
And when you said I scared you
Well I guess you scared me too
But we got lucky once before
And I don't want to close the door
And if you're somewhere out there
Passed out on the floor
Oh Joey, I'm not angry anymore

And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you
And when you said I scared you
Well I guess you scared me too
But if it's love you're looking for
Then I can give a little more
And if you're somewhere drunk and
Passed out on the floor
Oh Joey, I'm not angry anymore
Angry anymore, angry anymore",Joey,2000
Merl Saunders,"Well they tell me of a pie up in the sky 
Waiting for me when I die 
But between the day you're born and when you die 
They never seem to hear even your cry 

[Chorus]
So as sure as the sun will shine 
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine 
And then the harder they come 
The harder they'll fall, one and all 
Ooh the harder they come 
The harder they'll fall, one and all 

Well the oppressors are trying to keep me down 
Trying to drive me underground 
And they think that they have got the battle won 
I say forgive them Lord
They know not what they've done 

[Chorus]

Ooh yeah oh yeah woah yeah ooooh 

And I keep on fighting for the things I want 
Though I know that when you're dead you can't 
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave 
Than living as a puppet or a slave

Yeah, the harder they come,
The harder they'll fall one and all",The Harder They Come,1973

Merl Saunders,"You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

You got a lotta nerve
To say you gotta helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that's winning

You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt
Why then don't you show it

You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You're in with

Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, ""How are you?"" ""Good luck""
But you don't mean it

When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once
And scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I'd rob them

And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is
To see you",Positively 4th Street,1973
Merl Saunders,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,1987
Merl Saunders,"How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs and there you were

I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
And wonder what would I be without you in my life

All the things I did seems I'd done'em before
But you brighten up for me all of my days

Merl Saunders,"Maybe you'll wanna give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat.
And maybe you'll go away and never call,
And a taste of honey is worse that none at all.
Oh little girl!

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion.
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion.

Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around.
Or maybe you'll think that love will make us fools,
And so it makes you wise to break the rules.
Oh little girl!

In that case I don't want nobody

Merl Saunders,"You know, the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I looked through the window, I peeked through the blind,
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind.
He said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

I was cleaned and skinned and so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I love the best
I finally reached my baby 'bout a half past three
She said, ""I'd like to know what you want with me.""
I said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

She screamed and said, ""What's wrong with you?
From this day on, our romance is through.""
I said, ""Tell me, baby, face to face
A-how could another man take my place?""
She said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

Well, I learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the wind may blow
Women may come, and the women may go,
But before I say I love 'em so,
I want-- money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.
(If you want to get along) Well, make some money

Above us only sky

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

And the world will be as one",Imagine,1992
