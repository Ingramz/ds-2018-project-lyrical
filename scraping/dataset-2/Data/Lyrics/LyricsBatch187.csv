Ed Eastridge,"Sad is to live in solitude
Far from your tranquil altitude
Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream
That never can be, will never be
Dreamer awake, wake up and see.

Your beauty is an aeroplane
So high my heart can't bear the strain
A heart that stops when you pass by
Only to cause me pain
Sad is to live in solitude",Triste,2005
Ed Eastridge,"So close your eyes
For that's a lovely way to be
Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream
Together

You can't deny don't try to fight the rising sea
Don't fight the moon, the stars above and don't fight me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream
Together

When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity

By now we know the wave is on it's way to be
Just catch that wave don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream
Together

When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity

By now we know the wave is on it's way to be
Just catch that wave don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream
Together",Wave,2005
Ed Garland,"Hey now, heh!

What's the reason for this celebration?
Man, ya look at all those people there
Hanging round this station
Say, what's the big event?

An essential train is coming
On track number one

Well, it's got to be the Pittzburg Pirates
No, it's more important, son
Is it the President?
No no no no
Brigitte Bardot?
No no no no
Then tell me who's about to arrive?
Ee-hee!
There he is now, Satch-a-mo and The Dixieland Five

Oh, look at them shuffling, shuffling down
A-rambling, scrambling over the town
Hustling, bustling, buzzing around
Never saw a bigger celebration

Oh, look at the train, a number seven-o-nine
Just a hugging and a-puffing 
And arriving on time
Changing the town from dead to alive
Satchmo and His Five

We're gonna play that Muskrat Ramble tune
And Mr Bing, the moment that it's played
You lead us on the big parade
Altogether now, one and two
Join the happy throng
Everyone start mushing, swinging the Muskrat song
We'll be singing along

Oh, Mr Bing, when you sing, that's the thing we do enjoy

Well, Mr A, when you play, Gabriel say, Who that for?

Everybody's walking, talking 
That Muskrat song
While we amble that Muskrat Ramble
While we amble along

Oh, that's the best parade I ever been on, Satch!

Natch! You are in New Orleans!

While we amble along",Muskrat Ramble,1996
Ed Gein,"You're supposed to serve a higher power, but instead you serve the will of your tiny dick. a pervert of the cloth, taking cover behind the church. praying on your brothel (of alter boys). I'd love to kick the holy shit out of you ""father."" and the pope is no better; saying you'll be punished in heaven. imaginary justice in an imaginary afterlife. but until then, the church of molestation is in session. ""suck my dick for a free ride to heaven!""",Amen,2005
Ed Gein,"I hope a cancer claims you that stem cells could have cured. 
And as you're puking out your guts from chemo, and dying in your bed, 
I hope your god still comforts you, because due to your ban of federal funding, 
Science can not save you. and you did it to yourself. 

And you'll be taking thousands more down with you, 
All because you equate a ball of cells in a petri dish with a conscious human being. 
If I ever met you without your secret service I would spit in your face.",Bastard,2005
Ed Greene,"Like a candle 
Burning bright 
Love is glowing in your eyes 
A flame to light our way 
That burns brighter everyday 
But now I have you 
Nobody loves me like you do 

Like a leaf 
Upon the wind 
I could find no place to land 
I dream the hours away 
And wonder everyday 
Do dreams come true?
Nobody loves me like you do 

What if I never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow 
Ooh, you touched my heart in places 
That I never even knew 
'Cause nobody loves me like you do 

I was words without a tune 
I was a song still unsung 
A poem with no rhyme 
A dancer out of time 
But now there's you 
Nobody loves me like you do 

What if I never met you?
Where would I be right now? 
Funny how life just falls in place somehow 
Ooh, you touched my heart in places 
That I never even knew

Ed Greene,"I'm here alone on a Friday night
Waiting here beside the phone
The TV, radio and me
Really ain't been getting along

I wish that I could fly away
And party 'til the break of day
And there I'll be sure to meet
The guy that would be special to me

Then mama comes and asks me
Why am I dreaming sitting alone?
Why not go out and have some fun
It's the only way I'll ever find
Someone for me
While I am young and seventeen

Someone for me
Someone for me
I've got to go find someone, someone
Someone for me
I've got to find someone, yeah

Now there's a party down at Angie's house
With people packed against the wall
I'm sitting in the corner here
Trying to make some sense of it all

And when I least expect it
Meeting the guy I see in my dreams
Here he is walking up to me and asking
If I'd like to come and dance with him
I think I've found someone for me

Someone for me
Someone for me
I've got to go find someone, someone
Someone for me
I've got to find someone

I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me
Someone

And so I'm finding out that dreams you believe in
Can come to be
And now I'm looking up to find the joy and happiness
Can come to you and me
At last I've found someone for me

Someone for me
Someone for me
I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me

Ed Greene,"Time can pass so slowly when you feel so all alone
Love can strike like lightning when you find your heart a home
I've see it in the movies, read about it in a book
I never thought I'd feel it but your touch was all it took

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

Come and make your magic 'til you have me hypnotized
If we get any closer I'll be drowning in your eyes
You're the one I needed most when my love was on that line
I'm so glad you gave me yours when I gave you mine

So take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good
I've waited for your love forever

I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good (oh it keeps me feelin' so)

You're the one to take good care of my heart

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of me

Ed Greer,"If some of ya'll never been down south too much
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this 
So that you'll understand what I'm talkin' about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods
And in the fields looks somethin' like a turnip green
And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there 
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause thats about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A mean vicious woman)

Everyday ?for supper time, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman
Lord have Mercy, pick a mess of it)

Her daddy was lazy and no count, claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for was stealin' watermelons 
Out of my truck patch
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(Sock a little polk salad to me, you know I need me a mess of it)",Polk Salad Annie,2001
Ed Greer,"Well, I'm a steamroller, baby
I'm bound to roll all over you
Yes, I'm a steamroller now, baby
I'm bound to roll all over you
I'm gonna inject your soul with some sweet rock 'n roll
And shoot you full of rhythm and blues

Well, I'm a cement mixer
A churning urn of burning funk
Yes, I'm a cement mixer for you, baby
A churning urn of burning funk
Well, I'm a demolition derby (yeah)
A hefty hunk of steaming junk, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Now, I'm a napalm bomb, baby
Just guaranteed to blow your mind
Yeah, I'm a napalm bomb for you, baby
Oh, guaranteed, just oh guaranteed to blow your mind, yeah

Never were as blue as his eyes

Ed Hamilton,"Lift me, won't you lift me above the old routine;
Make it nice, play it clean jazzman.

When the jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.

It's a gospel kind of feelin', a touch of Georgia slide,
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.

Jazzman take my blues away;
Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Jazzman, oh jazzman.

When the jazzman's signifyin', and the band is windin' low.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.

He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
He can cry like a fallen angel when risin' time is near.

Jazzman take my blues away;
Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Oh lift me, won't you lift me with ev'ry turn around;
Play it sweetly, take me down, oh jazzman.",Jazzman,1999

You walk around the house

For us to have a break 

We'll climb the corporate buildings 
Spray-paint the outside walls 
You bet that they'll be yielding 
When the castle falls 

We'll swim beneath the ocean 
Near the coral reef 
I have a certain notion 
That it will not be brief 

We're going to Shanghai
To watch the red sky 
We're moving to Shanghai 
Goodbye, goodbye

So I´ll put it across in a simple song

From bodies laid out on the ground

When you were just knee high

Something to remind you

Burnt to black 
There's a face you don't recognise
Just a doll with hollow eyes
And a feeling you can't describe
In factories
Toys are made by the companies
Who create our killing machines
So the planet can rest at ease

There's a story you had to hear
When you couldn't sleep at all
Now the pages are burning in some 
Sad unholy war

Something to remind you
Something to remind you
The ones you left behind you

Leaving no part unscathed 
Too young to be as jaded as I am 
But old enough to feel the strain 
I hope that I can hold on to 
The beauty that I'll never match 
The never-ending open wound 
That started from a simple scratch 

I want to save us from being saved 
Before we get too old and waste away 
Like some lovers destined to die young 

And so through all the loss we've seen 
Of friends who sit and think too much 
Too fragile for the cold outside 
Too proud to say what's on their minds 
This is for the broken fools 
Whose flames are gone before their time 
And if you see me trip and fall 
Save me from my swift decline

Out in the fields where the grass snakes hide
Six years old, tall as a chair
Found the trapdoor hidden from sight

Fell into the blackness, seemed like hours
I hit the ground on a sea of skulls
There was no treasure, just stolen souls
Taken years ago down this endless hole

Man must kill to live or quench his thirst
Let's go back to the source where it first came from

Looked death in the eyes, falling stalactites
Then burnt by a light as angels flew by
Who pulled me back up to the moonlit sky
Covered in dust, it was hard not to cry

Man must kill to live or quench his thirst
Let's go back to the source where it first came from

Falling through trapdoors wherever I go

Sayin', ""Maybe, maybe I'll be back someday.""

You walked in, I didn't know just what I should do,

Ed McCurdy,"Jesse James was a lad that killed many a man
He robbed the Danville train
He stole from the rich and he gave to the poor
He'd a hand, a heart, and a brain

Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor
He couldn't see a brother suffer pain
And with his brother Frank he robbed the Springfield bank
And he stopped the Glendale train

Poor Jesse had a wife, a lady all her life
And three children, they were so brave
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid ol' Jesse James in his grave

It was Robert Ford, the dirty little coward
And I wonder how he feels
For he slept in Jesse's bed and he ate o' Jesse's bread
But he laid Jesse James in his grave  

It was with his brother Frank that he robbed the Gallatin Bank
An' carried the money from the town
It was at that very place that they had a little chase
For they shot ol' Captain Sheets to the ground

Poor Jesse had a wife to morn for his life
And three children, they were so brave
But that dirty lettle coward that shot Mr. Joward
Has laid ol' Jesse James in his grave  

They went to a crossing, not very far from there
And there they did the same 
For the agent on his knees delivered up the keys
To the outlaws, Frank an' Jesse James  

It was on a Wednesday night, not a star was in sight
When they robbed the Glendale train
Those people, they did say for many miles away
It was robbed by Frank an' Jesse James 

Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life
And three children, they were so brave
But that dirty lettle coward that shot Mr. Joward
Has laid ol' Jesse James in his grave 

Then on a Saturday night, Jesse was at home
Just talking with his family brave
When Robert Ford came along like a thief in the night
And laid poor Jesse in his grave

Now, the people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death
They wondered how he came to die
It was one of his own gang called little Robert Ford
An' he shot Jesse James on the sly

Poor Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life
And three children, they were so brave
But that dirty lettle coward that shot Mr. Joward
Has laid ol' Jesse James in his grave

Jesse went to his rest with his hand upon his breast
And there are many who never saw his face
He was born one day in the County of Clay
And he came from a solitary race

This song was made by Billy Gashade
As soon as the news did arrive
He said there's no one man with the law in his hand
Could ever take ol' Jesse James alive  

Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn his life
An' his children too, they were brave
But that dirty little coward shot Mr. Howard
An' laid Jesse James in his grave

Oh, they laid poor Jesse in his grave, yes, Lord
They laid Jesse James in his grave
Oh, he took from the rich and he gave to the poor
But, they laid Jesse James in his grave",Jesse James,1989
Ed McCurdy,"In Scarlet town where I was born
There was a fair maid dwelling
And every youth cried well away
For her name was Barbara Allen

'Twas in the merry month of May
The green buds were a swelling
Sweet William on his deathbed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen

He sent a servant unto her
To the place she was dwelling
Saying you must come to his deathbed now
If your name be Barbara Allen

Slowly, slowly she got up
Slowly, slowly she came nigh him
And the only words to him she said
Young man I think you're dying

As she was walking o'er the fields
She heard the death bell knelling
And every stroke it seemed to say
Hardhearted Barbara Allen

Oh, mother mother make my bed
Make it long and make it narrow
Sweet William died for me today
I'll die for him tomorrow

They buried her in the old churchyard
They buried him in the choir
And from his grave grew a red red rose
From her grave a green briar

They grew and grew to the steeple top
'Till they could grow no higher
And there they twined in a true love's knot
Red rose around green briar

There was a fair maid dwelling
And every youth cried well away

Luas vão vazar
Sobre as marés
Seus pés

dormem...

At rainbow's end?
Only love would know,

Ed O.G,"But when it comes to
Protecting the lives of twenty-two million Afro-Americans
Then all of a sudden, Uncle Sam becomes very conscious, of legality

Here's the reason that, I've been upset for a while
'Cause if you're black you get life, but if you're white you're on trial
Ain't nothing to it, just like that chump Charles Stewart
They're always claiming, that the devil made me do it
For insurance, he killed his wife and his child
And blamed it on a brother, and racists got buck wild
He had the media, believing the, aesop fable
And all the whites were like, ""I can't wait 'til
They catch the bastard - I hope they fry him""
They were sure that he did it, there was no need to try him
And Willy Bennett, who was in it to win it
Got bassed and harassed cause they was sure that he did it
And the thing that really pissed me off and truly offended me
Is the suckers wanted to reinstate the death penalty
For a brother man, but not the other man
And when they found out, he killer her himself, hmm on the other hand
Now it's inhumane, bring it back they wouldn't dare
But his brother confessed he was with it, so give HIM the chair
But that won't happen with that punk Dukakis
Flynn and Mickey Roach, you better just watch for us
I don't want to hear that you're sorry to me
After you tore up, and started a war up in the black community
It's out of the news, but it's still in my head
Charles Stewart still lives even though the sucker's dead
I'ma speak upon it

He is trying to wipe, you, out
Trying to eliminate your total existence
With falsehood and lies
And he's succeeding in doing it!

Now here's a verse about a relative, that coulda lived
But killed by a cop that thought negative
Shot in the back like a victim of Jesse James
Tell them his motherf***ing name!
Phillip Pernell, murdered by a devil
That never saw a cell, so I'm here to raise hell and tell
About a child that was left to decay
And the next couple of days the pig was suspended with pay
Receiving support from cops and superior courts
And all we receive is a bullet inside a corpse
Now tell me, what type of justice has been done
What woulda happened if I shot his son?
I woulda been killed, taken to a chamber and filled up with gas
But yet nothing has happened to ?
So I had to take two extra steps
And put it on wax, cause I couldn't let it rest (why?)
'Cause I can't stand to see Satan smile
And get away with taking the life of a child
You meant to do it, so now your motto is (tell 'em)
The more bullets, the less blacks live (you better)
Watch your back you murderer because you're wanted
But for now, yo, I guess I gotta speak upon it

We've got to come together
Pool our efforts, our strength, our finance
And build our own nation
The Chinese did it, it's called Chinatown!

Let me speak upon this with a radical take as I take
Time to talk about the systematical break-down
And deliberate destruction through mis-education
Of the Nubian Nation
Starting in kindergarten, continuing through college
They continue to kick you trick knowledge
And call it education but I call it training
Washing your brain into gaining and maintaining
The American dream, but to me it's a nightmare
Because they keeps ya right where
They want you to be, mentally, physically, and monetarily
As you go merrily merrily merrily
Down the stream but it's more like up s***'s creek
Without a paddle and the boat's got a leak
We start drowning in all that s***, getting deeper
Mind's in a choke hold or should I say a sleeper
But I ain't going out like Rip Van Winkle
So you can't gas me up anymore, and I think you know
That I can see clearly now the rain is gone
It's bright outside, I see the light, and I'ma speak upon it

You know what I'm saying?
'Cause all that s*** they taught me in school amounted up to ZERO
(Word is bond!)
Abraham Lincoln ain't my motherf***ing hero, why know what I'm saying?
(That Devil ain't my hero neither)
Word up, yo this is Def Jef the poet with soul
Cooling with my man Eddie O.G.
On a funky funky funky funky funky funky track
(Yeah, Bulldogs is out there, why'knahmsayin?
ShaQuan, peace to you and Ace, why'knahmsayin?
Peace to Teddy Ted, Special K, DJ Doc, Ramos
Yeah boys, the soul brothers, why'knahmsayin?)
Oh yeah yeah, Craig B. ? Love and the Legend
And DJ Eric Vaughn, hah
(Word up)
Yeah

Notice this!
They put ""In God We Trust"" on a dollar bill
They don't even have it on a church
And don't even open the verses of their bible
But on the dollar bill is a big sign ""In God We Trust,"" correct?
Then they have, on the back of the dollar bill
The key, the scales, the pyramids
All of the symbols of bondage, slavery
How they took the country, who they took it from
Who you are, the builders of the pyramids
Without your eyes
You are the builders of the pyramids without your eyes
Because you don't know you did it
Why don't he know?
Because a traitor, taught him to eat wrong foods, since he was a baby
Put pork in him, has you eating pigs feet and ribs
Has you living in his image
And took away your divinity
And replacing it, with his low animalization",Speak Upon It,1991
Ed O.G,"Uh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah
ED O.G. uh uh, D Quest uh uh
Boston's Finest, y'all check this out

You challenge me I'll challenge you, off balance fool
I'm a show you rap niggas what real talent do
Never shook up, doing with skills not book up
Four-course-meal is what I cook up
Put your notebook up
Niggas swear they're down cuz' they look up
Rip them rhymes up, hook them hooks up
You need a mic check I'm a push them rooks' up
Your crooks suck, I make a deal off of blood money
Make an album off the drug money
Take the label money and launder it under the table money
And open businesses
It don't matter who's the first or who's the first one that finishes
I'm out of nowhere just like Kurt Warner
Did it to the head without a nigga in my corner
The solo performer, who tell the ""Truth"" like Sojourner
""EDO"" keep it hot like a bullet from a burner

[Chorus]
Whatever you got we got two of it
(You bring yours I'll bring mine)
Straight up sucka' without a crew with him
(You'll get yours in due time)
If you got skills learn what to do with them
(You bring yours I'll bring mine)
What goes around comes back in town
(You'll get yours in due time)

Do I really have desire to flow
Or desire for dough
By any means play the spotlight or behind the scenes
Fuck rap sell ? and get chased by crack fiends
But remain positive and appeal to black queens
Left and right not too many scenes for inbetweens
We kept it divided I remain undecided
And put it on auto-pilot, lay back and cruise
Till I get enough blues and bad news to blow my fuse
Walk a week in my shoes
Concentrate like the camp on the Jews
We drop jewels, while others blow budgets on bars and booze
We already lost nigga so it's hard for my to lose
And choose without being confused
A lot of funny shit happens but I'm hard to amuse
I was knocking hard in the beginning
Learning to lose is the key to winning
A lot of you all take drastic measures with plastic treasures
How we going to put it down without the cash together
Make it last forever and realize you all been blessed
To hear ED O.G. and Deric Quest on the quest

[Chorus]

Yo, I've been in altered states all throughout the states
Blew out the gates, you want wine we got to squash them grapes
Over seas it ain't about the states
I make a hot album, you get a verse on other nigga's tapes
Your first mistake's your worst mistake
Trying to eat and survive off of other nigga's plates
If I'm involved then there must be dialogue
I spits fire dog, to the wire on a level that's higher
Money will turn a saint into a liar
If you ain't got game, you'z a baller in the wind
Niggas rather have a dime up front than a dollar in the end
Silence when you lose but you holla when you win
Big star, close but no cigar
You get smashed on stage like a heavy metal guitar
Whoever you are, or what you sold niggas
You old niggas I don't care what you told niggas
Or who you gased up, you ain't no damn winner
ED O.G.'s the lead singer and you just a band member
Yo, you just a band member, yeah

[Chorus]",Extreme,2000
Ed O.G,"[Chorus: ]
You used to be my man, we used to be in love
Since we parted ways things is gettin' rough
Just because I got a kid by you
Don't give you no reasons to act like a fool

Yo, you used to be my girl, but that was in the past
It's a shame that that shit didn't last
And just because we got a kid together
Don't give you no reasons to change like the weather

Sometimes I reminisce on how it was before we dropped a seed
I was your everything and you was all I need
Stopped payin' attention cause I gained a little weight
Pokin' all these hookers, layin' up from state to state
My stress level's risin' to the highest, you begged me
To have your baby, now you're tryin' to play me
And so I choose to move away from this drama
No longer in love, now you just my baby's father

What's up, you needs to shush up and hush up
Everything you hear you believe
You're loud plus you Rifkin more than Steve
When I come through you make me leave
If I roll up on you like a sleeve
Don't get it twisted like braids or weaves
No welly, I'm off to the bank telly
Plus actin' foul when my seed was in yo belly
You ain't the eight one on the section
The problem is we ain't together but we still keep sexin'

You tryin' to keep the upper hand just because we got a kid
Don't give you the right to try to monitor the way I live
Where I go and who I date ain't no business of yours
No need for you to player-hate, you still get the drawers

The love used to be there, I don't know where the shit went
We was young and wasn't ready for commitment
Young ways at a young age
Two teenagers with a young seed to raise

[Chorus: ]

See you been on fire since the baby, flamin' up
Started changin' up with the rah-rah callin' my peeps and hangin' up
Speakin' in a different tone now
On that young shit, even though we grown now
You on your own, but ain't raisin her alone
We can't even hold a decent conversation on the phone
Yeah, we lay down like SMPTE
You want me to hit you so you tempt me
Turnin' red like Simply

Don't take it out on my seed cause you resent me
It's unfulfilling, so in other words we empty
You talk about things you prepared to do
I was there when your fam wasn't there for you
And yo, I'm pointin' fingers, like triggers
Your sisters is a bunch of goldiggers
With they kids around a million different niggas
Fake tears you cried and wept
Baby, walk the same path and follow in they footsteps

You try to say them hurtful things and threaten me with fear
But I cried my last cry and shed my last tear
I did my best to keep you out of court for child support
But you don't do your job, it's like I'm married to the mob
Your friends be on some spy shit, I'm on some do-or-die shit
Survive it, I got to, I can't depend on you
Watchin' her on weekends, thinkin' you the shit
Callin' it a favor when you babysit
You'se a part-time daddy with some part-time love
And I ain't stoopin' to your level, I gots to rise above
Appreciate I demonstrate, my ways could be much meaner
You be a clown and fuck around, I'm servin' you subpeonas

[Verse One]
Yo..
If the opportunity was to present itself
I might just have to go and reinvent myself
Hook up a chick and advance, don't stick whenever the chance
Sometimes I hit, most the time my dick in my pants
It's on dogs, put your life on pause/paws
Get heads wrapped up in bras and drawers, fightin a lost cause
We break laws, give gauze when we break jaws
Findin flaws in stars and keep the even with the odds
In head-nods, from Spanish red-head broads
And stay Trump tight, with the cards
Went from a meter to a yard, livin my life scarred
Cause every minority grow up hard
Blow up hard, illin get you banned and barred
Soon as you start sleepin catchin you off guard
The very thing, is a 'Bury thing
Either everything is workin, or you workin for everything

""Boston niggaz don't play..""	"".. live and direct son""

[Verse Two]
Will them dogs that smoke blunts witchu, throw a punch witchu
or hold it down when you down and the mutts hitchu?
We all got tools -- I hate tellin good people bad news
Everybody livin by they own rules
Niggaz make me so sick I get nauseous
When I'm in the streets I always remain cautious
You can get rolled up, like a ounce in some Garcias
Compare my accomplishments, to my losses
Everybody want to wonder what the winner does
On my worst day now, it was better than it was
Cause money kept, is twice as good as money burned
And money won, is twice as sweet as money earned
Will there ever come a time, when the cryin ends?
Cause death is just a moment when the dyin ends
The very thing, is a 'Bury thing
Either everything is workin, or you workin for everything

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Alcohol and weed is my vices
to see my daughter smile is priceless
I leave the nicest lifeless
Return like Christ in a crisis
Take this +American Pie+, and distribute out slices
Like enterprisers, who take it to the wire
And shine so bright, niggas need a sun visor
MC's search the seven seas and wind up fishin
There's little to no competition
when I appear like an abberition
Your repitition, kept you in the same tradition, same position
Same ol' rapper, same ol' mission, the game won't listen
We got two thousand new ways, to shine and glisten
Ed O.G. is to rap, what Pedro is to pitchin
Nowadays if you dissin, you could wind up missin
But if you ain't under God, you goin under hard
And we gon' be the main event and y'all are undercard

Either everything is workin, or you workin for everything

Ed O.G & da Bulldogs,"I stay hard like an erection, I'm burnin
suckers who wear protection, now whose next when Ed's flexin
I'm the bread, and you are just a crumb off
Jerkin your jimmy but you still can't come off
I'm from Roxbury, the 'Bury, but not the fruit y'all
Don't make me act like where I come from cause it's bru-tal
Hold my bone, in a zone that's neutral
Soon to be large, the whole nine yards, but I ain't souped y'all
Suckers be swearing that their staring is gonna scare me
Look but don't touch, and if you do be prepared G
to go out, just like your first day off punishment
Da Bulldogs, Roxbury, and Boston is what I represent
The Black United Leaders Livin Directly On Groovin Sounds
At first you didn't know us, but know it's like, ""Yo put me down""
We didn't get in there so you can get in with us
You wasn't down when we was ridin the bus
So put on your Adidas, and STEP OFF.. I got to have it

No need for me to run away, brother put the gun away
You want to take my life away as if we were in combat
You can buy some new Adidas but you can't buy my life back
Aiyyo whassup with that?  Why is it like that?
Let's stand together y'all... and fight that in our race
To replace waste with a taste, just in case
you can't face the place that you've been put in
If you was my kid, for what you did you'd have a foot in
right in your ass, another term's rectum
Kids are having kids, they're not parents so they let them
do things that shouldn't be done
You're not a father cause you got a son unless you're taking care of him
Crack... is more contagious than rabies
Baseheads broads are havin basehead babies
Now how that sound, not profound
Black people unite, and let's all get down.. I got to have it

I'm not like anyone else, and in your shoes I couldn't be in
The E unto the D unto the O ohh yes be G'n
Da Bulldogs got pull dawg, incitin we be seein
I don't want to, stand on a corner, I'm MCing
Call me, a goody two-shoes, who's in the right shoes be
I don't have to pump jumps or clock G's
It's my turn to go, and I got the right-of-way
You gotta fight your way to see another brighter day
But that's another subject you like it or you love it
Ja-ilers, get jealous, no push but I'ma shove it
But regardless, when times are hardest
I cleaned off the dirt, cause they needed a polish
When you're in like food in your stomach, they want to stick witchu
But when you're out like Elvis, they want to dick you
But hey, that's OK, cause we kept on strivin
and even when T lost his car, we kept on drivin
You had your chance to advance, but you blew it

Now this is the meanin of a Bug-A-Boo
It's a person who's constantly BUGGIN YOU
Never givin you no room TO BREATHE
On you like skin, or a shirt WITH SLEEVES
A person that constantly wants to be around you
It could even be your moms or pops when they hound you
Just someone who's always botherin you
If you was a plant, they'd be continuously waterin you
Sweatin you like - heat
Let's say you are the (?), and they are the sheets
Always on you, and wrapped around you
As if you were lost, and they just found you
They never get the picture
No matter how many times you diss 'em, they still want to get witcha
continuously callin never givin you a rest
A Bug-A-Boo's just like a fly..
Nothing but a pest, and I suggest
That you step, why?

[Chorus]
Cause you're a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo..

[Ed O.G.]
Now girls, there's that certain guy that just be tippin
On you like clothes and I suppose that you be dippin
in his kicks, cause he's a stupid dick
Sappy givin you this and that, so you can feel happy
Yeah you might be happy but you're sick of him
Because he's on it, and you want to get rid of him
But he's sweatin you, don't knock it cause he's gettin you
everything you want, so you can get fly
You say, ""Bug-A-Boo jump,"" and he says, ""How high?""
Hey, just get paid, cause he's payin you
And don't call him by his name, call him a Bug-A-Boo

[Chorus]

[Ed O.G.]
Now everybody knows a Bug-A-Boo or was a Bug-A-Boo
You mighta had to bug a few or even fell in love and knew
that you was buggin a person, never cuttin no slack
Cause everytime you called them they was like ""I'll call you back""
Now a girl can whip a guy, and he can become one
He'll be callin you'll be stallin cause he's stupid a dumb one
But it goes both ways, and as a matter of fact
A girl can catch her man cheatin, and still take him back
So to all you Bug-A-Boos who got the blues and really want it
without you Bug-A-Boos we couldn't say that you were on it

Aiyyo Florida, why ain't you more into the crime
instead of sweatin rappers for the way they say a rhyme?
I thought your state was straight, lots of girls and very sunny
You're bein Bug-A-Boo's cause they black and makin money
Protestin and arrestin a rap group real quick
If there was a white rock band you wouldn't say shit
Oh shit, I said a swear, I'm appalled I shouldn't say this
You musta started swears cause this ain't even our language
The other man and sellouts, are constantly riffin
Porno flicks are legal talkin about it won't make a difference
2 Live is sellin gold, so somebody's lovin the
But you can't dig a nigga makin more than your governor
Hi-five to 2 Live, aiyyo T, pass the brew
Step to this, catch a fist, now tell me what to do

""Do, what you want to.."" (2X)

[Ed O.G.]
The problem's not race, it's anything that's steamy
They arrested white people, for wearin bikinis
They said they're showin too much, I don't see, how y'all can take it
But when I go to Florida, I'm goin naked
And swearin, and rappin, and talkin bout sex
Full of Olde E, from my feet to my neck
I'll be the main attraction on the news at eight
Since drugs and murder, don't affect that state
The fear down there, I hope the cops don't see me
Rockin a rhyme, or wearin a bikini
Ed O.G. and the Bulldogs is a race not a crew
And no one can, tell us what to do

Let me be me, and you be you
And don't criticize or worry about the things that I do
Because I like the way I am, and you cram to understand me
Talk all you want, but I don't give a damn see
Cause I'm me, my mother's only son
Don't try to be like me, cause God made only one
individual, who's original, just myself
It wouldn't be right, for me to be like, anyone else
I'm down with Luke duke, aiyyo I'm in so count me
Fuck the sheriff don't dare riff, when I step in Broward County
I ain't hearin it, cause in the 'Bury we don't fear that shit
This ain't a western, rap's a profession
So stop guessin, sit down and learn a lesson
Stand up for what's right, fight a fight, cause it could be you
And don't let no one, tell you what to do, aiyyo

Hey yo T, you're ready to swing off into this?
(Ready, dog)
Aight man, let's kick it

Sometimes I feel like a nut, and sometimes I don't
Yo
Bu-do-do-do
Sometimes I feel like a nut, and sometimes I don't

Now there were times when girls ignored me
I was feelin' very horny
I wanted to flex
I was in the mood for sex
I couldn't get it
If she was a ball, she still wouldn't let me hit it
I couldn't understand why this girl wasn't with it
Yo, but now I'm makin' records and it's easy to get squeezed
Cause girls be handin' it out like government cheese
Now I'm gettin' it and I don't mean to pick with it
But tell you the truth, fellas, I'm gettin' kinda sick of it
Everyday out and in, in and out
Every girl makes the same noise - ""Ah,"" ""Ooh"" and ""Ouch""
T-Nyne said (I got two, you're ready to strike it?)
I'm really not in the mood, T, I just don't feel like it
Cause

I had a dream I lost all my girls and couldn't re-up
Jimmy couldn't sleep, so he woke me up
He was standin' straight up, lookin' down on me
And said you know what time it is, and then it dawned on me
I was horny and it was drivin' me crazy
Jimmy said it's about that time for love, baby
And I was with it
So I called up a freak, so I can get freaky
She said, ""My parents are home,"" I said, ""Just sneak me
Through the window cause this is somethin' I gotta have""
Said said, ""Okay, come over,"" - ""Cool, I'm catchin' a cab""
So then I got there and then I snuck in
Creepin' and duckin' and pressin' my luck in
All sorts of ways cause she was a new recruiter
Wasn't a traditional mission for me to knock some boots
Finally at last time to step on the gas, see
Of course I filled her up, cause she was on E
Sayin' all sorts of things, I couldn't understand what
Just one of those days I felt like a nut
Cause

Now a girl might say I'm sweatin' her cause she's a cutie
I give a freak a thousand chances to get the booty
And then when I get there to ignite it up
Hey yo, jimmy's prepared and ready to light it up
And then things won't be the way they used to be
I won't be callin' her, she'll be callin' me
Sayin', ""Hi, hello, what's up and how you doin', E?""
Call me back, freak, cause you're annoyin' me
Down my name to your friends you wouldn't bone me
You gave me a piece and now you think that you owe me?
Come on, step off get lost
Tell your friends you rode me like a race horse
I bet you won't tell 'em that, in fact
Freak, don't even call me back
She said, ""If that's the way you want it, punk, I won't""
I said, ""Ehm, sometimes I feel like a nut, and sometimes I don't""
Let's swing it

Yeah
I want to send a super shout-out to Da Bulldogs who's in the house
I got my man T-Nyne in the place to be feelin' like a nut
You know what I'm sayin'?
I got my man Smooth Ice Gee
You know he in the house feelin' like a nut
DJ Chance feelin' like a nut
Teddy Ted and Special K, you know they feelin' like nuts

""I'm different, so don't compare me to another"" (3X)
""If they can't hang, word to the mother""

Verse One: Ed O.G.

I'm not like anyone else, so don't you think up or make suggestions
""He rap like so-and-so"" aiyyo yo know that's out of the question
Plus it don't sound right, cause I don't sound like -- him??
Or try to G like, see like, or even be like them
or anyone else I'm goin for self you opened your mouth and then I stuff you
You're like a floor; walked on, waxed, and then I buff you
Plus you think you're tough too?
Witcha garbage style, rubbish nothing but trash
You want to try me?  Come on I got some shit for that ass
I never be weak, doze off, fall asleep or get tired
Put wings on your head, so it's easier to fly it
Off you go, blaow, off the block
Get funky on you suckers like a gym sweat sock
cause I turn, to inflict, pick your hair up like a pick
Ed O.G., here is me, I make medicine sick
I'm never takin a loss, but beatin em down with force
Go when Dave writes the source, I got more holes than a golf course
Here's a lyrical lesson, so you losers you learn
Wack raps are like weak jim hats, you break and get burned
So I dare thee to compare me to a soft-hearted sucker
I'm different, so don't compare me to another

Chorus

Verse Two: Ed O.G.

Some of the people want to be equal wishin that they could be me
They never benign, got many who rhyme in the East so don't attempt to be
thinkin that you could do that, boy if you only knew that
I can't hold back, stompin a sucker I enjoy that
My impact, on contact, will overlap, your wack rap
Cause def tracks, exact to react, and attack the wack
I won't slack, but smoke smack slap you sap
Straight your soft so I put you in stacks
and stomp a sucker dead in his tracks, takin apart you righ to the max
Wake to the wonderful words, buggin you up and then waxin
Never ever takin a half-step, you diss oh that's your last step
You slept Joe, with strep throat, so now I'ma bust your rep
Droppin this, strictly on the metropolis
No comp for this, so why do you persist in this
Go ahead and attempt to; you better be filing exempt too --
-- cause you're a student, who's intruding
out of your district, oh well - another statistic
While I'm statin the swift style strictly, then switchin this
Swarm in a storm somehow, and leavin your shitlist
Smoke smack slap you sap, you are a sickness
Step and stand still boy, so I can stick this
sword of rap, straight up your spine sap
So you will be too scared, you swallow my style in your stomach
Let me shoot my sperm, until she screams and squirms, see
But don't sweat that I got a jim hat for safety
So I dare thee to compare me to a soft-hearted sucker
I'm different, so don't compare me to another

Chorus

Verse Three: Ed O.G.

Ed O.G.'s imposing threat, to be dreaded
To those I beheaded, the rest just sweated
But some of them are skeptical, so I step
with full packed force, and you know what, I wrecked the hoe
So don't put yourself, in that predicament
Because I'm sick of it, and you'll go out quicker than Bounty
The Quicker The Picker-Upper while I soak em
I might choke em, or even smoke em, NAH
But I'll max, and I'll just tax
and keep scopin by oneses, just like Jacks
See I compete with the weak I come across
I'm too elite to defeat, step off cause you're soft
When I elaborate, the ruler is smooth, I collaborate
in a state to straight that you hate
After this I'll be famous, but not the same as
those who proclaim this I'll leave them nameless
Thinkin you're hard with your backup, punk don't make me crackup
By yourself you just choke up, and plus get smoked up
So I dare thee to compare me to a soft-hearted sucker
I'm different, so don't compare me to another

Ed O.G & da Bulldogs,"""Come here, are you ticklish?""	

When I first got introduced with her
I wanted a future with her
And it was very easy for me to get used to her
We went to the movies, everything was groovy
We started spendin time and it was like she already knew me
We spent more time, then everything was fine
I kicked it to her how since she kicked it to mine
I called her up at work and even met her downtown
Keen to knowin one another, yo, I thought that I'd found
The perfect match for me, this just has to be
Asked her what's up with you and me?
She said she wanted to be friends with me
So I took it like a man
I couldn't understand why she wouldn't take my hand
And let me take her on a trip
She's a cute honey dip
It make her feel real good when I start to kiss her lips
Gimme a chance, oh yes, I be true to you
Hey yo, cause I want to make love to you

Let me tickle your fancy, girl
Let me tickle your fancy

""Come here, are you ticklish?""

Lampin on the block, coolin out and maxin
This girl walked by, she caught my eye, I said, ""What's happenin?""
WE started talkin, she was showin her interest
Got her number and address that very instance
Later on that night I decided to call her up
She was on the other line, she say hold on and hung up
With the person she was talkin to so she could talk to me
That was a sign that she was with it, it was time to drop some g
So I laid down with my eyes closed and kicked the Willie Bobo
And talked to her all night because I took a couple of No Doze
The next day came, I heard a knock-knock-kknock
I had on shorts and no shirts, so I unlocked the lock
She came in and sat down and we got right to it
I didn't waste no time cause I was ready to do it
She said she wasn't ready and this I couldn't understand
See, I really, really wanted to tickle her fancy

Let me tickle your fancy, girl
Let me tickle your fancy
Let me, let me
Let me tickle your fancy, girl
Let me tickle your fancy
Let me

The attraction from me to you was very physical
And if you had it and you lost it you would miss it, girl
I make you scream, scratch, squirm and sweat
When we get up to take a shower my bed'll be soaken wet
And after the shower we'll go and get some breakfast
Eatin to makin love is really the next best
Thing than actually makin love
Cause after love I'm hungry for some grub
I know your father always told you watch out for guys like me
Don't even say hi to me, just walk right by me
You see, I disagree, cause he was just like me
You want to obey him with all of your might
But look at your father now, he turned out alright
Come on, take your chance, yeah, I'm a dog who's sneaky
But gimme one night so I can show you I get freaky

Well, I seen a few, but this one I had to kick it to
So I stepped to her, threw a couple and a few of
My lines to sedate her
Hm... she grabbed her coat and her bag, we left five minutes later
Yo, if she was a door I wouldn't knock like a neighbor in peace
I'd treat her like a drug house and bang like the police
Now at the crib the lights are dim, the music is soft
I said, ""You know what we're here for, so take those off""
By now she's butt-naked, I'm ready to break it
Threw on the jim hat, I'm ready for trim, and all that
So I did it up, oo-wee, homes, I lit it up
After I was done, she almost didn't get up
Then she got up on her feet, sweat me like a dog in heat

""Excuse me, could you pull over, please?""
Right down ( ? ) in the heart of the 'Bury
I said to myself I'ma show this girl the meaning of my dic-tionary
She was dressed in black with a pair of riding boots
A Chinese top with a nice ( ? ), she was cute
She wasn't like a radio, so I couldn't turn her down
I got her address and said I be over after sundown
Night had fallen, Edo G wasn't stallin
I was over the crib, ready to place my bib
She was def/ man, you shoulda saw her
I rode them riding boots like a brother ride a ( ? )

We was ridin through Morton Street projects
Just cruisin around, foolin around
And then we saw a couple of female subjects
All of our eyes looked their way, standin in the doorway
With nothin on but two tight little negliges
So we stopped the car, got out cause we was trickin
Kenny and Mike wasted no time, they walked right up and started kickin
As if they had been there, pretendin to live there
Helping hands, but it was really just to get in there
Then they got in and left a brother all alone
K said, ""Hey yo Edo, then you can use my car phone""
So I'm talkin on the phone thinkin this is ill
After a 30 minute ( ? ) K said, ""You're runnin up my phone bill

Led the way to a place where we could all get paid
Where the goods were like rugs, just waitin to get laid
So we stayed, tryin to decide on
Who would have who, and which girl wanted to ride on
His jim, one got up and kissed Glen
And took him in a room, goddamn he's in
Teddy Ted and Special K was already bonin
In a room with two girls who was yellin and moanin
And that left me, Fish, T, Cruz and Joe
Me and Cruz got hooked up so we looked up and g-o
G and Joe was waitin, sittin and debatin like troops
While Fish got up so he could step into some boots
So now it's two left tryin to get into the hoes' clothes
Ted opened up the door and said (Kick the Willie Bobo)
So now we're all in, finished and done bonin
We jumped in the streets cause it's time to start rollin

Ed O.G & da Bulldogs,"But when it comes to
Protecting the lives of twenty-two million Afro-Americans
Then all of a sudden, Uncle Sam becomes very conscious, of legality

Here's the reason that, I've been upset for a while
'Cause if you're black you get life, but if you're white you're on trial
Ain't nothing to it, just like that chump Charles Stewart
They're always claiming, that the devil made me do it
For insurance, he killed his wife and his child
And blamed it on a brother, and racists got buck wild
He had the media, believing the, aesop fable
And all the whites were like, ""I can't wait 'til
They catch the bastard - I hope they fry him""
They were sure that he did it, there was no need to try him
And Willy Bennett, who was in it to win it
Got bassed and harassed cause they was sure that he did it
And the thing that really pissed me off and truly offended me
Is the suckers wanted to reinstate the death penalty
For a brother man, but not the other man
And when they found out, he killer her himself, hmm on the other hand
Now it's inhumane, bring it back they wouldn't dare
But his brother confessed he was with it, so give HIM the chair
But that won't happen with that punk Dukakis
Flynn and Mickey Roach, you better just watch for us
I don't want to hear that you're sorry to me
After you tore up, and started a war up in the black community
It's out of the news, but it's still in my head
Charles Stewart still lives even though the sucker's dead
I'ma speak upon it

He is trying to wipe, you, out
Trying to eliminate your total existence
With falsehood and lies
And he's succeeding in doing it!

Now here's a verse about a relative, that coulda lived
But killed by a cop that thought negative
Shot in the back like a victim of Jesse James
Tell them his motherf***ing name!
Phillip Pernell, murdered by a devil
That never saw a cell, so I'm here to raise hell and tell
About a child that was left to decay
And the next couple of days the pig was suspended with pay
Receiving support from cops and superior courts
And all we receive is a bullet inside a corpse
Now tell me, what type of justice has been done
What woulda happened if I shot his son?
I woulda been killed, taken to a chamber and filled up with gas
But yet nothing has happened to ?
So I had to take two extra steps
And put it on wax, cause I couldn't let it rest (why?)
'Cause I can't stand to see Satan smile
And get away with taking the life of a child
You meant to do it, so now your motto is (tell 'em)
The more bullets, the less blacks live (you better)
Watch your back you murderer because you're wanted
But for now, yo, I guess I gotta speak upon it

We've got to come together
Pool our efforts, our strength, our finance
And build our own nation
The Chinese did it, it's called Chinatown!

Let me speak upon this with a radical take as I take
Time to talk about the systematical break-down
And deliberate destruction through mis-education
Of the Nubian Nation
Starting in kindergarten, continuing through college
They continue to kick you trick knowledge
And call it education but I call it training
Washing your brain into gaining and maintaining
The American dream, but to me it's a nightmare
Because they keeps ya right where
They want you to be, mentally, physically, and monetarily
As you go merrily merrily merrily
Down the stream but it's more like up s***'s creek
Without a paddle and the boat's got a leak
We start drowning in all that s***, getting deeper
Mind's in a choke hold or should I say a sleeper
But I ain't going out like Rip Van Winkle
So you can't gas me up anymore, and I think you know
That I can see clearly now the rain is gone
It's bright outside, I see the light, and I'ma speak upon it

You know what I'm saying?
'Cause all that s*** they taught me in school amounted up to ZERO
(Word is bond!)
Abraham Lincoln ain't my motherf***ing hero, why know what I'm saying?
(That Devil ain't my hero neither)
Word up, yo this is Def Jef the poet with soul
Cooling with my man Eddie O.G.
On a funky funky funky funky funky funky track
(Yeah, Bulldogs is out there, why'knahmsayin?
ShaQuan, peace to you and Ace, why'knahmsayin?
Peace to Teddy Ted, Special K, DJ Doc, Ramos
Yeah boys, the soul brothers, why'knahmsayin?)
Oh yeah yeah, Craig B. ? Love and the Legend
And DJ Eric Vaughn, hah
(Word up)
Yeah

Notice this!
They put ""In God We Trust"" on a dollar bill
They don't even have it on a church
And don't even open the verses of their bible
But on the dollar bill is a big sign ""In God We Trust,"" correct?
Then they have, on the back of the dollar bill
The key, the scales, the pyramids
All of the symbols of bondage, slavery
How they took the country, who they took it from
Who you are, the builders of the pyramids
Without your eyes
You are the builders of the pyramids without your eyes
Because you don't know you did it
Why don't he know?
Because a traitor, taught him to eat wrong foods, since he was a baby
Put pork in him, has you eating pigs feet and ribs
Has you living in his image
And took away your divinity
And replacing it, with his low animalization",Speak Upon It,1991
Ed O.G & da Bulldogs,"Be a father, if not, why bother, son
A boy can make 'em, but a man can raise one
If you did it, admit it and stick with it
Don't say it ain't yours 'cause all women are not whores
Ninety percent represent a woman that is faithful
Ladies, can I hear it? Thank you.
When a girl gets pregnant, her man is gonna run around
Dissin' her for nine months, when it's born he wants to come around
Talking that I'm sorry for what I did
And all of a sudden he wants to see his kid
She had to bear it by herself and take care of it by herself
And givin' her money for milk won't really help
Half of the fathers with sons and daughters don't even want to take 'em
But it's so easy for them to make 'em
It's true, if it weren't for you then the child wouldn't exist
After a skeeze, there's responsibilities so don't resist
Be a father to your child

You see, I hate when a brother makes a child and then denies it
Thinking that money is the answer so he buys it
A whole bunch of gifts and a lot of presents
It's not the presents, it;s your presence and essence
Of being there and showing the baby that you care
Stop sittin' like a chair and having your baby wonder where you are
Or who you are----fool, you are his daddy
Dib;t act like you ain't cause that really makes me mad, G.
To see a mother and a baby suffer
I've had enough of brothers who don't love the
Fact that a baby brings joy into your life
You could still be called daddy if the mother's not your wife
Don't be scared, be prepared 'cause love is gonna getcha
It will always be your child even if she ain't witcha
So don't front on your child when it's your own
'Cause if you front now, then you'll regret it when it's grown
Be a father to your child

Put yourself in his position and see what you're done
But just keep in mind that you're somebody;s son
How would you like it if your father was a stranger
And then tried to come into your life and tried to change
The way your mother raised ya----now, wouldn't that amaze ya?
To be or not to be, that is the question
When you're wrong, you're wrong, it's time to make a correction
Harassin' the mother for being with another man
But if the brother man can do it better than you can,
let him. Don't sweat him, duke
Let him do the job that you couldn't do.
You're claimin you was there, but not when she needed you
And now you want to come around for a day or two?
It's never too late to correct your mistake
So get yourself together for your child's sake
And be a father to your child",Be a Father to Your Child,1991

How many of my real niggaz are still left?
A lot got killed, and filled a wooden box
and went out like ?docks?
I can picture when you went down, just like a ?becks?
Here one day, and gone the next
We all make mistakes, and these are the breaks
but I'm, sick and tired, of goin to wakes

I think you woulda been proud
to see me at a show, and move the crowd
Your best friend, shot you over five dollars, that ain't right
The money mattered, and not the life
I wonder what you woulda told me, to get a girl and lay her

and never thought that it would get to my moms
But when she found out, she made me take the pound out
and get out with it, man I could forget it
Now I'm stayin with this girl who got a kid
by another nigga, whose crew is much bigger
But he don't dig it cause his jim hat broke
But she kept the baby, cause he pumps coke
Now her crib is the new weed spot
to get the smoke or the choke, it was gettin mad hot
The next morning, while she was still sleeping
I was creeping to Jenny, here's a note, don't sweat it
Forget it, cause it ain't worth it
I need to be alone when I'm goin under the surface
Now I'm out to hit my workers
Two damn niggaz, and one Turkish white boy
who got Southeast sewn up

Only 17 and got my own crib
And still learnin how to live on the streets of the ghetto

I'm eighteen gettin mad green off the fiends

Now I'm up to three keys, pounds of weed and sellin bundles
Distributin all three, to get all the fundzoes

Twenty years old, I like the way it's goin down
I got money to burn -- dropped out of school
cause they couldn't teach me what I needed to learn
on how to earn big money, big money
I got the fortune, and a crib where it's sunny
But like a dummy, I started gettin careless
Talkin on the phone, so DEA could hear this
Date transaction the time and the spot
My world crashed on me, when I got caught
Now I'm locked, with the niggaz that are trife
No more money no more women for the rest of my life

Ed Polcer's All-Stars,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You,1994
Ed Polcer's All-Stars,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,1994
Ed Polcer's All-Stars,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do

Ed Polcer's All-Stars,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else),1994
Ed Polcer's All-Stars,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too? 
Just like I cried over you.
Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

Ed Polcer's All-Stars,"Just give me a June night
The moonlight and you in my arms with all your charms

Just give me a June night
The moonlight and you
Give me a June night
Give me the moonlight
But mostly give me you

And when you're in my arms, 
With all your charms and the moon above
We're gonna make love, love, love

Ed Polcer's All-Stars,"How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?
Why do you try to make me feel so blue?
I've done nothing to you.
Do me right or else just let me be.
'Cause I can beat you doing what you're doing to me.

How come you do me like you do?

Ed Polcer's All-Stars,"Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once ina while?
We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away

You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

And the snow is starting to fall
Then my eyes turn westward knowing
That's the place that I love best of all

California, I've been blue
Since I've been away from you.
I can't wait till I get going
Even now I'm starting in a call

California, here I come
Right back where I started from
Where bowers are flowers bloom in the spring

That's why I can hardly wait,
Open up that Golden Gate!

Ed Reed,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

But I can't remember where or when

Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to

And the first quail calls

For the old man is a-waiting for to carry you to freedom

The dead trees will show you the way.

The seasons make a song
And we who live beside her
Still try to sing along
Of rivers, fish, and men
And the season still a-coming
When she'll run clear again.

So many homeless sailors,
So many winds that blow
I asked the half blind scholars
Which way the currents flow
So cast your nets below
And the gods of moving waters
Will tell us all they know.

The circles of the planets
The circles of the moon
The circles of the atoms
All play a marching tune
And we who would join in
Can stand aside no longer
Not let us all begin.",Of Time and Rivers Flowing,1976

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

You taunt me
With memories

There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Ed Saindon,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1997

When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,

Not a real one, just a dream

Don't you drown when your dream boat runs onto the ground

I'd just like to know do you love him or just making time

He'll taste the aftertaste when you come home late some night.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Just friends, but not like before

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill

London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
And it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

A traveler
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat

What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

Stuck here sitting in the backseat

And if the city never sleeps

Ed Sheeran,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to

There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again

Oh you are my one, and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

You're just a small bump unknown and you’ll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
(Oh) Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide a small bump
In four months you'll open your eyes

I'll hold you tightly, I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you

You are my one, and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh you are my one, and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

You can lie with me, with your tiny feet when your half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me for a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one, and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh you are my one, and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

You were just a small bump unborn, for four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why",Small Bump,2011
Ed Sheeran,"This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, ooh

And I'll throw it all away
And watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall, now

You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing

And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I thrown it all away
Watched you fall, now

And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall
Down to earth
Take me back for

This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new",This,2011
Ed Sheeran,"I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry so I get high smoke in the day then I sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
End up forgetting things about myself
I'm stubborn I'm forward head's just blocked
My head's still with you but my hearts just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
That's why you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said that we'll be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views
Everything's great but everything's short
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
Oh you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied

Because if I was gonna go somewhere I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down oh
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around to make sure I'm not he only one to feel low
Because if you want I'll take you in my arms
And keep you sheltered from all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know that god made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied

Ed Sheeran,"I should ink my skin
With your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it

See I could do without a tan
On my left hand, where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
And fill it up with bubbles

'Cause maybe you're lovable
And maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter I'll
Hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty
If you did the same to me
Would you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it twelve times
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too
And if your DVD breaks, today
You shoulda got a VCR
'Cause I never owned a Blu-Ray
True say

And now I've always been s*** at computer games and your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go all cross
And chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you'd laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you'd lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always tryna get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot

So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand And I'll
Make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand

And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe
To feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now

'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up",Wake Me Up,2011
Ed Sheeran,"Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you at all

You need me man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verso
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper

Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow)

From day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til' we're just jack, soon as I get the bus back

Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a French church tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur

On a late night coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon but don't chase lines

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am

I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

And now I'm sitting on a night bus flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong

Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1

Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence

Oh well, she's a local girl
No make-up
Cos she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

Is it fast food
I'll regret it after
And I needed money
But I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her I love her
And she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio
It makes me feel naughty

She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek

So if the drink kill us
We're gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
I say I hate wasps too
I don't really dance
So I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that's alright
I don't wanna be here
I'm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You don't mind sharing

When we’re resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5.01
Like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed
And I’m way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it’s cold outside, again

And we’re both so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I’ll take ya
But I’d rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa, with you

When the morning comes
We’re not watching Formula I
It’s not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain’t too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

Pain ain’t the emotion I wanna feel but I’m thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
I’ll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can’t afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It’s dark when I’m about just me myself and my shadow
I'm parro, running out of ammo, and it seems like everyone around me is on the same path so it’s narrow
The less then the better, a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise are they ever gonna guess I'm clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind’s infected with terror
No wonder I’m under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It easy when you look back, shoulda, woulda, coulda but I bet you can’t bring should woulda could back
Back to fifteen I said to myself, that I’m more than a hood track!

You can’t ever drown me out, the water supplies too low

I've never seen someone drown without, a sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
A violent MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I’m choking? Seriously, do I sound like I’m joking?
I’m floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that's sunk many years, I’m maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin, when it’s in motion
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I’m broken
No real shit, throw my skin ain’t close to corrosion
Fuck em all, this ain't tug of war, still don't get roped in the open, I don’t wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then I’ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don’t wanna see this guy survive.

To see my family.
Please Father let me go,
As my mother sleeps.

I don't know about days gone,
But round here nobody lives twice.
When your gone, your gone, without no bye,
Cause only a judge can give you life.
This is my advice,
Trust me, I nearly lost my life.
3 weeks after I got this ride
It seems like I had too much wine.
Which that I I didn't get one,
Anyway, I was going to the [?] booked for a set,
Even though I didn't have a set one.
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one.
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one.
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination,
Then I was off to the next one,
20 minutes later I was on the M1,
Tired.
But I kept on going,
Fell asleep without even knowing.
No emotion in my face,
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going.
Woke up,
Lorry,
Flash,
Panic,
Break,
Skid,
Crash,
Skidded,
More,
Bang,
Smash,
Out,
Cold,
Ribs,
Cracked,
Ouch.
I was in so much pain,
Crawled out of a Megane that now looked like a Mini,
When I was still on the first lane.
Baffled, didn't even know my name.
Fainted, too much shock in my brain.
Surrounded by paramedics and feds,
Trying to get up but fainted again.

See I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cause I smile when you see me out.
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared,
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,
To see my family,
And keep it inside,
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps.
Save my soul,
Please Father let me go.
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps.

Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open,
I can hear voices and my phone ringing.
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning,
One of the worst situations I've been in.
I can hear all of the angels singing.

But when it stopped humming,
My brain turned on, stared running.
Still in pain, but it started numbing,
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning.
I still tried to do a few shows cause I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming.
But I was left with a permanent problem,
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (inside).
Ever so cunning,
6 weeks later, jogging and running.
I used the first aid kit like a drum set,
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming.
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes,
You can't afford to let one in.
Never done dream for a while,
The pipeline was blocked,
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing.
They say tomorrow never dies,
But he forgot to tell you 'you can'.
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang,
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam.
You can try beg for another,
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show,
Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother',
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, Runner.

I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cause I smile when you see me out.
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared.

Ed Sheeran,"Hey
Can you hear me?
I just wanted to let you know
Hm

I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam'
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
'Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you.

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alone

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you, oh

I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out?'
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us.
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam' I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing.
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you.

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never wanna be alone

I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you, oh

It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you, when I see you but,
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you

There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
'Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot.
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me.

I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face,
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air,
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you?",Goodbye to You,2011
Ed Sheeran,"I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe.
Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
""'Cause real will recognize real"" is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.

Five o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z
Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying
'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
It's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

[Chorus]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be...
The times I'm living in lately.

I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron
But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie
Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die.
Never die.

Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do,
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true!
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.

Ed Sheeran,"Listen, Little Lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday.
It's 30 degrees Thursday, you work late.
You was with a perv making dirty, fake love in his Mercedes.
Maybe the word, rape, sums up events that take place every night. 
You wanna get up, but you know your legs will ache if you try",Little Lady,2011
Ed Sheeran,"They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen?
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week,
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife,
Right now it's better than it's never been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me,
Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak,
Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it.
They chase dreams together like a slumber party,
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading.

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.

You better wake up cause I am making moves,
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms,
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training,
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze.
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading,
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception,
cause they try to hit misses with my direction,
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike,
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night,
The haters know where the family lives,
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger.
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it.
They say sleep is the cause of death,
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs I'm N/A reading.
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next.

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.
They watching me! They watch me sleep!

Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality,
And daydream about losing my sanity.
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow.
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed.
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat.
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep.
See, all the dreams I'm fonder,
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I Mr hard worker,
In my nightmares I Mr can't turn up,
And I missed my chance worst luck,
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah, and I walked from ish,
thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.

Ed Sheeran,"Hi, my name is JME, there was a time when radio played me
'Cause my music came from my heart, it was real to me
But now it's a par
I'm here struggling, keeping it real, 
While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal,
Sometimes I sit back and think JME just do one tune, make a couple G's and chill,
The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all that for this
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is, unfair, straight 
Who could tell me different, look at me, determined,
Man on a mission, my music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'm a do this

I never had a playlist in my heart, oho
Now I need an A list just to chart oho
But I've been famous from the start oho

Oho, oho, oho, oh, oh, oh

Thank God for night clubs and the raves
'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down, but cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bullet proof booth,
You won't hear me on the radio, 
But go to the rave and the crowd, they're raising roof
Why is that? What's going on there?
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

I never had a playlist in my heart, oho

Oho, oho, oho, oh, oho, oh

I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers, rhythm by the pile,
So won't you hear me out?
Never feel it from the base line, feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub
So won't you hear me out?
Are you gonna play me, though,

Ed Sheeran,"These thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid
the goals I reach are not near ones the further than limits
I block her out so when I'm looking through my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute, can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
Know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum
It's you that I lived for, I am the first and the last one to love you lots

Whats better than thinking about the ones you love
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm in the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up
No one here to help you pain now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is I wasn't so, I'm coming from a colder zone


And when the sun falls down I'll be up again
I never close my eyes,
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)

I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
'Cause you're been trespassing, and you won't leave my mind
Now even think about this, call me say, yes nan
I'm 31 now I'm still saying yes nan
You had to replace my mom, dad 2 parents in one
I know your proud staring at your grandson
I found a job I like like, got the flat, the cars, the bike, the quad I
like
Because of you I'm tireless in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanting people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here, cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm I'm gone I want my music still playin'
And when my people listen to this track, it's gonna make them wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about my scene to say the games better is a must
now I gotta fly
My talents gonna shine for surely, fam I know it, I work 'round the clock,
I don't stop at night.


And when the sun falls down I'll be up again
I never close my eyes,

Another cry

Another light lost from your face

Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right

Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart, melt me down

Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one
To help me get to sleep

And hold me tight, don't let me breathe

Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before

I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you

And all my walls stood tall painted blue

Making up for lost time, taking flight, making me feel like

I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now

But this place'll stay the same
And I'll know
When I'll go

Yeah
And I'm pickin' up another bag
And I pack another knapsack
The airport's like a stop light to me
Sittin' on red, green light go
Can't see my family
My family grew into a global trance
Or fans, some may call 'em
And it's on the stage I stand
To jam Roxy, no wakin' up to stop the dream
I lived the life, signed a picture
'Cause no dam could stop the stream
Or flood gates, I'm in the fuck trades
And a pocket fulla culture condoms

Who got the South in a six pack, and a shotgun just for show?
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth
Put the hood in mossy oak

Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life
Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's write
With a broken pen, there they go again
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' jam
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in
I'm goin' home, I'm home again
Bring it back up in the UK
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack
Catfish Billy, hell, you say
I'm just bein' blunt, homie
Keep the grass

Yeah, take one look
Better yet, take two
But if I take that break, there's a move you made
This dude you shape will come take you back
Back to the roots I've been
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in
Or a spot to sleep in
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season
'Cause I am not the reason
That the image you're used to seein'
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless
Meaning yes, I'm different
Differently made
And me screamin' the A
Is not the difference in grades
It's the place I stayed
'Cause the schools were underpaid
The teachers taught, but to me they fought
A star that was underway
It was under Wayne, it was in my name
Michael
M.W.A
Atha
And in trouble I stayed
Breakin' out of this bubble they made
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand
Committed to the words I say
A blood line's not a family tree
It's a needle in my skin for all to see
I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk
But I drink and take the ink

Ed Sheeran,"There wasn't much left
Except for the last twenty sack
And the last twenty of my last check
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step
Woke up and took it in with a half breath
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick
I lit my cigarette
Feeling half dead, whiskey on my mind
Then came the dead
Sheriff in the yard, here comes the rest
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by
My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye
Baby in her arms
She took a cab home
She told me I was only good for a sad song
A crooked smile I gave
Nonchalant about it
Maybe she'll come back
This time I doubt it
Act like I care, but I really don't
Wanted to change
But somehow I knew I really won't
See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal
Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand
God's not going to land another saving hand
If the time came like it has time again
Then I would watch the clock and be late again
One gun and a Harley in the driveway
One way out, dirt road, pathway
Put another dead butt in the ash tray
I stand up still drunk, half baked
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring
Paid him no attention
In fact I barely seen him
Until he walked away
And he started singing

London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

I didn't see it coming
I didn't see the wall
And I went from running, to a slow crawl
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry
Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie
I speak no evil, but hear no angels
A family is callin' but all I see is strangers
Take the bible from the hotel drawer
Hell froze over ice cold hell's door
Knock knock
I'm on the salt road non stop
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot
And the gust of a dry summer
Dirty water in the tap
I think I found my number in the sand
Right next to an empty can
Old number seven, Jack is back again
And the voice goes round and round
And I would take the bridge
But I can't forget the sound

London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found

Don’t jump, I just see, nah, took a swattin', then
Think while I jump back on the beat, like I need audiences
To speak too like a leech, needs to retrieve blood
Should I creep into these ambient sounds with the speech? Obvious
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy, that's several pauses
You might need a coffin with holes on the top of these tubes to receive oxygen
You buried alive like a freak, six feet
Clawing and snatching and clawin' like a cat
And a dog and a rat
And a hog in a pen
With a frog and all there is to eat
Is frog and they
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth and jaws and then
They fight to the death for at least a piece off of them
See that you back to bars again, he's all asleep in coffin, man
I’m all, they all that’s been, ever was at the start of it
You mention the squad and then
You mention the god of pens
Not of it, but I'm harder then
Flesh I’m harder than titanium brass plates that are polished in
Sticking emcees off like a fly trap, or a bobby pin
When I rap I’m astonishing
I attack tracks like a train track strapped to a bomb and send
Shockwave’s that's what I made, got this bastard popping then
I spit on my pop's grave without apologin'
Take shits on shih tzus
Pisses on igloos
Throw it up to the whole fucking world, it's sick too
Vomitin' stomach fluid like you just ate shit stew
Did I say shit again? Do I give a shit, dude?

Full of tears, full of war
I was a plowman and worked from the earth up
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs

Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl (like a failed man I worked from the earth up)
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl ('cause your world is the same as mine)

Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
The flavour of an ill-mannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though that’s why they live a lie
I don’t think I’ll ever win
All of this is anything
When I die I hope a brother’s at my side
There’s no trap door, or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
You’ve seen mine, I think it’s time I see yours
I bet you that we’ve been scarred by the same swords
So we are not so unalike
Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now i’m trapped in it
The way I feel within a few years time
I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics

Outside in the cold distance

Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I ain’t religious i’m a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
I’ve been a joker, I’ve been a thief, I’ve been a rapper
I’ve been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter

Said the joker to the thief, yeah
There’s too much confusion
Mmm I can’t get no relief

Business men, they drink my wine
Plowman dig my earth
None were level on the mind
No one up at his word

Yeah, I see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
You’d find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But I’m still showing signs all attributed to mine
In the pitch black, it’s too cold
I’m all alone take me back to the roads I had to roam to get here and I’ll hitch back
Get a cab to my mother’s house see my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
What’s a brother for?

Ed Sheeran,"Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's son

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn over
The mountain side

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall in
Surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on

I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire

Burning the trees

From where I stand on the top floor
But I'm not sure if I'm dead
I raise my hands to the clouds
To check if heaven is with me now
Cause the devil's in my bed
And she won't love me like she could
She won't hold me like you would

I bid this city goodnight
And colored street lamps spark my eyes
When it's quiet I'll go
And say my sweetest goodbye
Under billboards of fast food and mobile phones
Cause they won't treat me like they should
Cause they don't need me like you would

My lonely heart is beating so
Tired of the wonder

There's a sign ahead

And yonder lies my sleeping soul
By the branches broke like bones
Well, this weakened tree no longer holds

Well, the night is still
And I have not yet lost my will
Oh and I will keep on moving 'till

Ed Sheeran,"Give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone

As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

Give me that late 80's early 90's old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that O.G.
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past, what's up

As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want it (Eh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past, what's up

As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If your life like Christ live your midlife like it's Christ-like
But nigga' I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school, what's up

Give me that old school love right now
I'm leaving it all up to you darling,
Giving you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone

As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

As long as you love me

I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now

And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall painted blue
But I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you

And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies the beautiful kind
Making up for lost time, taking flight, making me feel like

Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin'
On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, love to vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left

I met this girl late last year
She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later and returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, but guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows

I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand

Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers

Has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type

And they're wondering if there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like, ""Naturally, baby, let me find a spot in the front""
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, but we can pretend, oh
Typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to Paula my patent young
Prince of Manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien Broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and Revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is Yeezus
One for the money, two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold, and not everybody is winning I'm
Larry David plus Miles Davis

If you were here,
I'd sing to you
You're on the other side

I'm miles away from seeing you
I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them, too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing 'Chasing Cars'
And I thought of us
Back to the time,
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars?
Over Amsterdam
You're the song my heart is
Beating to

'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart hold on

Live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart hold on",Even My Dad Does Sometimes,2014
Ed Sheeran,"Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

And my father told me, son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside, a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh

And things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie standin' in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Six years old I remember when

And my father told me, son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say

Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I’ve been sitting here for ages
Ripping out pages
How'd I get so faded
How'd I get so faded
Oh no no don’t leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh color crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well tell when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God make me another one
I’ll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I’ve done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon her broken hearted dove
Oh no no don’t leave me lonely now

Ed Sheeran,"I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you can swing by my room around ten
Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
Well be in between the sheets 'till the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
She's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what its about
Maybe well go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out
Why I'm sat here singing

Don't  with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told you
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize that you want it
It's a bit too much too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love

Ed Sheeran,"Oh I’m a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end

I can’t work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us

And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
When you’re on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
No, easy baby, maybe I’m a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can’t shake this feeling now
We’re going through the motions
Hoping you'd stop

And oh, I’ve only caused you pain, you know
With all of my words, always beloved
Of all the lies spoke
When you’re on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
No, easy baby, maybe I’m a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I love my lover
For how long I love my lover
And now, now, for how long, long I love my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover

Ed Sheeran,"Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm twenty seven, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore",The Man,2014
Ed Sheeran,"I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play the guitar
Just like ringing the bells
Sometimes I wonder
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And read stacks while the speakers play
I’ll be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high, two cars, we needed to breathe
We used each other’s edge just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And also you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry about your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time’s the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'mma wait too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain’t never coming home
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
'Cause that’s you and me
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You’d be wearing my hood
With jewels, strings pulled tight
To keep your face in the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we D on the road
'Cause every day when I was a baby
Don’t you speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
And if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish
Back to burrow all of the ‘queltics’ are disappearing
You call me selfish, I don’t understand
But I can’t help it
I put my trouble for everything
Except my family and friends
But you’ll be in between forever
So I guess we’ll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I’m not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain
Or wait to get on the plane
But in the day we’ll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain’t never coming home
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
'Cause that’s you and me
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won’t you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, oh won’t you leave me now

Oh Nina (Love will come and love will go)
You should go Nina (But you can make it on your own)

Cold as stone, and the kitchen lie

Could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us the same
To get the good nose up

Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces, and hold that

Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local raid, no
I don’t really know what I’m supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told them my name and said it’s nice to meet ya
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she’s a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I’m in deep

Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it, oh

Ed Sheeran,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh

Ed Sheeran,"It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star
And thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here,
I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them, too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing 'Chasing Cars'
And I thought of us
Back to the time,
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars?
Over Amsterdam
You're the song my heart is
Beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And, oh, I know
And oh, I know, oh
I can see the stars

Even my dad does sometimes
So don’t wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you’re alive
It’s alright to die
'Cause death’s the only thing you haven’t tried
But just for tonight hold on

So live life like you’re giving all
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It’s alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage
Against the dying of the light
It’s alright to say that death’s the only thing you haven’t tried

Ed Sheeran,"Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's son

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out for the rope, sent by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out for the rope
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
And I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

Oh, should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
And I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
And I see fire, blood in the breeze

Ed Sheeran,"I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You'll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya and you'll think of him
And pretty soon you'll be floating away

And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss, bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make up
I'll never trust you again
You can just be a friend

And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes

Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact is I
I'm on my way home
I'm on my way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm, I'm drowning in the oceans you made

Ed Sheeran,"I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten
Because plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you over
Like your stepfather
I do my own thing now, and get respect after
And I'm avoiding cocaine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old, yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at the subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I'll take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring 'em to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit
They try and take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens is from now on
I'll be ready to start again at the end of the song
Still their claiming that I handled it wrong
But then I never had an enemy, except for NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
I'm healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses
Rubber dinghy rapids
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on passioning magic
I'm battling for respect
I don't know if I'll have it
This songs from the heart
Cover the planet
I'll take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Take it back now
Now I don't ever want to be perfect
Cause I'm a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone has to win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart break
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again
Living life on the edge
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible
Achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
You'll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love

And let lightning be the veins

So fill to me the parting glass

And of all the comrades that e'er I had 
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had

But since it calls unto my lot 
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call 
Goodnight and joy be with you all

A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl 
And perhaps be welcomed back again

By the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams

But I'd long to be
In the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
She's waiting for me

So I'll make my way 
Through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose

I told my dad 
On the phone it's amazing
From the street to the craziest places I've seen

But I'd long to be
In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother
He understands me

I spend my days
Just travelling and playing shows
But my heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose

I met a man 
In the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me ""son
You know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea""

And I found truth 
In people I barely know
But my heart still beats

And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier,
Remember that with every piece of you

With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left

I met this girl late last year
She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later and returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, but guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe",Don't [Rick Ross Remix],2015

Calling it over thinking of your sleep
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream

I saw a young G sitting on the wall
Had a gun in his bag on the way from school
I told him, ""If you get life you're a fool""
Then he said something that stuck with me
He said, ""I'd rather do life, than have none at all""
He said, ""Krept, you made it out fam, you're cool""
He said ""Me, I slip once, then I'm through
You'd do the same if you was in my shoes""
I said, ""Bro, I'm just tryna keep you alive
I'm sick of funerals, another suit and tie
How do you expect me to tell a young G
Put down the guns? That could be suicide
For him it's kill or be killed, fam it's do or die
He said, ""Krept, I don't even like this stuff
But I'm in too deep, fam, I'm kinda fucked
I can't think straight when man are tryna line me up""
Just visited my boy today doing life for a crime where he didn't do shit
He said, ""Krept, what's good, how's the music?""
Didn't wanna gass it up too much
You know he's stuck doing life, he might lose it
Wishing he was out living life for the movement
When the MOBOs said we were the winners, he told the whole jail ""Brap, that's my niggas""
Happy but heartbroken at the same time cause he knows he would have been on the stage with us
Man this cold world could be so vicious
Put your hands together and pray with us
Need to see my family more
So busy that they probably think that I don't love 'em
Probably telling people I forgot about my cousins
He's gone to Hollywood now, man so fuck him
Man I'm stuck

Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Calling it over thinking of your sleep
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream
Caught up in the same things it's giving me life
One can dream
My mind will erase these memories, say goodbye

In New York I met my big sis for the first time (first time), imagine that
I'm 24, it's the first time she sees me
Before he died, promised dad that she'd meet me
I know it ain't been easy, and I can't stay for the whole night
She hugged me with tears in her eyes
And said she wished that he still was alive (alive)
She said, your mum sent you Jamaica (Jamaica)
She told me you came back ill (back ill)
Yeah I know you ain't been back still
But you know your friend over there got killed (got killed, killed)
I know she always had love for me (love for me)
Then she said something that stuck with me (stuck with me)
""Dad said you gotta keep the music alive""
Then she gave the the look like it's up to me (up to me, up to me)
It hit me hard, didn't show it though
Thinking 'bout it on the plane, going home (going home)
Growing up without my dad ever round
It's on me and I can't let him down (let him down, let him down)
Before I stepped out the house
My niece said ""Make sure you come back again""
Then I started thinking 'bout the hearts that I broke
Praying that the karma don't come back on them (on them, on them)
We spoke about everything (everything)
And how his wife's tryna take everything (everything, everything)
All the inheritance (inheritance)
All because he gave her a wedding ring
So God forgive me for the minor things
Cause you'll risk everything when you're tryna win
And I can't go back, but the more I move forward
The more I start losing the sight of things

Ed Sheeran,"They say boys don't cry
But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
'Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I've got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken, been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Get back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest A Raisin in the Sun
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

I recommend that you read The Alchemist
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up,do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid,jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, 'cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb

I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends

But I was younger then, take me back to when

Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat

Ed Sheeran,"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I find another use of key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher

Ed Sheeran,"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

I meet her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me, ""What does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?""
Said, ""It was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?""
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding as a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway girl
You're my pretty little Galway girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Kaleigh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night

I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart

Saw you walk inside a bar

I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

You should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pot hole, every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip

Unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near

You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell, fill my lungs
Spent my summer time beside her
And the rest of the year the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame
Oh roses roses laid upon your bed spread
Oh my, hold this, oh this, I know

That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear

The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night that will safely guide me home

And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we should not ask but

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer, as the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms round you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon

Ed Sheeran,"I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya

On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border

She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, met her at Guy's in the second world war
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her

Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya

From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears both shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet at watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand

But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says, chune, boy never light up the room
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisp, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved

When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave

Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song

Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
You're home

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit (Fuck!)

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run",River,2017

I've gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape

And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you've finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done

Ed Sheeran,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me and I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
This old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

I'm in a G5
Come to the A side
I got a bad boy persona that's what they like
You love it
I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

Reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we don't do it for long
And you understand the good and bad, end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes, and made some choices that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the fourth of July
I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say

I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just anther ex-love (You don't wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all

They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see

Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine [Take 1],2002

Nowadays we often gaze 
On women over fifty
Without the slightest trace 
Of wrinkles on their face
Doctors go and take their dough 
To make them young and nifty
But Doctors I defy
To tell me just why
No matter how young a prune may be
It's always full of wrinkles
We may get them on our face
Prunes get 'em every place
Prohibition worries us
But prunes don't sit and brood
For no matter how young a prune may be
It's always getting stewed

In the kingdom of the fruits
The prune is snubbed by others
And they are not allowed
To mingle with the crowd
Though they're never on display
With all their highbrow brothers
They never seem to mind
To this fact they're resigned
That no matter how young a prune may be
It's always full of wrinkles
Beauty treatments always fail
They've tried all to no avail
Other fruits are envious
Because they know real well
That no matter how young a prune may be
Hot water makes 'em swell

Baby prunes look like their dad
But not wrinkled quite as bad

Every day in every way
The world is getting better
We've even learned to fly
As days go passing by
But how about the poor old prune
His life is only wetter
No wonder he can't win
In the awful stew he's in
No matter how young a prune may be
He's always full of wrinkles
We may get them on our face
Prunes get 'em every place
Nothing ever worries them
Their life's an open book
But no matter how young a prune may be
It has a worried look

Prunes act very kind they say
When sickly people moan
But no matter how young a prune may be
It has a heart of stone",The Song of the Prune,2003

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

And then catch it
Somebody throws a baby

Do a spin move and catch it

And the crowd goes crazy

That's quicker

I love most brothers but someone told me that I burn bridges
I simply use a rapper's bones to build to build my third niche
I work with the aesthetic of a brain medic
Cutting up the reels with crystal shards to make the tape edit
I take lettuce, onions, tomatoe
Add a dab of mayo plus the fish fillet-o
Appetizing gray matter with a strange platter
The symmetry of energy with chemistry and plasma
After you latch on to lost masters
Come back to re-evaluate the now chapter
Style masters born to make classics
And paint canvas geometric break dances

The flames of magma rivers in Niagara

Eddi Reader,"Galileo fell in love
As a Galilean boy
And he wondered what in heavens
Who'd invented such a joy.

Of his scientific mind
And to his blind and dying day

Who puts the rainbows in the sky?
Who lights the stars at night?
Who dreamt up someone so divine
Someone like you who made them mine?

Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then

But just remember the alternative
For I remember when

I was lonely and unhappy
And my lips were cold as ice
Still you kissed me
And good heavens
Now I'm here in paradise
So if ever I'm not kissing you or
Looking in your eyes
I won't be blind
And I won't cry

Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""
""Still"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body!""
""Lord!"" she said"" ""Casey it's a shame to be alone!""",Casey's Last Ride,1983
Eddie Adcock,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",Wild Side of Life,1983

Eddie Adcock,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart

What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk.
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled, may relax on an old fashioned walk.

There's nothing like walking and having a ""heart to heart.""

Everybody there thought she danced so great; 
I realized a thing or two, 
When I got wise to something new: 

When I looked at Kate, she was in a trance, 
And then I knew it was in her dance; 
All the boys are going wild 
Over sister Katie's style. 

Oh, I wish I could I shimmy like my sister Kate; 
She shimmies like a jelly on a plate. 
My mama wanted to know last night, 
What makes the boys think Kate's so nice. 

Now all the boys in the neighborhood, 
They know that she can shimmy and it's understood; 
I know that I'm late, but I'll be up-to-date 
When I shimmy like my sister Kate. 
I mean, when I shimmy like my sister Kate. 

Now I can shimmy like my sister Kate, 
I know that I'm real late,

Eddie Butler & Nev. Byrne & The King Pins,"My Fine feathered friend with your cute little pranks,
I would like to express my thanks
I trusted you implicitly
But What a double-crosser you turned out to be

Stupid Cupid You're a real mean guy 
I'd like to clip your wings so you can't fly 
I'm in love and it's a crying shame 
and I know that you're the one to blame 
Hey Hey Set me Free 
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me

I can't do my homework and I can't think straight 
I meet her every morning bout half past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool 
You've even got me carrying your books to school 
Hey Hey Set me Free 
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me 

You messed me up for good right from the very start 
Hey now, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart 
You got me jumping like a crazy clown
and I don't feature what your putting down 
Well since I kissed her loving lips of wine 
the thing that bothers me is that I like it fine
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me
Hey Hey set me free

Eddie Calhoun,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2012
Eddie Calhoun,"Dancing in the dark 
Till the tune ends,
We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends,
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here,
Time hurries by, we're here and gone;

Looking for the light of a new love,
To brighten up the night, I have you love,
And we can face the music together,
Dancing in the dark.",Dancing in the Dark,2012
Eddie Calvert,"It's cherry pink and apple blossom white
 When your true lover comes your way 
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white 
The poets say 
The story goes that once a cherry tree 
Beside an apple tree did grow 
And there a boy once met his bride to be
Long long ago 
The boy looked into her eyes, it was a sight to enthrall 
The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall 
And as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find 
The branches of the two trees were intertwined 
And that is why the poets always write 
If there's a new moon bright above 
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white 
When you're in love",Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White,1998
Eddie Calvert,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,2002
Eddie Calvert,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from

Eddie Calvert,"Just got back from Paris France
All they do is sing and dance
All they got is romance
What a tragedy

Every boulevard has lovers
Every lover's in a trance
The poor people of Paris
I feel sorry for the French

Every guy has got a wench
Every couple's got a bench kissing shamelessly
Night and day they're making music
While they're making love in French

The poor people of Paris
Milk or water from a sink
Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink

And it worries me
For with wine as cheap as water
Oh it makes one stop and think
The poor people of Paris

Sister Madam Pierre
Had the craziest love affair
And the day after they parted there
He cries bitterly

Pierre was there to bid her farewell
But he brought his new girl Claire
The poor people of Paris
So don't go to Paris France

Not unless you like to dance
Not unless you want romance
Like those poor inhabitants of Paris

[Spoken] 
In the meantime, I got to hurry back there
I think I forgot something...",The Poor People of Paris,2002
Eddie Calvert,"Why do I love you I love you not only for what you are
But for what I am when I'm with you
I love you not only for what you've made of yourself
But for what you're making of me
I love you for ignoring the possibilities of the fool in me
And for laying firm hold of the possibilities for good in me
Why do I love you I love you for closing your eyes to the dischords
And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening
I love you because you're helping to make of the lumber of my life
Not a tavern but a temple
And out of the words of my everyday not a reproach but a song
I love you because you have done more than any creed to make me happy
You have done it without a word without a touch without a sign
You have done it just by being yourself and after all perhaps that's what love means",Why Do I Love You?,2002
Eddie Calvert,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2006
Eddie Calvert,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Eddie Calvert,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,2009
Eddie Calvert,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.

""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,
Eddie Cano,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1992
Eddie Cano,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,1992
