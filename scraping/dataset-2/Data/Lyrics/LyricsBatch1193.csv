Thom Yorke,"Open again
We breathe again
Upon another shore
Washed up
We live again
Just sing again
Just say the magic words
Open again
We live again",Open Again,2018
Thom Yorke,"This is a waltz thinking about our bodies
What they mean for our salvation
With only the clothes that we stand up in
Just the ground on which we stand
Is the darkness ours to take?
Bathed in lightness, bathed in heat

All is well, as long as we keep spinning
Here and now, dancing behind a wall
When the old songs and laughter we do
Are forgiven always and never been true

When I arrive, will you come and find me?
Or in a crowd, be one of them?
Wore the wrong sign back beside her
Know tomorrow's at peace",Suspirium,2018

Thom Yorke,"I've turned, turned
All broken, my bones
I'm sorry, must go
Some water, some water
I walk in willows, the willows
Somehow I go where I don't know
To where I don't know
To walk in sorrow and shame
A knife is buried",The Universe Is Indifferent,2018
Thom Yorke,"Come under my wings, little bird
Come under my wings, little bird
Come under my wings

Unmade, unmade
I swear that there's nothing up my sleeves
And then back again
I swear there's nothing
Unmade

There's no faces
Won't grow back again
Broken pieces
Unmade

I swear there's nothing
Won't grow back again
I swear there's nothing
Come under my wings
Come under my wings
Come under my wings

Thomas,"Odio tante cose da quando ti conosco 
E non ne conosco neanche il perché
Ma lo intuisco 
Odio il mio nome solo senza il tuo 
Ogni fottuto addio 
Io odio quando ti odi e mi allontani perché

Hai delle isole negli occhi 
E il dolore più profondo 
Riposa almeno un'ora solo se ti incontro 

E ti A-M-O e con le mani dico quello che non so 
E tu mi ami 
Trama sintetica di una giornata storica 

E tutto è perfetto 
Tutto somiglia a te 
E un anno va bellissimo 
Bellissimo così com'è 

Sei più forte di ogni bugia 
Se la gente ferisce 
È perchè tu sei migliore e lo capisce bene
La tua timidezza non condanna, no 
Ma ti eleva da chi odia, chi ferisce e inganna 

Hai delle isole negli occhi 
E il dolore più profondo 
Riposa almeno un'ora solo se ti incontro 

E ti A-M-O e con le mani dico quello che non so 
E tu mi ami 
Trama sintetica di una giornata storica 

E tutto è perfetto 
Tutto somiglia a te 
E un anno va bellissimo 
Bellissimo così com'è 

Io non mento non importa cosa dicono 
Nel silenzio guardo le anime che passano 
Di queste anime tu sei la più speciale 
Perché sorridi anche inseguita dal dolore 
E ti A-M-O
Anche se soffri e poi pretendi non si veda 
Quando vorresti che il sorriso tuo invertisse 
La controregola che regola le masse 
E tu mi ami 
Dici che esistono solo persone buone 
Quelle cattive sono solamente sole 
E forse è così 

Hai delle isole negli occhi 
E il dolore più profondo 
Riposa almeno un'ora solo se ti incontro 

E ti A-M-O e con le mani dico quello che non so 
E tu mi ami 
Trama sintetica di una giornata storica 

Hai delle isole negli occhi 
E il dolore più profondo 
Riposa almeno un'ora solo se ti incontro 

E ti A-M-O e con le mani dico quello che non so

Thomas,"A long time ago when we met you were lonely. 
I helped you forget life was solely 
Only a wish to survive 
And blood flows much thicker than wine. 
Friends who give up their time to be near you, 
Sing you a song just to cheer you, 
You will be rich in the end, 
Brother now you've got a friend. 
Life hurries by in the wink of an eye 
Almost without meaning. 
Days speeding past, like the wind, hard to grasp. 
No wonder you're bleeding. 
Friendship is needed today 
Or tomorrow is empty and we need each other; please stay 
For our only hope is together. 
We'll live in much calmer weather 
And we'll make a beautiful blend,

Thomas,"Ora che il tempo porta l’estate
Ed ogni giorno dura sempre di più
Vorrei andarmene da qui ma dove
Dov’è che vado se non ci sei tu
È naturale come respirare
Come il passare lento delle ore
Volerti sempre più vicino e senza niente a cui pensare
Ti rincorro tra le luci, tra le voci
Nelle tasche una tua foto e mille sogni infranti
Sono qui di fronte a te mi guardi e non mi dici
Perché non mi vuoi più

Se ne vanno i giorni, conto i secondi
Tutto passa in fretta, tu non passi
Tu non te ne vai mai
No, non te ne vai mai
Come un tatuaggio sopra la pelle
Come un desiderio tra le stelle
Tu non te ne vai mai
No, non te ne vai mai

E lo so che a volte può far male
Dormire con la testa sul tuo cuore
È come volare intorno al sole
Ci si può bruciare
È forse vero che devi cadere
Se davvero poi ti vuoi rialzare
Guardo i tuoi occhi prima di partire, vorrei già tornare

Via lontano dalle luci e dalle voci
Nelle tasche ho ancora quella foto di Parigi
Sull’ultimo treno che mi porta via da noi
Per non tornare più

Se ne vanno i giorni, conto i secondi
Tutto passa in fretta, tu non passi
Tu non te ne vai mai
No, non te ne vai mai
Come un tatuaggio sopra la pelle
Come un desiderio tra le stelle
Tu non te ne vai mai
No, non te ne vai mai

Thomas & Friends,"Thrills and spills on the railway, it's a life of happiness
But sometimes impatience can lead to carelessness
Some think they are smart cats, and some just know it all
But sooner or later we all find out that

Accidents happen now and again, just when you least expect
Just when you think that life is okay, fate comes to collect
Accidents happen now and again, when people or trains get smart
If you don't concentrate on the thing that you're doing
Accidents will happen, just like that

Your best-laid plans can turn upside down if you get too confident
Sometimes you will slip and slide if that's Lady Luck's intent
One minute you're riding high, the next you're on the ground
But please remember, whatever the weather
You must take care 'cause

Accidents happen now and again, sometimes just by chance
You gotta pick yourself up and dust yourself down
Put it down to experience
Accidents happen now and again
Just don't take it all to heart
If you don't concentrate on the thing that you're doing
Accidents will happen, just like that

The warning signs are there for us to see most of the time
But sometimes we take chances and ignore the danger signs
Fate can surprise you, with no reason or rhyme
Make sure you learn your lesson you'll know better next time

Thomas Allen,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,

Thomas Allen,"Can't we two go walkin' together out beyond the valley of trees?
Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;
That when the mist is in gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill, 
The heather on the hill.

Thomas Allen,"Pack up all your things; I'll help; you'll leave today
We said we'd do it, and today's the day
Don't care how we tried; it's gone a thousand times
We'll make it through this, there's no other way

If I'm the first and I'm the only, promise me I'll never be lonely
But only for as long as we believe

We placed all our faith in sex
And we broke it all, and now there's nothing left
Of my little world of make-believe

Messed up everything, all set to wash away
And, now, I'm through living as a criminal
No time for sentiment, just time to pay the rent
But maybe I'm not ready to grow up today

If I'm the first and I'm the only, promise me I'll never be lonely
But only for as long as we believe

We placed all our faith in sex
And we broke it all, and now there's nothing left
Of my little world of make-believe

I'm not ready to be thirty-two
And can't I just stay a while inside with you?
Far from the compromise and shifty eyes and dirt
I'm not ready to be thirty-two
But I can't stay forever young with you
Slam the door on my mixed-up ways
I can't live my life like I'm in sixth grade
In my little world of make-believe

Guess that's everything; I'll watch you drive away
Here's all your pictures, and here's most of mine
But I loved you more than this; I lived for your sweet kiss
You watched me grind away, and I watched you fade away

We placed all our faith in sex
And we broke it all, and now there's nothing left

Thomas Allen,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine

I'm looking for you 
Drifting on a memory 
Ain't no place I'd rather be 
Than with you, loving you 
Day will make a way for night

And a song soft and long, well 
Glad to be here alone 
With a lover unlike no other 
Safe to see a new horizon 
Slowly coming into view 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 

Lovely as a ray of sun 
That touches me when the morning comes 
Feels good to me, my love and me 
Smoother than a gentle breeze 
Flowing through my mind with ease 
Soft as can be well when you're loving me

Enchanted with your touch It seems to me 
We can sail together in and out of mystery

Can't feel insecure again 
You're the key and this I see

What I feel yeah love is real 
Ooh I might as well 
Sign my name on a card 
Which could say it better

You told me that the first day we met. I didn't understand.

Beneath the broad-beamed boughs, your love changed: a slow coming apart.
You moved on and I stayed the same. I was trailing from the start.

We laid long in the tall grass. We loved for the joy of love itself.
We threw our pennies in the fountain and we wished for nothing else. 
And we wished for nothing else.

And through the crossbeams whispers were heard: undoing in every line.
And in the fall you flew little bird but I'll see you when it's time.

We threw our pennies in the fountain and we wished for nothing else.

We're so ingenious we can walk the moon

Thomas Borchert,"Endlich Nacht, kein Stern zu sehen
Der Mond versteckt sich, denn ihm graut vor mir
Kein Licht im Weltenmeer
Kein falscher Hoffnungsstrahl, nur die Stille
Und in mir die Schattenbilder meiner Qual

Das Korn war golden und der Himmel klar
1617, als es Sommer war
Wir lagen im flüsternden Gras
Ihre Hand auf meiner Haut war zärtlich und warm
Sie ahnten nicht, dass ich verloren bin
Ich glaubte ja noch selbst daran, dass ich gewinn
Doch an diesem Tag geschah's zum erstenmal
Sie starb in meinem Arm

Wie immer wenn ich nach dem Leben griff, blieb nichts in meiner Hand
Ich möchte Flamme sein und Asche werden und hab noch nie gebrannt
Ich will hoch und höher steigen
Und sinke immer tiefer ins Nichts
Ich will ein Engel oder ein Teufel sein
Und bin doch nichts als eine Kreatur
Die immer das will, was sie nicht kriegt
Gäb's nur einen Augenblick des Glücks für mich, nähm ich ewiges Leid in Kauf
Doch alle Hoffnung ist vergebens, denn der Hunger hört nie auf

Des Pastors Tochter ließ mich ein bei Nacht
1730 nach der Maiandacht
Mit ihrem Herzblut schrieb ich ein Gedicht auf ihre weiße Haut
Und des Kaisers Page aus Napoleons Tross
1813 stand er vor dem Schloss
Dass seine Trauer mir das Herz nicht brach, kann ich mir nicht verzeihen

Doch immer wenn ich nach dem Leben greif, spür ich, wie es zerbricht
Ich will die Welt verstehen und alles wissen und kenn mich selber nicht
Ich will frei und freier werden, und werde meine Ketten nicht los
Ich will ein Heiliger oder ein Verbrecher sein
Und bin doch nichts als eine Kreatur, die will was sie nicht kriegt
Die zerreißen muss, was immer sie liebt
Jeder glaubt, dass alles einmal besser wird
Drum nimmt er das Leid in Kauf
Ich will endlich einmal satt sein, doch der Hunger hört nie auf 

Manche glauben an die Menschheit, und manche an Geld und Ruhm
Andere glauben an Kunst und Wissenschaft, an Liebe und an Heldentum
Viele glauben an Götter verschiedenster Art
An Wunder und Zeichen, an Himmel und Hölle
An Sünde und Tugend und an Bibel und Brevier
Doch die wahre Macht, die uns regiert
Ist die schändliche, unendliche, verzehrende, zerstörende
Und ewig unstillbare Gier

Euch Sterblichen von morgen, prophezeih' ich heut und hier
Noch bevor euer nächste Jahrtausend beginnt
Ist der einzige Gott, dem jeder dient
Die unstillbare Gier",Die unstillbare Gier,2018

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Thomas Clausen,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",Someday My Prince Will Come,1998

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2007
Thomas Clausen Trio,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Wie ein Feuer, daß entfacht hast do es über mich gebracht
Wir hatten beide diese Nacht, doch nun hör' ich dich sagen
Es ist aus und mein Herz zerbricht, ich steh' neben mir, ich glaub' es einfach nicht
Doch es ist war, do weichst meinen Blicken aus und will ich mit dir reden redest do dich raus
Und ich weiß, wenn ich dich anseh' kann ich nicht in dich reinsehen und ich muß einsehen
Do willst den Weg jetzt allein gehen und ich weiß kein Flehen hält dich davon ab
Und ich weiß nicht, ob ich dich je um was gebeten hab' doch hätt' ich einen Wunsch freijetzt und hier, würd' ich mir wünschen Baby do wärst bei mir.

Do hast mein Herz geklaut,
Ich weiß nicht ob do's gewußt hast,
Do Schuft hast es getan,
Hab' Dich geliebt, als ob es kein Morgen gibt,
Bis der Morgen kam;
Ich seh' die Straße in der do wohnst, fahre durch die Stadtzu dem Laden, in dem wir uns getroffen haben und der Fadender Erinnerung schmerzt mit jedem Stich,die Wunden heilen nicht,große Mädchen weinen nicht,die andern scheinen nicht zu verstehen,daß wir jetzt eigne Wege gehensie Fragen mich nach dir, wenn sie mich sehen
Ich hatte dich schon vermißt, bevor ich wußte, daß Schluß ist
Für all die andern war das Ende fern wir warn ein Paardu warst mein Stern, ich war dein Star
Ich hatte dich mehr als gern, mir wurde nur zu spät klar,
Daß do anders geworden bist und dein Erfolg für uns zum Mißerfolg geworden ist
Den Himmel, den do mir versprachst hast do mir nie gegeben
Und deine wundervolle Welt blieb an dir kleben
Jetzt wart ich auf die Zeit die meine Wunden heilt,
Während mein Kopf und mein Herz bei die verweilt.
Refrain
Ich hab' es dir erlaubt, hab dir vertraut hab an uns geglaubt,es war nicht schwer, hast mir gesagt, daß deine Liebe ewig wär,
Hast mir mein Herz ausgeraubt, jetzt ist es leer
Es zerbrach und das größere Stück ist bei dir, doch do bist nicht hier
Ich hab' mich leergeliebt, es tut mir sehr weh,doch mich ohne dich zu spüren tut noch mehr weh
Ich mach' dir keinen Vorwurf daraus, daß Gefühle vergehen,ich weiß, wir konnten den Test der Zeit nicht bestehen
Doch es macht keinen Sinn, daß do daß Feld räumst,wenn do dich Nacht für Nacht in meine Welt träumst
Ich fühle mich tot, tief in mir drinund nur der Schmerz läßt mich wissen, daß ich am Leben bin
Und jetzt liege ich da verletzt und alles tut mir weh,
Dafür hass' ich dich jetzt, weil ich dich liebe

Thomas D,"Und wie oft hast do schon die Nacht mit einem Helden verbracht
Und bist am naechsten Morgen neben dem Teufel erwacht
Ich stand am Rand deines Bettes und war ziemlich verranzt
Doch hatte laengst meinen Samen in dein Hirn gepflanzt
Mein Bewusstsein blieb am Schweben und mit jedem Atemzug
Kontrolliere meinen Flug
Krieg ich vom Leben nicht genug
Wundervoller Augenblick,
Verharrte einen Moment
Der die Schoenheit Deiner Welt durch meine Augen schickt
Und dennoch zieht mich mein Weg weiter
Und Dich von mir weg
Do vergraebst, was war
Ich frag mich jeden Tag, wirst do mir jemals vergeben
Unter Deinem toten Haar
Das hier geht an alle, die mir ihre Liebe gaben
Do bist bei mir - uns trennt das Leben

Es war schoen, ein Stueck davon gehabt zu haben
Es ist schoen, dass es euch gibt.. ja
Das geht raus an alle Leute, die ich geliebt
Das hier geht an jeden, der mir zu nahe stand
Und von mir verletzt wurde durch das, was uns verband
Jetzt trennt uns das Leben und doch -
Ich lieb Dich immer noch

Ich war die Zukunft fuer Dich, doch das ist jetzt Vergangenheit
Und ich schaetze ein ""Es tut mir leid"" tut's nicht mehr
Do warst so voller Erwartung
Ich war so leer
Do hingst zu sehr an mir, wir wurden zu schwer
Ich liess ein paar Federn, es half sicher nicht
Ich schrieb ""Liebe Dich!""
Und ich Liebe Dich
Ich werde meinem Karma folgen, ich kann in die Zukunft sehen
Lass es Dich nicht zerstoeren, lass uns auf die Liebe schwoeren
Schick die Daemonen in die Hoelle, wo sie hingehoeren
I'm glauben daran, dass nichts bliebe -
Ohne die Liebe

Das hier geht an alle, die mir ihre Liebe gaben
Es war schoen, ein Stueck davon gehabt zu haben
Das geht raus an alle Leute, die ich geliebt
Und von mir verletzt wurde durch das, was uns verband
Es ist schoen, dass es euch gibt.. ja
Das hier geht an jeden, der mir zu nahe stand
Jetzt trennt uns das Leben und doch -
Ich lieb Dich immer noch

Das hier geht an alle, die mir ihre Liebe gaben

Jetzt trennt uns das Leben und doch -
Ich lieb Dich immer noch
Ich lieb Dich immer noch


Ich lieb Dich immer noch

Ich lieb Dich immer noch

Was wuerden wir erfahren, wenn wir alles vorher wuessten
Vielleicht brach ich dein Herz, als wir uns kuessten
Doch vielleicht bist es do, die unsrer Liebe diesen Tritt verpasst
Und vielleicht ist es ein Gesetz, dass es in Deinem Leben gibt
Wenn do bereust, dass do mich je getroffen hast
Dass man fuer jeden Tag I'm Himmel einen in der Hoelle kriegt
Doch es gibt alles I'm Leben nur einmal
Und zwar doppelt so sehr
Und wenn's nicht so waer, ich wuerd' Dich nochmal lieben

Das hier geht an alle, die mir ihre Liebe gaben

Thomas D,"Jetzt bist do weg, neben mir ein leerer Fleck
Auch ich bin leer und suchen hat keinen Zweck mehr
Denn da, wo früher Glück stand, hat der Schmerz sich breitgemacht
Ich war ... überrascht, fast schon böse über Nacht
Wie ein Feuer, daß entfacht hast do es über mich gebracht
Wir hatten beide diese Nacht, doch nun hör' ich dich sagen
Es ist aus und mein Herz zerbricht, ich steh' neben mir, ich glaub' es einfach nicht
Doch es ist war, do weichst meinen Blicken aus und will ich mit dir reden redest do dich raus
Und ich weiß, wenn ich dich anseh' kann ich nicht in dich reinsehen und ich muß einsehen
Do willst den Weg jetzt allein gehen und ich weiß kein Flehen hält dich davon ab
Und ich weiß nicht, ob ich dich je um was gebeten hab' doch hätt' ich einen Wunsch freijetzt und hier, würd' ich mir wünschen Baby do wärst bei mir.

Thomas D,"Die Sonne zieht an mir vorbei, obwohl sie eigentlich steht,
während die Welt an ihr vorbei so langsam untergeht.
Und wenn es dann dämmert und die Nacht erwacht,
Beginnt ein Untergang, der jedem Tag das Leben nimmt.
Was diese Welt am Tag verneint, lädt sie des Nachts ein
Und einer ihrer Schatten wird von mir gemacht sein.
Dunkle Seiten seiner Seele bietet jeder zum Tausch
Unter Menschen, die sich suchen und nichts finden als Rausch.
Die nach mir greifen und mitunter kriegen sie mich zu fassen,
zieh'n mich runter in den Bunker voller dunkler Grimassen.
Hier kann ich Grenzen überwinden und meine Seele verwetten
Oder einen Engel finden und mich retten.

Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier...
Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.

Kann dir die Möglichkeit, die Sonne nicht mehr aufgehn zu sehn,
einem die Lust am Leben nehmen?
Ich teil' mit jedem heute Nacht den Ballast und das Elend uns'rer Not
In der Angst vor dem Leben und dem Tod.
In diesem lebenslangen Kampf, der krank macht und Kraft raubt,
Häng ich an allem, was mich schwach macht und aussaugt.
Wehr' mich dagegen, anzunehmen, was weh tat
Und niemals zuzugeben, dass ich jemals falsch lag.
Doch wenn es wahr ist, dass man erst durch Fehler vollkommen wird
Und dass wer aus Angst am Leben hängt sich vollkommen irrt,
Dann ist der Schmerz loszulassen, wohl nichts gegen den Schmerz,
Wenn einem alles genommen wird.

Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.
Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.

In einer stürmischen Nacht erlöschen Träume wie Kerzenlicht
Und wer nicht von Herzen spricht, trägt einen Schmerz in sich,
Hüttet und versteckt ihn hinter tausend Ausreden.
Ich sollte beten, aber irgendwas spricht dagegen,
Ich will vergeben, denn der Zweifel ersticht mein Leben,
Ich kann nicht glauben, meine Liebe zerbricht am Ego.
Ich will vertrauen und ich weiß nicht mehr, wie das gehen soll,
Ich seh kein Morgengraun, nein, ich seh nur dichten Nebel.
Ich bin am Boden geknebelt und fast zu Tode getreten.
Doch hab nicht vor so zu enden, ich hab nicht vor, aufzugeben.
Ich werde dieses Leben ändern und ich werd's überleben,
Ein neuer Morgen wird kommen und er bringt Hoffnung für jeden,
Der neu geboren unter Schmerzen aus dem Koma erwacht,
Damit das Feuer des Herzens auf ein Neues entfacht.
Das hat das Leben jeden Tag in diesen Händen verbracht,
Damit das Licht der Nacht ein Ende macht.

Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.
Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.
Es liegt nur an dir.",Die Nacht...du Bist Nicht Allein,2006

Suddenly I noticed
Something that I'd never seen before

Now I see a million lights
Lighting up the darkest night
All play a part
Shadows depart
I'm starting to shine, starting to shine
Where it was dark inside
Now I got a million lights
Each little spark igniting my heart
A million lights, a million lights

Suddenly I'm falling
Falling to emotion
Falling like a raindrop from the stars
The sum of all the small things
Adds up to an ocean
And somehow makes us worth more than we are

Now I see a million lights
Lighting up the darkest night

I'm starting to shine, starting to shine
Where it was dark inside
Now I got a million lights

I didn't need it, must have been blind
Here I stand blinking
Caught in the brightness of a million lights

That triple octane won't
contain the empty feeling, in Dolby's heart...

Strap him into his carseat
And the sump started leaking

Not one drop to fill me.

Blueberry milkshake
Fistful of coldrex
Won't fix the empty feeling, in Lizzy's heart...

Takes in a movie
But all those memories
Won't erase the empty feeling, from in her heart...

She came for coffee
And stayed all night

Broke down every time I tried to smile
Broke down like the store of my life

Thomas Dolby,"N.E.O.


Near Earth Object.
A solid body whose orbit lies within the orbit of Mars.

Moons Asteroids. Meteorites.

And human debris.

You can see a meteorite almost any night.
Go out to the desert


They are pieces of stars,
You might find a piece.


Same as you and me


They have travelled through space for thousands of years.


Perhaps you will get lucky

but you will never find a piece of Soyuz

or Sputnik or Apollo 9
They are still out there



They are very faint
And the pollution in earths atmosphere

washes out their pale light




Floating without air, without light
Or else - charred on the re-entry

They are still out there floating


Within the orbit of Mars.


Look at it this way:

a river of space, a ribbon of time

like a burial by a beaurocrat

undercover of a cold war risk.

a cloud of dust-a cloud of rubble

spinning in space on the heels of the Hubble

a parallel, or a temporal rip

in the belly of the Cosmos

a fossilized finger
Somewhere in a hanger


Stored by the government, hidden from the press

some young top gun s first solo

turned out to be a N.E.O.

Thomas Dolby,"There are all kinds of things I could ask you if I choose
But I don't do I dear good intentions don't survive here
No instead my requests tend to be dumb as hell
Move in close, closer still, I hear the songs of Georgie Gershwin
I swear at you 'cause I believe that sweet talk like candy rots teeth

No Hallelujahs, or gifted voices
To sing your praises I'd be walking on wheels
No whoops or war cry's or caramias
All translations will read Marry me now
Well I sing to express my belief that sweet talk like candy rots teeth

With his hand on his heart, it's a posing place
While draining the mystery from your face
He admits all he's chasing is the chase
But you won't let him run
You make him suffer for all he's gone done
He'll still be hurting when the kingdom comes

Move in close till you see, he only wants what he can't have
So when he gets it he's good as bad
Move in close, closer still, I hear the songs of Georgie Gershwin
Oh Hallelujah, how I'm walking on wheels",Hallelujah,2012
Thomas Dolby,"It's me again your worthless friend or foe
I somehow let that lovely creature down
Horsin' around, horsin' around
Some things we check and double check and lose
I guess I let that little vow get lost
Forgettin' the cost, forgettin' the cost

Quick to forgive and so slow to blame, the very thought fills me with shame
But that didn't stop it happening

The thrill of it - can I call it that ? - was cheap
And feeling cheap's the only thing you keep
It's so unsightly to walk from her arms so lightly
Selling it all up the swanee

Horsin' around's a serious business, last thing you'd want somebody to witness
I was the fool who always presumed that I'd wear the shoes and you'd be the doormat
You wonder why my hands are still shaking : In need of a cry the shoulders are taken...

I deserve to be kicked so badly
You deserve more than I sold you for
Horsin' around, horsin' around

The moral is whatever else you learn
You shouldn't let that lovely creature down
Lord just blind me, don't let her innocent eyes remind me
Selling it all up the swanee
Horsin' around, horsin' around.

And aren't you proud, of all I've done 
But I'm turkey hungry, I'm chicken free, 
And I can't break dance on your knee

So watch me hawk eye, understand 
The force of will, the sleight of hand 
Movin' the river, 
I'm turkey hungry, I'm chicken free 
And I can't break dance on your knee

tout contribue à ce que nous passions d'agréables vacances

Oui vous vous rappelez ces cartes postales
Quand on était petit fallait toujours se forcer à les écrire
Il y avait (je t'embrasse bien fort)
Voilà fallait écrire notre tante notre grande-tante notre grand oncle
Et puis bah, ça nous barbait alors
Nos parents ils écrivaient la carte et on signaient en bas
Et puis maintenant le temps à passé
Quand on ouvre notre boîte aux lettres
C'est nous qui aimerions bien recevoir plus de cartes postales
Je me rappelle mon grand-père à la fin de sa vie, il avait 86 ans
Sa femme était morte.
Il rentrait tout seul il avait du mal à pousser la porte qui était assez lourde
Et puis il ouvrait sa boîte et dedans y avait des
Des conneries de serrurerie sur des prospectus des machins et puis
Je me suis dit putain je lui écrivait pas assez de carte
J'aurais voulu lui écrire pleins de cartes
Et voilà et le temps passe et bordel

Le temps passe toujours trop vite, hélas
Nos amis souvent, les plus chers les meilleurs
Sont partis
Sont loins
Sont malades, sont morts
Parfois dans la nuit on ne sait plus très bien qui on est
On ne sait plus où l'on va
Parfois l'angoisse nous prend le cœur
Parfois la personne qui dort à côté de nous est un étranger
Alors moi je sors
Et je me commande un steak frites
Un bon gros steak avec des frites bordel !
Y'en a marre de ce poisson grillé !
De ces haricots verts
A mort le haricot !
Vive la choucroute !
Un beau gros morceau viandes
Et des pommes de terre bien grasses
La révolution du saucisson est en marche !
Venez avec moi !
Vous roulez dans la paëlla !
Vous vautrez dans le couscous !

Aux ordures et à la poubelles ces omégas 3 !
On veut des graisses saturées !
Incluez ce régime !

Coupez les en fines lamelles

Je veux lever mon verre à m'en rouler par terre
Je rejoins l’imprévu, la folie et l'ivresse,
En chantant dans les rues j'oublie toutes mes promesses.

Demain j'arrêterai, demain je m'y mettrai.
J'fous rien au café en terrasse,
J'suis bien, je regarde la vie qui passe.

Et pourquoi faire aujourd'hui,
Ce que je pourrais faire demain.
Vive la vie. 
J'comprends plus très bien ! 
Alors j'appelle mes potes.
Ça te dirait qu'on sorte ? 
C'est ce soir, demain sera trop tard

A l'amour à la vie, au soleil et aux filles,
Je veux lever mon verre. 
Allez viens voir mon frère.
C'est pas que le paradis n'a pas tout pour nous plaire.
J'ai plus chaud en enfer, entouré de mes amis.

Je fais des économies. 
J' prévois le reste de ma vie.
Mutuelle et petit bas de laine
Mon Dieu que j'aime le système.

Demain sera merveilleux. 
J'aurai ma maison je serai heureux,
Mais j'serais vieux, et ça c'est ennuyeux.
Alors je te les laisse, ma place, mon chien, ma caisse.
Résolution, j' prends plus de résolution.

A l'été à la vie, au soleil et aux filles.
Viens donc lever ton verre, renversons les barrières.
Demain on s'ra tous frères. 
Demain il y aura plus de guerre.
On mangera à sa fin. En attendant je m'en sers un.

A l'amour à la vie, au soleil et aux filles,
Je veux lever mon verre et rêver devant la mer.",Demain,2011

Tricked around and messed around with
All for the sake of common good and glory

And the days grew darker
And longer and though my body prevailed
It sent shivers down my spine

Where death was the final punch line
That everybody waited for

And I intend to see this thing
Through to the end, my friend

Thomas George,"I ride the time, it unfolds a new day,
Another time, this world would fade away
To find true love, is like no other joy,
Our choice is here

Be happy for today, be happy for today
The passage won, could maim a loser's fate,
The bombs will run, I wish love could have its day
A heart that soars, above the worldly haze,
Has found the cure

Be happy for today, be happy for today
Be happy for today, be happy for today

Soldier of fortune, runs away,
To take up arms against his brother
When does this ever stop?
We're still in the playground
Except the toys are hurting us

You're waiting for it now
You're waiting for it now
Here it comes

So far to go, but we keep moving on
So far, keep moving on...",Today,1998

"Thomas Giles Rogers, Jr.","I thought it was strange when all this shot into my mind driving. 
It's weird how this enclosed space makes me think so clearly...so free! 
I wish 
all hours were so relaxing. 
Thinking of the next noise... making up the 
next noise. Scream loud, loud, loud, loud. Static intoxication, sing 
this lovely violin song. Beat this bottle on a wall. Scream, scream, 
scream. The baby cries. Record the noise. It all makes sense...we're 
capable of beauty. Through sounds which make one cringe. The dogs only 
hear us now. For the first time tears came to my eyes while I was 
listening. Noise brings so many things...make my tingling skin freeze. 
Turn me on, make me laugh, shoot the can, shut the door, pour your glass, 
rape scene scream, car crash bash, black cat splat. 
A silent death, a silent scream...You can't follow me, you sing along to 
nothing.",Ad A Dglgmut,2011
"Thomas Giles Rogers, Jr.","Decrease the light, increase the smiles...a familiar heat is swarming the 
air. Soothing movements that help the evening come to a halt. Lifetime 
achievement... the looks on their faces make it worthwhile. The swaying 
of the ocean, to the swaying of your hips...shivering as your lover's 
caress touches your lips. Perfect world and perfect lives, we have the 
soundtrack for their futures. The seawater smell in the cold outside 
world seems to be enchanting the room. The chatter of riches keeping the 
beat, as the sea seems to freeze. The brisk air seems to make our hearts 
colder. The dimming smiles seem to have halted with a silent scream. We 
must play on. The perfect life torn apart in a matter of seconds...I hear 
their streams and cries...I know now that I'm the only one who possesses 
true happiness. We must play on. The perfect life torn apart in a matter 
of seconds...I hear their screams and cries...I know now that I'm the only 
one who possesses true happiness. We must play on. Keep the beat, we tap 
our feet...screams add a new feel to what we've perfected so dear. We'll 
play to our deaths for we possess true happiness. We are finally free.

"Thomas Giles Rogers, Jr.","[Day one] Asleep mid-sentence- the words fell apart. No one is listening 
anyway. This day will soon turn black and my ""wants and needs"" will spill 
on my burning ashes. I learned to be selfish today...I learned to be 
alive. These things I care for are for my personal gain and my person 
happiness only. Why should I sit in your chairs and satisfy your 
standards. I've done it all before and I've confused myself a thousand 
times. The tragic day that I call morality just doesn't do it for me 
anymore. No more choices, just standing in the cold. The day will turn 
black and I will have either lived or died. Asleep mid-sentence- my words 
fall to the ground. Swept into this dreamland. Economic satisfaction, 
never succeed. But happiness has its place. Justice will not lie in your 
corner. New day towards death, only compassion for my own needs make my 
need necessary.
[Day two] Throw myself in the corner; I have nothing to complain about
here. A tragic day seems too peaceful to most, spoiled ambitious turned 
my heart to black. I'm figuring out this realization process- the process 
to never look upon bitter ground. Living dreams, loving dreams, awakening 
to what I've always dreamt of. The familiar sound of lovely love from the 
love of my life will keep the notes coming. From the reciting of the 
show, from the plip and the shevanel, from the grind that annoys, and the
season they hate...forever I worship. I'll kill, love, and hate for all of you. 
Thank you for the best part of my life.",Mordecai,2011

Und wir nehmen es uns raus, ein bißchen mehr von dieser Welt zu sehen.

Und das so kurz vor der Wahl

Und die großen im Geheimen
Sind mit der macht ganz alleine
Die Armen was sollen damit nur tun

Und die Wolken schau´n uns zu
Sie lassen uns all die Sünden tun
Denn sie versperren jede Sicht
Und ich schau den Wolken yu

Wie wurden es dann weitergehen
Könnten die Götter uns sehen

Die Truppen ziehen zusammen
Wollen irgend wen endlich fangen
Der hat was schlimmes getan
Und jetzt tun sie es ihm an

Von fallen und von siegen
Am Ende kriegt keiner was er verdient

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Daddy liked to drink and smoke
Mama thought your dreams were a joke
You grew up dark in a garden of pain

Like the sun and the rain forgot your name

When nobody waters a flower child
You get this scared little girl with a broken heart
Growing wild I think I’m in love
I’ve got the water for my flower child

My love can fill this pail
And bring you back to health
And make those petals wanna stay

You’ve gone from man to man to man
But still you cannot stand
I’ve got the sun right in my hands

Can’t you see that I will understand? I'll understand

When nobody waters a flower child
You get a scared little girl with a broken heart
Growing wild I think I’m in love
Oh my flower child I think I’m in love
I’ve got the water for my flower child

Has the light gotten through to you?
Don’t be afraid to say you feel it too
I know inside you there’s a sweet perfume

When nobody waters a flower child
You get this scared little girl with a broken heart
Growing wild I think I’m in love
I’ve got the water

I have noticed that you are feeling blue
Honey you are a lot like me Trouble is piling up these days
It will hurt you in so many ways
Leave you crying helplessly
The streets are so cold

Honey I know Baby come on Baby let us fly
To the moon Alice up in the sky
Mercury free Finally You and me

Really want to hold you baby
Just the way I told you
To protect you from the hurt within
No one is gonna find us
We will leave the world behind us
Honey let us go ahead and jump in
Life is in our hands Let us take a chance

Baby come on, baby let us fly To the moon, Alice up in the
sky

Nothing but that love we carry inside

Thomas Helmig,"Oh, the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block
I’d ask him what the matter was
But I know that he don’t talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And they furnish me with tape

I know I can’t escape

Memphis blues again

Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if she’s talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked

To be stuck inside of Mobile

Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
An’ I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that
But then again, there’s only one I’ve met
An’ he just smoked my eyelids
An’ punched my cigarette”

Grandpa died last week
And now he’s buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about how
Badly they were shocked
But me, I expected it to happen
I knew he’d lost control
When I speed built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the senator came down here
Showing ev’ryone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
An’ me, I nearly got busted
An’ wouldn’t it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck
Oh, Mama, is this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the tea preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved it to him
Then I whispered and said, “Not even you can hide
You see, you’re just like me
I hope you’re satisfied”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said, “Jump right in”
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
An’ like a fool I mixed them
An’ it strangled up my mind
An’ now people just get uglier
An’ I have no sense of time
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

And when Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
’neath her Panamanian moon
An’ I say, “Aw come on now
You know you knew about my debutante”
An’ she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
An’ here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice

Thomas Jules,"Yeah, now, I don't mean to brag but
I'm a big city kid
Gone with the wind
Shoot from the hip
And all across the world, no difference
Every city in the world, at home within
Man, it could be nothing like the hard life
Shit, still a sucker for a skyline
The open road's fine to write a couple of lines
But the cities tell the story of a lifetime
Cut. Lights, camera, action
It's all that, everything you imagine
It's right there, you can reach out and grab it
Dreams turn reality big smoke magic
Maybe I'm biased, it may be the set up
Maybe it's just that I don't know no better
City don't sleep, speakers at eleven
If they got a question this is what I tell them (them, them, them)

Them city streets are endless
Them bright lights catch the eye
We push it to the limit
We build it to the sky
And anything can happen
So you do roll the dice
Hold tight and get ready to ride

I'm home, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
Said, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight

Yeah, you could live the dream
Have it fall in your lap
Fall in love or fall through the cracks
Tough call to avoid those traps
But in high-stakes business you gonna get that
Take it from the streets to the penthouse suites
All you need is a dream, a belief
A little luck and a bit of guts to achieve
Heart of the city, belly of the beast
Yeah, what you pay for, cheap thrills ain't cheap
Pay a high price if you wanna taste free
All the good isn't always what it seems
But that's fine with me, this is where I wanna be
Amongst the bright lights and the beat of the city
In any direction people are with me
We get busy, what a trip, what a blessing
They wanna question so I tell them (them, them, them)

Them city streets are endless
Them bright lights catch the eye
We push it to the limit

In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,

Then they looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

from the 1954 movie ""White Christmas"".

When I'm worried and I can't sleep
I count my blessings instead of sheep
And I fall asleep counting my blessings
When my bankroll is getting small
I think of when I had none at all
And I fall asleep counting my blessings

I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads
And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds
If you're worried and you can't sleep
Just count your blessings instead of sheep
And you'll fall asleep counting your blessings

Said she love Tupac but hates some LL
Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings
She can take a prince, turn him into a king

Said her man get paper but he don't live right
All these emotions flowing inside the club
Do you really wanna thug or do ya want love?
She gets the paper when it's time to get it on
She keeps these clowns thinking like Jack B. Quick

No joke all this love, let it stay broke out

I give you two, Italian, ice my whole crew

You beefin', yellin' on the cell of my six
You reach it then you hear the cordless click
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'

That's why I love you mami, you
Run your mouth though your legs over the bed baby

Keep it jinglin', no more minglin'
A brand new year, me and you can bring it in
I'm sick and tired of the freakin', night to morn'
Moanin' in the mirror with my Cubans on
Let bygones be bygones, no more games
Hope all the chicken heads go up in flames
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back
Got it all figured out, mami I like that

Thomas Newman,"I lit my purest candle close to my
Window, hoping it would catch the eye
Of any vagabond who passed it by,
And I waited in my fleeting house 

Before he came I felt him drawing near;
As he neared I felt the ancient fear
That he had come to wound my door and jeer,
And I waited in my fleeting house 

""Tell me stories,"" I called to the Hobo;
""Stories of cold,"" I smiled at the Hobo;
""Stories of old,"" I knelt to the Hobo;
And he stood before my fleeting house 

""No,"" said the Hobo, ""No more tales of time;
Don't ask me now to wash away the grime;
I can't come in 'cause it's too high a climb,""
And he walked away from my fleeting house 

""Then you be damned!"" I screamed to the Hobo;
""Leave me alone,"" I wept to the Hobo;
""Turn into stone,"" I knelt to the Hobo;
And he walked away from my fleeting house",Morning glory,2005

Another witch, another hero
With promises so bold and hollow,
We dare not doubt, just blindly follow

Creeping right into our marrow

Good and bad have joined their forces
Spreading lies in trojan horses
Skillfully disguised in laughter
To leave us wasted ever after

What ever is its sure messing me up tonight
Now hey baby do you like this song
Do you wanna go get a slow dance on
Me and you just rappin' each other tight (that’s right)

'Cause I've been sippin what you been sippin' on
Never tasted something so sweet, never tasted something so strong
And my heads buzzin' baby feeling like I'm falling in love
Hey girl ghatcha got in that cup

Hey girl whatcha got in that cup is it a hundred proof
'Cause its kickin' my butt can't be Jose can't be Jack
'Cause I had 'em before and never felt like that now hey baby
Whatcha got in here can't be no Jagger
Can't be no beer cant be no kinda mad dog wine must be love potion number 9

Thomas Rhett ,"Drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight

Got a Tennessee girl, a Rocky Top breeze
And a big ol' yellow moon
A new set of strings on my '69
And a Yeti full of iced-down booze
Everybody 'round this sleepy little town
Heading down Pinetucky Road
Gonna leave our worries in a cloud of dust
Right there by the old fence post

Yeah, we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight

Got a pig in the ground, stars in the sky
And a jar full of lightning juice
Got a worn-out path to the river bank
Everybody coming out of them boots
Gonna pick a few songs all night long
Ones that we grew up on
Some fishing in the dark, some Copperhead Road
Everybody just sing along

And we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music

Thomas Snow,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1997
Thomas Snow,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

Thomas Snow,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Thomas Snow,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1997
Thomas Snow,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997
Thomas Snow,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Thomas Snow,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Thomas Stevens,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Thomas Stevens,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm, I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever, but I know it isn't spring
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale without a song to sing
O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring 

I keep wishing I were someone else, walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard from a girl I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing 

I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way, that it might as well be spring

And slightly dopey gent, you are

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable

Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries

Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

I feel my words carry worth
In my darkest valleys
I could see the sun above my earth
Reaching down just to rescue me from my insecurity
All of the abuse my step-father did when I was weak
Way too young to know that I should open up my mouth to speak
Now I see, all the years I lost trying find some peace
And when my father died I swore it was the end of me
But Jesus gave me hope beyond the pain of what my eyes could see

Her eyes were as blue as the sea
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose
And she promised she would always love me

The shadows will cover her face
Her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground

And you're gonna be mine",The Best Is Yet to Come,1992
Thomas Young,"Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Since everyone spread the story 
With his own little personal touch
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

This ain't no disco 
And it ain't no country club either, 
This is L.A.

All I want to do is have a little fun before I die
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or buddy

And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if he's ever
Had a day of fun in his whole life

We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In the bar that faces the giant car wash
And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can
In skirts and suits

And they drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record stores, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over 
Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz, early in the morning
Billy likes to peal the labels from his bottles of bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights up every match
In an over-sized pack letting each one burn
Down to his thick fingers before blowing and
Cursing them out, he's watching
The bottles of bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously, close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads 

But,

[Chorus]

Otherwise the bar is ours, the day and the night
And the car wash, too, the matches and the
Buds, and the clean and dirty cars,
The sun and the moon , 

But, all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one

And I know know know that they don't want to believe
That I'm not just a run-around baby

They gamble on the time and the date it will end
Not much longer, they swear

When they say that we're in trouble
Cuz they don't know what they're talking about

Angels composed it for us to dance to.

Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Thompson,"Stow your gear and charge your lamp
Say goodbye to dark and damp
DSS will pay your stamp
Last shift, close her down

Leave your manhood, leave your pride
Back there on the mucky side
Take the cage for one more ride
Last shift, close her down

Put the business in the black
And they've stabbed us in the back
With old school ties and little white lies
They left our town for scrap

Golden handshake, sling our hooks
Now we're nursemaids, now we're cooks
Now our kids steal pension books
Last shift, close her down

Now the scrapper boys infest
And the wrecking balls caress
Like vermin round a burial ground
They catch the smell of death

Old Grimey's lost its soul
Fifty million tons of coal
And we're beggars on the dole
Last shift, close her down
Last shift, close her down

To the reason I gotta leave you waving goodbye

Something that you know I love
Baby pour the wine
And I'll hit the lights

Thorns,"It clings to your mind
Like a phantasmal leech
Nesting itself deep within
The substance of your soul

Demanding every second
Of your prying attention
In the continual search
For the methods to reveal

The ultimate secrets
Of existence

Infects in your blood
It's magnificent seed
Preparing the symbioses union
It feeds you to grow

It crawls along the surface
Of your reality's cocoon
Impatiently awaiting
The miracle of birth

You can count on this pimpin', I got them Budweiser horse women
Black mack, make a rookie divorce pimpin'
I didn't read about it, I was born with it and exercised
First I came with a game plan (what) next I tried it
Now what you know about that money in her snatch
When she promised you that she was givin' you the whole stack
Can't be no lover slash pimp nigga, or a player slash good boy
You either be real or Mr. Goodjoy
Cause ain't no such thing as love at first sight
But it's a such thing that you was on them drugs the first night
It's mandatory for me to appeal to the women
Keep it real with the women, but let them tricks deal with the women
And when you in the field with them women
Watch 'em, they start talkin' love shit stop 'em
Cause ain't no hoe supposed to have no emotions
Her job is to keep a trick broken and hopeless

[Chorus - X2]
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch

[Eightball]
I bust nuts on the face of slut hoes
And hang at the club with dope dealers and cutthroats
Never been one of them niggaz that would save a hoe
Bitch you know the score, you can get your shit and hit the door
Never slippin', you trippin' if you think you pimpin'
Hoes comin' up if they in front of you strippin'
Trickin', that pussy wet lookin' finger lickin'
Tradin' big faces hopin' you can stick your dick in
And she will do whatever for a dollar bill
Suck dick and lick clit on them X pills
High heels and big thighs make a dick ride
Make a nigga spend a grip and think of plenty lies
Lookin' deep in your eyes and don't mean none of it
I got the pie, you got to work if you want some of this
Where you from bitch, don't nothin' come easily
I got somethin' for you if you got somethin' for me

[Chorus - X2]
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this

[MJG]
For four and a quarter you can get a hoe and a order
A Barbie doll bitch or a hoe from across the border
A loose bitch, a tight bitch, whatever you like
With the certain group of paint brushin' bitches consider priceless
Nut drinkers, butt spankers, dominatrix
Most ain't really with that rough shit but some can take it
One hundred percent born and bred, pimp type
Hoes make my money off of goin' to bed

[Eightball]
Givin' head, hookin' niggaz like a cigarette
Niggaz plea and pay fees, just to get a hit
Skin tight, with no hair so you can see the clit
White hoes, black hoes and hoes that Hispanic
Pierced tongue feel good when she workin' wood
Platinum Visa, PIN numbers and them check books
Turn it in, help a nigga get a new Benz
Turn out your friend, let me be both of y'all man

couldn't be late for my trip to Jamaica 

heading to the river skeeming up on how to take a 

boat from a victim, rush right up and stick him 

with a sharp object making sure that I get him 

put it to the river, see, nervous as a lunatic 

jumped out of the veichle as borrowed me a boat quick 

jumped on with the gun, soughter on the break and run 

shot with the gat, in the back, like in Vietnam

Kissed my girl by the factory wall

Clouds are drifting across the moon
Cats are prowling on their beat
Springs a girl in the streets at night
Dirty old town, dirty old town

Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the smoky wind

And Burns like a coal

into your ear canal, like the alignments of the solar system,

Seen the fakes, who cry over copied riffs,

Let's be soldiers, go back and let God control us,

If You agree, there's more to this than what we see,
and what we know then bounce 'till you lose control,
And grab a partner, we about to make this hotter,
Turn up the heat, when we get this started,

Time has come, now shake up the dust 'till it settles in the sun

There was a world full of kings and queens

Dark as the night

We couldn't see it But we created
A place between truth and overrated

Just like a fly on the wall
Would I be able to accept what I can't control?
And would I share what I saw?
Or just sit back and ignore

I haven't seen you before?

I'm on the run from a thief I let into my head
I know, I hold the keys, so don't be scared 
When I turn and shout

I don't think I need you anymore
Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!
I don't think I need you anymore
Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it!

I wanna live, I wanna be the change
We can all be kings and queens
If we can just learn to believe
If we can just learn to believe

We had a plan to build a wall
A great divide that would never fall
To separate us from all the pain
And keep our skeletons locked away

And brick by brick we built it so thick
That it blacked out the sky and all the sunlight
And one by one we all became numb
We were making the bullets to a broken gun

(No one knows the walls that we've climbed, the knots we've untied, the shots that we've fired
I have a lot of ""friends"" who want what we've made but don't know the pain, the beasts that we've slain)

We fight, we bleed, we live, we breathe, we fall beneath, incomplete
We rise, we fall, we chase it all, we raise it up, incomplete

I won't let this fade away from you
I won't stop until you do
I won't wait, I'll run when you say ""move""
I'll stand and I'll fight for you

We fight, we bleed, we live, we breathe, we fall beneath, incomplete
We rise, we fall, we chase it all, we raise it up, incomplete
We fight, we bleed, we live, we breathe, we fall beneath, incomplete
We rise, we fall, we chase it all, we raise it up, incomplete",Incomplete,2016
Thousand Foot Krutch,"I can be stupid
But not outrageous 
I can be sickness
But not contagious
I can be empty
But I'm not nameless
It's the way that you love me
The way that you love me
I can be patient
But I'm not waiting
I can be shook up
But I'm not shaken
I can be angry
But I'm not jaded
It's the way that you love me
The way that you love me 

I am not alone here
I'm not on my own here
I am not alone here
I'm not on my own ('cause I am)

Running with giants
Everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance 
So I can just let go
I've been running with giants
Everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go

I can be outraged
But not a traitor
I can be distant
But I'm no stranger
I am a target but without danger
It's the way that you love me
The way that you love me
I can be strong
But not without weakness
I can be helpless
But not defeated
I can be cut deep
But I'm not bleeding
It's the way that you love me
The way that you love me

I am not alone here
I'm not on my own here
I am not alone
I'm not in my own ('cause I am)

Everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go
I've been running with giants
Everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go

And I feel the pressure of ten men
When the floor cracks and the walls start moving in
I feel the strength that's from within
Kickin' down the doors and walls
We're coming in

Thousand Year Itch,"When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.

Do, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.

Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter.

Will you, won't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.

Look out
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter.
Look out 'cause here she comes.

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.

Well do you, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.

Look out
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter.

Look out helter skelter
She's coming down fast.
Yes she is.
Yes she is
