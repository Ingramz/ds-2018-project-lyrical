Charley Patton,"Baby saddle my pony, saddle up my black mare 
I'm gonna find a rider, baby, in the world somewhere 

Hello central, what's the matter with your line? 
Come a storm last night, tore the wire down 

Got a brand new Shetland, man, already trained
Just get in the saddle, tighten up on your reins 

And a brown-skinned woman like somethin' fit to eat 
But a jet black woman, don't put your hands on me 

Took my baby, to meet the mornin' train 
And the blues come down, baby, like showers o' rain 

I got somethin' to tell you when I get a chance 
I don't wanna marry, just wanna be your man",Stone Pony Blues,1995
Charley Patton,"Jackson on a high hill, mama, Natchez just below 
Jackson on a high hill, mama, Natchez just below 
I ever get back home, I won't be back no more 
Oh, my mama's gettin' old, her head is turnin' gray 
My mama's getting old, her head is turnin' gray 
Don't you know it'll break her heart
Know, my livin' this-a way? 
Ever woke up in the mornin', jinx all around your bed? 
Ever woke up in the mornin', jinx all around your bed? 
Children, I know how it is, baby 
Turned my face to the wall and I didn't have a word to say 
No use a-hollerin', no use a-screamin' and cryin' 
No use a-hollerin', no use a-screamin' and cryin' 

For you know you got a home, mama, long as I got mine 
Hey, Lord have mercy on my wicked soul 
Oh, Lord have mercy on my wicked soul 
You know I wouldn't mistreat you
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, for my weight in gold 
Oh, goin' away, baby, don't you wanna go? 
I'm goin' away, mama, don't you wanna go? 
I know you wanna go, baby
Take God to tell when I'll be back here anymore",Screamin' & Hollerin' the Blues,2003
Charley Patton,"I'm goin' away, to a world unknown
I'm goin' away, to a world unknown
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

My rider got somethin', she's tryin'a keep it hid
My rider got somethin', she's tryin'a keep it hid

Charley Price,"When you're standing alone
With the mountains and the sea
Where the arms of the world open wide
Where the truth is as plain as the falling rain
And as sure as the time and the tide

You know we're all His children
His next of kin, that's the way it began
No matter where you're going or where you've been
You're part of the family of men

When you walk down the road
And the sun is on your side
With the sweet river breeze for your face
Where you don't hear a sound as you look around
Everything sort of falls into place

You know we're all His children
His next of kin, that's the way it began
No matter where you're going or where you've been
You're part of the family of men

You know we're all His children
His next of kin, that's the way it began
No matter where you're going or where you've been
You're part of the family of men

Charley Price,"How do some folks stay in love like a honeymoon couples that can't get enough
How can love be tender yet so tough as it grows
I've left you and I've come back so many times I can't keep track
What is it one of us lacks do you know
When I stop leaving I'll be gone when I stop leaving you I'll be gone
Love's not gettin' any clearer sometimes I think it's all done with mirrors
When I stop leaving I'll be gone
I need you and you need me still we pay for love love that's free
Should we hang together or independently and let it go
I come back each time I leave we make love then we shout and scream
Bottom line time what does it mean oh do you know
When I stop leaving...
When I stop leaving I'll be gone when I stop leaving you I'll be gone",When I Stop Leaving (I'll Be Gone),1998
Charley Price,"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
 
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
 
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
 
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone",Help Me Make It Through the Night,2004
Charley Price,"Baby, it's gonna take a little bit lo-onger
For me to ever get you off of my mind
Baby, it's gonna take a little bit lo-o-o-nger
'Cause I've been lovin' you a long-long time

People try to tell me that it won't be lo-ong
'Til I won't even miss your anymore
But I can tell there must be something mighty wro-ong
'Cause everyday I want you even more

And baby, it's gonna take a little bit lo-onger
For me to ever get you off of my mind
Baby, it's gonna take a little bit lo-o-onger
'Cause I've been lovin' you a long-long time

They say this lonely feelin', that it'll go away-ay
But after all this time now, it ain't gone
Every wakin' moment and every night in bay-ay
Just seems to keep on keepin' on

Charley Price,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,2004
Charley Price,"In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town
One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothin' much to see but a starvin' hound
In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town

Down in the Delta where I was born
All we raised was cotton, potatoes and corn
I've picked cotton till my fingers hurt
Draggin' the sack through that Delta dirt

And I've worked hard the whole week long
Pickin' my fingers to the blood and bone
There ain't a lot of money in a cotton bale
At least when you try to sell

In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town
One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothin' much to see but a starvin' hound
In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town

On Saturday nights we'd get dressed up
Catch us a ride on a pickup truck
On a gravel road, it nearly strangled us
That cotton pickin' Delta dust

We'd sit across the street on the depot porch
Lookin' at the folks lookin' back at us
Munchin' on a dust covered ice cream cone
Wondering how we'd get back home

From a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town
One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothin' much to do but just hang around
In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town

From a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town
One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothin' much to do but just hang around

Charley Price,"My Eyes Can Only See As Far As You
My eyes can only see as far as you
I stop searching all the faces in the crowd
I don't ever want to find somebody new
I'm content with loneliness if you're not in my arms
For my eyes can only see as far as you
My heart is set on loving you forever

And your love is strong enough to see me through
It'll keep me holding on to you forever
Cause my eyes can only see as far as you
It'll keep me holding on to you forever
Cause my eyes can only see as far as you
Yes, my eyes can only see as far as you",My Eyes Can Only See as Far as You,2004
Charley Pride,"Kaw-Liga
Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standin' by the door
He fell in love with an Indian maiden over in the antique store

Kaw-Liga well he just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga well he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed

Is it any wonder that his face is red Kaw-Liga that poor ol' wooden head
He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk

Kaw-Liga well he stood there as lonely as can be
'Cause his heart was an ol' pine knotty tree

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga well he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed

And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
He took her oh so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Well he stood there and never let it show so she could never answer yes or no

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga well he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed",Kaw-Liga,
Charley Pride,"The bills are all due and my baby need shoes but I'm busted
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound but I'm busted
I got a cow that's gone dry and a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day

The county will haul my belongings away I'm busted
I called brother Bill to get me a loan I was busted
For I hate to beg like a dog for a bone but I'm busted
But Bill said that there ain't a thing I can do

My wife and my kids're all down with the flu
And I was just thinking of calling on you I'm busted

Now Lord I'm no thief but a man can go wrong when he's busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone I'm busted

Me and my family's got to pack up and go
But I'll make a living the Lord only knows I'm busted",Busted,1966
Charley Pride,"I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home
I dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother
I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long
I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home

Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines
'Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
So I just think I'll take ol' Charley Pride put him on a Southbound freight and ride

Charley Pride,"I hear the sound of distant drums,
Far away, far away.
And if they call for me to come,
Then I must go, and you must stay.
So, Mary, marry me, let's not wait.
Let's share all the time we can before it's too late.
Love me now, for now is all the time there may be.
If you love me, Mary, Mary, marry me.

I hear the sound of bugles blowing,
Far away, far away.
And if they call, then I must go
Across the sea, so wild and gray.
So, Mary, marry me, let's not wait,
Or the distant drums might change our wedding day.
Love me now, for now is all the time there may be.
If you love me, Mary, Mary, marry me.

Charley Pride,"She don't hold and kiss me like she did one time
I think my sweet baby's got leavin' on her mind
The longer I know her the more I can tell my darling's not happy with me
The longer I know that I know her too well the less love in her eyes I see
She don't hold and kiss me...

The stronger I hold her the farther apart my darling is growing from me
The danger of my darling breaking my heart it's fast moving in on me
'Cause she don't hold and kiss me...

The deeper I love her the farther away my darling slips out of my hands
The longer the future the longer I'll stay out of my darling's plans

The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mamma and pappa
And down the road I look, and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms a-reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home,

Yes, they'll all come to meet me

It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Then I awake, and look around 
At the grey walls that surround 
And I realize that I was o-only dreaming
For there's a guard and a there's a sad old padre
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again, I'll touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree

Charley Pride,"Way down in the state of Georgia through the swamps and the everglades
There's a big ol' hole in Tiger Mountain
God help the man who gets lost in Miller's Cave
I had me a girl in waycross Georgia but she had unfaithful way
She made me feel I was unwanted like the birds and the bears in Miller's Cave
I couldn't stand the way she did me couldn't take her lowdown ways
Before I'll stay with the cheatin' woman I'll go and live with the bears in Miller's Cave

Caught her out one Sunday morning with some guy they call Big Dave
The meanest man in waycross Georgia I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave
I said you'll pay both you and Davy I'm a gonna see you in your grave
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em
I took their cheatin' schemin' bones to Miller's Cave
That woman made me feel unwanted but I guess I showed her I was brave

But they'll never gonna find me cause I'm lost in Miller's Cave

Charley Pride,"All te snakes crawl at night that's what they say
When the sun goes down then the sneaks will play
I watched that car pull right up into my driveway
Saw a shadow slip away from my house
So I hurried straight and looked in her room
And I found out that it was my loving spouse
All te snakes crawl at night...
So I waited in the shadows until morning and the gun I held was trembling in my hand
No I did not plan to give them any warning
Cause the devil on my shoulder had command
All te snakes crawl at night...
Oh the trial in a little while was over and they sentenced me to die right away
But before I leave this courtroom please Your Honor

Charley Pride,"Troubles and a worried mind it seems that's all I've ever known
But now I'll leave it all behind if you'll just leave me alone
And if I go on loving you if to leave is a mistake
If I'm wrong in what I do that's the chance I'll have to take

And she's gone gone gone gone and she's gone gone gone
And I'll bid her my last farewell

I fell in love with a pretty little thing I thought that wedding bells would ring
She was as sweet as sweet could be till I found out what she did to me
Railroad steamboat...

I asked her mother to let her go she whispered mother please tell him no
Though he may think that I am true there's plenty more who think so too

How she could be loving me forever and leaving on the other hand
Last night I thought I'd see a movie to help me get my thoughts in hand
I think what I saw was the western preacher or James Bond on the other hand
I placed the ring upon one finger of her left hand
The one who said she'd stay forever is gone on the other hand
(And here's big Jim Talbott and his electric Hawaiian steel guitar)

But today the world looks brighter I feel just like a brand new man

Now all my social friends look down their noses

One of these days I'll wander back to you

My sweetheart writes me letters they find me now and then
I've send her funny postcards to show her where I've been
She always writes I love you though we're miles apart
But none of funny postcards can't say what's in my heart

I feel the cold winds blowing blowing up a storm
I go to sleep and I always dream that you're here in my arms

Just stop and consider all she's been through
Don't be quick to condemn her for things she might say

Charley Pride,"(spoken)
I asked my love to take a walk
Just to walk just a little way
As we talked of our future wedding day
And when she said she could never be mine
(sung)
I placed a knife against her breast
As into my arms she pressed
She cried oh please don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity

(chorus)
Only say that you'll be mine
In no other arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

[ mandolin - banjo ]
I started home tween twelve and one
I cried my God what have I done
I've killed the only one I loved
Because she would not be my bride

If he brings you happiness then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if he ever breaks your heart if the teardrops ever start

Though it hurts to let you go darling I want you to know
And I'll stand by you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear that he made you shed a tear

I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away every teardrop that you cried

I say she's just another girl now just a flame that's lost its glow
And I say her name has slipped my mind now and she's just a girl I used to know

The yard could stand a little mowin' each time that I pass by

Whispers sweet nothings tenderly and gently hold her tight

Lies one that I loved so well
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, 'neath the willow
Disturb not her rest in the vale.

There, close by the side of that loved one
'Neath the trees where the wild flowers bloom
When the farewell hymns shall be chanted
I shall rest by her side in the tomb.

Come to the church in the wildwood
Oh, come to the church in the dale

Charley Pride,"Hey, you left your room this morning
Did you think to pray?
In the name of Christ our Savior
Did you sooth for loving favor as a shield today?

Oh, how praying rests the weary
Prayer will change the night to day
So when life seems dark and dreary
Don't forget to pray

When you've met with great temptation
Did you think to pray?
By his dying love and merit
Did you claim the Holy Spirit as your guide today?

Oh, how praying rests the weary
Prayer will change the night to day
So when life seems dark and dreary
Don't forget to pray

When your heart was filled with anger
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace my brother
That you might forgive another who had crossed your way

Prayer will change the night to day
So when life seems dark and dreary
Don't forget to pray, don't forget to pray",Did You Think to Pray?,1971

Let me live again, let me live again
Reach into my heart and light the light of love again
Let me see the sun let this darkness end

And the way we tried so hard not to fall

For I was just born to be exactly what you see
Nothing more or less I'm not the worst or the best

On the road I'm wonderin' what I'm gonna say
Funny how the light's not turnin' maybe this time she'll be sleepin'
In the drive I'm wonderin' if she's okay
The house looks dark to me as I fumble for the key
Now inside an empty chair is all I see
In the kitchen on the table there's a letter and Lord I'm shakin'
Cause she's cried and wrote she's tired of waitin' for me
Instant loneliness all around me certainly my whole world has slipped away
Instant loneliness where she should be and this instant loneliness is hurtin' me

She once said to me that she'd grow tired some day

Charley Pride,"Well I woke up this morning when the cold Chicago wind
Blew my newspaper blanket off my back
Through my dirty broken window the grey sun filtered in
As I dreamed about the Southbound railroad track
I could almost hear the crickets in a sleepy cotton field
As daddy drove our vagon to Virgin
But today I'd give a fortune for a twenty five cent meal
And I wish I was a country boy again
So let me ride on the Southbound
Back to where I came from I don't care or where I am
So let me ride on the Southbound and put me off somewhere near Birmingham

And the fame and fortune I came here to win
I've got nothing but the roaches running cross my window sill

Where the sad and broken hearts come in

Have my future read from the palm of my hand

Please tell me good news Gypsy woman that my sweet love's a comin' home again
God only knows of my big trouble I thought I had a true love a love that'll never end
Heaven only knows how much I miss her Gypsy woman say she's comin' home again

A flock of geese flew overhead
Wind from the wings fall down to me come go with us that's my way
It grieves me much to see you cry I'll break a heart with my goodbye
I warned you ahead of time
I could never say I'm sorry but it has to be that's my way
That's my way to try to find a place I've never been
Before directions master me and distance is my friend
I try to put a lifetime into each and every day that's my way
I yearn to love but it can't be for fear of what's inside of me

I saw fame and fortune which I finally found
Everyone at home may know me and they say that I'm a big man
A hometown boy that made good and he's back home again
But there's a face in my memory that's stands out from all the rest

A face of someone special the girl I still love best
Well I asked my mom about Jeannie she said she married yesterday
Please don't try to see her son it had to be this way
Then my eyes fill with tears as I turn back the years

When you whisper my name I lose all control
And once again I'll leave my world behind and rush to you and then
I'll be happy till I leave you once again

But I can't find the strength to end it all

With the mountains and the sea

And as sure as the time and the tide

No matter where you're going or where you've been

One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothing much to do but hang around

All we raised was cotton, potatoes and corn
I've picked cotton 'til my fingers hurt
Draggin' a sack through the delta dirt

Pickin' my fingers to the blood and bone
Ain't a lot of money in cotton bale

On an early autumn day
Freshness of the breeze brought the mornin'
And the sun came risin' up
Shinin' down on leaves that fell like golden snow
And the mystery of it all
Made the problems of the day seem unimportant

There ain't nothin' like an Oklahoma mornin'
Nothin' like it when you're feelin' low
It warms up your mind and your body
It puts Oklahoma sunshine in your soul

Our campfire came to life
The crackling of the fire and smell of coffee
Turned back the time
To a day when a man could listen for a while
To the sound of mother nature
Without the sound of industry in the background

That Oklahoma mornin'
Puts Oklahoma sunshine in my smi-I-ile
There ain't nothin' like an Oklahoma mornin'

It'll warm up your mind and your body

Charley Pride,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge headin' for the train feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my har'poon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time
And Bobby clapping hands we finally sang up ever song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Oh but feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
And feeling good was good enough for me good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip away
Looking for the home I hope she'll find
And I'll trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Booby's body next to mine
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

Charley Pride,"He was driving home one evening
In his beat up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened,
Standing out there in the snow
'Til he said I'm here to help you ma'am
By the way my name is Joe.

She said I'm from St. Louis
And I'm only passing through
I must have seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you
When he changed the tire
And closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said how much do I owe you
Here's what he had to say.

You don't owe me a thing, I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really want to pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you.

Well, a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along,
And dead on her feet.

Though she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitress's eyes
When she read what she wrote.

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really want to pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you.

This last verse of this song I really like

That night when she got home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinkin' about the money
And what the lady's note had said
And as her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low
Everything's gonna be alright, I love you, Joe",Chain of Love,2003
Charley Pride,"There's a place they call The Bottom,
And friends! I've been there once or twice.
It's dark down there and lonely,
And something's missin' in your life.

Tonight I thought I'd had enough,
When I heard a voice said, ""Don't give up!""
That whisper had an old familiar ring
I didn't see the angel, but I felt the comfort of her wing.

Daddy always called her angel,
I never knew the reason why.
I was looking for a halo
He was looking in her eye.

She was always there to guide me
With all the love a gentle hand could bring.
I didn't see the angel,
But I felt the comfort of her wing.

Now I'm looking back in time
To a young man stumbling through the kitchen door.
How Mama kept on praying
When she couldn't tell me nothing any more.

I woke up in my bed again,
I guess she must have tucked me in
I can't remember much of any thing.
I didn't see the angel, but I felt the comfort of her wing.

Charley Pride,"Did you ever just feel like a movie
Or a book or story in song?
Or did you hear some words for the first time today
And find yourself hurting alone?

When the lyrics start telling your story
And Shakespeare starts writing the play
Then those well chosen words by some
Old country verse held all your defenses away

Well, I thought I was over that story
I thought I'd forgotten that song
But old songs were new songs
For fools all alone

And we'll all come around
And we all will be found
Caught in the act of crying alone
Trapped in an old country song

But old songs were new songs
For fools all along

And we'll all come around
In that old country sound
Caught in the act of crying alone
Trapped in an old country song

Charley Pride,"In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town
One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothin' much to see but a starvin' hound
In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town

Down in the Delta where I was born
All we raised was cotton, potatoes and corn
I've picked cotton till my fingers hurt
Draggin' the sack through that Delta dirt

And I've worked hard the whole week long
Pickin' my fingers to the blood and bone
There ain't a lot of money in a cotton bale
At least when you try to sell

In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town
One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothin' much to see but a starvin' hound
In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town

On Saturday nights we'd get dressed up
Catch us a ride on a pickup truck
On a gravel road, it nearly strangled us
That cotton pickin' Delta dust

We'd sit across the street on the depot porch
Lookin' at the folks lookin' back at us
Munchin' on a dust covered ice cream cone
Wondering how we'd get back home

From a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town
One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothin' much to do but just hang around

There's a story I would tell
'Bout a brave young Indian
You should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix Valley
In Arizona land
Down the ditches a thousand years
The waters grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Til the white man stole their water rights

And their land grew crops of weeds

And forgot the white man's greed

Jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water and a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,

Well my daddy left home when I was three

Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

And I said, ""my name is Sue, how do you do?

Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

Well I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
And he reached for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
And I knew you'd have to get tough or die
It's that name that helped to make you strong""

He said, ""now you just fought one heck of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But y ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya gut and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the, that named you Sue""

What could I do?  
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
I called him my pa, and he called me his son
Come away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then

With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt 
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert 
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes 
And found my cleanest dirty shirt 
Then I washed my face and combed my hair 
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day 

I'd smoked my mind the night before 
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking 
But I lit my first and watched a small kid 
Playing with a can that he was kicking 
Then I walked across the street 
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken 
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned 
'Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone 
And there's nothing short a' dying 
That's half as lonesome as the sound 
Of the sleeping city sidewalk 
And Sunday morning coming down 

In the park I saw a daddy 
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging 
And I stopped beside a Sunday school 
And listened to the songs they were singing 
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyon 
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

Niggas like, you must've bent that she never would've spent that
On Cam'Ron I bought me my first box of tampons
Bleeding in the pants at the school dance

Never took a chance at romance although all my friends think ya fly
But me doing that, I think I'd die, we like Thelma and JJ, Brandy and Ray J
Anyone against C and C, pulled a AK
Thinkin' 'bout sucking your dick, had me sick
But if I lost my mind, you'd be the first I'd lick

I don't care if they try to avoid us
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else but
Me and you boo, me and you boo, me and you boo

A-yo I'm sorry yo, but when it come to Charli
I wouldn't hit that, we got back like Atari
How you live mister? Yo you see me and CB she a wig twister
Call her my big sister she game heads

Never wear the same threads
I wouldn't hit that if we slept in the same bed
Fucking with her, yo shit get sliced her wrist is ice
And rappin', the bitch is nice

She told me how girls fool you for the bucks
And I should stay low, cool up in the cut
I told her the difference a wooler from the blunt
That's how we get down so cool I call her cha'

And any girl next to her, just to run her up
That's why y'all run a muck thinkin' that I done her up
I thought about it once when we grew up
But then I saw her naked and I threw up

A-yo Cam, yo
Yo I know you knocked Charli off
No I did not man, yo stop lying
Word to my mother, I did not hit that man

A-yo I'm your dog duke you can tell me
Nigga I would tell you if I did her
Yo I know you hit that, yo how the head, how the head kid?
Yo I did not touch her, that's like my sister

Yo, stop frontin' that's like my sister, word to mother
Yo you lying, whatever man whatever
Yeah, aight a-yo Charli, what's up with you and Cam
Nothin' that's my dog, saying this together

Come on now I know how that nigga roll and he look good
Come on that's like my brother, he probably got a lil' dick
Let me find out, a-yo see we're just alike, call it ironic
But why they don't listen when I say we're platonic

Well you know how niggas talk just for wreck
If my dick was hard and your clit was wet
A-yo a-yo Cam watch your mouth, don't disrespect
I remember when your ass got hit with the Tech

Well I remember that girl tried to slit your neck
And you remember that stank bitch hittin' the deck
Yeah that's when your pretty ass ate coochie free though
And I took you off canal right down to Tito's

But when the cops pulled us over I had to keep the heat low
But I gave you the money to pay off the repo
A-yo you real funny, yo you know how we go
Yeah, motherfucking peoples, uh, without the egos

And I'll do anything for you, even give my last breath
I wish you the best
Man I love you to death

[Chorus]
I don't care what they think about us
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they think that we're fucking
I only love you this way

Don't care about the way girls thinking you twistin' my back
Bought the chrome almost so you can christen the AC
In '91 when you was young and I was dumb and
Robbing niggas splittin' the figgas with you boo, screw who?

Incest, never dissed a kiss shine on your wrist for a birthday gift
Niggas like, you must've bent that

Uh huh, Untertainment
Charli Dangerous
H-Class, little E
Uhh uhh

Verse One: Charli Baltimore

I don't know if it's the pretty face or the expensive taste
That got everybody wantin' to touch me like Case
Feels So Good like Mase, to pull over
Anywhere I want, diplomats on the Rover
The way I put it on a nigga sober
I have 'em comin' back, knockin' on my door like Johovas
Ya'll already know that Charli's in charge
Weekly massage, platnuim and gold cars
Money stashed in NY to Witchitaw
And I stay with my niggas cause you know how bitches are
Aggy, cause they baby daddy want to bag me
That's why I never leave home without the 44
Ya'll hoes can't do nothin' to me
I got this game wrapped like a dubee
Pinned up in what?
Charli rappin' about, I really got
And it ain't that I'm stuck on myself, I'm really hot

Chorus

For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh)
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (really need it, yeah)

Verse Two: Charli Baltimore

Yo yo yo, gimme the money
Rich bitch be swimmin' in money
I need Jet Ski's in mind, can't tease a dime
Lookin' in the mirror, feeling pleased with the shine
Lady Rolex for the time, the class is ""S""
Wear the ice on the bra of my chest
When the money ain't right I go far to the left
Niggas want to play games then Charli direct
want to Long Kiss Goodnight, don't hold ya breath
Bitches know I'm the shit with my MAC lipstick
Crushin' the player haters with a purple navigator
Shoes alligator, my bag is too
If I was broke like you, I would be mad like you
But you can come work for Charli, a boss with a body
Ask anybody, I could take over Gotti
Poo by the poo while you just another hottie
Niggas roll bricks that'll stay if it's notty

Chorus

For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh)
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (really need it, yeah)

Verse Three: Charli Baltimore

Uh huh, yo when you look you see the slim waist leavin' no trace
Cause shit for no Charli will be in the breifcase
Yeah Long Kiss Goodnight, Baltimore get it right
For the cash, pop out the window and shoot through the ice
Ain't no love here, just the black gloves here
Check it, and I don't get by with nothin' I can't leave in 30 seconds
But my kids, they think mommy a teacher
They don't know, for the love of this
I make the whole world tre' dough
Bingo, get 'em ready for school like nothing happen
Here's a apple for the teacher, tell 'em mommy said ""Hi""
Bet he won't fail you no more, one more ""F"" and he die
Even with my nails done, I can take guns apart son
So when they come lookin' for this reporter broke Un
Dealt with birds, but I had to move on
But for none of these I tatto the little P-pac on my arm
Ask Un how the ones be when he advance me dough
So I put out mines and tell dawg keep yours yo
For real...

Cause way downtown, you know the fuzz is tryin' to hear it 
So when ya spark, ya make sure it's in the dark 
And most importantly, stay away from Central Park 
Cause cops live, just to put away a thug 
But not today, cause me and my baby in the Cabaret of Love 

[Chorus]

[Charli Baltimore]
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo, uhh 
I thought I already barked on cats about Russ Hadden 
It ain't work, gotta Scream on cats like Wes Craven 
Oww! They ain't know I had it in me 
Like Lil' Kim, didn't know they had it in me 
Don't you know don't you know, we pull up from a show 
Cam and chrome bag the hos, in Prada bags all the dough 
And caked out, break out, uh 
Horse & Carriage, forced to marriage, been had too many carats 
And they ain't know, passin' that down 
Where I come from 
Ask Jane, that's my dun-dun 
How we handle them dumb dumb's 
And we like, Siskel and Ebert 
We review cats, thumbs up if they they shit's right 
And down if they new jack's 
You might see Charli, in a Benz or Ferrari 
Hennesey or Pacardi, gettin' bent at a party 
But I flip, be the new face, cover of Trace 
This the muthafuckin' remix, we ain't need no Mase 

Uh huh uh huh 
We like it (Slikk the Shocker) 
Uh huh uh huh (Cam'Ron, No Limit) 
(Untertainment) 
(Mo' money, ya heard me) 

[Silkk The Shocker]
I live life like a thug, cause time's is rough 
Convicted felon 
Now I'm like, rhyme for bucks 
Ball till I fall, should I say, my time is up 
And I cop you diamonds, never diamond cut 
Forget the money, cause I could ball with or without the shipment 
And I'm down girl, but I could ball with or without the chick 
Silkk the Shocker, Cam'Ron, now how you gonna doubt us a hit 
(Must be a car), Miss I could pull you, with or without the six 
Now I ain't the C-E-O, but I ain't far from it 
So if I ain't far from C-E-O 
That mean I ain't far from havin' C-E-O money 
Can't discuss what I'm worth, but I'm worth this much 
Like Mantigo, fall back like snatchin' purses for bust 
So many styles 
Drop a beat, I'ma drop a hit 
Rap game stop for the dope game 
And cop a brick 
No Limit Soldier baby, so watch the talk 
Get lost like, Oh It Ain't My Fault! 
I'm from the N-O, L-I, M-I to the T 
Tru my click, Silkk, the Shocker, yeah that's me 
Now look, money I'm tryin' to make it 
Bustas I'm tryin' to break, girls is like 
Ooh I love Silkk, and then, ooh I hate him! 
Cause they can't have me, but I don't look 
I can't afford to live average 
So senorita, let me walk you to my carriage 
Now I don't want to settle down, but we can do it like we married 
Cheese!

Papers dial mine, clothes custom figure
Matchin' Jon Gotti to roll through customs nigga
Roll the custom built shit, I bust them clips
Niggas trust my lips, while they suck they dicks
Plus the Kiss be the Long Goodnight
Murderous bitch be the wrong in spiked-typed, what
Price right, be that song, the right type
But only if Havoc and P spittin' wit' me
And they say they gon' see that C.B. nice wit' it
Hinnesy and Rimmy, and give me some Ice wit' it
Shake down, niggas'll throw some dice in it
Put your Money on Chuck or in 9-9, you're fucked
Try your luck, stress this red-head
I mix blood in my dye, like my family ties

Yo, when I foul out on lab mouse
One nut and I'm out
Ain't tryin' to stick around, let a nigga catch me out of bound
Don't give a fuck about a rumor
Know how I get down
Let my man's do it, he gots to right to it
Known Jay come through the door, still like they ""Who this?""
Don't got beef, but got niggas, serious ones
Make sure a nigga here, plus lasted wars
And stay countin' all that cash when I'm fuckin' wit' 'Un'
Fuck around with my funds, got a bring a gun
Please don't make me have to puncture ya lungs

Cause we the ones rockin' 'em, the ones toppin' 'em
Gold bars unpredictable, like Mr. Cal' shockin' 'em
We heavenly like BIG, Pac and them

Go at the girls, have a good time, don't make it a problem
While we pop bottles of Mo'
Burn down bottles of 'dro
Smack that ass of models and ho's

Oh, you gon' take him to the airport?

[Guy]

[Verse One]
C.B. can get to your head, if you let me
Or give ya he'd, if you let me
When you met me, never bet we'd be
Bumpin' and grindin'
Wore short skirts and drop shit when you was behind me
Design ways to fuck with no craze
Cause I know you've known my man's since 3rd grade, I stayed
Pure through his whores and tore's, overseas
You and me, too long
Look opposite you ball
Lil' sis', so you say
want to fuck me Tony?, Scarface-way with Gina, I mean the...
Signs be there, time we share, be sweet
Fuck that reckless till we shred the sheets
To confetti, ready, picture teddy and gaurders
Play Marta, I'm smarter
Rub tit's, part lips, and watch you, I got you
Will powers down, got the ship mapped out
Cause that nigga's leaving town

[Chorus]
Who's makin' love to your old lady

[Verse Two]
Soakin' in the bubbles, by Body Shine
Dreamin' bout you, want to wake up
Suckin' on my ""A"" cups, make up
Reasons to see you
I can tell you want it, all you gotta do is
Push up on that
Ask ya nigga, you loyal?, drunk off Crown Royale
Tellin' me how he be gettin' down out of town
What he don't know, won't hurt him
One squirt through my tight skirt, then we can fuck all the flirtin'
All I gotta figure is, how to pull this nigga
Fool my nigga, but he dumb anyway
And his chime, anyday now, have me in the hay now
Dirty ass way down, I'm still gon' lay down
He on his way now, to keep me company
Little did he know, when he show
He'll be bumpin' me, humpin' me
Wantin' me to open my mouth
Let him spit in it, take the wetness, suck his dick wit' it

[Chorus]
Who's makin' love to your old lady

Who's makin' love to your old lady
While you're out makin' love

[Verse Three]
Knock-knock, who is it?
I'm coming, make me cum in
Five minutes or less, two seconds, I'm undressed
Open the door, threw him to the floor
want to whore like Del Rio, tell me no, take that, know my steelo
Dick's hard, feel tights like a vice grip
Or nice lips, both sex, I'm a veteran
You better win, I'm on top, don't stop
Do it faster, fuck you bastard, got it mastered
Yeah yeah, so glad you gave in
I'm about to cave in, be your sex slave and
I'm dumb and I'm about to...

[Guy]
Yo, yo, yo, C.B. what's up? boo

Oh shit, what are you doing here?

Peep the math

Mau Mau be about land and freedom

Reperation and apologies, for Africa to America oddesseys

Guerilla-type tactics on them socialistic fallacies

It be about, the devestations of the social doministic thought

Keep a brown man down sport

They wantin to keep our (?) set nigga

The way Franz Fanon put it, you lucky I ain't ""wretched"" yet


[Big Black - Mos Def]

Yo, you fucked up in the game now

It's Big Black, Mr. Chairman of the Mau Mau

I hear the world in all-black surround sound

Barricaded so you can't move around now

Doin this for my clan that ain't around now

Buried six feet deep beneath the ground now

My loud sound pound down make the earth crush in and bow down

There's faultlines in the ground now - shake 'em down


[Smooth Black - Charli Baltimore]

Black Chevy, Mau Maus, gats ready

BLAOW BLAOW, black deadly, femme fatale

Underground, rats in this rat race

and black race cats sell out to the blackface

and rag grin, laugh not my light skin

be S-M-O-O-T-H from pH

UHH, backseat strappin in

cause I'm the only bitch with Big Black and them


[Chorus]

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, gun ready

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

Well how black? BLAK HEART, BLAK MIND, BLAK SOUL

Mau Maus (HOOTIE HOO!) We was born to roll!

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, aim fire

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

How black? BLAK WOMB TIL WE REACH THE BLACK HEARSE

What's black? - SHADE OF THE UNIVERSE


[Mo Black - Canibus]

Yo, yo

Yo when Mo Black start to black out bitches pass out

Stick my black dick in they mouth and dig they back out

Black monk like Thesalonius, the government got a black phobia

That's why they tap my black Nokia

Black fathers, black mothers, black brothers

handcuffed to each other, goin upstate in black buses

Black thugs, wrap drugs in backwoods

Smoke til they got black tongues, black lips and black lungs

Blak iz blak, wack MC's get smacked

Forced to go home and dial 1-800-I-CAN'T-RAP


[1/16th Black - MC Serch]

Aiyyo who that? Yo right there; blue eyes, and black hair

Kill 'em with a rhyme, or the bottom of my Nike Airs

So quick son pick one, you don't want me to finish

or I'll quickly take you to 1950 and do you like the British

Head on a spear, contusions ear to ear

For Africa Maxima, I'ma drive you out of here

Mr. 1/16th, born to kill your self esteem

Born from part devil, part cracker from Queens

Knowledge that we drop, you don't even build with

That's like me winnin a rap Grammy, givin it to Lyn(?) Smith


[Chorus]


[Jo Black]

Yo, yo

Everything black is wack and shit

Blackheads, blackmail, black cats and shit

Funerals, niggaz gotta wear black and shit

Black cars, black clothes on they backs and shit

Blackballed, if we don't kiss they ass and shit

Blacklisted see ya nigga, and you're gone that's it

White bitches, they wanna be black and shit

Tan lotion on they white flat ass and shit


[Double Black]

Aiyyo all the Mau Maus gather up and let's attack

because they're tryin to fuck with our images

and I think that shit is crazy wack

And as a matter of fact, they want us niggaz

to smile and laugh - I guess they never seen a bloodbath

Brothers and sisters are dyin, babies are bein taken out

So what the fuck they want me to rap about?

About how happy I am, to be livin in the slum

where little shorties walk around totin big guns


[Chorus]


Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll

Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll


[Hard Black]

Nigga, nigga you think these rhymes?

You think they fuckin rhymes? This this this this PHILOSOPHY

This the end of redneck-ass catastrophes

Puttin a plunger in the, ass of my history!

Forty-one shots of reality for the generations to come after me!

As it be, hell hath no FURY like a black man scorned

Nigga BLAK IZ BLAK, you've officially been warned

Nigga - you've officially been warned

You hear me? You've you you've OFFICIALLY BEEN WARNED

You've been TOLD nigga, you've been fuckin OFFICIALLY been warned

This is for your dome, straight up

MAU MAU STYLE, BACK FROM THE FOREST KNAHMEAN?

Ain't none better, repeat the letters
Murder I-N-see fucka, we go together, Lord
When you see the pink hair the Inc. here
Fuck - we can do it mixtape or dubbed
And by the underground bastards, appeal to the masses
Style like Jackie on asses, come through with Jackie on glasses
Protectin' yo asses, seven inch classes, fuck ya'll bastards
G - catch a wiff of the murderous bitch, the murderous clique
Like you never heard of the G
From the muscle like crime life like corner hustlers
And the, tunner winter shit, tell me I ain't a winner
??, Got my mind on my money and my money in my pocket
Who the fuck gon' stop it, time for the honey is up
So dummy it up, who the fuck gon' knock it
Now that The Inc. locked it, Chuck

[Chorus:]

We got vision by I.G. - hook by Ashanti
Got Chuck spittin', where the fuck ya'll fit in
Those without my name recognition
C.B. - bitch of the commission, still play my position
Oh, won't settle, put the foot to the pedal
And knee short stiletto's, the chick is still ghetto
Hold the bitch down, but not on her
I'm rissen, mind driven like hundred mile commissions
How I'm spittin', niggaz is rewritin', and I'm just bullshittin'
Gon' know when I'm hittin' (uh)
Wrists start slittin', I'm killin' 'em soft
A predator, slow burn and I'm killin' 'em off
Now, back to back let's pace it, five steps
Who want to test the streets is on a record
One eight-seven Mami, click behind me, ya'll know what the sellin' be
Kill 'em with the melody, Chuck

[Chorus:]

Now who that baige bitch poppin that shit like she cocky eyed
Inc. Mami, bitch know how to find me
Out 'til the late night, studio trouble maker
Ass don't know how to take a (murderous) love the hater
Flows like an elevator, 'cause each level I'm up, I get off
Fucker, who want to cross the line
It's real thin with a pad and a pen
And I spit ten and throw ya'll six for the win
Again - ya'll heard me, niggaz thought but the chicks all girly
Body all curvy, fuck how the world be
I'm mobbin' on the top of ya'll

Come on why'all, tonight somebody sho nuff
Gon' tear the club the fuck up as soon as I hit the scene
All eyes on us, mean, and so vicious
A good nigga, bad intentions
Not to mention, them 12 engine benzes with fish lenses
We park right out front
To handle our business
The broads on the way in
Showin a little attention
Like, I fucked before but ain't never call
That's life you either love to live it
Or just live it, I live it to the limit
Champaigne finish gangsta
Image, platinum shades swingin
Then I do that 2 step that niggaz do
We don't really dance
We just rub the dick on the ass
And fill the glass with nothin but ??
And if they pop it gettin the poppin with me
Get my niggaz tonight baby, lets partaay!

Yo, uh

And hotter in person, hottest when I'm cursin
Love my bitch thuggelbees
Strokin my ego, then he go
For the bubbly, nigga love me
We go to the vehicle, talk dirty
Past flirty, flight leavin at 5:30
It's hot in herre, foggin the windows

Passenger side beside them, whoa
Gotta be controllin when I'm rollin

Hands on my knockers, he feelin them poppers
But Chuck never givin it up, livin it up

[Charli Baltimore]
Uh, Count me and My niggaz as OD'in
Rule got a bitch Korean, lap dancin
Off to the murder mansion, ride the shoulder
Benz and the Rover, Nigga we ain't sober
Girl Interrupted, murder got me corrupted
With shots so that any lickin shots with the semi
Out the sunroof of the Bentley
Bottles all empty but niggaz got stashes
Never fuckin the glasses

[Ja Rule]
Ha, You know the Rule roll up in the party
Me and Charli, Ready to have them hotties
Rub up on my body, 'cause after the club
Its the after set, with some pushin a little head
Is always the safe bet, she tell me V twizzy
In the Red Corvette, swervin lanes

Charli XCX,"Backwood of that good to the pain for the brain
A cup of lean for me to sleep, see I be going through thangs
Music business got me stressed Xanax to maintain
Waking up on wrong sides got me writing in vain
Vicodin to numb me up help me cope with the struggle
Remember praying to get in there saying rap to my brothers
And now I, got the whole world listening
Give your ear for a second a life changing decision
Every other minute thoughts run through my mind
'bout how bad I wanted this but I cannot waste time
So I'm trapped in the beat, stuck on every line
Nothing else matters, except my next rhyme
You can never understand all the pressure I'm against
Getting high thinking how to make it better than your last shit

Might have a mental breakdown
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on

I float on
Let's go, hop up in the Chevy four-door, let's roll

Remember back when mommy sent me for the Wonder Bread
And niggas jumped me stomped on my fucking head
It's like I learned right then you either sink or you swim
And to beat your enemy, you gotta think like them
So I was up late breaking day with the gremlins
Music in my heart but my thoughts wouldn't listen
Hood outta bye-bye cause rap shit was sci-fi
So I'm tormented with the things I seen with these eyes
Can't get a wink 'less I'm leaning off of syrup
Dreaming of my past like a nightmare so I wake up
Staring at the ceiling with this feeling that won't go away
Until the verse is done wrote all day but them shit's throwaway
So I'm breaking day sniffing Adderall writing
And not for the money for the life after dying
Pray I get old just to hear I been the future
Just to see my influence in this genre of music

And might make it to see somehow
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on

That salvation lets their wings unfold

I'm loving angels instead

A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong

For our captors there, require of our songs
And our tormentors mirth

For our captors there, require of our songs

Saying, sing us one of the songs of Zion
Sing us one of the songs of Zion
Sing us one of the songs of Zion

In a foreign land?

Charlie Anson,"Well, that was some performance you gave at the Albert's Dam
Oh Sri Lanka, hilarious 
And by the way you missed nothing after leaving

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
Spend my life in the shade of the morning sun

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion

And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow

Of the things that cost you too much",True Faith,2016

And there we are, swearing to love forever,

The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?

But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

And Jacques and Antoine got into a fight,
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light,

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic,1992
Charlie Barnet & His Orchestra,"You always hurt the one you love
The one you shouldn't hurt at all
You always take the sweetest rose
And crush it till the petals fall

So If I broke your heart last night, 
It's because I love you most of all",You Always Hurt the One You Love,1992
Charlie Barnet & His Orchestra,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Cherokee,1997

She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Charlie Biddle,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2007
Charlie Biddle,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2007

Pero ya lo sabe que el show se robó
Ella lo sabe que el show se robó

Ella lo sabe que el show se robó

Todavía ella lo jura que nadie la vio
Pero ya lo sabe que el show se robó
Ella lo sabe que el show se robó
Ella lo sabe que el show se robó

Ella lo sabe que. Ella lo sabe qué

Ella lo sabe cada vez que baila
Ponle el cinturón porque la curva es ancha
Ingrediente natural que no deja mancha
Lo que estrujamos bailando después lo planchas

Lo que te dedico ma', no es pa darte guille
Y aunque te lo des ya yo sé dónde es que tú vives
Tú eres de la que baila hasta los jingles
Buscas también que te monten por encima el finger

Además del baile viene el momento de ocio
Que al verte caminando se te marca todo un gran negocio
Desde que te vi yo te quiero pegar
Pero paso por tu la'o y comienza a pichar

Ella sabe que yo le quiero perrear,
Pero me le pego y empieza a caminar
Y yo busco la forma de que preste atención
Convencerla de verdad que es una misión

Dale vente nena, ya te robaste el show
Vamos a vacilar, tu me entiende, you know
Yo se que te gusta, que yo le meta con flow
Entonces vamos para un sitio, donde nobody knows

Una llamadita provoca que tú salgas
Con el corto pantalón por encima ‘e las nalgas
Sabes que de esa forma me provocas tú
Tu me vuelves loco cuando mueve' el boom boom

Todavía ella lo jura que nadie la vio
Pero ya lo sabe que el show se robó

Es que si tú la ves
No lo puedes creer la nena se acicala, papi a otro nivel (Por encima)
Y tiene un corte de asesina y de intocable a la vez
De primera crees que no se va poder

Pero una vez la conoces tu pensamiento cambia
Te das cuenta que ya es toda una diabla. (Ja, ja, ja)
De nada te sirve tu labia
La chica es todo una sabia

Así que la mires o no la mires sigue haciendo piquetua
Y tú saliste hoy en busca de sepultura
Así que enfoca tu verdura en dirección de la apertura
Y dale duro que para eso hay puntos de sutura

Eso se cura con un sobito con Vicks
Me pide estar en mi agenda, every week
No sé qué es lo que le gusta a ti de mí
Me agarra duro como si me fuera a ir

Pa donde voy yo me quedo aquí perreando
Sé que te está gustando lo que te estoy dando
Y no vengas a darte guille que eso no va contigo
Deja de estar fronteando por tener grande el fondillo

Ella se hace la que no sabe na'
Se deja ver cuando está entre las sábanas
Así que no te dejes antes que otro sea el que se le pegue
Boom, castígala como se debe

Look what I turned out to be
I wonder if my mama really means it when she says that she's proud of me
Or is she tripping, is she lying
Is she on to all my lies? Mean that shit ain't rocket science
I've been coming home at four, and my eyes been red as sirens
I miss slurring all my words when she asked me how my night went
I swear it's them white boys, it's them white boys
Everything they do is so much doper than my life been
I don't got that type of money, I don't got that finance
She's like, why you so lazy trying to get by
Back before I smoked, I wasn't even tryna get high
Cigarette breaks at lunch time
Bong rips to my face, I passed out at Dave's place
In the morning tryna get right

Some say you pretentious but I call it class
Prep school boys with their collars popped
Coming through the spot, always see you with your sleeves rolled up
Even with a uniform
I could never do the norm
How could I forget? I be on some shit

Me livrei de tudo aquilo e consegui mudar
Tudo que foi feito em troca de uma amizade mas 

Foi quando te encontrei 
Ouvindo o som e olhando o mar
Foi quando te encontrei 
Ouvindo o som do mar rolar 

Eu não preciso de promessas 
E acho que você também,
Eu não tento ser perfeito 
E acho que você também
Dias e noites, pensando no que fiz
Eu sou um vencedor
Eu lutei pelo o que eu quis
Mas quando não se pode mais mudar tanta coisa errada
Vamos viver os nossos sonhos
Temos tão pouco tempo 

Foi quando te encontrei
Ouvindo o som e olhando o mar
Foi quando te encontrei
Ouvindo o som do mar rolar

Foi quando te encontrei,
Ouvindo o som e olhando o mar
Foi quando te encontrei
Ouvindo o som do mar rolar

Foi quando te encontrei,
Ouvindo o som e olhando o mar

arrastou 
Os homens de preto acionam o dedo,

Pra frente aqui vou eu e quem não se envolveu 
O meu é partidário vacilou quem prometeu 
O ambiente na quebrada é quente meu 
Entardeceu vacilou na festa é problema seu

Que eu não presto, que sou um marginal
Que eu não educação, que eu só falo palavrão,

E aprende o que é raiz, então cria consciência

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

That makes thrice, let's make it four!

If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.

I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love.

Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
Is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
And when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
And if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,

Io capisco male oppure siete voi
Mi stupisco sempre per tutto quanto
Mi incupisco sempre perchè già lo so
Se mi metto a scrivere son già le sei
Spengo la candela, spengo quell’incenso
Spengo la mia testa e tutto ciò che ha dentro
Svengo nel letto e compenso
Svengo nel letto e contemplo
Sì, come se fosse un decesso
Siamo delle pile, delle pile vuote
Venti pile vuote le riverso sopra il blocco note
Fiume in piena, catene di edera sopra la schiena
Sì le mie radici me le tengo appresso
Sono morto così tante volte
Tanto da scordarmi di chi fossi
Devo ritrovar me stesso
Tu c’hai le botte sul telefono
No, mica come me che c’ho le bozze sul telefono (seh)

Pago l’affitto per me e per mia madre

Li lascio affogare mentre prendo il volo
E divento un puntino lontano nel cielo che stanno a guardare
Nei messaggi privati lei mi chiama “Papi”

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Charlie Christian,"Days can be sunny with never a sigh
Don't need what money can buy

I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man

Charlie Christian Quartet,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2011
Charlie Cobb,"I sparkle
Loving the way that I do
(It is true) I feel so good
Just having you
Breathlessly and eager
Submission isn't easy for me

I always known it could be

Don't want to do nothing
Tied against your will
This ain't no cheap thrill
You got to know just how it feel
And if you think your going to fall
All you have to do is call
I have nothing in my self
And I give my self to you

Say child tingle sparkle
I hope the love never breaks away
Keep the fire burning everyday
Save all the warmth for you

Just want you to know 
When your jealousy shows
Understand there will be no other man
But you, baby
You can believe
This love in me
As I believe in you

So much work at first, it goes
How should I walk this earth?
So much worse the further, the further you go

But you're managing, that's how you evened out, out

Keep on walking that line, the fine line
Between a wrong and a right

Is that what you signed for?

To keep you on their side

And how much more can you pass yourself round?

Full moon shining down along the border

Over here by the railroad track
And I wish to the Lord that I was back in Georgia
Blue water in the indian sun,
Calling me when the day is done
Mama mama pray for your son
All of my life I've been told
That the LA streets was paved with gold
Fame and fortune waiting to reward ya
But it didn't take long to understand
California ain't the promised land
But at least a man's a man in georgia
Blue skys in the mornin' there
And there's green trees and breathin' air
Rockabye in my easy chair
Well it seems every river in the Georgia moonlight
Flowing up where folks are free
Tthe sun comes up through the lonely pine trees
Over 'round the Kingsland ridge
I maybe here but my mind is still
About 90 miles north of Jacksonville
Well I may not make it, it's a long long road
But mama I've paid all the debts I owe
And if I don't you know they gonna find me tryin'

They made me hard and they made me old

The old Calcutta show had to wear clothes,
Would they still come all the way from Kokomo,

For the Black Panther Party of America to be merged with the Ku Klux Klan,
If Richard Nixon made Spiro Agnew
The new ambassador to Timbuktu,

It would prove his relationship with CBS,
What if Lester Maddox was to pass a law,
That the black population of Georgia had to be moved into Arkansas,

Would they ask the government for federal aid to buy pickaxe handles and razorblades,

Charlie Daniels,"I was takin' a trip out to LA
Toolin' along in my Chevrolet
Tokin' on a number and diggin' on the radio

Jes' as I cross the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to go

Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
'Cause there wasn't a fillin' station in sight
So I jes' limped down the shoulder on the rim

I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
A kind of a redneck lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn

Well I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one

There was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place 'cept for him an' me
And he just looked disgusted an' pointed toward the telephone

I called up the station down the road a ways
And he said he wasn't very busy t'day
And he could have somebody there in jest 'bout ten minutes or so

He said now you jes' stay right where yer at and I didn't bother
Tellin' the durn fool 
I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go

I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in an' said who owns this car
With the peace sign the mag wheels and four on the floor

Well he looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd jus wait outside
So I layed a dollar on the bar and headed for the door

Jes' when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin
These five big dude come strollin' in
With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth

An' I was almost to the door when the biggest one
Said you tip your hat to this lady son
An' when I did all that hair fell out from underneath

Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night
'Specially when there was three of them and only one of me

Well they all started laughin' and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I'd better think of somethin' pretty quick
So I jes' reached out an' kicked ol' green-teeth right in the knee

He let out a yell that'd curl your hair
But before he could move I grabbed me a chair
And said watch him folks 'cause he's a thouroughly dangerous man

Well you may not know it but this man's a spy
He's an undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan

He was still bent over holdin' on to his knee
But everyone else was lookin' and listenin' to me
And I layed it on thicker and heavier as I went

I said would you beleive this man has gone as far
As tearin' Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars
And he voted for George McGoveren for president

Well he's a friend of them long-haired hippie type pinko fags
I betcha he's even got a Commie flag
Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage

He's a snake in the grass I tell ya guys
He may look dumb but that's jus a disguise
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage

They all started lookin' real suspicious at him
And he jumped up an' said jes' wait a minute Jim
You know he's lyin' I've been livin' here all of my life

I'm a faithfull follower of Brother John Burch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church
And I ain't even got a garage you can call home and ask my wife

Then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy movin' and hopin' I didn't run outta luck

And when I hit the ground I was makin' tracks
And they were jes' takin' my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a twenty an' jumped in an' fired that mother up

Mario Andretti woulda sure been proud
Of the way I was movin' when I passed that crowd
Comin' out the door and headin' toward me in a trot

An' I guess I shoulda gone ahead an' run
But somehow I couldn't resist the fun
Of chasin' them jes' once around the parkin' lot

Well they're headin' for their car but I hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
Well I was slingin' gravel and puttin' a ton of dust in the air

Well I had them all out there steppin' an' a fetchin'
Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catchin'
But I figured I oughta go ahead an split before the cops got there

When I hit the road I was really wheelin'
Had gravel flyin' and rubber squeelin'
An' I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas

I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped

Play, let the blind man play

And no one cried when the blind man died, with the name that no one knew
They made his coffin outta knotty pine, with a wreath of laurel too

Drives a '36 Cord with a rumble seat.

And chases it down with Thunderbird wine.
Carries brass knuckles and a .44,
Runs a loan shark business and a mary jane store.
He's a jitterbug; keeps movin', don't sit still;
If the law don't get him, some gun-totin' irate husband will.

Back the way I came I was returning.
And then I saw me standing just across the river,
Just across the bridge that I'd left burning.

Back to the laughing green of summer days,
Back to the chilly golden autumn haze
To a place called yesterday.

We're gonna strike up the band;

Purple shadows fall across the countryside,
We could get together for a rainbow ride.

Bright and breezy, nice and easy.

Hold on while the music takes you way up high;
We can race the moon across the evening sky;
See the night time rainbow colors flying by.

Just an old boy from Memphis with a big diamond ring:
A country girl's prayer and a city girls dream;
Hail the king

But its all right now
Keep on singin' loud

The sixties came in with a bang and a roar.

Two weary strangers moving slow
Were looking for a place to stay
But there was no place
Though they traveled many miles
So Mary being great with Child
Lay down on the sweet smelling hay
Then a bright light fell from heaven
As a special star shone bright
And three wise men from a foreign land
Came to worship him that night
And in the clear night you could hear the angels sing
Praises to the newborn King
Jesus is the light of the world.

And the angels heralding the Holy Birth
Were singing Peace to men on Earth
Unto you is born a Son
And the shepherds
Though they had their flocks to tend
Journeyed unto Bethlehem
To behold the Holy One

And then the Boy grew up to be a Man
Come to set the captives free
Come to heal the sick and raise the dead
And to cause the blind to see
And the best part is even though
He's gone away
He'll be coming back someday

Tonight were forbid
For tomorrow he must fight once more

As he knelt to pray
He said God grant me this nothing more

And I must die today
Let me die like a Toreador

Rushed the hot blood to his Spanish heart

As he flirted with death
And the bull fighter's sword found it's mark

And trying to hide
The wound in his side
He walked from the ring standing tall

And a crowd gathered round
As he fell to the ground

Where he lay in the sand
And he was heard to say
A brave bull died today
But he died like a Toreador",El Toreador,1980

And like my brother above me who took a rebel stand

Just one thing stayed on my mind
To ride a white horse, over Durango Mountain
And leave Sweetwater, Texas behind

But I turned 21, in Sweetwater, Texas
But just one thing made me stay there
I wanted to leave but I was in love with
The girl with the chestnut brown hair

Then came a time, when she said she'd be mine
And go any place, any time
So we rode a gray dog, over Durango Mountain
And left Sweetwater Texas behind

It was thunderin' and lightnin' when we left Nolan County
The bus rolled along through the night
And Old 36, was the magic black [Incomprehensible]
Leading towards the stadium lights

Well we pulled into Houston at ten in the morning
Our hopes were a high as the sky
But hope turned to weeks, then to years, then forever
I never knew how fast time goes by

Cowboys in cars and country girls in bars
Somehow, it just don't seem fair,
And I wanted to die 'cause I knew I was losing,
The girl with the chestnut brown hair

So many times I've said, I'd rather be dead,
Than take it down and go back, and unclear my head
But if the good Lord sees his way to let me live one more day
I'm so tired of being alone

Gonna ride a white horse over Durango Mountain
And make Sweetwater, Texas my home

but he grabbed him by the collar and he pushed him to the wall,
He said you try to run away, you gone regret it, all your life,

The Cajun started laughin when the pimp pulled out a knife,
He said I oughtta kill ya, but I'm gonna spare your life,
With one sledgehammer fist he knocked him sprawlin on the floor,
and then he kicked him in his forked end, and he headed for the door,
He walked on down the sidewalk and hit the Southern trail,
He went back to Louisiana and he walked into the jail,
He said I had some business up above the bunkie line,
but my debts have all been settled and I've come to do my time,
and I hope I didnt cause no trouble, I wasnt tryin to run away,
But a feller owed me somethin and I had to make him pay,
Besides I'm kind of proud I been a coonass, all my life",Ragin' Cajun,1982

I even played that music when I'm laying in bed,
it never did get me anywhere at all, but it makes me kinda proud.

Charlie Daniels,"Stroker Ace was born to race he had a mean streak two feet wide
A son of a gun with a taste for fun and more than his share of pride
Take a dirt road curve with a devils nerve make a car dance across the mud
Haulin? shine was his regular line till the track got in his blood

Was a real hot shot and he bragged a lot, but man that fool could drive
'Cause he loved the feel of the steering wheel
And the girls with bedroom eyes
And in a race of time or a bar room fight, Ol? Stroker stole the show
A back stretch blazer, a real hell raiser and a racetrack Romeo

Mama lock your daughters up that vile bunch is back in town
And them little girls get frisky when they hear that race car sound
They're bringing out the yellow flag, somebody?s brakes have failed
There's an alsike on the inside and a wreck along the rail
You'd better stand on it Stroker 'cause a bandit?s on your tail

It?s a dynamite joy for a country boy when he hears them engines moan
But you've gotta hang tough when it gets real rough
When you're out there on your own 'cause they'll push you down
They'll knock you down, they'll shove you up against the wall
And you always know when the engine blows that a man can't win ?em all

You can push that car just a little too far any Sunday afternoon
And if you'd break your neck in some damn fool wreck
They'd forget about you soon
But Ol? Stroker Ace was born to race and it?s worth all the trying
Just the dirt champagne in the victory lane and to hear that concrete whine

Stroker get your dander up this ain't no time to laugh
You've got to make the lap up if you're gonna take that checkered flag
Number 10 is closin? in to even up the score
It?s time to wave bye bye and put the pedal on the floor
You'd better stand on it Stroker 'cause your blowin? off their doors

Blow their doors off Stroker
Stand on it, son
Ah, you good lookin? devil you
",Stroker's Theme,1983
Charlie Daniels,"See that man in the field over yonder
With dirt on his hands and a loan on his back
He's the man that puts the food on your table
He's the man that grows the clothes on your back
Were running a mile out of the house he was born in
Tending on the sidelines and watching him fall
Selling his land to the big corporations
What you gonna do when they get it all

He's been rolled for sure treated like a outlaw
Turned down sold out, put out to graze
He's been pushed you know when he can push no more
It gets a little harder everyday

[Chorus]
He's the American farmer
And he damn hard to beat
Better wake up America, wake up America
'Cause if the man don't work then the people don't eat

He's sending the high tech stuff of to Russia
I can't figure what where doing it for
We should be sending the wheat and meat and cotton
'Cause that man in the middle of city
Eatin' outta garbage cans, sleepin' in the street
See that baby, moping in the kitty
To make ends meet

It's a damn disgrace on the face of America
Hungry people everywhere you go
Children in Africa starving by the fields
While the land lays fallow and the banks foreclose

Take this stranger on to Santa Fe
It seems like romance and danger
Follow this here tall dark stranger all along the way

Well, the train was rumblin' through the night heading south to Santa Fe
And in a fancy car with a private bar and a personal valet
There was a bunch of cold eyed men sittin' at a poker table
Bettin' hot stakes all around

Ole Louisiana Lou had a knife in his shoe was dealin""
A hand of cards and ole Stagger Lee Crocket had a gun in his pocket
Was sweatin' bettin' hard and over in the corner this Mexican guy
With two gold teeth and a patch on his eye took a long hard look around

And then the door flew open, the stranger walked in
Said, ""don't y'all get excited, I know this here's a private game
And I know I wasn't invited but I got a roll that""d choke a mule
I'm just about a big enough fool to lay it all right down

And everybody nodded as the stranger took his seat
He knew this bunch of cutthroat""s would be mighty hard to beat
As the stranger knew then the toughest two by far were where he sat
Was a pot belly fellow from south Alabama and a dude in a black felt hat

Well, clear them tracks and keep that whistle blowin'

And the pot-belly fellow drew a pair of queens but the stranger
He drew aces and he kept on raising and pushin' his luck
Kept on winning like a run away truck he was giving them a beating

And the stakes got higher than a Chinese kite, the stranger
Kept getting hot till every cent everybody had was lying out in the pot
And then the stranger threw down a royal flush, somebody said
""Hey man, that's enough friend I think you've been cheatin'""

And then the stranger picked the money up and said, ""Boys I better run""
And then the pot-bellied fella pulled a razor out, somebody pulled a gun
They said, ""You may think you're a sly old fox, you're gonna leave here
In a long pine box if you don't leave that money alone""

Just about then the lights went out and they all started fussin'
And the lights came on, the stranger was gone, they all started cussin'
And they searched that train from front to rear
That stranger he done disappeared and all their money was gone

When the train pulled in the station, with the whistle blowin' loud
A telegram was waitin' from the stranger for the crowd
Said ""Thank you for the money boys but don't feel too outdone
'Cause it takes a dog to know a dog I'm a howlin' son of a gun""

What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

And I like my chicken fried

Ain't nothin' but a workin' man
And he makes his livin' 
By the sweat of his brow
And the calluses on his hands

But there ain't nothin' that you can do
'Cause there's a whole lot more of us common-folks
Then there ever will be of you

Charlie Daniels,"If you ever go back into Wooly Swamp son you better not go at night
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That'd make a strong man die from fright
There's things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground
And they say the ghost of Lucias Clay gets up and it walks around.

But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain.

The old man lived in the Wooly Swamp way back in the gurgling woods
And he never did do a lot of harm in the world
But he never did do no good
People didn't think too much of him
They all thought he acted funny
The old man didn't care about people anyway
All he cared about was his money.
He'd stuff it all down in Mason jars and bury it all around
But on certain nights if the moon was right
He'd dig it up out of the ground.
He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack
And run his fingers through it.
Old Lucias Clay was a greedy old man
And that's all there ever was to it.

But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain.

The Crayton boys were white trash they lived over on Parvis Creek
They were a real snake and sneaky as a cat
And belligerent when they'd speak.
One night the oldest brother said ya'll meet in the Wooly Swamp later
We'll get old Lucias' money and we'll feed him to the alligators.
They found the old man out in the back with a shovel in his hand
And thirteen rusty Mason jars he just dug up out of the sand.
And they all went crazy and they beat the old man
Then they picked him up off the ground
Then they threw him in the swamp and they stood there and laughed
Till the black water sucked him down.
Then they turned around and went back to the shack
And they picked up the money and ran.
But they hadn't gone nowheres when they realized
They were running in quicksand.
And they struggled and screamed but they couldn't get away
Then just before they went under
They could hear that old man laughing
In a voice that was loud as thunder.

Now that's been fifty years ago an' if you go back by there again
There's a spot in the yard in back of that shack
Where the ground is always wet.
And on certain nights if the moon is right
And you're down by the dark footpath
You can hear three yound men screaming
And you can hear that old man laugh.

Charlie Daniels,"Me and my buddy got us a wild hair
And figured we wanted to go somewhere
So we loaded up in my rag top Chevrolet
We had a little bit of money 
And a whole lot of show
And with Hank Jr. blaring on the radio
We got us a tank full of gas
And we was on our way

We figured we'd go down to New Orleans
We were barreling down old 17
When a man with a blinking red light 
Was on our tail
He said you were doing 60 in a 45
But I'm gonna let you go this time
But if I catch you again
I'm gonna slap you in the county jail

We said thank you sir you sure been nice
And you ain't gonna have to tell us twice
And we were Southbound and down with the wind 
Blowing in our faces
We kept on rolling and pretty soon
The radio was cooking out a Haggard tune
And we were pulling into Houston
Checking out all them places

I was feeling dry and I said I think
We ought to stop and get ourselves a drink
And old Jim said yeah 'cause we got time to kill
We kept on rolling and I seen this spot
And we pulled into the parking lot
Of this place called the Cloud Nine Bar and Grill

We walked through the door
And the place was jammed
The lights were low they had a punk rock band
And some orange haired feller singing about suicide
I said Jim this ain't our kind of place
He said well let's just have one round anyway
So against my better judgment we walked on inside
Went up to the bar and we sat down
This feller walked up and said I'll buy this round
And he sat down on the bar stool next to Jim

He looked like a girl but he talked like a guy
He had lipstick on and mascara in his eyes
And everybody in that place looked just about like him
I said Jim this ain't our kind of bar
Let's just go on out and get back in the car
Cause there's gonna be trouble 
Ain't no sense in taking a chance
We was getting up getting ready to leave 
When somebody grabbed old Jim by the sleeve 
And this good looking girl was asking my buddy to dance

I said Jim don't do it there's something missing
There's fellers dancing and fellers kissing
There's a feller in high heeled shoes wearing panty hose
He said partner I just can't turn this down
You just go over there and have one more round
And I'll dance with the lady 
And we'll get on down the road

So he walked away and left me alone
But this funny looking feller kept coming on
And he was making me mad with some of the things he said
Then he put his hand on my knee
I said if you don't get your paw off me 
I'm gonna locate your nose around
The other side of your head

He said I love it when you get that fire in your eye
I said well partner try this on for size
And I unloaded on him and he went out like a light
Everybody in that place must have been his friend
They all headed for me I said this is the end
But where I come from we don't give up 
Without a fight

They were screaming and yelling and scratching and clawing
I was punching and hitting and kicking and pawing
I was holding my own 'cause I've been in a scrap or two
Old Jim come running up out of the blue
And that gal he was with come running up too
And proceeded to beat on me with a high heel shoe

I grabbed her by the hair it came off in my hand
And that beautiful girl was just a beautiful man
And old Jim just got sick right there on the floor

He dropped that dude like a shot from a gun
Smeared his lipstick made his makeup run
And me and old Jim started fighting our way to the door

We lit out of there in that Chevrolet
I put in on the floor and it stayed that way
We were going down the highway 
Doing about a hundred and ten
We were headed for home and we was getting nearer
Then a red light came on the rear view mirror
And that same blame cop was pulling us over again

Now I'm sitting here in this county jail
I had to call my daddy to go our bail
But I learned me a lesson 
That I never will forget again
I've done give up drinking I've give up bars
And running around the country in souped up cars
I'm going back where the women are women
And the men are men",Uneasy Rider '88,1989
