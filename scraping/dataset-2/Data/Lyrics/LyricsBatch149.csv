Dinu Radu,"She laughed in my face, told me good-bye
Said ""Don't think about it, you can go crazy
Anything can happen, anything can end
Don't try to fight it, don't try to save me""

[Chorus]
She's a woman in love
And he's gonna break her heart to pieces
She don't want to see
She's a woman in love, but it's not me

Well alright, do what you want
Don't try to talk, don't say nothin'
She used to be the kind of woman
You have and you hold, she could understand the problem
She let the little things go

[Chorus]

Time after time, night after night
She would look up at me
And say she was lonely
I don't understand the world today
I don't understand what she needed
I gave her everything she threw it all away
On nothin'
She's a woman in love",Woman in Love,2008
Dio,"Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind 
It looks like a long, long way to fall 
No one ever told me life was kind 
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all 
Living in a world of make believe 
I can hide behind what's real 
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve 
And they all know what you feel 
And here it comes again 
Straight through the heart 
Straight through the heart 
Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes 
It's the eyes that let you down 
Tell a little truth with many lies 
It's the only way I've found 
Oh here it comes again 
Straight through the heart 
Straight through the heart 

Shout to the wind 
How can you hurt me this way 
Oh once it begins 
It looks like it's coming to stay 
Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind 
It looks like a long, long way to fall 
No one ever told me life was kind 
I Guess I never heard it, never heard it all, no! 
But here it comes again 
Straight through the heart 
Straight through the heart 
Straight through the heart 
Here it comes again 
Straight through the heart 
In the middle of the heart 
Now don't stand still, they'll get you 
Right through your heart 
And here it comes, here it comes again 
Straight through the heart",Straight Through the Heart (Live),
Dio,"Look away from the sea
I can take you anywhere
Spend a vision with me
A chase with the wind

Move closer to me
I can make you anyone
I think you're ready to see
The gates of Babylon

The power of what has been before
Rises to trap you within
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more
A city of heavenly sin
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away
Oh gates of Babylon

You can see but you're blind
Someone turned the sun around
But you can see in your mind
The gates of Babylon

You're riding the endless caravan
Bonded and sold as a slave
A sabre dance removing all the veils
Getting as good as you gave
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away

Look away from the sea
I can take you anywhere
Spend a vision with me
A chase with the wind

Move closer to me
I can make you anyone
I think you're ready to see
The gates of Babylon

The power of what has been before
Rises to trap you within
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more
A city of heavenly sin
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away
Black gates of Babylon

The devil is me
And I'm holding the key
To the gates of sweet hell
Babylon",Gates of Babylon,
Dio,"Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's heaven and hell
Oh well

The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell
I can tell
Fool, fool

Oh uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and on

They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's heaven and hell, oh well

And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh no

Fool, fool
You've got to bleed for the dancer
Fool, fool
Look for the answer
Fool, fool, fool",Heaven & Hell,
Dio,"If there isn't light when no one sees
Then how can I know what you might believe? 
A story told that can't be real
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeah

Fade away, fade away
Vanish into small
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball - oh!

It's the sign
Feels like the time!

On a small world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
If an echo darts in dancer
When it hears a certain song
Then the beast is free to wander
But never is seen around

And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
All right
Sail away
To the sign
Oh

From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong
Reach above your dreams of pleasure
Given life to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
Sail the ship of signs

And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball
Fade away, fade away
I can't accept it anymore

On a real world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow, see it shimmer
When the summer falls
From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong!

It's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross

Don't live for pleasure
Make life your treasure
Fade away!
Eight miles high, about to fall
And no one there to catch you
Look for the sign, the time
The sign of the southern cross, yeah",Sign of the Southern Cross,

She had fourteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before

And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it said

You can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisible

Well I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before

You've stolen the day, snatched it away
But I saw the sky and I never want to die
Now you know the reason why

Dio,"Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow

You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ran

You'll feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all

Flying away int the clouds
You know you're loosing your control
And finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul

You'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're

Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flow

You can feel it
You can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're

Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Like the rush of a thunder
That brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle
You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm
You break it off in the middle",Caught in the Middle,1983
Dio,"She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white

Well I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail

When I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail

You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy

Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within

And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
And need to have a little sin

So I'm ridin'
Well I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen

Well she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by the light

So she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right

I'm still ridin'

Dio,"It has been a thousand years since the once powerful
planet of Blessing lost its life-giving two suns, and
countless millennia since the days of the great
magicians. An expedition of alien voyagers came upon
the now ice-covered sphere, drawn there by an
unexplained lone beacon far below the miles of frozen
moisture, they unlocked a written history of Blessing
from its almost undiscovered tomb. So begins the story
of Magica.

It was a time of celebration. The Book of Magica and
the wizards who had used its spells so wisely for the
good of the people were being honored in all the great
cities of the world. There was however an exception.
Where good thrives, evil survives and evil has plans
for survival.

The celebration of thanks and prosperity would signal
the forces of Evilsyde to begin the attack and
ultimate capture and destruction of Magica. The spells
from the Book would be used to turn all of those
unwilling to join Evilsyde into statues of stone and
send their spirits to Otherworld, where they would
eventually be assimilated into the energy needed to
drive Evilsyde, and maintain its power without the
necessity of the Book and its incantations forever.

Defenses were naturally relaxed during the festive
preparations and although the battle was well-fought
by both factions, the minions of the dark prevailed.
Their assault was well-planned and executed to a
fault. After overwhelming their initial opposition,
they pushed on to the sacred ground upon which the
Book of Magica rested. They possessed a much weaker
form of magic themselves, and although it would be
normally quite useless against the strength of Magica,
the inability of the Wizards to gather themselves
together in time, coupled with the perfect timing and
determination of the attackers, spelled doom for the
Book and its followers.

The leader of the insurrection was the high priest and
executioner known as Shadowcast. His presence could
make the naughtiest of children become obedient and
inspire great fear among the adult population. This
man, most vile, would now be ruler of all and
answerable to none. His reign would plunge Blessing
into eternal darkness and prepare the way for the
coming of his master, Astoroth, the Grand Duke of Hell.

The capture of Magica did not, however, mean that
Shadowcast had finally reached his goal. He must now
find and conquer Blessing's Grand Wizard and legendary
hero, Eriel. Eriel, who defeated Evilsyde time and
again with his understanding and use of Magica's
spells. He would be the last stumbling block of total
domination.

Eriel had removed himself from the general population
in anticipation of everlasting peace and now he
devoted all of his energy to meditation and praise of
his God. Lately though, he had been visited by many
temptations in his dreams. Promises of pleasure,
riches and power raced through his sleeping mind. All
these lures had been placed there by Shadowcast,
hoping to avoid confrontation between this dominant
man and his own villainous forces. Eriel however had
resisted these solicitations and was now warned of
some impending danger. He managed to make his way to
the sacred ground by cloaking his identity with simple
spells, only to be discovered just before his attempt
to rescue the Book of Magica, but not before he was
able to memorize the most important of Magica's
charms, The spell of Restoration.

The ceremony of thanksgiving was now directed toward
the transmission of spirits to Otherworld. One by one
the good souls of Blessing were turned to stone and
sent on to their grisly fate, until only the noble
Eriel remained. The spectacle that followed was meant
to degrade Eriel and raise the courage of the cowardly
supplicants of Evilsyde, but true to his
indominantable bearing, he promised to return and
banish Evilsyde forever. Then he was gone.

The horrors of Otherworld are now revealed to the
masses huddled together for some small measure of
comfort. First the adults were separated from their
children amid cries and pleas for help. Next the old
ones were taken away and assigned to a place very near
the assimilation site. They were guarded by monstrous,
misshapen denizens of this shrouded netherland, who
constantly harangued the inmates with promises of pain
and extermination. Intermittent bursts of flame shot
up from jagged cracks in the ground, threatening to
consume anyone in its path. Shrieks of torment could
be heard piercing the murky atmosphere, further
unnerving the petrified captives. Only one seemed
unaffected by all the inflicted fear and turmoil.

Eriel's strength and determination soon pacified the
men and women with whom he was confined. When they all
became more calm and subdued, he began to speak to
them softly as an adult to his children. ""Long ago you
entrusted me to protect the Book of Magica and to be
faithful to its special purpose. It must seem that I
have failed you and condemned us all to oblivion, but
fear not! This hell is only a test of your faith and
resolve. The power of Magica did not vanish in fire.
On the third day I will evoke the spell of
Restoration. United we shall return to Blessing and,
armed with the strength of Magica, we will be
triumphant. Many will perish, but Magica and our souls
cannot be restored until three days have passed. Take
heart my friends. Victory awaits you.""

Even magic has its limitations and as Eriel explained
to his flock, the spell could not be activated until a
waiting period of at least three days. One third of
the souls of Blessing would be melded into the
Evilsyde collective before Eriel could be effective
with the words of Restoration.

The old ones were the first to go. Cries of
encouragement and hope were shouted to the condemned
as they trudged slowly to their fate. One by one they
were thrown into the assimilation chamber where a
blinding blue spark gave evidence of their demise.
With each burst Eriel's heavy heart ached with guilt
for his part in this slaughter of his charges. If only
he had not become so complacent. He above
all should never have let this tragedy transpire.

In the compound holding the young adults, an
insurrection of sorts was occurring. A boy of
seventeen years called Challis was urging an uprising
among his captured companions. Futile though it was,
it earned Challis a place in the cell adjoining
Eriel's. His rantings and ravings were soon quelled by
Eriel's quiet urging and the two settled into serious
conversation. Eriel knew his time of assimilation was
near and only hoped it would not be scheduled before
the three day waiting period for Restoration was
ended. Shadowcast wanted to personally oversee Eriel's
termination but couldn't abandon his duties on Blessing
until all was secure.Would there be enough time?

Eriel realized some of his own strong qualities in
Challis and decided that this was an opportunity not
to be lost. He instructed Challis to remove all anger
from his mind and hate from his heart. Only the pure
could receive and transmit this most important of
spells. Convinced that this young man was ready, he
joined with his spirit and gave him these words.
""Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna,"" Words that would
resurrect the masses if delivered correctly and in time.

Over two days had passed before Shadowcast was ready
for travel to Otherworld to deliver Eriel to his fate.
His journey through Otherworld was marked by what
could pass for cheers, if they weren't shouted from
the mouths of utterly inhuman shapes and forms. Upon
his arrival he instructed the guards to take him
straight to Eriel. Once there he announced with great
satisfaction that he would personally supervise
Eriel's execution in a matter of hours. Nearby,
Challis loudly voiced his objection to this treatment
of his newly met hero and was rewarded by kicks and
punches until he could no longer speak. Eriel's heart
sank. Had he misjudged Challis and entrusted his
people's future to a reckless youth? Eriel's mind
wandered to his own younger days. He too had been
restless and foolhardy, but in time had outgrown these
traits and become the adored leader of Blessing. He
wondered if Challis had yet experienced love. Eriel
himself had turned his back on the beautiful and
innocent Annica. She was his intended from birth, but
he couldn't let love for this saintly child cloud his
duties to Blessing and the Book.

One hour remained in the wait for Restoration. Eriel's
hopes were soaring. Surely Shadowcast would fail once
again. But as that thought surfaced, so did Evilsyde's
dark leader. Eriel was led away with head held high,
but as he passed Challis he gave just the slightest
nod. A gesture that wasn't lost on the youth. Eriel
was then taken to the assimilation chamber and
strapped to the cross-like structure in the middle of
the room. Seconds were all that stood in the way of
resurrection or destruction. Shadowcast walked to
Eriel, presumably to gloat one last time to his old
nemesis. Eriel welcomed the time that would be wasted,
but at the last moment Shadowcast seemed to reconsider
and raised his arm in signal for the end to begin. The
arm dropped and, with crackle and hiss, Eriel was no
more. Shadowcast and his minions erupted with joy.
Never again to be slaves. Now to be masters.

Challis heard the cheering and knew that Eriel had
passed without time to summon the spell. Now only he
could influence the future. He heard the rattling of
armor and realized they were coming for him. Soon the
guards appeared and dragged the struggling Challis
from his confinement. One of his jailers struck him a
mighty blow across the face and suddenly all his anger
left him. He was sure of what he must do. Thunder
starts from silence and he would be thunder.

Challis was taken to the chamber and secured to the
cross. Shadowcast approached him and asked if he had
any last thing to say before assimilation. Challis
smiled and said he did. Then with an evil laugh,
Shadowcast raised his arm and announced that his
question was only a final killing joke. It was now or
never. As the arm fell in signal, Challis shouted out
the spell: ""Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna"" and all
hell actually broke loose. Challis and the good folk
of Blessing were bathed in an incredible rush of
light. Shadowcast and all his wicked throng writhed in
agony in the darkness they were spawned from, as the
fierce illumination sought them out and consumed each
troll, ogre and gargoyle in a horrible melting frenzy.
Shadowcast, hiding in the last black space to be
found, watched the light creep irresistibly toward
him. At the last moment he cloaked his body with his
unpriestly robe and muttered what sounded like an oath
as the light touched the cloth. The robe erupted into
flame and then there was nothing. Surely Shadowcast
was also consumed by fire! But that tale would not yet
be told. Now as each remaining citizen of Blessing was
transported instantly back to their home, they found
themselves standing among thousands of recognizable
stone statues. These monuments represented their
fallen comrades and would ever be a lasting testament
to the dangers of evil and the power of Magica.

Now came the time of mourning. Funeral pyres
brightened the night sky for weeks and songs of sorrow
could be heard across the land long after the flames
had sputtered and died. When the prolonged periods of
grieving had ended, the citizens and their council
directed attention to the task of anointing a new
leader and protector of the restored Book of Magica.
The choice seemed a simple one. Challis had
resurrected the populace and the Book, but many
questioned his youth and inexperience.

The debate raged on as the time of choosing approached.
The candidates were summoned to the sacred
place. Eloquent speeches were made on behalf of them
all. Only Challis lacked a champion and it seemed
certain that he would be passed over. ""Will anyone
speak for the boy?"" asked the council. The question
was greeted by silence as the judges turned away to
cast their votes. Then the quiet was broken. A
handsome woman with golden hair, now flecked with
traces of gray, spoke: ""Challis must be chosen. This
is the secret I have carried with me for all these
years. Although I was once rebuffed by my only true
love, Eriel, our brief union produced the young man
standing before you. Eriel was never to know that he
had sired this free spirit, but he will live on
through his son's achievements if you now find him
worthy."" So spoke Annica, mother of Challis.

The decision was now reached quickly. Annica's
revelation left little doubt in the minds of the
councillors that Challis should indeed succeed his
father. Evilsyde had been defeated, Shadowcast was
hopefully destroyed, Challis had been chosen to lead
his people and, despite the huge number of casualties,
the old way of life began again. But, evil does not
easily die. Shadowcast did indeed survive and persist
in his attempts to challenge and conquer Blessing.
Great battles would be fought. Brave heroes would rise
to the occasion and legends were created. There was,
of course, the unforgettable War of the Darkpeace when

Never been to London
Never in a limousine

Something made him go
Could it be the voices
Coming from the radio

But somewhere down the line
The happiness you'll find
Will crash into a wall
Just before the fall

Someone joined the band
But he never heard the music
Couldn't really understand
No, no no

Don't know what they mean
Where's my picture
Shining from a magazine

But somewhere down the line
He'll quickly glance behind
Then smash into a wall
Before the fall

Someone ran so fast
When he saw the future
He was sure that it was just the past

Someone had a dream
Only this one ended lost
Inside the old machine

The same old shadow on the run
That's no shadow, it's your shadow's son

I know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more
Do you need more?

Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock - same old time

There's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Do you want more
Will you need more?

And that's enough to satisfy

Don't ask why

Brave men die
But what a way to go

She's not above
Death by love

One spell from the wishing well
And you're nevermore
Bad start for the sacred heart
Cause the end has come before the beginning

Knee deep in the darkest sleep
But the eyes see all
So high you could break the sky
And never feel the fall to come

What if I'm wrong
But here's what I've been thinking
It must be the end of the world

What ever happened to the rock and roll song
Breaking your brain
Making you stronger
They say you never hear the bullet that kills
And I don't hear a sound

It's not about a change or revolution
What's gone today is still called substitution

Don't get emotional but we're out of time

Looking inside my secrets
Coming through cracks before I mend the wall

Get out - cause you're breaking the law
How did you ever find me
Places where I can hide can't get much smaller

I have invisible dreams
Where no one can touch me
Maybe I'll find a way to disappear

No one moves - and no one dies
Just the eyes

I've run as fast as I can
Thinking they'll never catch me
What a waste of breath a waste of time

Feel like digging a hole
Going in even deeper
Maybe they just can't see what just can't shine

I'll be lost - so no goddbyes
If no one moves then nothing dies
Just the eyes

Oh no - they've done it again
Sending out the detectives
Searching for signs of life and that means me

In my invisible dreams
When no one is watching
I'd make the whole world blind and I'd be free

I'll be lost - so no replies

Just like the words that I've said
Ashes turned to ashes once again

Look for a sign in the air
A light that dances in the sky
Maybe you'll see it somewhere
Oh, shining like a diamond
Promising that hope will never die

I might know the answer
Well, it's back there in my brain
Someday soon I'll be rising again
Higher than the sun

I have been father and son
I cry for children of the night
Just because tears have begun
Beware of quiet voices
Thunder comes from silence - I am light

Oh, look for a sign, is it me
No don't believe with only eyes
Speak to the blind 'cause they see
Truth is just a circle
Spinning round until it meets the lies
Then dies

Dio,"Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's heaven and hell
Oh well

The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell
I can tell
Fool, fool

Oh uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and on

They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's heaven and hell, oh well

And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh no

Fool, fool
You've got to bleed for the dancer
Fool, fool
Look for the answer

Todo casal na vida tem altos e baixos
De vez em quando muda o clima
E haja sentimento, reconhecer o erro

Também tem que sofrer e a vida segue

Fazer amor é um ato divino 
E nem o maior dos poetas define 
Pode completar mudar um destino 

Fazer amor é a entrega perfeita 
É a emoção de uma noite sem fim

Se dá, se encontra, se respeita, sim 
Me realizar e te ver satisfeita 
É bom pra você é bom pra mim 

Amor não é laia laia

Ele acende a chama que um rio não pode apagar
Dançando na roda da vida eu pude encontrar
Luz que a paz ilumina, desejo que vai muito mais além

De lo contrario de ti he vivido agradecido 
Más que todo eres la madre de mis hijos 
Que mañana también te reclamarán 

Todo eso lo tienes que decir en tu libro 
Lo bueno que yo he sido contigo 
Lo mala que tú has sido conmigo 
Más sin embargo, yo he sido lo mejor que has tenido

El día en que nos conocimos, yo te brindé mis respetos 
El mismo que hoy día te tengo, después de tanto tiempo 
Por que has tallado el ejemplo de la madre de Jesús 
Que por medio de una luz, él fue engendrado en su vientre 

Y entonces José también se puso celoso
Por que una voz del cielo le dijo 
María será tu esposa por siempre
Es la mamá del divino Niño

Diómedes Díaz,"Yo sentí en el final del sendero 
El llanto infinito de una mujer 
Que empuñaba un poema en sus manos 
Escrito por alguien que un día conoció 
Era aquel habitante del mundo 
Del alma sensible que quiso tener 
El amor que le fue un imposible 
Y al ver su destino su vida acabó 

Nadie sabe quien tuvo la culpa 
Ella nunca le pudo entregar lo que estaba pidiendo 
Un poquito de cariño, así fuera un instante 
Y aunque quiso, nunca le obedeció el corazón 

Y hoy cantan 
Versos solitarios que nacen de un hombre 
Que se fue volando 
Con alas hechas de ilusiones 
Que no realizó

Dónde está (en el cielo tal vez)
Un amor (señaló su final)
Dónde está (en el cielo tal vez)
Un amor (señaló su final)

Yo encontré en el final del sendero 
Los sueños caídos de aquel corazón 
Que en su afán de encontrar ilusiones 
Sufrió mil engaños tratando de amar 

Y ahora ella recuerda a aquel hombre 
Que puso en sus manos aquella canción 
Y quisiera entregarle su alma 
Pero ya es muy tarde, la cruz fue el final 

Yo no sé si es valiente o cobarde 
La fatal decisión de borrar con su sangre las penas 
Que llegaron por mirar a alguien inalcanzable 
Que no sabe que le ofrecen la felicidad 

Y hoy cuentan que tenía en sus manos 
La foto sagrada de aquella muchacha 
Y un verso a unos ojos negros que nunca cantó

Diómedes Díaz,"Ay qué culpa tengo yo que no hubiera nacido
Qué culpa tengo yo que no hubiera nacido
En una cuna hermosa con varillas de oro
Mis padres son tan pobres que nadita han tenido
Los tuyos son tan ricos y te han dado de todo

Yo soy un hombre humilde de casta provinciana
Que lucho con pujanza por la superación
Nací en la cuna triste que tú desde tu cumbre
La miras con desprecio y rechazas con fervor

Cuna qué destino te ha tocado
Eres un poema de tristeza
Eres cual un niño regañado
Que sólo llorando se consuela
Cuna qué destino te ha tocado
Eres un poema de tristeza
Eres cual un niño regañado
Que sólo llorando se consuela

Ay mi vida siempre ha sido humilde y peregrina
Mi vida siempre ha sido humilde y peregrina
Como aquel campesino sólo tengo esperanza
De demostrarle al mundo que un hombre con orgullo
Es capaz de vencer los fieros que lo atacan
Por eso me perfilo como en son de justicia
Buscando con ellos una gran realidad
Porque no es el destino quien va a mermar mi vida
Ni voy a se' el vencido sino el que vencerá

Cuna qué destino te ha tocado
Eres un poema de tristeza
Eres cual un niño regañado
Que sólo llorando se consuela
Cuna qué destino te ha tocado
Eres un poema de tristeza
Eres cual un niño regañado
Que sólo llorando se consuela

Cuna qué destino te ha tocado
Eres un poema de tristeza
Eres cual un niño regañado
Que sólo llorando se consuela
Cuna qué destino te ha tocado
Eres un poema de tristeza
Eres cual un niño regañado
Que sólo llorando se consuela

Cuna qué destino te ha tocado
Eres un poema de tristeza
Eres cual un niño regañado
Que sólo llorando se consuela
Cuna qué destino te ha tocado
Eres un poema de tristeza
Eres cual un niño regañado
Que sólo llorando se consuela

Cuna qué destino te ha tocado
Eres un poema de tristeza

Porque yo me merezco alguna explicación
Pensé que era imposible que este amor se acabará
Pero ya se acabó

Por favor vuelve ahora
Que si tú no lo haces
Yo pase lo que pase

Te diviertes al verme morir
Suplicando tu amor
Sabes que no soy nadie sin ti
Y hoy me dices adiós

Nunca pero nunca en la vida esperé aquel adiós
Que me duele en el alma, aún te amo
Sin saber qué me espera
Soy capaz de jugarme la vida

Sin misericordia estos amores

Sabes que te quiero y te adoro
No me dejes solo en la vida
Sabes que te quiero y te adoro
No me dejes solo en la vida  

Uno a uno tus pasos
Los seguí hasta encontrarte
Y hoy te tengo otra vez
Aquí estamos tan cerca pero no eres la misma
Te he perdido la fe

Que le guarda el destino a mi vida vacía
Hoy regreso a tu puerto sin saber lo que quieres
Enseguida intenté darte un beso y me has correspondido
Pero mañana sé que eres capaz de tirarme al olvido

Nunca, pero nunca en la vida esperé aquel adiós
Que hoy me duele en el alma
Se que fuiste alegría en mis tristezas
Con tus promesas me diste la vida
Es injusto tu adiós

Sin tener a una muchacha

Dicen que es el sexo débil 
De débil no tiene nada

Diómedes Díaz,"Ay! Perdona morenita que llegue a estas horas 
A interrumpir tus sueños si es que estás dormida 
Pero es que en esta noche siento que mi vida 
Deambula por la calle un poco resentida 
Pa' ver si con mirarte puedo consolarla 

Si tu ventana hablara, te podría decir 
Despierta compañera, deja de dormir 
Que aquí ha llegado un hombre que trajo el alma

Ya se acabaron las penas mías 
Negra, asómate a la ventana
Ya se acabaron las penas mías 
Negra, asómate a la ventana

Si alguien te pregunta que qué era esa bulla 
Que andaba a media noche turbando el silencio 
Le dices que era yo lleno de sentimiento 
Que siempre me aparezco en cualquier momento 
A visitar el barrio solo en busca tuya 

Le dices al vecino que yo a ti te quiero 
Que ya no falta mucho para ser tu dueño 
Que en caso tal perdone si le hago dar rabia

Yo vine solamente para verte a ti 
Me voy muy satisfecho por que ya te vi

Diómedes Díaz,"Voy navegando por este mundo sin mundo fijo 
A ver si encuentro el barco pirata dónde se fue 
Si no le encuentro yo me convierto en un submarino 
Y hasta en el mismo fondo del mar yo la buscaré 

Y si me pierdo en la lejanía de ese mar inmenso 
Díganle a Diana que en busca de ella es que 
Andaba yo 
Yo se que ella se encuentra lejos en estos momentos 
Pero tendrá que volver al puerto donde se embarcó 

Si acaso yo no regreso mas por aquí 
Díganle a Diana si viene porque me fui 
Si acaso yo no regreso más por aquí 
Díganle a Diana que rece y ruegue por mí 
Si acaso yo no regreso más por aquí 
Díganle a Diana si viene porque me fui 
Si acaso yo no regreso más por aquí 
Díganle a Diana si viene porque me fui 

Diana de mi alma cariño mío ven a darte cuenta 
Como he quedado desde ese día que te vi partir 
Y si no vienes seguramente aquí no me encuentras 
Y lo que pasa es que yo sin ti no puedo vivir 

Como te fuiste con la intención de dejarme solo 
Yo te recuerdo y estoy seguro que volverás 
No me da pena decirte Diana que yo te lloro 
Y si no vienes puede matarme la soledad 

Si acaso yo no regreso mas por aquí 
Díganle a Diana si viene porque me fui

Diómedes Díaz,"Ese muchacho que yo quiero tanto 
Ese que yo regaño a cada rato 
Me hizo acordar ayer 
Que así era yo también cuando muchacho 
Que sólo me aquietaban dos pengazos 
Del viejo Rafael 

Y se parece tanto a papá 
Hombre del alma buena 
Y se parece tanto a papá 
Hombre del alma buena 

Se ponía triste al verme llorar 
Y me daba un pedazo de panela 
Y entraba en discusión con mi vieja 
Por que la pobre le reclamaba 
Que porque diablos me maltrataba 
Que dejara al muchacho tranquilo 

Y hoy veo en Rafael Santos mi hijo 
Todavía las costumbres aquellas 
Y hoy veo en Rafael Santos mi hijo 
Todavía las costumbres aquellas 

Recuerdo la cartilla abecedario 
El primer día que al pueblo me mandaron 
Porque era día de fiesta 
Recuerdo que iba tan entusiasmado 
Por que desde que me habían bautizado 
No llegaba a la iglesia 

El 16 de julio es la fiesta 
De la virgen del carmen 
El 16 de julio es la fiesta 
De la virgen del carmen 

Ese fue el día que le escuche al padre 
Que dios a todos nos tiene en cuenta 
Y con deseos también de quedarme 
Pa' allá en la nocha de la caseta 
Y me tocó quedarme en la puerta 
No tenia plata para pagarles 
Por eso es que la vida es un baile 
Que con el tiempo damos la vuelta 
Pero el tiempo acaba la fiesta 
Y me voy solito pa'l valle 

Yo aprendí a trabajar desde pela'o 
Por eso es que yo estoy acostumbrado 
Siempre a vivir con plata 
Y con toda la plata que he ganado 
Cuántos problemas no he solucionado 
Pero nunca me alcanza 

Pa' pagarle a mi viejo la crianza 
Que me dio con esmero 
Pa' pagarle a mi viejo la crianza 
Que me dio con esmero 

Porque en la vida hay cosas del alma 
Que valen mucho más que el dinero
Porque en la vida hay cosas del alma 
Que valen mucho más que el dinero 

Por eso Rafael Santos yo quiero 
Dejarte dicho en esta canción 
Que si te inspira ser zapatero 
Sólo quiero que seas el mejor 
Por que de nada sirve el doctor 
Si es el ejemplo malo del pueblo 

Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy
Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy
Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy

Diómedes Díaz,"La herida q siempre llevo en el alma no cicatriza
inevitable me marca la pena q es infinita
quisiera volar muy lejos muy lejos sin rumbo fijo
buscar un lugar del mundo sin odio vivir tranquilo
eliminar la tristeza las mentiras y las traiciones
no importa q nunca encuentre el corazon
lo q ha buscado de verdad
no importa el tiempo q es ya muy corto y las ancias largas de vivir
cualquier minuto de placer sera sentido en realidad
si lleno el alma si lleno el alma de eternidad
si lleno el alma si lleno el alma de eternidad

es muy triste recordar momentos felices
de un cariÃ±o q sangro mi corazon
y es ya la hora de partir sin medir distancias
y ni sombra quedara de aquel amor
y ni sombra quedara de aquel amor

no quiero volver a verla mas nunca en mi camino
distancia q nos separa q hiere sufro el olvido
es muy cierto q las noches tan largas con mi desvelo
rayito de la maÃ±ana tu sabes cuanto la quiero
solitario en el recuerdo se va alejando mis quejas
amigos q me conocen me diran q es lo q pasa en tu interior
no eres el mismo q conocimos lleno de vida y de ilusion
se nota a leguas de verdad q te lastima el corazon
se nota a leguas q estas sufriendo x un amor
se nota a leguas q estas sufriendo x un amor

es muy triste recordar momentos felices
de un cariÃ±o q sangro mi corazon
y es ya la hora de partir sin medir distancias
y ni sombra quedara de aquel amor
y ni sombra quedara de aquel amor.

Diómedes Díaz,"Yo quisiera volver al pasado y a mis ilusiones
y encontrarme de nuevo tan cerca estrechando tus manos
Y sentir tu mirada, tu voz, las cosas que hablamos
cuando te confesaba que yo morÃ­a por tus amores.

Y era cierto mi vida esa vez sÃ³lo era un sueÃ±o
y en seguida me viste rodar como hojas al viento
era el tiempo en que yo enamorado aun no sabÃ­a
que destino me correspondÃ­a
ser querido o mÃ¡s bien olvidado

Hoy quisiera que por fin te aparecieras
me sonrieras y lloraras con mis penas
y encontrarte algÃºn dÃ­a en otra parte
solitaria frente a frente y saludarte

Y en un arrebato de mi vida loca
darte un besito en la boca
Y en un arrebato de mi vida loca
darte un besito en la boca

Era triste saber que no habÃ­a una razÃ³n en tu vida
para amarme y dejar que algÃºn dÃ­a se cumplieran mis sueÃ±os
Y hasta quise enfrentÃ¡rmele Dios y pedir de rodillas
que dejaras todo por mi amor sin sentir tanto miedo

Duele ahora saber que lo amado no pudo llegar
y es asÃ­ porque Dios lo ha querido y a si lo serÃ¡
Fue imposible tu amor pero creo que algo sentiste
al mirar en mis ojos lo triste que causo mi posible deseo

Hoy quisiera que por fin te aparecieras
me sonrieras y lloraras con mis penas
Cuanto diera por llegar allÃ¡ mi vida
y encontrarte solitaria en esa esquina

Y en un arrebato de mi vida loca
darte un besito en la boca
Y en un arrebato de mi vida loca
darte un besito en la boca

Y en un arrebato de esta loca vida
darte un beso aquÃ­ en la boca
Y en un arrebato de esta loca vida amor
darte un beso aquÃ­ en la boca

How'd things go for you today

I'll keep you company.

Well I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely

Well, look here, is that a teardrop
In the corner of your pane
Now, don't you try
To tell me that it's rain.

Guess we'll have to learn to get along
Without her if we can;

Pa' que no se me acabara
Fuera bendita, fuera bendita
Pa' poder vivir cerquita
De las cosas que mas quiero
Que no me pusiera viejo
Pa' estar siempre jovencito

A la edad de quince años
Ya yo cantaba, ya yo cantaba
Y a los veintidós cumplidos
Ya yo grababa, ya yo grababa
Ya la gente comenzaba
A valorizar mi canto
Y al lado del gran Colacho
Me llené de requisitos
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

He vivido todo el tiempo
Enamorado de una morena
La que meritoriamente
Hizo que fuera yo el dueño de ella
La pobre ha salio tan buena
Pero casi vive sola
Porque salgo a toda hora
A cumplir mis compromisos
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

Vivo muy agradecido
De aquella gente que me acompaña
A donde quiera que voy
Cada dia mas dandome fama
Yo no sé cómo se paga
Ese gesto tan bonito
Quiero repartir mi alma
Dandole a todo' un poquito

Fui cantor bajo un sol de acordeones y amigos de ayer
Y ella estaba soñando una tarde y la vi por ahí
Cuántas cosas no quise decirle, no pude y callé
Y en el alma guardaba un secreto, me enamoré al fin

Ven conmigo soñadora, ven conmigo soñadora
Que si aquí en esta noche no hay luna, mi luna eres tú
Y aunque traten de hallar el olvido en los dos
Solo que tengo en tu alma, guardado un lugar
Y aunque vuele muy lejos aquí vuelvo yo

Aunque sea tan humano y cometa un error
Tú sabrás comprenderme y me perdonarás
Creo que ya no hay remedio, lo nuestro es amor

Porque trabajo y en cualquier parte yo me la puedo ganar
Es lo que siento aquí en el pecho
Que con dinero jamás y nunca se puede solucionar

Yo me refiero es a la señora que fue conmigo al altar
Que yo la adoro y la quiero tanto y es la mamá de mis hijos

Que me está quitando el cariño

Pero me da mucho pesar
Que me está quitando el cariño

Más fácil se le hace olvidar

Queriendo el recuerdo matar 

Hasta la piel me siento 
Que el sol me quemó sin cesar 
Testigo fue el silencio 
Que el llanto me hizo desahogar

También me hiere pero es el final

Solo tu llanto libre te aliviará 
Adiós gaviota herida vuelve a volar

Diómedes Díaz,"Para qué me quieres culpar
Si tu eras para mí como agua pal sediento
Acaso no recuerdas ya que me sentí morir
Sin la miel de tus besos

Pero una vez te vi partir
No lo pude evitar
Me quedé en el intento
Dejaste de regae' jardín
Y en él no quedan ya sino pétalos muertos

Entonces para qué decir
Que no te amaba si no es cierto
Entonces para qué decir
Que no te amaba si no es cierto

Decir que no te amaba sería negar mis canciones
Y que Freddy Molina nunca le cantó a su tierra

Que la cumbia y el porro no son el sentir más noble
De todos los troveros de la región sabanera
Y me forgé contigo todo un mundo de ilusiones
Hasta sentí llevarte como la sangre en mis venas

Pero un día te marchaste de mi tierra
Sin decirme porque ni para donde

Pero un día te marchaste de mi tierra
Sin decirme porque ni para donde

Te quise con el alma, bien sabes
Que amarte más no pude, volaste 
Con rumbo hacia las nubes, más altas
Ya no pude alcanzarte

Hoy cuando de la nube te bajas
Ya es demasiado tarde, que vaina
Pues ya no queda nada, de aquel amor tan grande

Pues ya no queda nada, de aquel amor tan grande

Quien pudo amarnos más que Dios
Si fue quien nos creó un día a su semejanza
El mismo que en la cruz murió por nuestra salvación
Uno como si nada

De igual manera sufrí yo la ausencia de su amor
Mientras tanto volabas
Sin importarte mi dolor, ahí estuvo tu error
Entonces qué reclamas

Y hoy vienes buscando perdón
Porque un viento quebró tus alas
Y hoy vienes buscando perdón
Porque un viento quebró tus alas

Yo puedo perdonarte si es que estás arrepentida
Pero volver contigo no lo puedo hacer ni en sueños
Recuerda que te di la mejor parte de mi vida
Buscando ser feliz pero fallé en mi noble empeño
Porque mis sentimientos los dejaste por el suelo
Como algo que no sirve y que en cualquier parte se tira

Y si en algo te sirve de consuelo
Le pediré a mi Dios, que te bendiga

Y si en algo te sirve de consuelo

Broke my heart
We're apart
Thinks she's smart

I met a girl a month ago
I thought that she would love me so
But in time I realized
She had a pair of roving eyes

I remember the nights we dated
Always acting sophisticated
Talking about high society
Oh then she tried to make a fool out of me

(They call her Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
Broke my heart now
Thinks she's smart now
We're apart now

Pretty little girl you're just having fun
You're running all around and breaking lover's hearts
Pretty little girl, I don't stand a chance
Without any money there goes our romance

She always wears charms, diamonds, pearls galore
She buys them at the five and ten cents store
She wants to be just like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Even though she's the girl next door

Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish upon a Star,1973

I've done some things I can't explain
I walk the streets alone
The darkness is my safety zone

always in the rain

The street lights print my silhouette
upon the pavement dark and wet
I find my childhood in the ghoarts
of the old neighborhood
Yes always
always in the rain.

It's a melancholy feeling
shakes my senses takes my feeling
Then I find i just surrender
to the moment it's so tender

I watch the neon city swirl
just like a mystic dancing girl
Beneath the stormy weather
all those colors flow together
always
always in the rain

beneath a boundless sky of blue
It's just a fantasy
a wish within a memory
Yes always
always in the sun

The moment I looked in your eyes I never will forget
And I remember oh the time that we kissed
Remember thinking to myself could it really be like this
And we danced beneath a midnight moon
And I took one lock
One look at you
And I fell in love before I knew
And the night stood still
And we moved so sweet
So sweet and slow
To the rhythm of the radio
And then your arms reached out and held me close
And the night stood still
I will remember the song that they were playing then
And if I close my eyes I answer
We're right back there again
Do you remember oh the way it used to be
We were two hearts on the run
So young as wild as free
CHORUS
The night stood still
We danced
Danced
We fell in love
Do you remember oh the way it used to be...

Dion,"I guess we can't help it 
The moment just found us 
The timing was perfect, the energy boundless 
We both read each other, words aren't necessary 
Like dancers in rhyme, we're involuntary 

We think as one person without concentrating 
I'm high on your laughter, it's intoxicating 
We walk on the ceiling, the walls can't contain us 
Together we're flying, the angels can claim us 

You bring the dream 
I'll bring the power 
We'll blend it together 
We'll build a tower of love 
You'll bring passion 
I'll bring desire 
Then we'll light the sunrise, turn it to fire 
And love 
Turn it to love 

You see the rhythm fits perfect, it's cooperation 
I can't stand in one place, it's anticipation 
With all of this feeling, the whole world can't cage us 
My heart beats with your heart and it's contagious

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in the projects yo
I watched my uncle Greg put D's on his six-fo'
I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain
Shopped crack and watched ""Colors"" and I soaked up game
Drove the Impala on his lap that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40-ounce bottle
On the weekend him and my pops flashed the 'Vette
Till one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend my pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Block they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass nigga wit' a Black Panther tat
Kill a nigga cross him out on his Compton hat
Told me when I got older I would understand that
It's blood in blood out and ain't no turnin' back
Few summers went by and we moved across the tracks
13 that's when I had my first

I was the first nigga wit' a Starter jacket on the block
Used to build model cars and let the motherfuckers hop
Moms banged Hoover Crip she was known for sellin' rocks
Let me collect the 40-ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard so I stole my brother's glock
And that's the day my life changed 'cause that night he got shot
Killed by another crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that Chronic from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40-ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped
I start bangin' red laces in my adidas
Drinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by
I was a menace to society
But I never left fingerprints on my

I got a lot of dead homies some blood some crip
This is life stop watchin' that ""Boyz N The Hood"" shit
You see this red rag hangin' out of my jeans?
I went to twenty funerals by the age of nineteen
Then I went to college basketball was my dream
Quit the team 'cause I rather shoot rock wit' the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac thought I was rich bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin' till I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit
So I got her name tatted in

And her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks
She's awfully hot, asshole burning like Tabasco
She used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go
Started smoking weed and graduated to the pipe
Thought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right
Infatuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers
Prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers
Putting dope in the cook, searching for her vein
Tracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain
The monkey on her back is now a gorilla
Fiending for a hit knowing one day it's goin' kill her
The clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman
Destroying her pretty image and her health
Got me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen?
I seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching

She wakes up, with an urge to get high
Everyday, the same routine, needing the mood of fix to get by
So she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle
Tie a sock her arm and start shooting up the diesel
Had a flesh back, screwing some dude up in his hashback
The night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack
A regular John, she met her through Tom
She passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm
Dying a slow death, oh, she losing her dear mind
From the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind
Uh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS
Lost her appetite, hardly slept in days
Now it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around
With the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases
Two months pregnant, carrying around her fetus
But they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners

Trying to make some quick cash for a hit of that stash
Listen, baby, you growing up much too fast
Uh, this goes out to every project and every ghetto
For those getting high, using drugs on every level
Living your life, day and night, getting stoned
You better leave those drugs alone, feel me?

More franchisin', less sanitizin', more uprisin', less down sizin'
More enterprisin', less sympathizin'
More buildin', less destroyin', more jobs, less unemployment
Let's skip the Devil, less enjoyment

More originality, less bitin' off Pac 'n' Big
More community activism, less pigs
More Blacksmith, Def Chucks, less Geffen then the rest
'Cause the West suck, they got this shit all messed up

More marijuana, less coke, more accountability

More schools, less prisons, more freestyles, less written
More serious shit and less kiddin'

More history, less mystery, more Beyonce
Less Brittany, more happiness, less misery
More victory, less losses
More workers, we all bosses, of course it's reflection

More grind, less wishin'

Less rushin', more vision

I can get you taken now, think I couldn't when I could

Surrounded by the heavy herb

This the shit the cops stoppin' us for

This the rain of theTech and the muthafuckin' peanuts
Slice like a nip-tuck, specalizin' deep cuts
This the music that you ridin' to
Provided to you by Talib and Hi-Teck, the livest two

What we need

More grind, less wishin'
Less stuntin', more fame, less talkin', more change
Less rushin', more vision

The more I put into it the less it sound like the nonsense
The more natural, the less conscious
At the same time, the more I bomb shit the less the Devil got a grip
I'm gettin' loose, we gotta slip away the ghetto gotta get

More for a dollar, more fresh goods for purchase
Less liquor stores, less churches step lookin' like corner stores
More rap songs to stress purpose with
Less misogyny and less curses

Let's put more depth in our verses till they left on the surface
While we stomp through the underground, the cop don't come around

I give you these bars for free like it's promotional

What we need

More love, less hate, more real, less fake
More grind, less wishin'
Less stuntin', more fame, less talkin', more change
Less rushin', more vision

Call me when you need me, any time at all

Babe, all of the places I go
People I see, things that I do
You know it gets lonely at times

But I love being here

[Dion] You make me step my game up!

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Shit, cause women come, women go
Until we all mature we ain't really tryin' to grow
With the girl we seein' we ain't really tryin though
Try and beat it up fast on the living room flo'
Got a little older, had to spend a little dough
Kept somethin' in the pocket just in case I had to show
Shorties how I did it when I took 'em to the sto'
Took a few to the mo', lot'll vouch for that
Nigga bounce to the fact things I did was dumb
I account all of that to bein' young
Got a little age, got some understandin'
The older women get the more concerned with companion-ship
It took me a while to get to this point
I don't expect all of y'all to understand this shit
Read between the bass snares and kick
Everybody gettin' judged by who they standin' with, f'real

You make me step my game up, game up
Step my game up yeah step my game up
You make me step my game up, game up
Step my game up yeah, my game up

[Phonte]
She said we should go out on a date
I said that's cool you can come to my house
She said nigga please! Do better than that
Why the fuck I wanna come over and chill on yo' couch?
I laughed cause it seemed she had me all figured out
And my game ain't work like it did befo'
Dem are days long gone, cause once they get grown
These hoes ain't impressed by Applebees no mo'
Gotta dig a little deeper for that PF change, for PF Chang's
And if you can't afford it
You can still do thangs to show you ain't on no dumb shit
Take her to a gallery, museum or some shit
Thank God for you and all the crew that you run with
Givin' new meaning to the blind date
You so offi-shall, but a nigga can't attract Crist-al
With a Boone's Farm mindstate, knahmsayin?

I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

You didn't need me.
You have your share

I don't want their sympathy
You go to parties, dances and shows
I still love you but no one knows

Maybe some how, some time, some where
You'll walk by and hear my prayer
My loneliness will fade away
Darling please tell me you'll stay

I'll be hurt but I won't cry
And though my love for you still grows
I feel it's better if no one knows",No One Knows,1982
Dion & The Belmonts,"To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.

Dion & The Belmonts,"I'm just a country boy and I like to do what's right
And just like any other boy I like to hold 'em tight
Sometimes I got resistance, but no matter how I try
When a cute little gal just looks at me with a gleam in her eye
And I say ""Baby, you better not do that"", and she say ""Oh, why?""
And I say ""Because you just better not do that""

When I went to the country school I always had a girl
They'd laugh and giggle awful cute and put me in a whirl
And everyday at recess time they followed me outside
I'd scratch my head and wonder are they ever satisfied
I'd say ""Baby, you better not do that"" and she'd say ""Why?""
And I'd say ""Because you just better not do that""

I got a little older, and I went to the country dance
I went to have a little fun, I wasn't thinkin' about romance
But the dim lights just lured 'em on and they'd snuggle up to me
I knew I couldn't last too long, 'cos I'm human you see

It's about a girl that I once knew

Diona Devincenzi,"Today I took some paper from the closet
And wrapped the wedding ring
You left behind
And I addressed it to the man
Who vowed to love you
And on the little card
I wrote these words inside

Merry Christmas to me
Just one gift beneath my tree
For the fool who let you leave
Merry Christmas to me

Then I sat down in my chair
And thought about you
About the many reasons why you're gone 
And I opened up the present that I gave me
And realized how much it hurts to be alone

Dione Taylor,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way,2006

Wasn't me who tried to ignore
That were were both half of each other

You can go if you want you can run

But when you get near my voice and you can't knock on my door
It wont take much more

You body's is the world
That holds no power for me you
You couldn't mean it if you wanted too
For me there's nothing you can do
Boy even if you're out of my world 
You cant get my world out of you

Floating in the air

Full of shadows without pity

You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

So people, get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers from coast-to-coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board them
There's hope for all among His chosen ones

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Believe me now, have pity
On those whose chances grow thinner
But there's no hiding place against the kingdoms throne

Knowing when to leave
May be the smartest thing that anyone can learn, go

I'm afraid my heart isn't very smart

Fly while you still have your wings
Knowing when to leave
Won't ever let you reach the point of no return, fly

Foolish as it seems, I still have my dreams
So I keep hoping, day after day, as I wait for the man I need
Night after night and I wish for a love that can be

Though I'm sure that
No one can tell where a wishes and hopes will lead
Time, how I feel there is happiness just waiting there for me

When someone
Walks in your life, you just better be sure he's right
'Cause if he's wrong, there are heartaches and tears you must face

Keep both of your
Eyes on the door, never let it get out of sight

But like a fool I don't know when to leave

Never gonna stop 'till that dream is mine
Gonna see what life's all about there

Dionne Warwick,"Gotta get off, gonna get
Have to get off from this ride
Gotta get hold, gonna get
Need to get hold of my pride

When did I get, where did I
How was I caught in this game
When will I know, where will I
How will I think of my name

When did I stop feeling sure, feeling safe
And start wondering why, wondering why
Is this a dream, am I here, where are you
What's in back of the sky, why do we cry

Gotta get off, gonna get
Out of this merry-go-round
Gotta get off, gonna get
Need to get on where I'm bound

When did I get, where did I
Why am I lost as a lamb
When will I know, where will I
How will I learn who I am

When will I know why",Theme from Valley of the Dolls,1976
Dionne Warwick,"Who can I turn to
When nobody needs me
My heart wants to know
And so I must go
Where destiny leads me

With no star to guide me
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way
And, after the day
The darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal, or borrow
My share of laughter

With you I could learn to
With you what a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away

With you I could learn to
With you what a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away",Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me),1976
Dionne Warwick,"The windows of the world are covered with rain
Where is the sunshine we once knew?
Everybody knows when little children play
They need a sunny day to grow straight and tall
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
When will those black skies turn to blue?
Everybody knows when boys grow into men
They start to wonder when their country will call
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
What is the whole world coming to?
Everybody knows when men can not be friends
Their quarrel often ends where some have to die
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
There must be something we can do
Everybody knows whenever rain appears
It's really angel tears
How long must they cry?

Ev'ry voice would be a voice to be heard

My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams

I'd like to know
People say you have found another
Is it true, what they say?

When the picture's over, will it be all over?
Tell me, who gets the guy
In that last sweet caress?
Don't make me guess

Lovin' you has become my whole life
I can't live without you
When it's time to walk out
Are you gonna walk out?

And that's why I just keep listenin'
To the music to see if it's happy or sad
Because if it's happy that's how I feel
And if it's sad, well, that's too bad for me

Tell me that the ending is a happy ending for me

You're my world, you're every move I make
Although I see the stars up in the skies
But for me they shine within your eyes

As the trees reach for the sun above
So my arms reach out to you for love
With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so divine

You're my world, you're every prayer I pray
You're my world, you're every breath I take
If our love ceases to be
That is the end of my world for me

With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power that is so, so divine

You're my world, you are my night, my day

You still know what to do
You still know how to make me feel
There's no one else but you

And you think that things
Adjust the way they used to be
But I can see

It in your eyes
I see that you wanna run away
And in your eyes
I don't see the kind of love you say

Is in your heart
'Cause in your eyes there's another face
And not a trace of me

You still know when to touch
You still know when to call
And sometimes when you hold me close
I'd swear we had it all

Oh, it isn't that
You're not the man you used to be
It's what I see

There in your eyes
I see that you wanna run away
And in your eyes
I don't see the kind of love you say

Is in your heart

And not a trace of me
No, not a trace of me

Dionne Warwick,"An old friend told me that you just ran out of chances,
One too many dances down the narrow street of time.
Remember how we faced the world, like two tramps shining.
Please, don't let that magic ever end.
Don't forget what we learned living on the wind.

No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do,
I still can show you who you are.

That day the long and dusty road had us both crying,
We used up our last joke just to try to smile a again.
And only now I find I know what we were learning,
Though it's dark and you have traveled far.
Every long night gives you one bright shining star.

No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do,
I can still show you who you are.

Deep in the night you know that you'll find,
Deep in the night you know that you'll find the way.
No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;

I can't help the way I'm feeling

Will grow green again

We can heal all our wounds
We can use our own names

And then death has no shadow
There are no foreign lands

We will never bow down
We'll be tall as the pines
Neither heroes nor clowns
If we only have love
Then we'll only be men

Sadness and tears, that's all you left me
They're such bad souvenirs
Of a love that once was, oh, so very great
The greatest love, reaching all the way to the stars above

But now there's not a star left in the sky
And if you don't come back to me I'll die
Only your embrace can fill this empty place

If I don't fill this emptiness
I know that I'll lose my mind
Looking out and only seeing space
An empty, empty place

Ah, sadness and tears, that's all you left me
They're such bad, bad souvenirs
Of a love that once was, oh, so very great
The greatest love, reaching all the way to the stars above

But now there's not a star left in the sky
And if you don't come back to me I'll die
Only your embrace can fill this empty place

Come back, come back, come back to me
Come back and fill my empty arms
I need your loving, darling
Your lips are loving, darling

Come back, come back, come back to me
Oh, come back and fill my empty arms
I need your loving, darling
Your lips are loving, darling
Come back, come back, come back to me",This Empty Place,1989

And she said it's really a sin to be mean and cruel

Angels up in heaven are looking at you

So be very careful not to make us part
You won't get to heaven if you break my heart
Oh, no

I've been hearin' rumors about how you play around
Though I don't believe what I hear, still it gets me down

It would be so awful the angels would cry

Dionne Warwick,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.
I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.
To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.
What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine.
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
Darling, I love you!

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,

A thrill divine down my spine.

I never felt a love so sure

And it will stand the test of time

What dreams are made of

In love eternally

In the shadow of the night

Turn my head around, destroy the love that I've found
You are the cause of all my pain
Yes, you're to blame, now he's gone

Because of plain old jealousy
You are the cause of a many a misery
Plain old jealousy that made me lose
Everything that was good for me, that jealousy

Jealousy, release your spell from me
Let me live again, enjoy my life till the end
You made me doubt what I believe
Now look straight at me, I'm all alone

But our world's all over now

The world was our private little merry-go-round
The lilt of our laughter made a beautiful sound
We were so in love

Each night the moon used to wait for us
Before it would shine
But that was long ago

And now the wine is young
Our dreams are old
Love has come and gone
And it hurts me more than I can bear to go on alone

I'd bring you back if I knew how
But our world's all over now

My lips long to kiss you like they kissed you before
My arms would do anything to hold you once more
What a love we shared

We owned the stars
Half of them were yours
The others were mine
But that was long ago

And now the wine is young
Our dreams are old
Love has come and gone
And it hurts me more than I can bear to go on alone

To feel the way we  do today and then if you can remember
Keep smilin', keep shinin'

For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more

Well you came and opened me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way I thank you
And then for the times when we're  apart
Well  then  close your eyes and know
These words are coming   from  my heart

So be very careful not to make us part

Though I don't believe what I hear, still it gets me down
If you ever should say goodbye
I'd feel so awful the angels would cry

Everybody sing it now come on let's go see

With a nice electric wreath into my coffin

And dress with Molly's shirt into my coffin

Dionysos,"J'ai rencontré une fille étrange
Qui se disait coiffeur d'oiseau
Elle se cachait dans les branches
Elle attrapait tout les oiseaux
Elle découpait tout plein de formes
N'importe comment dans leurs ailes
Avec ses ciseaux de couture
Et un joli petit peigne

Et tous les oiseaux se sont mis
A voler un peu de travers
Et ils se cognaient dans les branches
Et ils se cognaient même entre eux
Certains se fracassaient par terre
En atterrissant à l'envers
L'un d'eux dans la roue d'un vélo
Comme harponné dans les rayons

Et que sur de lui, il nous clamera pas de soucis,
No soucy comme il dit, no soucy,
Personne, non personne ne rira ne lui,
Et tout le monde aura un joli sourire conquis,
Posé sur les lèvres, il était comme ça!

Pour se faire parfumer

Dionysos,"Un jour, peut-être pas le jour le plus froid du monde,
Mais pas loin, je décidais de retirer mon horloge.
De lourds flocons gorgés de pluie s'amoncelaient sur mes épaules
""C'est un bon jour pour s'arracher le cœur"" me suis-je dit.

Lorsque j'ai tiré dessus,
J'ai eu l'impression qu'un bulldozer était en train de tout casser entre mes poumons.
Les gens disent qu'on voit une lumière très intense quand la mort arrive,
En ce qui me concerne, je n'ai vu que des ombres.
Des ombres géantes, à perte de vue et une tempête de neige aux flocons noirs.

La neige recouvrait progressivement mon corps,
D'abord les mains, puis les bras écartés.
Des roses semblaient pousser de la neige tellement le sang gorgeait la poudreuse,
Puis elles se sont effacées.
Mon visage, puis mon corps tout entier ont disparu.

J'étais étrangement détendu et anxieux en même temps,
Comme si je me préparais à un très long voyage en avion.
Un dernier bouquet d'étincelles a poussé sous mes paupières,
Le souvenir de Miss Acacia dansant en équilibre sur ses petits talons aiguilles,
Docteur Madeleine penchée sur moi, remontant l'horloge de mon coeur,
Arthur en train de vociférer son swing à coups de
""Oh when the saints go marchin' in""
Puis Miss Acacia dansant en équilibre sur ses petits talons aiguilles,
Encore et encore.

Mon cœur et sa mécanique se sont arrêtés pour de bon.

Pour vous embrassez sous une pluie

De confettis?

Fermez vos belles gueules à passion
Les accidents d'amour à la pelle 
Ne m'ont pas toujours donné raison

Tais-toi mon cœur. Je ne te reconnais pas 
Oh, tais-toi mon cœur. Je ne te reconnais pas
Tais-toi mon cœur. Je ne te reconnais pas

Je me fabrique un cœur de pierre 
Pour devenir un grand garçon
Celui dont tu serais fier 
Et pourrais tenir une maison 

Mais un beau jour comme ça tu te lève
Avec une idée à la con
Fouiller souvenirs et les rêves

Tais-toi mon cœur, mon cœur c'est toi

Dionysos,"Cela fait maintenant plusieurs années
Que dans cette école je me sens chez moi
Et c'est vrai dans la cours de récréation
C'est souvent moi qui fais la loi
Tous les autres élèves me respectent
Il y en à sûrement beaucoup qui me craignent
J'ai mes repères mes habitudes
Mes certitudes sur lesquelles je règne
Alors c'est vrai j'aime pas beaucoup le changement
Pour moi la vie c'est la stabilité
Je voudrais effacer littéralement
Tout ce qui pourrait menacer mon autorité
J'ai fais ce qu'il faut depuis longtemps
Et dans mon entourage je n'ai plus de rivaux
Mais à l'école depuis peu de temps
J'aime pas trop ça y a un nouveau

Il est tout petit un air gentil
Moi j'ai vraiment envie de lui mettre des claques
Je crois qu'il y a pas plus bizarre que lui
Quand il s'approche ça fait tic-tac
Un bruit d'horloge incessant
Il paraît que ça vient de son cœur
Moi ça me dérange
Et puis j'ai l'impression qu'il connaît rien de la vie
Moi le nouveau je le trouve étrange
Il a de drôle d'occupation souvent
Il couve des œufs dans la manche de son pull
Alors dès que je peux à la récréation
Je les lui casse sur le crâne sans aucun scrupule
Nous n'avons vraiment rien en commun sauf
Une chose découverte avec horreur
Il est amoureux de la même fille que moi
Il n'aurais jamais dû c'est une grave erreur

Cette fille c'est la petite chanteuse
C'est ma petite amie depuis longtemps
Elle s'appelle Miss Acacia
Et elle chante en moi à chaque instant
Depuis peu malheureusement
Elle est repartie dans son pays l'Andalousie
Et le nouveau qui ose me parler d'elle
Est en train de décupler ma jalousie

La présence inutile de ce nabot renforce
La cruelle absence de mon amour
Il semble l'aimer presque autant que moi
Et si ça continue je crois bien qu'un jour
Ce n'est pas ses œufs mais son cœur en bois
Que sur son crâne je vais briser
Pour qu'il ne soit plus jamais capable d'aimer
C'est bien son cœur que je dois viser",Thème de Joe,2007

Qui surplombe la ville, et ses clochers!

Me prendrait-elle pour une poulet grillé,
Que l'on aurait oublié de tuer? 
Elle me découpait la peau de la poitrine.
Ses grands ciseaux crantés plantés entre mes os,
Elle a glissé une horloge dans mes débris glacés
En lieux et place de mon petit cœur gelé.

Oh grand jamais tu ne devras oublier

Premièrement ne touche pas à tes aiguilles
Deuxièmement ta colère tu devras maîtriser 
Et surtout ne jamais oublier quoi qu'il arrive,
Ne jamais se laisser tomber amoureux,
Car alors pour toujours,
À l'horloge de ton cœur la grande aiguille des heures transpercera ta peau,
Explosera l'horloge, imploseront tes os,
La mécanique du cœur 
Sera brisée de nouveau.

Only you can take control
Watch out before the hangman takes your soul

Don't hide there nowhere to run
No escaping from all the things you've done
It's time to face reality
There is no chance for you to feel

Falling, loosing your ground
And times running out but still you're blind

[Chorus]
You're down and out, you're lost in paradise
You're just a fool, a fraud filled with lies
You're in a land where shadows watching you
That land is only an illusion of life!

Watch out darkness will come on your way
Decide if you ever want to change
You're the one with the golden key
To the future and to your destiny

You need to find out who you are
Take my advice or else you wound get far
Stop pretending that you're the man
Guilty of charge it's time to take your stand

Falling loosing your ground
And times running out but still you're blind

[Chorus]

You see the shadows closing in
I know the fall has just begun
Nowhere to hide you can't get out
You were trapped inside your lonely life!

Dionysus,"Be deceived, its powers hidden
Darkness lurks, invisibility
Fear the deed of Carwan's hands-
A mythic treachery
Fire born, to rule them all
An orb of might, hunger insatiable
Evil craft
A deadly tool, to seal the blasphemy
You will see

And then the lands will fall as one
And if the light subdues defenders hope is gone

[Chorus]
Ancor, veiled in vengeance, calls its name
Powers far beyond the dreamers of the wild
Dark echoes shatter through a world unknowing
Shadow dying to behold the orb of warn

Minions march, to mountain city
See the beasts, creations of wizardry
Wails of war
Tonight the dead will die and rise again
Mirrors crack, the light is fading
Hate reviled, illusions and imagery
Feel the scent of fear and madness
Darkness settles in
Walls will bleed

And then the lands will fall as one
And if the light subdues defenders hope is gone

[Chorus]

And then all the lands are free
And the Carwan's fate is sealed
The singing king is crowned
And the world can live again
The mirrors are restored and Calannor fares on
By destiny he's bound to live on eternally

And then the orb will be destroyed
Will be taken by the flames and lost in history
So the world can carry on
And Calannor fares on and still lives on
And mankind will forget

[Chorus]

Ancor, veiled in vengeance, calls its name

Is written on the wall
I don't know where to go

I've been on the run from something

Kill my heart and soul
Like a ghost inside of me
You whisper I'm your savior!

You're the queen of madness
Wears no crown
Lost in deepest sadness
Falling down
You deceived me
Blood stained and never free
You've blamed all your shame on me

I have made a promise
To get back on you someday
Justice come, it will be done

You will face the darkest future
You will go to hell

You use to be so strong and sure but suddenly

Heaven comes falling down on you

The light seems so far away
But still I believe it's not too late

So don't lose the spirit
Without it we're standing small
So keep up the spirit
This is our time in life to take all the chances
Before we throw it all away

I know your worries, I know your agony
I'm also hurt from time to time
I guess we need to believe once again
That we can beat the odds like many times before
I don't follow, I don't understand
To throw away what we've achieved is not the way

Use your imagination now
Could you really leave it all?
We all slip and fall sometimes
But the inspiration will be there again!

[Chorus]

You know we didn't chose an easy way
But somehow we've managed
To overcome impossibilities
We have only got this far
By being who we are

We all slip and fall sometimes
But the inspiration will be there again

So don't lose the spirit
Without it we're standing small

Until she's found I won't give up, I won't give in!

I am searching recklessly through pain and misery
The tides will turn for me, it's my destiny!

By the river of Styx, through the echoes of death

Silence is broken in the halls of the dead

Fighting all the demons
In the middle of the night
I open my eyes and I just see I'm still alive

Here's another story of the world I'm living in
You can see a hero fall tonight
I see dark angels fly
Nothing else remains a mystery

Smiling on the outside
Empty on the inside
Lost even my direction
Where to go?
I'm still in this madhouse
My life's just one big lie
No more air to breath
We're face to face

Covered by a smiling mask
To hide all our sins
But really have to see
That there's no more truth within!

Is cutting through your spine

But don't let us do it again
Have all we taught been so wrong
If not ""Why are you singing this song""

Remember, a single spark can ignite the fire
Inside its womb you're his soul desire

The bringer of war

Like a phoenix he arose from the ashes
But did you ever see him come?
Even though his eyes are shining true
He's not the savior for me, nor for you

What's that sound I'm hearing?
Hasn't he been here once before?
A malefactor, promising to take down the sun

Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Yeah, they wanna snuggle (Come'er)
Aw, that's a cute teddy bear
Put it in your butt hole
Ooh what you know 'bout me, Dirt Nasty, bitch, I'm a farmer (Yeah)
Come through with a ugly ass ho, call her two-headed llama
She wanna sleep on me, better bring some pajamas (Good night)
I got a white boy Entourage, Johnny Drama

Ay, yo
Spandex (spandex), I pull up with a lamb text
Too strudel, toaster strudel, ballin' on you poodles
Swish! Two cougars, 40 plus, clutching Rugers
Blackout the two seater, MC Hammer, have you seen her (seen her)
40 karats in the gallon
It's apparent, your parents, got 'em runnin' like mascara
Tempers flaring, I pull up in the Ric Flair McClaren
Four bad bitches on probation, are you sharing (are you sharing)
Got 'em jealous, 20 inches, all you fellas chop the tellers
Got 'em running over Jerome Bettis, Versace lettuce
No dieting, Gucci eyelids, I go to sleep, snobby pilots

I’m a farmer boy, goin' Scottie Pippen in Illinois
Teeth full of diamonds and corduroy, been a while since I was unemployed
I’m the real McCoy, not Hatfield
My RV got rims on 12 wheels, I ride to the club on a school of seals
Turtles and beluga whales, Escargot and a plate of snails
My farm grows broccoli and I get paid well
Only time will tell, armored like I just cracked the liberty bell
Gracin' on the cover of Mademoiselle, sicker than a sick guy with sickle cell
Andy Milonakis just went to jail
Drinking V8 in the V12 with three L's smelling like Adele",We Are Llamas,2012
Diplo,"And another one bites the dust
But why can I not conquer love?
And I might've got to be with one
Why not fight this war without weapons?
And I want it and I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
And let's be clear, I trust no one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, I won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I walked through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
And I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

You did not break me (You did not break me, no, no)
I'm still fighting for peace

Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close

Diplo,"My flow drops like an earthquake earthquake, earthquake, 
Earthquake, earthquake, earthquake
I make that ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, 
Ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, ass shake
It's time to deveastate, devastate, deveastate, 
Devastate,deveastate, devastate
I'll male the glass break, glass break, glass break, 
Break, break, break, break
Drop like an earthquake

My flow harder than a bitch fucking good dope
These hoes hating why these hoes so cut throat
One hit wonder bitch, I make that shit pop
He told me to go in, fresh, I pop that shit
My flow shake harder than Alaska quake
The one in 1964, it was devastate
These bitches wonder who I is, tell them shake 'n' bake
Ricky Bobb,y bitch I'm nobody
Shake that ass on the floor, let me see you wobble it
Tell them to burn my shit when you hit that replay girl, 
Smokin' while I'm riding
Bitch nigga hiding
Do these shit like every day, drop like an earthquake

Dj Fresh where Diplo at?
Hey Diplo I see you baby (Ugh)

It'll make the ground shake, ground shake, 
Ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, ground shake

Play my shit hit the replay, replay, replay, 
Replay, replay, replay, replay
It will never hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, 
Hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, hesitate
It'll make the glass break, glass break, 
Glass break, break, break, break, break

Stick a molly on the table then she licks it up
Throw the ones off in the air then she picks it up
