Butch Cassidy,"I bang with the gang that don't need no intro
We run from East Long Beach to West South Central
Credentials, to kick flows and rip shows, 
dip 4's and pimp ho's while the indo blow
You know that west coast low mentality
Focused on reality but livin in a hole notha galaxy
We keep it straight hard but guard the spot
Bangas snatch chains in the parkin lot
Don't matta there still be fine ho's to gatha
Pick about the thickest bitch and I gots to hav ha
It's routine the coupe clean let's hit the sho
You know we all fuckin once they glimpse the po
Wit the satin in my hand pack the gat on my lap
Cuz it's hatin when your skaten and your pockets is fat
Don't act for a minute like your ass surprised
Just reconize the real way that gangsta's ride

If it ain't chronic don't blaze it up
And if it ain't a chevy don't raise it up
You know we keep it bangin don't fake the funk
So all the real niggaz stay gangsta'd up
We makein papa only suckas claim to touch
By stickin to the script and neva changin up
You know we keep it bangin don't fake the funk
Keep it real motherfucka stay gansta'd up

It's goin down motherfuckaz like dat
Sounds like Battlecat been upstairs wit Zapp
And the nockin don't stop
I hope nobody don't call the cops
It don't stop the beat'll make your pop block
Na betta yet cuz dis shit'll keep your glock cocked
You think I'm trippin fool I ain't bullshittin
You betta read up on dis shit to keep the latest non-fiction
Watch out for the friction
Dis West Coast on mine
And fuck anybody dssin nigga lissen
Dogg House style cuz I'm a gangsta crip
C-walkin holdin on the extra clip
Now you wanna be a frend
But you gunna make me unload and slap the other clip in reload
You wanna go toe to toe
Sit my pistol down on ground on the pound nigga hell no

I must stay gangsta'd up cuz it just lives in me
And when I seen enuff I guess dats when I'll free sumbody
Once said from willie c. nigga dont speek on me
I wont stop so let me be we are from the streets sumboby

I'm a Long Beach East Side mad ass lunatic
Gang bang slap a bitch nigga out to get a grip
On the grind gettin mine ask the homiez on the 9  2 o you know
We still own niggaz who talk bitch shit
Real niggaz feel dis let's get rich
Under the sun with the young 2 ones TLC's and all the DPG's
Down for whatever who eva wanna see me now
You lookin like me i guess you wanna be me now
It take a hole lot to be Snoop D-O-dub
You gotta put it down and always stay g'd up
All star shoes with the G apparel
If I fall in the club i mite bust a pair of Stacy Adams
You neva catch me lookin R&B
I mite be in a 3 piece suit lookin way OG
Blazin a ounce with the homie cat
Or Ruff Dogg cuz i luv puttin huslas on the map
I keep it gangsta for sho do lo
And always got the muthfuckin do-do smoke
For all my loc's an ken folks dis is for y'all
Let me hit sumthin dogg
Beware of my clique
We hopin and dropin nuthin but the gangsta shit

If it ain't chronic don't blaze it up
And if it ain't a chevy don't raise it up
You know we keep it bangin don't fake the funk
So all the real niggaz stay gangsta'd up
We makein papa only suckas claim to touch
By stickin to the script and neva changin up
You know we keep it bangin don't fake the funk
Keep it real motherfucka stay gansta'd up

Butch Cassidy,"[Xzibit]
Yeah..
Addicted to life, had to pay a heavy-ass price
Sacrifice worth waitin on the platinum and ice
I'm precise with the merchandise, came back like Christ
to change the game, while y'all niggaz remain the same
Clear the lane, comin through like Kobe, you can't hold me
You can't stop me, ever since I dropped ""Paparazzi""
I done watched the game unfold into some hideous shit
Like every idiot that can spit be droppin a hit
I transmit for the convicts, committed, never bullshitted
Shadowbox, detox, my own worse critic
It's like tryin to squeeze water from rocks
I negotiate the neighborhood stops and clean your clock with a glock
Sick of niggaz screamin they hot, but really they not
Beatin you all to the ground like six L.A. cops
Put your fist up in the air if you ever been shot
and lived to tell about it, never leavin home without it, c'mon

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
There's no one out there, for us, to fear
I'll say it loud and clear..
Who can say they're close, to us
Speak now and you'll be brought, to tears

[King Tee]
They probably saw me on the 91 East, gettin off on Central
with the rag back, lookin like life's so simple
Tela take a loss, still floss, all bets
If Trife can't cover the house, call X
Likwit crew brothers, Blues Brothers
Move somethin, make killers do somethin, f'real
The bitch-made often politic with the skill
Now shit's all twisted, unlisted
Guns fixed it, best not speak about the Likwit
We gifted, twenty-four hours and still lifted
(*X*: Bitch keep your vagina) We drunk and ain't interested
Bitches come a dime and a dove, we ain't trippin it
Standin at the bar, soft-styled in the cut
""Ooh, boo wait, I think you had too much!""
Bitch what?  Act right and pour it in a cup
The West and Eastside keep smokin them blunts, niggaz

[Interlude: Butch Cassidy]
Let's get with it, I was born to trip
Stay on the lookout, ain't no time to slip
We ain't for games and shit
Change your spot, cause we're known to dip
No time for chasin hoes
I'm on a mission cause my cash is low
There's no need to speak on those
Doggy rags are the gangsta's clothes

[Defari]
There's two sides of my family, both sides from the ghetto
Pops Finnish choco-late, moms Mississippi yellow
Caramel, Cherokee black man, with a pedigree of excellence
Together we rise, no time for seperateness
My grandfather Snake was a Jake, or a jack
of a smack to a bird who don't know how to act
Straight hustler, Mississippi moonshine smuggler
Good ol' wrangler in his day with that attitude of ""Fuck ya""

[Xzibit]
Built to run forever, X the infinite
First line of defense to smash through the immigrants
Can't straddle the fence, it's all or nothin
Close the curtain, shut down your whole production
Don't be scared, be prepared, niggaz do be bustin
without thinkin; I mastered the art of hard drinkin
Yo, you want to stop the X, try your best
I'm still fuckin with your pockets like the IRS, so yo

[Chorus]

[Butch Cassidy]
Gather all around, to see
how we display our vicious skills
I done seen and heard, enough
Let's prove the West coast is for real

Butch Cassidy,"( Goldie Loc )
Damn cause this spot's gettin hot
I can't trust the paremedics or them crooked ass cops
The closest nigga to you would do you and try to screw you
Backstab you in the back and act like he never knew you
And he could be the same nigga the switch
Playin all one minute but he really is a bitch
Now watch out for the twist
Here come them niggaz that was with you but they out to get rich
But you thought them niggaz would never do that
Until they came back strapped with them rat-tat-tat-tats
And it always ends up fucked up
When the innocent die it'll have yo brain stuck
It'll have yo brains stuck shit outta luck cause I'm havin bad luck
Fucked up in my younger days
Shit I'll bang you with deuces and hang you with trays
A few days back one of homies got rugged out
Damn shame all the brothers seem drugged out
One of seeds bust a bottle over the bizis head
Say it's yo fault that the otha bizis layin dead
But it's a fact if you pack nigga bust back
Neva run throw our gun unless you fall rat
Hoo wooda said that it wooda helped anyway
Wit mo guns niggaz sinnin for another day
Damn cause this spots gittin hot
Damn cause this spots gittin hot
Shits gittin hectik bustin threw my windo
Think it was my homies fucked up can't really call it do
If it was I'ma git him
He gunna hate it when it hit him
Damn cause this spot's gettin hot
I can't trust the paramedics or them crooked ass cops
The closest nigga to you wood do you and try to screw you
Backstab you in the back and act like he never knew you
( hook, Butch Cassidy )
Another day has come
How much longer will I run
I wanna have sum fun
Layin out in the sun
How much dirt have I done
My life has just begun
I sleep with my gun
My problems weigh a ton
( Tray-Dee )
I gots to say damn the program dun up and switched
Fool I used to run with and trusted snitched
Got one time on my block straight posted
Hopin that I slip but I dip and ghosted
Told my babymama it wus drama unfoldin
I kissed all my kids den commits to strollin
Wound uptown on a hot ass block
Checkin with some chickens gettin hot ass cock
Daily Tray-Dee'll loose pursuit
But deez ho's broke and don't look to cute
So I parlay to the hard ways of jackin
Fast came to cash but the mash was crackin
I didn't I was the one to be
Kickin summary of sum wen I let em slide up under me
But God as my witness
As a G I couldn't see Dee just goin out sensless
I stayed hard hit the yard
Pull niggaz hole cards
Had em runnin to the sarge
Jail house scars tell the part you played
Livin with a snitch jackin destined for the brake
It don't pay to go soft
Cause when we catch you slippin real niggas takin off motherfuckers
( Dee, Talkin )
And that's how we do it
Bitch ass niggaz
Out here tellin disrespectin the game
Fuckin up this realism we puttin down out here
You know what I'm sayin
Nigga need the cops to help em out
Hoe ass niggaz
Stand on ya own nigga
Live by the gun die by the gun
Nigga be a soldier

Wassup my nigga, how you doing dog?
Man, I'm chilling my nigga
How you livin'?
Shit, I'm livin' it up baby
Really, ohh really, shit
It's all great then
I'm glad to see ya, basically
Yeah, yeah
But on the real though dog
How you living though?
Who me? Shit

I got two boys and a wife
I live a luxurious life
And I'm respected in this game
Cause I do's the same
Man, look here
Let me spit you something for a second
Cause I see y'all ain't been peeping out my record
I see ladies, I see players, and I see haters
And all you fools who perpetrate us, I'll get back with ya later
I got a plate of shrimps, laughing with some pimps
Chopping game, while my diamond's swinging
Banking off my gold chain

My time has come
The way it's done
No more being strung
Around just like a bun
My dues are paid
Darkness was paved
Let's go find some shade
Then we've got it made

Money ain't everything dog, but I tell ya
If I didn't have it, i'd be labelled as a felon
So, as long as I breathe, I achieve
Keep god first in my life, I know that's right
And I prevail, whether I do or don't sell
It ain't about that, it's about giving back
We trying to get our live on, while you jib on
Let a homie get his sang on, instead of his bang on

My life's my friends
And it's gonna be here till the end
It brought me a past
Out the hood, so I know it's gonna last
Down by the sea
Is where all the ladies see me
They tried to flash
Be down, but I had to make a dash

He went from a bucket to a benz, from some change to some ends
From his homies in the pen, to his balling friends
You know, flossy, flossin, bossy, bossin, boss
But I paid the cost

I wanna go
As far as I can go
Just not loco though
Japan and even Tokyo

Five years before I bought my first Crodusack

So lay low 'cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishing on your raggedy brougham
Could of thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

We bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the top dogg bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whats up pimping?  It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, 'cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me 'cause I'm a million dollar hitta
It's, no limit til I d-I-e
C-p-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick
Talking shit, he better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick
Now she sick, she better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so!",Lay Low,2000

Feels like I'm losin' control
And I don't even know
Girl you hurt me oh so bad 'cause I love you so, hey
But it don't matter now
I'm doin' better now
Whatever you do, Bitch
Will come back to you, Bitch
Hey, hey

Hey, hey

(I was in love at times)
(I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes)

[Snoop Dogg (Butch Cassidy)]
Now who would ever think that I wanted her home?
Three kids and a wife, never be alone
A dog in the front yard and that picket fence
Havin' somethin' on the side? It didn't make sense
(I'm a family man sportin' a wedding band)
I heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn
I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you
The other twenty was cool, 'cause we gone make it through
(The homies said she got my mind blew in, blew in)
I told that nigga like Chris Tucker, 
""Don't worry about what the fuck I be doin'""
We was makin' chemistry, but who is he?
And how this nigga know the deal about you and me?
(I fell to my knees and asked the girl ""Why?"")
She looked at my eyes with no reply
So I cried
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
I was in love at times
They say game don't wait, ha Warren G?
Well the game better wait for me
I'm spendin' my time while I'm writin' these rhymes
In the Hills for real, sippin' wines
Girl, you's a dime
Got me losin' my mind
Well if lovin' you is a crime
I'm down to do my time
Lock me up and throw away the key
I once told that ""This was the way love was meant to be""
I see you with me forever
We can do things that you never,
Thought you could've
Up out the hood-uh
Is where I took you
Never overlooked you
I can't believe that you shook to another spot
And left me cold, now I'm hot
I'm tryin' to find you, what am I to do?
I gave you everything that you needed

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
You know what girl?
I was in love with you and you treated me like that,
But you know what they say?
What goes around comes around

[Butch Cassidy]
How could, how could, you do me wrong?
You be messin' up my songs
Now a nigga must move on
Gave love, and you just, straight played on me
Had a nigga sick for weeks
Now I must begin my streak",Loosen' Control,2000
Butch Cassidy,"I jumped out the blocks like ready! set! go!
Check all my traps and dodge the fair cold
I'm all about the mix like a fuckin collage
And out the gararge, is the Bentley Onage
With the brains blowed out, so is the suns beeming
I got a jacket drooming and the hoes feeming
Since I'm Westside Connected I got a streets on hype
I got big deals, big squeels, big wheels, big pipes

Twenty-inches row - going get these hoes
Pinky hoes - when I roll with my negros
Be a freak about it and I'm a see about it
Speak about it, not bitch I'ma be about it
Who want some of this, West running this
Mack 10 with the playboy bunny bitch
She's a dummy bitch - with a money pit?
You broke ass niggas can't even stomach this

What that connect nigga like three times selling
Six-double-0-west nigga selling rich roll delling
Throw it up, hold it up, guns bust fo' fingas up
Two twisted in the middle with the thumb cuffed
Chevy Nash and dippin at ass and king of the zaggin
Fo'-fo' macking and coat tacking
Dub the hood and I'm in blue friend at 'em
Front up the club, I'm duolete, do for talk and mack 'em trick

What is it like? Tossing 'em hoes
And rolling on fools on them fo's
Flossing 'em chain, we doing big thangs
And busting on punks at close range

Sit back and watch it as it unfolds
Bitches on suck us done so cold
Ahhh! this is the life we chose

Dope money and rapping shit I'm all with it
And all I know is streets is how I spit it
Chickenhawk see a bird, I gotta get it
So if ya hood come up sho', then I'd probably get it
If lil momma dick then I gotta hit it
The trojan gotta be a magnum for me to fit it
If you sherm on 'em stick then I'd probably lit it
The red beam is on your wig so I probably split it

To all them bitches that think they bootylicious
I think they new tricious - I think they do dishes
I make 'em three wishes - I take 'em they pictures
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches
Ego maniac - little homies call me brainiac
Ice Cube's an asshole and it ain't an act
So take a hit at that - and remember that
Where my motherfuckin niggas and my bitches at?

Britches I get I'm Dub-C, the rider with the clique
Like a dragon it's nothin' but fire when I spit
And I can't shake these ghetto ways
A street rich nigga eatin a bag of Lays
And the rubber bands and brains
From the turf for the sirens and Neverlands
Where we keep the pistols smoking just like Afghanistan
It's gangsta the killa - the dope dealer
Back for mo' figgas - so trick bow down and po' the liquor bitch

Bring it to me, shit I ain't got nothin' to lose
Just make sure you don't spill it on my Stacy Adams' shoes
Bad bitches usually run in twos
And gangsta niggas usually run in crews
Now take this for example, if Eve bit the apple
Would the police still gap em', pass em'
Now put him on a lasso
And keep my foot out his motherfucking asshole
For all the abuse and the wrongful bookings

Come ride with me
Take you where the gangstas play
Often heard but seldom seen

When you do see me

Got a piece by my side

Gangsta leanin on the scene on them twisted deez
Big ballin mad doggin like a gangsta ride
As I exit I step with my stacey shine
I'm so cool but motherfcukers know I'm a fool
Ten times outta ten catch me toaten the tool
Laid back or stay strapped for pay back
To think that I'm slippin then crippin from way back

Glocks, K's, and eagles trying to put a murder down
Watching fools servin' found
Put your eyes on the prize, hitting switches
And getting bitches with plenty riches
And if you bang homie, do that
But when your ass gets slapped with that 25, handle that
And all you see is the glamor and gold
Don't know the other side of the game is where it's scandalous and cold
Your destiny is in your hands, you got control
Wasting time with your life until your ass is old
Trying to be bold, a hog and a pimp
Eighteen years old, HIV in the limp

Can't fuck with, what you asked for
Sometimes you just should let go
Get what you need and not want
Some folks believe and some don't
These are the ones that don't last
Hard head makes soft ass
But it was something that I had to have
I just had to have

What's crackin' gangsta
Little woe G sake with a bang loose
Dickie sagging how should kicking it
Bangs with me, nigga let me swang with you
Hop in this cut dog, and split this game to ya
I see them niggas that got ya tatted and called it paddering
A clutch and a glock, banging on niggas at the bus stop
Putting in work, leave you broke, cloke white shirt
Doing dirt trying to gain strikes for the turf
Loc, what up, shit I knew your brother
You used to bang with him, when you was a little motherfucker
Until they amputated both of my legs, circled the block

I'm like a sickness; I'm like a sickness but there is no cure
And when you hear my voice don't it sound so pure
Tha Alka-holiks know, come bust fo' sho'
So whether we together kickin' down the doors

From Lake Buteras to Paris generic rappers get embarrassed
We inherit b-boy Sermons just like Erick's
Liks been flowin' longer than your grandparent's marriage
Eatin' buzzed brownies more than Bugs eat carrots
Kick back in the 'llac like a horse and a carriage
Spittin' ""The Facts of Life"" more than Tudy and Ms. Garrett
When I'm runnin' my errands Dayton rims feel like Ferris

Get socked in your larynx, if yo' ass get careless

Aiyyo who stole the soul? I did cause I was desperate
Send a random note to Loud - I want a million for my next shit
I know you got the money Steve just reach into that grab bag
Then step back and watch me drop these ""Bombs On Baghdad""
Cause Tash rap melodical, drunk periodical
Niggas think they hot but I'm seein' they ain't got it though
I'm from L.A. you from Idaho, no skills you gotta go
Fo' albums deep, so y'all motherfuckers gotta know
We birds of a feather so we, smoke together
Tha Liks and Rocwilder gonna, choke whoever
Ain't in this motherfucker comin' raw dog style
Hold my drink Mr. Tan while I jump in the crowd

[Chorus]

Excuse my gutter language, but fuck bein' famous
Robust for nameless don of rhymin' china chain less
Olde English ancient drive Chevy's with paint chips
I breathe herb, so they say my words is tainted
Let's take it back to ""Colors"" get your face painted 
With fat caps
I got more rhymes in my mind than you can fit in your backpacks
Go 'head, eat 'em up like snack packs
I stay busy like crack shacks
I like my hoes with the lickable toes
And the silver dollar nipples that be pokin' out the clothes
Now I suppose you want flows like MackinRo's
Cause you be standin on the stage at all our motherfuckin' shows
James Robinson, even my name is dominant
Lyrics astonishin' from the Likwid Conglomerate
My crew in it, I'm in it, so we remain prominent
Rap game I'm bombin' it, it's too much Uncle Tom in ït

Hate the pops and kill the T A

Hang with my crew blue strings in my shoes
Mary Jane and some loop while we swags in the coupe
I'm addicting to smacking hoes
Tracks, flows Crenshaw Boulevard backing foes

L.A.'s Finest and L.A.'s behind us
Gangsta, hoochies, essays and whinnies
D's still twisting, low low's still hopping
Gangsta shit still dropping, Crenshaw still popping

Gang signs throwing up, body's still showing up
And O yea Time Bomb still blowing up, bitch
When you got the L.A confidential up in the place to be
Ride with me

Let's all roll, throw it up if you with me
I'm so cold, who am but staying G
The Dogg Pound stays the learn all y'all heard
Please date me when stick before you get serve

You know gangstas bang and gangsta slang
It's just an gangsta thang
Gangstas dip and some gangstas trip
I'm the gangsta slip and this gangsta crip

I used bump brother with the gangsta nip
'Cause nobody else was on the gangsta tip
Gangstas smoke sh room and gangsta rock perms
Gangstas don't listen and gangstas don't learn

Gangsta rock braids and gangsta jerry curls
Gangsta's going take over the world
Gangsta's go to jail, gangstas skip bail
Gangsta's make mail and gangsta's would never fail

Gangsta's goin' stay on top
Because the gangsta is going to make the gangsta shit pop
Just lounge homeboy you in the gangsta zone
Heart thrown in California where the gangstas roll

Let's all roll, throw it up if you with me
I'm so cold, who am but staying G
The Dogg Pound stays the learn all y'all heard
Please date me when stick before you get serve

My nigga slip is an gangsta
'cause I'm an hood ster, an hood star I'm taking the hood far
The see Riders posted up with the bullet loco blue rags
Smoking the bombing fluid and keep dumping on you fags

I heard and seen it all and I'm hoping you fall
Keep looking at my nuts until I get crip ball
I'm still striving, yeah ya word is about what I'm driving
Your bitch is going me more, pedal to the floor

Fuck an navigator, nigga I can flip ten gators in my living room
If you can't to that nigga give me room
Had an tourney 89' but your bitch made me mine
See the mother fucker ran on that biz state of mind

For mine I did the crime, had to run one time
And you take my dick in your mouth in one time
I fuck you in the butt and crip walk your liver
While I rich roll on the river

Caught up in the land of hard time
Back off mine, I'm mad I'm pushing an hard line
An hard cat with hard raps and hard rhymes
I hardly pay attention to rap

My mine say hard dick serve to an bitch ain't no crime
Hood soft to hard dime, chicken way I flip mine
Hard hit and rip like canines, hit hard heads with no spine
March and start to take mine

Big D let me fuck that bitch and you fuck mine
Off hard liqueurs is harder than wine Knoc-Turnal comes through overtime
When I die build me an shrine all is all is getting in my mind
I ain't begun to speak yet, until that time

Let's throw it up, throw it up
Let 'em know, out in the west represent let it gold
Let's throw it up, throw it up

Go to G-e-sale fuckin with them e-e-mails
I'd rather get my shit wide nigga e-e-mail
Fuck a sex slavior make what I just made
That bitch had to sell her pussy for a decade
And that's too much time for the brainy one
I'm on a daily run
To crack your cranium
Wrap uranium
Ain't nothin else

Cause I'm a nigga
Your prostitutes wear high heeled boots
My prostitutes wear three piece suits
Count your money nigga

Pimp the system cause the game is grossing
Everyone listen to what we're proposing
Quit the quickness, we'll trick the system
Skills that will impress'em and make this slaves victims
Oh no no no
No more hesitation cause our game is stronger
Taking over
On top of the world they'll never take us under

I don't kiss them, twsting, pimping the system
So vp's and presidents wherever you are
Just cut a fucking check and I can bring you a star
Then read up on the deal, make them throw in the car
I got a young lawyer bitch she just passed the bar
See I'm a pure rare pimp, but I told them I got
Young homie pussy don't pay you like EMI
Mack find the ho
Then sign the ho
Then put the bitch out and steady grind the ho
Hit the radio jack and then just like that
Bitch bring money back when the ass on the track
A pro watch them come
And I watch them go
And if you don't pimp the system
Then you's a ho, whoa

State your order
Wipe them off and put them on a corner
And if she good
I take her on tour bring me ebona
I'm a rider, gangsta, wall spray painter
True banger, got nam-e, taking out enemies with my fingers
Now feds and undies when the gummy thristy homies
Looking funny I converted the street like the rap money
And now is all about the benjis and with this pen
Like pussy I pimp this lyrics like pimping cane
Leaning in my cadillac
Buffing on a De la Hoya checking ? for neighboors and high power lawyers
Cause i don't trust a bitch
I'm trying to stay way rich
Break the bitch nigga

Rich Nice where you at baby? Whoo!
I go by the name Bobby Bronson
Yeah, this is Disturbing Tha Peace
Every now and then we switch it up, you know
Mellow it out, I'm capable of that, you know

[Verse 1: I-20]
Yeah, now you about to hear the sounds of Down South Hip Hop
In my CL-Vert with the top just dropped
Some broad from backstage at the show I just rocked
But before I hit the room I make a quick pitstop
Late night, Buckhead, time to hit the BP
A new pack a switches and a box of MC's
Got no time for playin hope the broad know well
The penthouse suite at the Swiss Hotel
It's the real after party if you tryna meet me
Got anything to drink, I just need some I.D
If you know you ain't cutting it's gonna be a long walk
Cause you came here for nothing if you think we gonna talk

[Chorus Butch Cassidy]
Backstage we chilling where the players are
The ladies hoping just to meet a star
And ain't telling what they gonna do
We been sitting on the couch for all the things we do
We'll only take you if you bad as hell
No disrespect if you look so well
Its kind of crazy if you understand
So let's take advantage now, and keep these hoes in check

[Verse 2: I-20]
Now I ain't tryna be rude but lets get this thing moving
If not keep it moving cause these other hoes choosing
If pussy was a drug I woulda been OD'd
If you niggaz fucking dimes then my bitch is a key
Pimp a dime, break a bitch, take the chick of the leash
So if niggaz wanna hit it you can rent it at least
Sounds fucked up don't it, but it's part of the game
Same women holla lover all caught up in fame
And the girls at 'cris concert be acting the worst
Claiming they don't know a nigga but they rapping my verse
It's cool shawty, you ain't gotta know me to cut
Cause if you know me then you probably know I'm ready to cut

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: I-20]
Love this ain't hip hop, this and this is all a little message
That our dressing room is really for undressing
You wanna talk to me, even date me at that
But the night still young baby later for that
You wanna know my real name, where I'm from, how to start
And me I'm just tryna get your legs spread apart
Yo nigga told you that he love you and you fell right in
And now you see he never meant it and his car was just rented
Here's a drink, take a shot, take a sip, here's a glass
Use that backstage pass to give me backstage ass
See it ain't no disrespect if you know you too proud
So take this autograph and stay the fuck in the crowd

Backstage the only place for you and me
Then we head straight to the (?) (break it down)
There's no other place I'd rather be (come on)

O.G. ANTHEM

[Verse 1: I-20]
Yeah, 2-0 an OG since I first came out
DTP is the gang and yeah we will bang out
I had one close call, no the mac didn't miss
The bullet looked, saw it was me, and it jumped back in the clip
It's the gangs where I'm from, but most the sides is ours
So if a nigga talking shit, we'll just ride this song
And be careful wat you saying when you under your breath
And throw up signs like the whole neighborhood's gone deaf
Now nigga that's gangsta, no words spoken
Just one head nod and your head's bust open
This whole cool team we only got one question
In about three seconds, which side are you reppin
We used to throw hands, now it's blast on blast
You got a pass from the homey now the pass gone past
Watch the colors on your rag in the pockets you rock em
And the way you braid your hair, cause real niggaz is watching, YEAH

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
Gangsta forever I'm leaving it never
It's been done for life and it's done in all weather
Like it or love it, I ain't for no dumb shit
When you in the street, you see the niggaz you should run with
Cause we keeps it clean
When most of them gangstas lean
Here they come, here we come, cause a scene then they run
Go and get your gun, and smoke that shit when you done

[Verse 2: I-20]
And oh yeah I'm affiliated (a rider is born)
And if you want I can demostrate it (try all you want)
Man, lets get this one started bitch, I'm banging your set
The first down south nigga with a westcoast rep
1 album, 5 months, I'm number one in the hood
A low-low 3 wheels, 2 hoes and I'm good
Pull the gat, squeeze something nigga put 'em to sleep
Even these techs mean something nigga, read 'em and weap
You grinding hard to get yours while the getting is good
You got jumped in the club just for repping your hood
Eastside D-E-see, where nobody's a punk
We'll pull something out the trunk, then put you in the trunk
Look, everybody's ghetto, nigga, follow the rules
We throw a party when you come home from jail, not school
It sound sad but it's love nigga, leave it at that
And every bitch love a street nigga, this is a fact, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: I-20]
And I was born in the hood, so I'll die for the cause
Niggaz think it's all good 'til I swing on their boss
(Gangsta, Gangsta) where every screamining it
But ain't nobody meaning it, cause I know I ain't seeing it
Real thugs don't party they just hold up the wall
And buy bottles just in case they wanna start up a brawl
It's an everyday thing nigga, home of the pen
Where niggaz wear the same color like it's part of they skin
Down south or out West, look it's one in the same
Dark read or all blue, shit it's all in the gang
You better watch your handshake when you greeting your boys
Cause if they know your man fake, they'll be heating your boys
Even the bitches get down when they knowing it's beef
They got her man in the pen and her kids in the street
It's the neighborhood bullshit I gotta admit
But I'll be thuggin 'til they bury me, I'm loving this shit

Butch Cassidy,"Oh shit, caught that nigga alone
Ain't that a bitch
Hey, uh, this one here is, uh
For them niggas that be Johnny Dangerous

When they be fuckin' fifty deep
But they be fuckin' cowards when they by they selves
You know who I'm talkin' about
(You know who I'm talkin' about)

That's right, you ain't shit without your homeboyz
You ain't shit without your homeboyz
You ain't shit without your homeboyz

Now, now every time I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
Out on the streets you don't hear a peep

Nigga it's a goddamn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin' in the casket

How long will it last, nigga don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate, go get the tape
We keep the nation anticipatin' until we break

Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck motherfuckers I'm LOC
They all duckin' when my gun smoke
'Cause you ain't shit without your homeboyz

You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a fuck, you niggas is punks
Without your homeboyz
You be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary niggas is punks

You ain't shit without your homeboyz
Nigga, punk ass motherfucker
You ain't shit without your homeboyz
Throw your hands up
You little trick, coward motherfucker

Like Yak said, ?How the fuck you gonna shoot me rocks
When you got the Outlaw 'Pac shittin' ya box?
You was lookin' real weak walkin' down the street
Now a nigga thirty deep, oh you wanna beef

Talk cheap, shoot a nigga the fair one
Your homies like fuck it
What's this you the only scared one
(Fagot ass)

Damn son, close call I bet
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw nigga played you out
We could have took it to the fifth

I would I have laid you out
Niggas be actin' all different
When they dogs come around
Watch 'em act like bitches
When Outlawz draw down

They all clown, better yet they all stunned
You the type to have a gun
And never blased it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel

Outlawz you'll never forget
Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin' these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboyz, homeboy?

You ain't shit without your homeboyz
My thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
My homeboyz, the only thing a nigga got left

I love my niggas to death, we ain't shit without our homeboyz
You know what time it is
I ain't shit without my homeboyz
Hey, tell 'em the story how you came up, nigga

Now I was born alone
Took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated

One nigga smokin' and drinkin' and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son we all happy
'Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride

To rectify the problem, motherfuckers they all die
Been tryin' to make a million, by hustlin' since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villain, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me

Bustin' with automatic straps
My raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggas be together

Ain't shit without your homeboyz
Thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboyz

The only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggas to death

Butch Cassidy,"I couldn't help but notice your pain
My pain?
It runs deep; share it with me!

They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust
But now I'm labeled as a troublemaker; who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry
I'm about to crash up on the curb ‘cause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me; what should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family; what else could I do
But be a thug? Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the club!
Got my mind on danger; never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang bangers and drive bys
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin back to court, so fuck what you thought!
I'm drinkin' Hennessey, runnin' from my enemies
Will I live to be 23? There's so much pain

Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain

Years and years of that rough life
Runnin' crazed and wild as a kid and growin' tough with a knife
And livin' trifed on the regular, buckin' out competitors
See 'em fake a move and chase them down
Like the fuckin' Predator
Get in trouble everyday in school, act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin' off for the bitches, ‘cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop, pop, pop, and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo, currency kept passing me by, but I didn't cry, broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin' coke
And now the money's looking lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick 'em the game, it's all the same
I kick it back, yo; give 'em slack, yo
And now they label me the mack, yo, people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman, you heard, man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn! At least I'm realistic with my biscuit
You know you get your ass twisted, so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan, kickin' major dust
So if you're on, nigga, look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame, it's a deep game
And my mama always cryin', yo, there's so much pain

Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain

They got me mobbin' like I'm loc'ed, ready to get my slug on
And I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust – I got my Glock cocked, playa, if they press me
Bust – on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck, ‘cause I ain't looking when I'm blastin'
I'm a nut, and drinkin' Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die
Tell me why, ‘cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?
Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards want to kill me in my sleep
I'm real they cannot see
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin', loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother I'm trapped, I'm kickin' dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene, steady muggin' mean until they kill me
I'll be livin this life, I know you feel me; there's so much pain

Ohhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhh
Tired of the strain and the pain

Butch Cassidy,"Yeah, clear enough for ya.
Why niggas look mad.
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free.
Y'all look like you wanted me to stay in jail
Old busters.

Picture me rollin' in my five hundred benz.
I got no love for these niggas,
There's no need to be friends.
They got me under survailance.
That's what somebody be tellin' me.
Known as don't be insulted 
But I ain't the one tellin'.
Don't want to be another number.
I got a fuckin' gang of weed to keep from goin' under.
The fedarones want to see me dead.
Niggas put prices on my head.
Now I got 2 rottwillers by me bed.
I feed em lead.
Now on release.
How will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did?
To feed kids.
One life to live.
It's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin' at your crib.
Mama, I'm still thuggin'
The world is a war zone.
My homies is inmates
And most of them dead grown
Full grown, finally a man
Just sceamin' on ways to put some green inside the palms
Of my empty hands.
Just picture me rollin'.
Flossin' a benz on rims that isn't stolen.
My dreams is censored.
My hopes are gone.
I'm like a fiend that finally see when all the dope is gone.
My nerves is wrecked.
Heart beatin' and my hands is swollen.
Thinkin' of the G's I'll be holdin'.
Picture me rollin'
Can you see me now
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Picture me rollin'
Yeah nigga
Eh, but picture how my nigga Sak duke do it.
Guess who's back?

I got keys comin' from overseas.
Cost a nigga 200 G's.
I'm a street commando.
Nino for example.
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle.
So I got to floss 'cause I'm rollin' like a boss playa.
Thug granted to be a women layer
So many playa haters, imitaters steady swangin'.
Make me want to start bank bangin.
So I'm caught up in the game.
Let's go change.
Packin' 40 glocks.
Contain or rearrange.
All that jealousy and envy comin' from my enemies
While I'm sippin' on green leaves?
In front of black Lexuses, Chevy's on the roam.
96 big bodies sittin' on chrome
As we head up out the zone,
Stone facing is on.
Looking at mine but don't look too long.
I'm livin' a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin.
It's hard to imagine.
Picture me rollin'

I gots to get the fuck up in.
goin' to lay a caper.
'cause a nigga straight sufferin' from lack of havin' paper.
My bitch fin to have a bastard, see?
So I need to hit a lick, drastically.
I see some bald head ass niggas and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin in the pots.
Check in the park, Pac.

We caught em sleepin'.
We didn't think you niggas creepin'.
This how we do it every weekend
And I dump for madness?
It's time to count the profit.
CPO, we got the bomb spot.
Nigga, time to clock it.
I get the liquor and you could get the females.
This crooked shit can re-inflict and get the street sales.

Butch Cassidy,"[Verse 1: Mack 10]
I jump out the blocks like ready! set! go!
Check all my traps and dodge the fed co
I'm all about the mix like a f***in collage
And out the garage, is a Bentley Onage
With the brains blowed out, so the sun's beamin
I got the jackers drooling, and the hoes fiendin'
And since I'm West-side Connected got the streets on hype
I got big deals, big skrill, big wheels, big pipes

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Twenty-inchers roll - go and get these hoes
Picky hoes want to roll with my n****roles
But be a freak about it, and I'ma see about it
Speak about it, no b**** I'ma be about it
Who want some of this, West running this
Mack 10 with the playboy bunny b****
She's a dummy b**** - with a money pit?
You broke a** n****s can't even stomach this

[Verse 3: W.C.]
What that connect like? N**** like three time felon
Six-double-0-west n**** selling rich are you-bellin'
Throw it up, hold it up, guns bust fo' fingers up
Two twisted in the middle with the thumb cuffed
Chevy Nash and dippin' the a** and king of the zaggin'
Fo'-fo' mackin' and coat taggin'
Dub the hood phantom I'm in a blue phantom
In front of the club and valet, do for talk and mack 'em trick

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
What is it like, tossin' them hoes?
And rollin' them fools on them vogues
Flossin' them chains, we doin' big things
And bustin' on punks at close range
This the way us gangstas roll
Sit back and watch as it unfolds
B****es and suckers stunt so cold
This is the life we chose

[Verse 4: Mack 10]
Dope money and rapping s*** I'm all with it
And all I know is the street so that's how I spit it
Chicken-hawk see a bird, then I gotta get it
So if ya hood come up short, then I probably did it
And if lil' momma thick then I gotta hit it
The Trojan gotta be a magnum for me to fit it
If it was sherm on a stick then I probably lit it
The red beam is on your wig so I probably split it

[Verse 5: Ice Cube]
To all them b****es that think they bootylicious
I think they nutritious - I think they do dishes
I'm makin' three wishes, or takin' they pictures
And spendin' they riches and f***in' they b****es
Ego maniac - little homies call me brainiac
Ice Cube's an a**hole and it ain't an act
So take a hit of that - and remember that
Where my motherf***in n****s and my b****es at?

[Verse 6: W.C.]
Tree-i-ick! I'm Dub-see, the rider with the clique
And like a dragon it's nathin' but fire when I spit
And I can't shake these ghetto ways
A street rich n**** eatin' a bag of Lays
And rubber bands and braids
From the turf for the side, rings an ambulance
Where we keep the pistols smoking just like Afghanistan
It's gangsta the killa - the dope dealer
Back for mo' figgas - so trick bow down and po' the liquor b****

[Chorus: x2]

[Mack 10: x2]
It's plain to see, you can't change me
Cause I'ma be ""Connected for Life""

Our rise; it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hatin', fakin', schemin' on mine
And on the down-low, talkin' shit
Best move 'cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low 'cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games; so if you wanna play 'em, lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage; so if we gotta do this, let me know
That's what I came fo'

[Goldie Loc]
Where that nigga who be talkin' shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick while I was squeezin' the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was tryin' to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishin' on your raggedy Brougham
Could've thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

[Tray Dee]
Booyaka, booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's - the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the top dog bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggaz grow they hair, hope they stayin' act hard
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit, get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by, then you get capped on

Whas up, pimpin'? It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nottin' but loot
They call me Jackhammer for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got

Butch Hancock,"Down by the banks of the Guadalupe 
On a summer's evening and a haloed moon 
Wide-eyed as night owls, naked as a dream 
We washed our love in the rippling waters of a rambling stream.

We slept like time itself under diamond skies 
Far from the bright lights and the city's lies 
Our love arose like a morning dream 
And it was washed in the rippling waters of a rambling stream.

Well the mountain dreams of a blanket of snow 
And the wild wind dreams of directions it might blow 
But the river's dream is a dream of love 
And a dream of sweet reflections from above.

Down by the banks of the river of change 
We watched the river running from the wishes of the mountain range
And the stars and the wild wood played the season's theme 
And it was washed in the rippling waters of a rambling stream.

Well Dallas is a jewel, oh yeah, Dallas is a beautiful sight.
And Dallas is a jungle but Dallas gives a beautiful light.
Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?

Well, Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down.
But when you are up, she's the kind you want to take around.
But Dallas ain't a woman to help you get your feet on the ground.
Yes Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down.

Well, I came into Dallas with the bright lights on my mind,
But I came into Dallas with a Dollar and a dime.

Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eye.
A steel and concrete soul with a warm hearted love disguise.
A rich man who tends to believe in his own lies.
Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eyes.

Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Swinging on a Star,2003

he had it made with the ladies, but he never got far
Five years past, now he's gotten kinda fat
Working eight days a week at the laundromat

His dad owned a bank, while his mom was alone
Everyday with the mailman, the trashman, the lawn guy
Kid didn't look a damn thing like his dad (I knew why)

He grew up, got a job, making 80 grand a year

'Cause he hit her in the face with an old space heater

He came home drunk and tried to force sex on her
But he didn't see the .44 stuffed in the covers
So she waited till he came as he lie there naked

But he had bigger, better dreams waiting out in L.A.

She cried and he cred as the plane flew away
She never ever wanted it to end this way
Two years later, she reads in the news
He'd gone on to be a big star, but nobody knew

'Cause he changed up his name, but his heart stayed the same
'Cause every song he wrote was about her, he claimed
But he never got to tell her, 'cause he died that year

Nicols had a lot in common
With performing arts
A and are guys having cookouts
On her back with super stars
But she had some nasty habits and some
Roadwork to repair this drama queen
Sometimes Beachwood yelled at Laurel
On the terms of selling out
Then laurel yelled at Beverly
For not knowing what lifeâ??s about
With her trust fund friends and family,
It felt just like an earthquake
When sheâ??d shout
And Silverlake just stood there
With her nose up in the air
Pushing up her horn rimmed glasses saying,
I don't fucking care

And banging on things 
A couple of girls from the school 
Would listen to KISS 
(With rockets for fists) 
Acting like saturdays fool 

Learned how to smoke, 
Told dirty jokes 
Talked about loose girls from Rome 
I made out with most of them 
So I raised a toast to them 
Especially now that I'm (old)

In their paper mill jobs 
While their teen heartthrobs 
Are playing in bands 
Or they're dead 

Can I go back to when 
I was the winner 
Way before the rain came 
And washed away the sinners 
Everyone was something and 
Nothing was done right or wrong 

Smothering the cover of a '69 summer 
Played through a speaker of fuzz 
Nobody knew Bryan Adams wasn't cool 
The TV just told me he was 

Always heard the sound get me out of this town 
Resonating clear on my head 
Chuck ran away with our gear and the drugs 
I'm pretty sure that he's dead 

Or he's 46 and alone, 
Cast the heaviest stone,

Can I just go back to when 
I was the winner 
Way before the rain came 
And washed away the sinners 
Everyone was something 
(And I could never do any wrong) 

Went back to the woods 
Where I hid all my goods 
In a rusted out cadillac door 
we all get nostalgic 
And fall for the hat trick 
Of thinking it'll be like before 

Like the football jocks 
Trying to please their pops 
And the stoners aping everything their bad uncles taught 
And the teachers who cared 
More than I ever knew, 
And knew I played clubs 
Let me sleep through school 
And my day job boss 
Who wrote it up as a loss 
But let me leave when i wanted and I never got caught 
Sleeping out on the field 
In the back of my truck 
Breaking into the bars 
Steal the beer and getting fucked 
By a girl twice my age, making minimum wage 
But the tan lines were good 
And she had a good face 
Is this what I've become 
Is this all I've become 
When do I become,

In your belt loop tied little baby made it out of here

You found a chain-smokin, soft spoken, house broken man
Only so you won't be lonely and all because you can

My city had been pulled down 
Reduced to parking spaces 
A, o, way to go Ohio

Well I went back to Ohio 
But my family was gone 
I stood on the back porch 
There was nobody home 
I was stunned and amazed 
My childhood memories 
Slowly swirled past 
Like the wind through the trees 
A, o, oh way to go Ohio

I went back to Ohio 
But my pretty countryside 
Had been paved down the middle 
By a government that had no pride 
The farms of Ohio 
Had been replaced by shopping malls 
And Muzak filled the air 
From Seneca to Cuyahoga falls 
Said, a, o, oh way to go Ohio",My City Was Gone,1998
Butler,"I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me

Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be

So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me

Butt Trumpet,"Something has gone wrong
We're losing all our rights
Everyone is blind
Everything has changed

Moving every day
Towards a police state

Burying thee truth
Keeping us apart

What can we do?
What can we do? Have we all lost?
Is it too late?
What can we do?
What have we done!

I often wonder why
Nobody can tell
Just what the hell
Is going on
Everything you're told

What will you do?

We're lobotomized

Is it not our fault?

Butta,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,2006

But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Oh, let's not make love
Let's just cuddle up
Take me in your arms
And squeeze me tighter

I love it when you next to me
Got me numb like butter from your body heat
Spectac got the recipe, how I make you moan girl with the best of me
You're special, one of a kind
Hit the light switch and know that ass mines
When I'm with you, my phone on mute
When we spendin' QT, girl it's all about you
Ain't no limit to the foreplay
How I make you feel good in the right way
Get nasty, buck as a ice
I'm a do it slow, make you feel nicely
In my arms, cuddled up

Cause she wanna sleep

And we ain't really really gotta have sex
Let a Blue Star hold ya girl
I got a lot of nice things I wanna show ya girl

Them guardians they shouldn't let you get past the gate
Watch out dog, the watchdog's showing his teeth
(Guess you bit too much shit) they biting your beat
While I speak from experience, hunger and hurt
And a little bit of hate from niggas doing me dirt
I just wash it all out with Tide and show love
to those who ride with me while I'm putting in work

Full-timing it, 8:30 to 6, the graveyard shift
The three months before the benefits hit
But my position went temp' to perm'
I sat and listened like an intern watching who applied get fired
Now I'm sitting in the break room, they gotta make room (make room)
My paper stacks, put staples through 'em
So I can keep my money together
Some die-hard fans just don't want it like, ""Put Pos back on it""

We give you what we live through for real (for real)
Don't own a crown but I'm royalty

I don't give money, I don't support the needy
Schooled in America, taught to be greedy
And everything ought to be, easy
But I never could say goodbye to my friends who get high
I wonder why, I'm rocking with that guy, it's serious
Still make him cry when the satire's hilarious
Cold for your areas, flows come in various shapes and sizes
so hot that you despise it

Never last up to bat (no no no no)
These skills we don't lack (no no no no)
We never fall and pray (no no n-no no)

Yo, if you are what you eat; some of you
cats heads between your girl's legs a lot cause y'all act too sweet

Put in a little more practice on your rhyming attack
What you write's not the least bit hot
Maybe cause your wrist is so cold from all that ice you cop
Hate to hate a player but you know what?
I still smother ya like cheese and rocking leaves freshly cut

And we the steak and potatoes and De La's the greatest
And ladies be on the floor thanking the Lord that He made us
I'm telling you, I swoop her like a pelican do
You saying look at that pelican fly, you spitting gelatin rhymes
They shaky as shit, ugly in the mold you fit
We the square peg on the round hole, sound's soulful
Your imitation flavor is tofu
It's true we make our bed all day, and we are

in the days of all four hundred ways that people lack
It's that (what) authentic, big-nosed mic music 
Four to five survive all night to it

And that's alright, I just penned another sixteen

To tell you I love you
You showed me what true friendship means

This life is rough

You shared your strength

And I want you to know

You help me to grow
I thank you 
Where ever you go

Tough times I came through
You were there, helped me make it through

This life gets rough
But knowing you has made me stronger

Yo...You make me want to vomit 

Yo  pay homage and dos e doe my sonnets

y'all cronies souped up 

My men ain't near dumb, we grew up 

You want your hair done? Hey, FUCK around and get your crew cut 

I organize the mental 

And live my life as the next essential 

Speak on this wild shit, as If I could begin to 

Who fall quick? Too many niggas fightin' over small shit 

You'll find me flippin' stocks, on boats that never dock 

I travel blocks, pick the best man 

Bust shots at the yes man, 'cause it was destined 

for me to flip investments 

Bag a lie, in the basement of the Best Western 

And if you don't want the consequence, then don't ask the question!

In Ninety Nine, more war, more crime 

Some'll stay behind doors, and some blow nines 

Your conception is annoying 

Leave the things we was born in 

The street nights, and hope we see the following morning 

Niggas sold soul, for gold ropes 

Do crimes, for new shines 

Poor beer out on the spot, where police drew lines 

Hey yo word, we thirty plus 

Wear guns that's dirty (?) bust (?) 

Ask your men pa, you should've been more (What?)...courteous 

Like my rain drop 

And all my li'l niggas rockin' tank tops 

And sell arms, like government bonds, in Bangkok 

Bank stops on lavish trips 

Soils I marry with, a dime piece!

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!

Finding another world.

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,

Tommy played piano like a kid out in the rain 
Then he lost his leg in Dallas he was dancin' with the train
They were all in love with dying they were drinkin' from a fountian
That is pouring like an avalance coming down the mountian
I don't mind the sun sometimes the images it shows
I can taste you on my lips and smell you in my clothes
Cinnamon and sugary and softly spoken lies
You never know just how you look through other people's eyes
Some will die in hot pursuit and firey auto crashes
Some will die in hot pursuit while sifting through my ashes
Some will fall in love with life and drink it from a fountian

Another Mikey took a knife while arguing in traffic
Flipper died a natural death he caught a nasty virus
Then there was the ever-present football player rapist 
They were all in love with dying they were doin' it in Texas
Holly caught a bullet but it only hit his leg
While it should have been a better shot he got him in the head
They were all in love with dying they were drinkin' from a fountian
That was pouring like an avalance coming down the mountian

And a loaded automatic just to blow me all away
With a dog drinkin' liquor from a hole in the sky
And a picture of a pitcher throwin' pitches at a guy

Buxton,"When I was a boy of nine 
I loved you with all my mind
All my heart, all my soul
Love me now or lose it all

Your sister Jean and Anne-Marie
Say that you're in love with me 
Is there something I can't see?
Love me now or leave me be

Down by the river, on past the creek
All the way to Widow's Peak 
Proclaimed the love but you didn't speak 
Love me now or hold your peace

The baker and the butcher's wife
Say you lead a lonely life 
Need a man to stand beside?
Love me now or stand aside

Even I get lonely too

Love me now or leave me

If no one's waiting past these hills

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

Spilling out all the truth

In innocence I hold it all inside

One of these days these blues will be gone 
When I'm laid beneath cold grey stone

And when I'm gone then I'll be free
From the blues that haunt me

Often I wonder how it will be
To have no more sorrow when I rest in peace

Sometimes I feel like I'm alright 
Then I awake and see the morning light

Some say I'm waiting to be called home
To my final reward beneath a cold grey stone

Buzz Carlton,"Freedom of Speech

A couple hundred years ago
Between two countries on this earth
Men fought and died to protect what shes worth
Now shes not just a piece of material
Or some sort of useless rag
Shes the symbol of our freedom
Ol Glory the American Flag

Now lately some crimes have been commited
By some cowards with no name
Who took it upon themselves
To send her up in flames
Now I just dont see how it can be
A constitutional right
To destroy what flew so gallantly
Through the peralous fight

And if it were up to me theyd all be in the slammer
Id lock em up tight where the sun dont shine
This is the land of the free and were all together
Freedom of speech well thats mine

Every time I look at the stars and stripes
Im reminded of who I am
And of our fathers that fought our wars
And the gulf and Vietnam
Now weve all got to pull together
To put an end to this abuse
Cause the way that I see it
There just aint no excuse

And the lonesome sound that a freight train made

Buzz Cason,"That Mississippi farm wasn't much
But girl, it was a home for us.
Now we can never go back
Because I heard it from the Judge.
He said: ""Son, the people in the valley won't
Have anything to do with you now"".
So goodbye for the very last time
To the place we love somehow.

We can never go back to the garden of Eden.
Adam and Eve have sinned.
We can't go back again. Oh no no.

She was sixteen and I was a twenty-five.
For the first time in my life I really felt alive.
But we never should have done what we done when
We took that little run into town.
The Bank Teller made a wrong move
And I cut him down (gunshot).

We can never go back to the garden of Eden.
Adam and Eve have sinned.
We can't go back again. Oh no no no. Oh no no no.

From the getaway car to the hideout,
Thinkin' 'bout the dyin' man.
And no matter how hard I washed
I couldn't get the stain offa my hands.
But Eve you were there beside me even though
The chips were down.
And I heard you cry out to me
As they took us back into the town.

We can never go back to the garden of Eden.
Adam and Eve have sinned.
We can't go back again. Oh no no no. Oh no no no.

Now this Louisiana farm they sent us to,
It 'ain't like our home.
They got you workin' too hard
An' they got me bustin' up stone.
But I believe one day they'll pardon us
And we'll walk away.
And Eve I'll still love you then
Although we'll be old and grey.
 
But we can never go back to the garden of Eden.
Adam and Eve have sinned.
We can't go back again. Oh no no.

Saturday night and the moon is out. 
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
when it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
out in the middle of a big dance floor.
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more.
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight.
 
And I never have wandered down to New Orleans,
never have drifted down a bayou stream.
But I heard that music on the radio,
and I swore someday I was gonna go:
down a highway 10 past Lafayett;
there's a Baton Rouge.
and I won't forget to send you a card with my regrets
'cause I'm never gonna come back home.

a gulf storm blowin' into town tonight.
Livin' on the delta it's quite a show.
They got hurricane parties ev'ry time it blows.

and there ain't no cure for my blues today;

Bring your mama, bring your papa, bring you sister too.
They got lots of music and lots of room.
When they play you a waltz form a nineteen ten, 
you're gonna fell a little bit young again.
Well you learn to dance with you rockin' roll,
you learn to swing with do-si-do.
But you learn to love at the fais do

Fathers are black holes that suck up the light

But I'm so happy just to be with you

You said that time you didn't love me
Although I'd been the cutest you'd seen
But would the past have changed even though

I'm looking through mirrors to catch the reflection that can't be mine

And I believe in the resurrection
And I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the elixir of youth
And I believe in the absolute truth
Yes I believe in, I believe in

There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore

I've fallen from favor while tryin' to savor experience
I'm seein' things clearly but it has quite nearly blown my mind
It's the aim of existence to offer resistance to the flow of time
Everything is and that is why, it is will be the line

I believe in perpetual motion
And I believe in perfect devotion
I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the things I've never had
And I believe in my mum and my dad
And I believe in, I believe in

There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore

I'm skippin' the pages of a book that takes ages for the foreword to end
Triangular cover concealing another aspect from view
My relative motion is just an illusion from stopping too fast
The essence of being these feelings I'm feeling, I just want them to last

I believe in original sin
And I believe what I believe in
Yes I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the web of fate
And I believe, I'm goin' to be late

You've sold your secret, will you tell mine?

Release a power much greater than this foolish pride

To get my tail wagged must I sit up and beg

And if you want to brush up on technique
You can read all about it in the book that I found
When the spirit is willing the flesh won't be weak
There's little more to it than just jerking around
I'm hungry for the most perfect of needs
My craving feeds at the palm of your hand

My temperature shoots up to one hundred degrees
It's manual automatic makes me weak at the knees

Not for the first time I've started to feel

Straight, straight through my heart and that's no lie

I don't want to play the innocent you know me too well
You still keep me wondering but I don't know why
You satisfy the need you created
And for the first time I feel so real

The pile of debts never ending

Dreamin', am I dreamin'?
Try as hard as I can I just can't get you out of my mind
Dreamin', am I dreamin'?
Will my dreams come true or am I simply wasting my time?

Well, I told you that I'm sorry, didn't mean to make you cry
But look at it from my point of view
It's the little things in life on which our happiness depends
And what's the use if any in trying to survive
All the problems that the world can provide
If at the end of all it we haven't got the time to be friends?

Well, I get this funny feeling that just won't stay away
You know it drives me almost out of my mind
It seems that life's too short to carry on the way that we do
Too much discrimination is keeping us apart
And I don't think I can take any more
I only hope and pray I can find a way to say ""I love you""

Oh wouldn't it be great if we could be in that state forever
Just a moment with you in the next year or two or whenever
Let's make history together

Dreamin', am I dreamin'?
Try as hard as I can I just can't get you out of my mind

From heaven to hell and back again

And so each night I say a prayer
Someone to love someone to care

Hold on

What are we living for ?
All of my hopes, dreams and desires
Assembly required
That's flat-pack philosophy

So when my thoughts make me depressed
I think the best and fuck the rest

Despite it all the future's key
The double decker bus, the one I didn't see

I wonder if you'll notice
Exactly how I feel
Maybe if we could spend more time together
Then you'd discover what I try hard to conceal

But you don't know what I'm talking about

And I break into a sweat
I wish that I could stage the perfect encounter
That I just hope to god I won't live to regret

What a complete waste of time I've had enough

The love I wished for don't exist
If it's not one thing it's another - can't carry on
But I feel powerless to resist

Friends don't know what I go through I've had enough
Now see what you've made me do I've had enough

Been trapped in this state of denial for far too long
The love I've aimed for has been missed
But this time I'm serious, it's final
It would be wrong, don't wanna be a masochist

And I wish that there could be another way
But I can't believe a single word you say, anyway

Not gonna take any more I've had enough
Just what did you take me for? I've had enough

Each morning I wake and discover you're still the same
The love I crave for won't exist
It's neither one thing nor another - I won't go on
I hope I'll find strength to resist

Sure is its own reward

You are the one I care about, the only one I love
And though we may be separated by the sea

And I intend to keep that promise, you know

I have this dream of yearning, burning in my heart
Of how goos things still would be
If we made a brand new start
Seven empty days fill weeks tough months become years
But I still cherish memories of romantic beers

And so I'll tell you something you already know
Para siempre means forever
I still intend to keep that promise, you know

What I want is reconciliation
This separation's more than I can bear
Don't wanna be alone, my love is guaranteed
I want to know that you still care

And so I'll tell you something you already know
Para siempre means forever

Your love is all I need

To be deserted so that hurt is all that's left inside

Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Wish I never loved you but I just can't let go

What makes me think I mean nothing to you ?
Everything that you say, everything that you do
All you excuses, the lies you invent
Provide more than a little discouragement
Wish I never loved you but I just can't let go

Tried to brainwash what I had
Somethings they can't find
So I guess that's not so bad

Yeah I'm counting the hours
You're a long time living dead
And yesterday's flowers will be placed
Upon your head

Your a perfect girlfriend and I want you for my wife

May not be good at real romance

Give me a chance to show and prove 
Yo baby doll don't front the move

Like you, you know I'm the innocent 
I shouldn't tell you this but I keep urging 
You might not believe it but I'm still a virgin 
Do you want my love I need to know 
'Cause we're taking this situation too slow 
Say yes and I'll keep a smile on your face 
But if you say no, I'll be gone without a trace 
'Cause you are the one and you got my number 
I dream about you when I'm deep in slumber 
You should know that its your love I need 
And satisfaction is guaranteed 
And you know why I want your love so much

Away from small town schemes
Cobblestones on bumpy roads
To the life on silver screens
Memories from a life escaping
When the dark is closing in
After storms have passed I see at last
The magic can begin

There I see the guiding light
The star you’re born to be
I realize your love has set me free

We could be heroes
We could be angels in the sky
From the rainbow’s end to heaven sent
We spread our wings and fly
We could be heroes
We could be lovers you and I
And when angels fall and curtains call
We climb the mountains high
We could be heroes

Take me to the streets where I used to walk
The dreams I sacrificed

We could be angels in the sky
From the rainbow’s end to heaven sent
We spread our wings and fly
We could be heroes
We could be lovers you and I
And when angels fall and curtains call
We climb the mountains high

I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time

If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time

Brings me down to this conclusion
That I'm a man of conviction
I've wasted time out of window panes
No place to go to recreate
The feelings that I have inside
When I spend time with you

We are never alone 
Bringin' down angels today
His promises are true he's always 
Closer than we're far away

T-t-t-turn it up 
I want to feel alright
Like a shining star
On a summer night
Heavy glow of rock and roll
Pumping through your stereo
Makes me want to sing

The plans God made
Are for hope and of love
Lord you're so good to us",Far Away,2003

Drivin' right to the city limits sign

Ship lost at sea
Dry land was right in front of me

Reminiscing on my first slant,
By the time I was sipping on my first Schlitz
Hit the game, I started as a look out,
See the fly cars that the big wheelies pushed out,
Dirt bikes popping wheelies by the cookout, that was that summer,
I was thirst to be plumper. It pays better but the risk was worst,
Save the fly leather copping kicks with the work.
It didnt work; I was fucken up the re-up.
Bottles at the tunnel, that was 98, I called papa for the bundles,
An easy ten grand, it felt like a hundred,
These Gucci belts by the stomach, with guns in them.
Its only wealth that we want, if we run wit em
Till the death, until the feds come and get em
Byrd gang money, it started off that Byrd Kane Money
New cars, in that third lane money!

Getting money is the hardest,
Your first hundred grand is a job
Your first cool million, you're an artist.
Especially if the niggas up the block, sell garbage
Told it, crumbles all apart when you hold it
Wasn't naturally born a crook, I was molded
Drugs kept my uncles in the green, so I sold it
Even learned to smell a good grade through the packing
Headed Midwest and got financial backing
Started networking with the wheelies on credit
Any concepts of being robbed I was debited
Anybody get it, don't come a day later with the eigth money
Got to play it out, cause I said it
Courts an acquittal, coming in the club with an entourage
Me I'm the boss in the middle.
The brain and the bran roc-a-house rope around the neck
A lot of letters for the chain, and the charm. Come on man

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,

At a young age, no bricks just grams
Nigga stuck, then your mans a flip
The situation real, then your mans a hit
You slow on the get-a-way, the can you get
You circle the block, you play track and field
A lot of real niggas on that track got killed
But you know me forever manning up,
Never sit down when I pee, forever standing up
I'm a boss, so I'm calling the shots,
Big homie, pioneer of the block
You wanna pump, nigga Ill tell you when and where at
Don't face-fight; I'm not the one to stare at.
Matter of fact dog, you and your man sits,
In the back off cop car, dog, pointing your index
I guess you could, cause you a Sammy the Bull
But somebody gonna die if a hammer get pulled.

Just clean my fancy car

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams

Byron Bank,"Officially crazy, that this world gets daily
Thinking here lately that half this shit shouldn't phase me
Yet the media chauffeurs the crazy, driving Miss Daisy
Now is my net gross enough to even consider about saving
It's just a hard and a knock life
Where opportunity can't get right, it left us all in plain sight
To blinded to see, we can't believe it, yet it's true
What's hope without faith? Do you have a clue?
Another lost one falling, 
We all victim to the system yet racism they call it
Now what's a law abiding citizen
When the law can't abide what's being placed before the citizen
'Cause that don't make no sense
Just like the one extra penny you paying monthly on rent
I know the struggle is real cause this is everyday life
Too many dying and killing, some even take their own life

I'm just praying for better dayz
Still praying for better dayz
There's so much I gotta say, it bothers me everyday
Time I ease my mind and move bullshit out the way
I'm just praying for better dayz
Still praying for better dayz
There's so much I gotta say, it bothers me everyday
Time I ease my mind and move bullshit out the way
I'm just praying for better dayz

Years ago I heard this
Mama told me there'd be days like this
Who would have thought that it would switch, in time to reminisce
Stories that go untold like criminal minded shit
Some many hop on the band wagon just to say they support it
Wanting self glorification just to feel so important
I can't breathe
Just know the fact to these things
Instead of appearing just to be on the scene
You niggas ain't on the team
Believe me, cause I done witness some shit
Been apart of and accused cause I fit the descript
Should it be this way, nawl too much shaded grey
Areas and barriers that's placed in our way
'Cause I be speaking as a whole, when I speak unto you
Everybody wanting change but they fearing it to
I know the struggle is real, this is everyday life
Too many dying and killing, some even take their own life

I'm just praying for better dayz
Still praying for better dayz
There's so much I gotta say, it bothers me everyday
Time I ease my mind and move bullshit out the way
I'm just praying for better dayz
Still praying for better dayz
There's so much I gotta say, it bothers me everyday
Time I ease my mind and move bullshit out the way
I'm just praying for better dayz

I always hear people say, 
I’m always broke, ain’t got a dime to my name
And I hear them hope for change
That seems to be taking it’s time coming
They hope better dayz are ahead
They think things aren’t as bad as they were
Those people are dead
Alive, but dead and breathing
Forever wishing, on a star that doesn’t shine
What everyone forgot, a simple thing
Change is created by change
Is that too deep? 
Better dayz come with better ways
Better ways, 
Only sow what you want to reap

Still praying for better dayz
There's so much I gotta say, it bothers me everyday
Time I ease my mind and move bullshit out the way
I'm just praying for better dayz
Still praying for better dayz
There's so much I gotta say, it bothers me everyday
Time I ease my mind and move bullshit out the way

Byron Bank,"Take me back to that time in my life to revisit
And all this weight upon my shoulder now is finally lifted
As for my distance please forgive me, I know I've been missing
And I been working that's for certain, hope y'all ready to listen 
I on a mission, grinding, minding my business
So much passion deep inside, though I thought about quitting 
Until I realized that the game don't give a fuck about feeling
Now I'm here to make change up out you 5 dollar niggas, c'mon

Why don't the sun shine
Why don't the sun shine
Why don't the sun shine
Is it because you're not mine

And I didn't want you fucking anyway bitch, talking all that shit
Hard dick and bubble gum is all you bitches gonna get 
I'm just playing but super serious though 
It's like you practice giving head and never did it before, whoa
It's not the same or different, if you ask me how I'm living
I'll tell you pimping, my life I been renting 
And now it mortgages since, the change up and switch
I got an appetite to wreck, so buckle up for this hit
Drive is incredible, nothing's comparable 
Too tight as my grip, could never see myself let it go
So let it go, so let it go, so let it go
Where's reality them others play a role 
Staying persistent, I'm always up in the kitchen 
I taught myself to go get it, not much luck with that wishing
While everybody stationary, I'm just changing my address
Here's goes the change, hope y'all proud of the progress

Why don't the sun shine
Why don't the sun shine
Why don't the sun shine
Is it because you're not mine

And there's so many reasons why, shit I don't have to explain it 
Clearly you see the signs vividly the picture is painted
Up on this wonderful canvas, do this shit it's a must
This is where my heart is at and I don't need approval of course 
I use to think that they supported when all I heard was excuse
Such and such, this and that, then I came to a clue
That the ones that claim they're down a quickly switch on you too
So I had to make a change to adapt to it too
Damn I'm feeling this, give me a shot of Henny to reminisce
In my Dexter's laboratory penning my experience 
It's safe to say that all the bullshit is done
And I don't need to meet the oracle to know I'm the one
All I do is make hits, like Solange in the elevator 
Too soon, we'll get back to that one later
The sun rises even after it sets 
If I'm a dick, I might as well just bust a nut on your chest
Now keep the change niggas

Why don't the sun shine
Why don't the sun shine
Why don't the sun shine
Is it because you're not mine",Change,

There's a lot of people that doubted me, which allowed me to not feel a thing
Now I'm high as hell, buzzing, like a dope fiend cause I don't feel a thing
Cold world still a dollar and a dream, shit ain't always what it seem
Back then see they didn't want me, now I'm hot and they all up on me, like damn
Is he really gone drop that, talk shit and they still go cop it
From the city where they know we launch rockets, any means Imma get it, no option
Waiting for the moment just to capture it, while y'all sleeping
Dream chasing I'm speeding, if the streets is watching then I'm peeping
And that's how it goes, don't say I can't cause I'll show you so
Prove you wrong look you in the face, and say I told you so, bitch
It's not a threat it's a promise, and I'm just being honest
Taking names while kicking ass, on my Fresh Prince shit, bitch I ain't Jazz
And for all of y'all that want to know exactly what I'm bout to do
You couldn't understand if I taught y'all niggas what I'm bout to do

Cooping with the bullshit, and attitude now on some fuck feelings

Never said shit or even thought about it, see it's my time so let me speak about it

Truth is, jealousy so stupid
I ain't going to amount to nothing, tell me who the fuck, you is
Tell me that and I'll tell you this, your opinion, remember it
When I'm on the big screen, doing big things, with visible fans to the ceiling
Shocked as hell from a close friend to even say that
Suppose to be my ride or die, now you riding by and I'll wave back
Everything so different, words never sound so distant
What was said was said in the past and we can't revisit, damn
And that's bitter sweet I hate to say that
A doubtful one you are, and this song you can't play back

Telling all of your business, posting Kermit pictures
Like it's socially funny but that ain’t none of my business
Pillow talking with thots, too busy nutting off in it
Now you caught up in a situation
Just reacting to bullshit, to elevate it
No floors involved, pushing buttons ain't going no where at all
Just continue to fall, continue fall for the okie doke
This reality unscripted not a tv show
Fuck that other shit with long dick, director's choke
Know that really nobody cares

And did I know, I told him, nawl it's the same man, you tripping 
Constantly I'm getting more focused, what's gotten in to me
Arrested my development back then when Tennessee, was slamming
Still a get the party party jumping
Had enough of that trapping, now pull your breaches up

Lying and deceit, evil malicious and planted seeds
So much to live for, but just the thought of having to feed the family
You remain on the streets, you pray but working for the enemy
Animosity, all over the nation, secrets held under wraps
I call it the silent operation
Minus on probation, felons under eightteen, discrimination
Just take a look at Harris County, yeah
Judging by the color of the skin, 
Rest in peace Trayvon Martin, careful who you’re letting in
The closer the kin want to see you deep below the barrel
Never turn my back, can’t even trust my own shadow

Maybe they was right on the end of a cliff
Hold on strong second guessing my gift
They told me life was a dream, but now I'm dating that bitch 
And I will never chase what's destined to me
You couldn't visualize or even paint what I see
I use to fear of being judged and every cared what they think
Now I believe in myself and give a fuck what they think
That use to drive me crazy until I realized
We are not the same, just destined nigga in due time
Underline that shit two times, but it in bold face
Capitalize not, punctuate it, then quotate

Picture yourself with something, picture yourself with nothing
Or on the corner with a sign up in public
Looking for something to eat, when no one else will reach 
A helping hand or a dollar cause they're quick to even judge you when you stand on them streets
And every day it's a struggle, to get back on your feet
The middle class a say this, upper class a say that
But if that was motherfuckers wouldn't know how to act
First and foremost that's real shit
And a lot of mental shit to even deal with or go through
They say there's help but who to go to
And when it's there you won't accept it cause your pride, controls you
And that could be the death of us all
We fall to get picked up in life to evolve
Consider this small cause soon or later you might
Realize it starts with you and watch a change in your life

Life is so beautiful, you gotta believe

The only outcome was an end and you're feeling it worst
Questioning everything, even your worth
Losing yourself cause in the end, all you got was the hurt
Something's are never meant to be
Only learned to make us really see 
The beauty in ourselves lies deeply underneath 
All the pain and the scars, that you battle and heal
You know the days get harder, trust me I know how you feel
Better days are coming, I know you're fed up
And all the bitterness you're battling inside that's built up 
And sheltered, you hold on to, never to let it go
It's doing nothing but destroying you even more
Here's something to think about
Happiness is you, you attract what you're giving out
It's time for a change, you can sit there and think about it
The world awaits but it waits for nobody

Life is so beautiful, you gotta believe
Everything is, what you want it to be
Dreams come true, you don't have to be sleep
Just keep focus and watch you succeed
But let me tell you something, 
Something, something
Is way better than nothing, 
Nothing, nothing",Something Versus Nothing,

Couple of hours, back seat, about to give it up
Now can I beat it up, video tape media
Put that shit on worldstar and label that shit B-B-beat it up
Now that's impressive girl keep dropping that ass
The way you engineered, I had to throw a drop in the track

But let’s get it clear, cause I don’t like speaking in typo
You chief hoe stop fucking and sucking these niggas just cause they got nice clothes
Got Gucci this and Gucci that, and you know that the belt match the Gucci hat

Educated but the streets got 'em, strong enough to be a role model
See his hands up but they still shot ‘em, itchy finger made the man squeeze
Taking life no excuses, red blood see we all bleed
That’s another story and another song, 
Pardon me, I’m a carry on
This automatic not manual, but I operate without a manual
And I’m beasting going animal, Muppet Baby like Animal
Just a happy day with no Fonzie,
And not giving a fuck is my attitude, so
Silently I’m still tip-toeing
To the top, y’all tricking nigga y’all still hoeing
That’s a damn shame, energized but I’m still going
A different day ain’t new to me, cause my thought gone, puberty
Tom Fords and a side iron, in case I might run aside
Of a wrinkle nigga off a clothesline, trying to get fresh, I now realize

Liquor bottles turned swimming pools, model broads in my living room
Illustrated getting sporty, taking selfies in swimsuits
Pop style like everyday, can’t complain got much to say
Cause I live my life fast, like a quarter mile and that cocaine

Gaining weight like lifters do, 
Pay attention this is overdue, I need my forty acres and a mule
This that cocaine in that glass vial, line it up gone take a sniff
Of this crack music, or you can light it up cause I make hits
If it make dollars then it makes cents, mo’ money mo’ problems bitch
Being broke really make no sense, no money is problem bitch
If you got the work and I need that, lyrical dope and I be that
Vocabulary so necessary, but a dope beat it comes secondary to
To the shit I be dropping, not stopping 
Lose myself in the moments, opportunity keep knocking
They jocking every word of that good shit
What she gotta have and that’s good dick
Where I come in legendary, but we face to face in the missionary 
Now it’s back to the topic, this rocket fuel ain’t common
Shit, I don’t play the same on the same page, just read different in a different way
And I’m wide awoke well rested, want a call back leave a message

How did this happen, where we go wrong I still wanna know
We were lovers and once friends, now look at us both
’Til this day I’m still here for ya, some kisses and hugs for ya 
No matter the circumstances, I’ll always have love for ya
We use to joke about it, now it’s reality

Now both of them hate me, because I did them both wrong
I told you passion has a price, that’s why I’m writing this song
Admitting my selfish ways, it’s getting harder each day

I think about it every day, I’m hoping you’re do the same

These my current situations all bullshit aside

Quick to send a message, waiting for the reply
I use to tell myself and you I’m not that typical guy
And all the shit you been through, and I knew of it too
I watch you cried on the couch how could I did this to you
That shit was devastating, handing my key grabbing my things
And my baby that’s unborn I can’t even see
Now you look at me different, it ain’t the same yeah I get it
And I don’t ever wanna be the one you think of resenting
Now I’m at the therapist, how could it just come to this

I gotta keep it together, it’s all on me I realize
I live a double life, it’s hard to keep the other a side
And now we five months in, you’re asking me for the name
When we talk about it all I really see is your pain
Now I struggle to tell my kids, my oldest at that
My granny said I’m like my father I don’t wanna be that
Still that hurt ’til today, my sister turned me away
Had to watch my momma cry when I told her the same
This my life but live it, shit I know what I did
And I’m giving him my time just like the rest of my kids
Nobody stand in my way, fuck what everyone say
Ain’t the first it happened to or be the last shall I say

Patiently you waited for this day, frantic now that you see it
Can’t believe it that it’s here, but remember them years
When the struggle was real, away from home and you feared
That things would never get better, you only hoped that they will
As you sit in the auditorium hearing professor talk
And the lectures were nothing you gave a fuck about
Puzzled at the same time, stressed to keep an open mind
But progress was regressed working nine to five
And then reality settled in, you be the first in your family 
With a wonderful Grammy, that will soon come in handy, 
And that career you were planning is getting closer like family
You dig, 

It’s a day for celebrating, that moment y’all been waiting
Hats up in the air, it’s time for graduation
Diplomas and you planned, long summer vacation
Let’s toast to graduating, let’s toast to graduating
It’s a day for celebrating, that moment y’all been waiting
Hats in the air, time for graduation
Degrees and you planned, long summer vacation
Let’s toast to graduating, let’s toast to graduation, let’s toast

As you acrossing the stage
Your favorite song and it plays, in your head as you wave
Friends and family scream, some chanting your name
All of a sudden you gaze at the girl off the stage
That you been eyeing for a long time, a couple classes y’all took
She just gave you that look, even signed in your book
As it read for you to call her sometime
Gone be a long long summer is what you had in your mind
Let’s rewind to the times when you was on the couch
With you head up in the pages trying to figure out
Ain’t nothing like those quizzes teach be dishing out
That final grade you use to always seem to stress about
Borderline crazy, ever paper was graded
Thoughts of joining the navy, scholarships you’re maintaining
All that difficult shit, you been through and don’t miss
Until this day, prepares you for moments like this

Backpack full of books, when you walk in the room
Thirty minutes for nap then at work before noon
A couple hours just to study, off to sleep and it’s two
In the morning now it sucks cause at six you’re at school
Now you’re back at it, hoping that you don’t get a quiz
And your friends throwing parties but you work until ten
Couple hours just to study, and it’s two once again
In the morning, but today you’re graduation beginnings

It’s a day for celebrating, that moment y’all been waiting
Hats up in the air, it’s time for graduation
Diplomas and you planned, long summer vacation
Let’s toast to graduating, let’s toast to graduating
It’s a day for celebrating, that moment y’all been waiting
Hats in the air, time for graduation
Degrees and you planned, long summer vacation
Let’s toast to graduating, let’s toast to graduation, let’s toast

Toast to graduating, let’s toast to graduation, let’s toast

Back to back with no message, get blocked in a second bitch, hold up
New to the game, y’all fruit ninjas roll up
I ain’t playing or slicing but it’s time y’all catch up
Double XL I need the freshman cover
All my past shit, you can call that a warm-up
See the summers up and I’m on
Been missing shit for so long
Now I’m here and halfway gone
From the weed smoke that I’ve blown
On the other hand when I think about it, I mean really really think about it
Last dream I had I woke up in a new Bugatti, since I’m really being frank about it
I ain’t got it yet but I’m on the road to these riches
In these ragged clothes and these breaches
Making it rain on these strippers
See somebody got to make a difference, when it comes downs to the highs and lows
VIP stay outta control, I’m getting head with my eyes closed
See she goes down, Geronimo
Breath, breath in just a little bit, 
Let me put the head in just a little bit, see it’s all same with experience, girl
Now taste that, babysitting don’t waste that
It’s a known fact that the game ain’t really been the same since the cadillac and 8 track

Pardon me for being blunt about it
But I gotta keep it real and the truth of the matter is, when you sit here and think about it
More fucks given more heartache, less fucks given more heartbreak
It’s all the same is the out take, no matter where you really go or about face
It’s a cold world with no chill filter
Food for thought with more liquor
Sex sells nowadays more quicker
If the canvas naked you can’t picture the shit
Women out here dogging the men
Saying damn why you acting like a bitch
Threesome on some lesbian shit
Middle finger while I’m playing with the clit like

Like a pedophile cause you ain’t paid your bill in months, the metaphor is all fucked up

Save the number as don’t answer, we all guilty of this shit man hold up
Peep this it ain’t new to me,
Ice box on my heart where it use to beat
Back to back in this bitch like it’s two of me
No feelings when I say, you should join the league

You know your vibe I been digging it, since the start the beginning
And when you walked in the room you stole the limelight
You know I shine bright, together we be a blind sight
Let them hate cause shit I know they will
We’re living our dream they eating value meals,
How’s it feels, escaping the moments without a care in the world
Would give you diamonds and pearls but not a typical girl
So I, do the best that I can I hope you notice it
If you like it I love it, that’s like in that order shit
Shoutout to that Momma Dee, your twitter I be following

But if her cousin join in then that be something else
Kissing cousins for a moment I want it, 
Don’t have to tell nobody, our little secret, I hoping now am I

Changing up my life when I thought I wasn’t

I keep on losing my way, it’s getting hard to keep up
No feelings, don’t have too much to say 
I hope your heart is a better place
You know it’s real in the field with all this sexy appeal
But let me find out it’s fake, can I cop me a feel
Then I try to be true because I know you alone
I’m on the road at these shows, these bitches come out they clothes
I’m thinking bout the pussy weed and all this alcohol 
Something that a seem to satisfy us all 
I’m way outta control
So many yes’ I rarely hear a no
Is it too late to fix, we both just wanna know

Looking through the frames I hope the Visionworks, glasses
Preaching to the masses, repenting before I crash in
Never regretting or looking past it

Every line in the script, like I been there before
You know that delicate, medicine slightly ease the approach
But then I’m going all in, in and out out the the door, I go
I hate to say it’s true
The fact is, it’s not me it’s you
I’m sticking to the role only played the position
I guess you failed to mention, when you started catching some feeling
I knew it would happen, way too soon to imagine
A step forward like we’re taking two steps backwards
Where we go I don’t know, too busy caught in the moment
But when the camera is rolling, we’re directing the moments, now am I

Got a man but she’s missing me, so suddenly
All on my line, telling me she in love with me
The new news, he ain’t hitting it right
Cause her walls ain’t been the same, since I laid the pipe
Now days I’m just really where she want to be

Could have been my Cookie in my Empire
Sparks fly cause we set shit on fire
Still the same 'til present day
She’s the middle of the week I call her Wednesday
Blessing in disguise, so this guy keeps an eye on her
Ride or Die, kill the pussy when she ride on it
Word on the gram, she been asking about me
Said I’m doing well and she never doubt me
But her new nigga looking through her phone, should've guess it
When he saw the flirting in a message
Here’s another named Sade’
Always use to party with her, now days
Now days she’s just lonelier than before
FaceTiming me the nookie through the cell phone
Got me on speed dial, texting me, yeah it’s been awhile
You know the same old shit just a different whale
Free willy but the pussy be wet as hell

Life, is like a movie script with no details, less inspirations
Pay a nigga he’ll turn his cheeks
Everybody for themselves it seems

See the world just another Museo
America, you suppose to be the land of the free I mean
But every day on the tv screen, all we see is racism and violent things
Everybody got a phone
Just to video and post
Quick to scream world star 
Rather than just get along

Sad thing is everybody wanna make a difference, then
But it’s too late, part time but want full pay
Half the time we participate, then it’s back to the same old shit today

Love and hate at the same time
Both in the system as a crime
Ironic how we always walk that line
Help me understand, right now I need clarity
A rapist gets out of jail and we give him gets security
Hands up but you still shoot, Sandra Bland and Trayvon too

Oh no, it’s well written on the tv screen
It ain’t black and white, the whole thing is on another fucking color scheme

They get scared when I step on the stage and spit
Really really in amaze they get, 
Give it up for the band while I’m aiding it 
That means I’m Frankie Beverly and Mazing it
Still blind to the hate that’s why I’m shading the shit, don’t wanna see the shit, so pardon me
Introducing to you a new smarter me
With a whole lot of heart never skipped a beat
Played the game without a code to cheat
Going harder what it’s suppose to be, you feeling me

When I swang swang swang swang swang to the left
And then I swang swang swang swang to the right
Po’d up, ain’t no telling what I’m feeling like
Man, it’s about to be one of those nights

They be like awwww shit, he killing it
Clever with the words rapping for just the hell of it
Intelligence alone, in a world of my own
Keep me caught up in these moments so I'm always in my zone
And I'm gone, exiting the premises
Y'all want more than here's a little bit
See I'm hated by some nemesis who feel they have to scream and shit
Can't rock the mic but I can rock a crowd since
I'm born to be an emcee,
Underground been digital ask my uncle Humpty
Yes they like my style I been here for a while
Some claim to have known, safe to say they knew me now
For the better I chose,
Never staged I just do it and go, y'all be doing the most
Give the gimmicks a break, I got more Power than Ghost
You seeing Starz cause I been that before, you know

Everywhere that I go,
I gotta rock the shit like never before
Never stagnant with the rhymes, just consistent with the flow
The show, I be that, as if you ain't know
Everywhere that I go
Everywhere that I go
Bank a put on a show,
As if you ain't know

Damn, why you bringing up old shit
It's Me, Myself and I up on my De La Soul shit
Take you back to the moment, while I regained focus
80's babies say he killed it like old shit, he at it again
When I ink with this pen
Mentally I jot it down it's faster to pen
Time to stop watch and monitor, me upon the monitors
Fans rise haters take seats and remain anonymous
Please, cause I don't need it
Since I have a choice I wouldn't take it but I'll leave it
Face it, don't want to see it, keep moving is what I do
All them half ass looks stay over there with you, way over there now I'm through
Oh, it's a wonderful feeling
When they say my name we say TeamBank in the building
On one Accord, Honda, pardon the entendre
It's a venue take over I promise

Everywhere that I go,
I gotta rock the shit like never before
Never stagnant with the rhymes,  just consistent with the flow
The show, I be that, as if you ain't know
Everywhere that I go
Everywhere that I go
Bank a put on a show,
As if you ain't know

They said it wasn't possible
I overcame their obstacles
Anything’s possible
You can have anything you gotta put your mind to
They can say what you ain't gone be
Use it as the energy to be all you can be
So I stand here like a champ and put myself in the ring
Knock them out up in the booth and every show in between, because

Everywhere that I go,
I gotta rock the shit like never before

Byron Bank,"Picture this and very soon you’ll understand
Why I’m hot but really cool as a ceiling fan
Wipe me down like Boosie on the other hand
Gotta dumb it down for some of you to comprehend
This retard flow is stupid, see I lose it every time that I do it
Some can’t fathom the fact I’m from Houston, shit what the fuck is they stupid
I’m doing the damn thang, consistently maintain, my vision alone will have you feeling some way
See I can’t complain, it’s just one of them thangs, that I stay doing me and probably misbehave
That’s how I live me life,
Steady going left until it feels right
This the rhythm of my life, so I rap to it
Chasing dreams might as well sleepwalk through it
Too much noise I just turn it down,
Bad hoes turning up in the club, I just turn them down
Ain’t nothing like that turn me down service
But I tend to do the shit on purpose
Recognize a real real nigga when you see one
Cause tattoos and a gold teeth don’t mean that a nigga like me
Can’t come through with a team in the streets
Al B Sure but this nigga ain’t weak
Love songs for your chick, yeah I might do
Groupie love, she in love with the whole crew
New tricks she came back and show you
It is what it is, homie I thought I told you, we slidin’

If the candy paint dripping, then you know what it is, we be slidin’
From the city where the styrofoam cup doubled up and we slidin’ 
Poppin’ tags though Galleria, parking lot pimpin’ we be slidin’
Shit, if the pussy wet enough then a nigga like me about to slide in it

Let it breath just a little bit,
See it’s a science to the shit and I experiment enough to have a DJ in the mix
It ain’t hard for you to see, 
this is meant to be, eventually you’ll have to get with the program
This is track and field, 
the way that I run tracks words can kill and drop credit to producers in the obituary programs
Man I’m just nasty with, buzzing light years beyond and still toying with it
Every story being told, there’s a lie up in it
See the truth is being show, y’all ain’t paying attention
Now days even lames, get an honorable mention
What the fuck that’s just bad for business
Every quarter there’s a check and a penny missing
See you almost had it, you just gotta get it
Like that state farm commercial guy hanging that fishing rod
Bad bitches and these mitches get menopause
Some snitch other ones get lock jaw
Jaw bone was her name I thought I told y’all
Love songs for your chick, yeah I might do

Drunken hot girls whine up in my room, ready to fuck

See I goes hard no credit karma all black cards
Started from the bottom when food stamps turned lone star
Everyday see I’m trying to eat, miss a meal nope never me
At the table top like I can’t see from a high seat in the nosebleeds
Knocking straight out the park, it’s home run

I’m an advocate to my own success, fantastic marvelous

Questioning my life like, Can I Live?
Is this what it is to be and lose yourself
And at the same time cursed of what you dream of yourself
You in the mirror and can't get a glimpse of yourself
Cause all you know is this guy that can't picture himself
Wiping tears from his eyes cause he don't know where he going
Got the coldest songs out but don't nobody a know it
You say you'll never run away but now you're packing your bags
The devil's laughing in your face all on your ass
While you mashing the gas and still pursuing your dream
Can't believe the next person cause the lie in between
It's not the end boy, it's just the beginning
Cause every lost a be a gain you're potentially winning 
You give it all, like you know it's your last
And people don't give a damn, unless they hear from your ass, it's sad

Promised everything but never given anything

Over work a nine to five still just under paid
I'm getting paid and pay bills on the same day, broke as shit
On my last two dollars, Johnny Taylor shit
To put this poetry in motion but running out of steam
Bleeding from the heart it got me down on bended knees
They only love you when you're up, cause when you're falling
Fake friends turn enemies regardless
But you don't hear me though, and some of you don't know me
You're just watching cause you're fearing what you don't see

If you the one, here's your chance to take the spotlight
See my life is realistic your eyes can even witness
Everyday's Christmas so you don't need a wish list
You know I'm with it if you with it
To spend a little time just to show you something different
I'm billboard charting with sick flows
Take a vacation on the sun and come back cold, I'm well seasoned
You know I do this for a reason

Cruising around the city absorbing the sights, loving my life,
See my name spelled by stars in the night, dodging the hype.
She’s a ten which kind of makes her alright 
For a late night convo on Twitter or Skype
The Black James Bond, I’m far from feeble,
My demeanor’s so smooth it should illegal.
Follow the Pirelli’s as I pop a bottle, 
Pinky blinging, wrist glinging as I floss with models
Black tux, the wind surfs the waves of my hair
Fancy free without a care causing women to stare
They love it but you hate, they hate it but you love it
A young Warren Buffet without a budget
Feel the plush leather seats of Bentley coupes
A young Black millionaire, yes, I’m living proof.
80 proof guaranteed to get her body loose
Beat her booty up, she labels it abuse, I seduce then chunk the deuce

Most of them be fabricating, I be never lying
Gotta keep it grown, you know I'm tailored to this suit
Live my life like a Don, this is living proof
So follow my lead, the empire that I stay building 
While we toast with the finest that stay chilling
And they be raising they glass while we be raising the bar
And if you're rolling with me, then you can feel like a star
And I'm the flyest, you can be my co-pilot

And I’ll never forget you
I love you, 
And I’ll never forget you

They say you never forget your first love, moments you can't shake up
Internal scars that you just can't wake up
The break-up is real and still you wait up
Hoping things will let up, the truth you gotta let go and face up
Got a wall built because you don't want to love again
Relationships are hard, scared to let others in
Bittersweet, see what is happening
It's easy to move on, but it's hard remembering
(Ha) Cause I remember the days
I gave my heart to another but her love what just vague
Put it all upon the table and all she did was just ate
Say her friend was just friend but now they married this day 
Crazy to say, but I gotta let it burn
Confessions of a love that's lost with no return
To whom this really may concern
It's one life to live, I guess you live and you learn

I love you, (see I love you and I’ll never forget you)
And I’ll never forget you (know that, it’s real talk, yea)
I love you, 
And I’ll never forget you
I love you, 
And I’ll never forget you
 
When did my life become a love song and where do I start 
Talking about the one that picked me apart
Had me crumbling and wondering she seemed so far
Played her role, I didn't feel like a star 
Still I fell for her, knowing I knew better, forget her 
Ignoring the do betters, my fellas be yelling at me 
Saying that that ain't me, home is where I'm happy
If I don't see it now, I'll be damned but hope she catch me 
Stuck in my ways chasing a fair tales
Life in a carousel, knew the shit very well
Trip to New York, I'm regretting I did that
Right up in my face, I see her flirting believe that
How real can it get man the eyes don't lie
Just a sucker like them cartoons guys, I'm letting it burn
To whom this really may concern
It's one life to live, I guess you live and you learn, word!

I love you, (I got respect for you, you know)
And I’ll never forget you (we gotta move on, but I’ll never forget you though, yea)

And I’ll never forget you

To let you know that this shit don't stop
The beginning of an end I was spitting it then
Getting well with the pen, now I'm sicker again
Y'all been waiting for this album to drop
And off the top like a pringle I been waiting to pop
It's my time, our time, synchronize your watch
Going to work with these lines, punching the clock
All my life I been told to get it,
Get it by any means, so I mean to get it
Nice guy, I can be mean and shitty
And I don't like liars but can show you plenty
See anything goes, in the game of life
With no rules, rolling the dice
Second guessing, thinking it twice
Conscience say it's wrong, but it feel so right
So please take me away from all this madness
Minus the frowns, too much sadness
The fortune and fame, y'all can have it
My blood, sweat, and my tears, ya'll can't have it, damn it 
It's a gift and a cursed, die a little bit in every verse
Give you the works, with no perks 
Artistically speaking
Painting pictures with my thoughts, so my mind I'm speaking
Can you feel that it's real
I tell my girl don't wait up, you know how it is
These long summer nights and for the moments I live
Passion has a price, can I veto that bill
Will we live together forever
Bittersweet memories we making together
Weather whatever, you there on my arms
Be the fire I seek, when I ring the alarm
Best friends become your enemies, down this road to success
You know how the shit gets
Along the way comes respect and that negative shit
Old flings come out say they're pregnant and then
Three days later miscarried the kid, revenge is bittersweet that is
Dwelling in the past, mind stuck in a jail
In a world so cold, caught up in hell

Please take me away from all this madness
Minus the frowns, too much sadness

But a winner still springs, putting fear in them all

Then they love you then they hate you again
Smiling up in your face and like a friend pretend
Talk behind your back all over again

I never trust a big butt and a smile
Cause she's something like a pimp, you know what I'm talking about
That's that wake up cup that Starbucks don't sell
Skills pay the bills but sex still sells
Dwelling in the past, mind stuck in a jail
In a world so cold, caught up in hell

Please take me away from all this madness
Minus the frowns, too much sadness

Like the mountains in spring-time,
Like a walk in the rain, like a storm in the desert,
Like a sleepy blue ocean.
You fill up my senses, come fill me again.
Come let me love you, let me give my life to you,
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean.
Come let me love you, come love me again.",Annie's Song,1995

Byron Lee,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me 
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me 
And I knew for sure 
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love 
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother 
Would disagree
To get my way I would run 
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
yeah yeah
Then finally make me do 
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he 
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step 
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Cause I'd love love love to 
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much to much
But could you send her 
The only man she loved

And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Down the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
'Akey' rice, salt fish are nice
And the rum is fine any time of year

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around

Byron Lee,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2007

(Don't do it, don't do it)
To all the girls I loved before
To all the girls I cheated on before
To all the girls I loved before

To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson
You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson
Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions
To fall into seduction while playing a temptation
I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last
The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas
Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside
Stress brings me pain, I gotta hold my pride
When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide
Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives
You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her
I found myself in a blur
Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

Second verse is gonna hurt, based on a true life story
I got married at 24 in New Jersey
You know the feelings start nature take it's course
Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce
When I had the cold feet, I shouldn't've walked the altar
With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future
Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right
Creepin' with my secret lover in the middle of the night
Back home, break of dawn, dinner's at the table
Thin Line Between Love And Hate is on cable
I'm lookin' at myself thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh

Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you take her friend
Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you snatch her friend

Break it down right here

One love, you're lucky to have one love
It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug
One heart, one mind, one soul
She ain't a gold digger, she don't care about your bank-roll
Keep your money, she make her own cheddar
All she want from me is respect like Aretha
Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter
Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone 'til November
Have you seen her?
I think I did
But what I did wrong was take a love for granted
Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust
Easier said than done, I lust and I must
Passion is a must, but then we start to cuss
We was just makin' love, now we tearing up each other's guts
Like species, she called me an animal
So feel the tongue of the warm-blooded mammal

I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh

Byron Lee & the Dragonaires,"I'm walking on the dark ice of the North
The end of my journey is near
Every step is a wound
While dust is my death bed

The white sun
Is touching me
Freezing my blood
My pale face
The world goes away
I'm walking on the red snow of the East
I can see monstrous shapes under the ice
Wriggling in paroxysm of pain
In agony, madness and rage
Memory is already - dead
Future dead - as well
Faith without - good deeds
The old world - is gone
Our life is bound to die
Death's chill
Will get me
Will freeze my blood
Will suck my face
Will throw me down
I'm walking in the dead woods of the South
No one has won
The holy earth is dying
Asleep under the whip of ice
Helpless and naked
Our memory is bound to die",Memory,1991

The human heart a captive in the snow

I'll never know how good it feels to hold you

Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time

Do you ever dream of me
Do you ever see the letters that I write
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night

And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Even though you hurt me so girl

Byron Miller,"Got that thang that you need
Uncut and spreadin' the seed
And when you're feelin' down
Look, we'll be around

Splish, splash we water your mind
Never serve ya till it's time
We will supply the heat
Good things from head to feet

We will be your rock
And when you're really in need
Turn it to the right and feel the flow
And if you want some more
Just look down, we're kinda low

We will be your rock
Just when you need to be found
We'll be right back on the block
Right back on the block, right back

You know we'll be around
Say you been lost in a barren land
With no water or funk on hand
Hot sweat runs down your chin
Look what a mess you're in

Put your hands upon the rock
(Let the vibes flow through)
Then check the time on your clock
(As if it really knew)
Turn on your radio, big daddy's flowin' so
Pump up the volume it's kinda low

",Kinda Low,1997
Byron Motley,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",At Last,1996
Byron Motley,"I got the call today, I didn't want to hear
But I knew that it would come
An old, true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are those voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand,
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
People filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
Ah, the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
They're the very things we kill, I guess
Oh, pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us, you know it doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live with out you now
But I miss you, baby
And the more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I'd figured out
I have to learn again
I've been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

There are people in your life
Who've come and gone
They let you down
You know they've hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you baby
'Cause life goes on
You keep carryin' that anger
It'll eat you  up inside baby

I've been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So, I'm thinkin' about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if , even if you don't love me

Forgiveness, forgiveness, baby
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Forgiveness, forgiveness

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2004

If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you
 
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do",If I Had You,1999
Byron Stripling,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2000

It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.

Byron Stripling,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

Byron Utley,"Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty five thousand moments so dear
Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?

In daylights, in sunsets
In midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife
In five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure a year in the life?

How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love

How do you measure the life of a woman or a man?

In truths that she learned
Or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned
Or the way that she died

It's time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends

Remember the love
(Oh, you got to, you got to remember the love)
Remember the love

Remember the love
