Ray Crisp,"I've got the letter darling read it o'er and o'er again
You say that you are really sorry now
After all this time I suffered you asked me to come back
Marriage vows that were forgotten you are just recalling now

Marriage vows forgotten is a debt you'll have to pay
For I realized I can never want you now
I've thought at first I couldn't live without you being around
But you're the one I'm not to blame for broken marriage vow

I've forgiven you my darling praise that God would do the same
Was before him that we made our every vow
I must say I'll always love you you're my choice of all the rest
And I'm glad the vows you've broken you at last remembered now

Marriage vows forgotten is a debt you'll have to pay
For I realized I can never want you now
I've thought at first I couldn't live without you being around
But you're the one I'm not to blame for broken marriage vow

",Broken Marriage Vows,1995
Ray Crisp,"You and me together life's a pleasure
But without your love I'd want to flee
And I feel the same about you darling
We belong together you and me
We'll share loves' joy and life's sorrow
You belong to me I belong to you
When you hold my hand 
The sun shines brighter
When you smile at me, I lose my blues
Don't ever let nothing come between us
Think how lonely life apart would be
Gossiping tongues can never change me darling
Your love means more than life to me",You and Me,2015
Ray Dalton,"Ey ey, ey
Good to see you, c'mon let's go
Yeah, let's go
Alright, alright, okay, ah, alright, okay
Alright, okay

Return of the Mack', get up, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn’t
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit
We get up, fresh out, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, sweater game
Nope, nope, y'all can't copy that
Bad, moonwalkin', this here, is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way, grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything, I record to it
And yet I'm on, let that stage light go and shine on down
Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money
Stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustling
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the fourtrack, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I've got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm meeting at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on shark week, raw
Tell me go up, gone
Gone! Deuces, goodbye, I've got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar make you a believer, nah
I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes, so I'm giving it back to the people now
Sing that song and it goes like

Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

So we put our hands up
So we put our hands up

(Let's go) Na, na, nana, na, na, nana, na
Aha, hey
And all my people say
Na, na, nana, na, na, nana, na (that's right, feels good)
And all my people say

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over

Ray Davies,"Now all the lies are beginning to show
And you're not the country that I used to know
I loved you once from my head to my toe
But now my belief is shaken

And all your ways are so untrue
No one breaks promises the way that you do
You guided me, I trusted you
But now my illusion's shaken

Thought this empire would be here
At least a thousand years
But all the expectations and aspirations
Slowly disappear

Now all the lies have gone on too long
And a million apologies can't right the wrong
Soldiers die but the lies go on
But soon we will awaken

In our expectations for the future
We were not to know
We had expectations, now we've reached
As far as we can go

And all your manners are too, too polite
Just to prove that you're conscious is white and bright
You had your day so get ready for the night
For another dawn is breaking

We had expectations, now we've reached
As far as we can go",Expectations,1985
Ray Davies,"She left a message after the tone
I hear it over and over on the answer phone
No one can find her, address unknown
She just decided to go out and make it alone

Solo, solo
My little child is going solo
Solo, solo
My little child is going solo

I feel like crying, I'm in a rage
I can't understand why she just ran away
What made it happen, guess we'll never know.
She just decided to go out and make it solo
Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo

We work like dogs all of our lives
Like millions of other husbands and wives
Sent her through college, didn't care what we spent
Think of how we feel
She didn't say, she didn't ask, she just went

Solo, solo
My little child, you're going solo
It's like a pattern, it's like a crime
We see it happen time after time
You raise your children, you watch them grow
Then one day it's good-bye, they've decided they're going solo
Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo

The toys are forgotten, now it appears
You've let them down after all of these years
Sacrificed all, now there's nothing to show
Ungrateful youth, decided you're going solo

Solo, solo
My little child, you're going solo
Solo, solo
Ungrateful youth, you're going solo

The obligations, all of the ties
Have got to be broken so you can survive
Just because they gave you life, they can't stop if you grow
Now they can't hold you back 'cause you're going solo",Going Solo,1985
Ray Davies,"Ooh, Darling, what can I do
I feel so afraid, and even my friends don't know what to say
That's why I'm asking you

I'm so afraid
I know I should be strong
But when affection is gone, it's hard to face each day
Knowing love has drifted away

Somehow I can't hide the pain
Is he going to come back again

Dear Lonely Heart
I wish things could be the way that they were at the start
But you must face the fact
If he's going to leave there's no way that you'll win him back

You got to try to hold back the tears
Don't give into your fears

Darling, I'm so afraid
I can get through the night
But when affection is gone, it's hard to face each day
Oh will he please come home

Dear Lonely Heart, dear Lonely Heart
Dear Lonely Heart
I wish things could be the way that they were at the start
But you must face the fact
If he's going to leave there's no way that you'll win him back
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Dear Lonely Heart, dear Lonely Heart
Dear Lonely Heart

Darling, I'm so afraid
I can get through the night
But I can't face the day knowing you are far away
Oh will you please come home",Lonely Hearts,1985
Ray Davies,"Have you seen this face
Does it ring a bell
Does it strike a chord somewhere in your mind
And there's a big reward
If you help us solve this crime
And if you recognize this face, dial 999

Have you seen this face
Dig deep in your mind
Has anybody seen that little girl of mine
She was always a rover
But I'm afraid to say she's strayed
Too far this time

Now I'm sitting at home, staring at the wall
Waiting for the missing person to call
Waiting for the message I'm dreading to hear
Waiting to confirm my darkest fears
She's a missing person, I wish I could see
All of the places she might be
Maybe I stopped her from being free
Maybe there was something missing in me

Wherever she is, I hope she's doing fine
But I wish that she would phone or drop us a line
Till then I've got nothing to ease my mind
And I'm thinking about her all the time",Missing Persons,1985
Ray Davies,"This is the end, this is the last time,
Take what you want, why wait a lifetime?
Why wait till tomorrow when you can just take it today,
And it's not far away.
Live all your life according to a plan.
Live by the rules the best way you can.
So the system that fed you and bred you can throw you away,
And it's not far away,
Not far away.
Oh, oh.
The system that fed you and bred you can throw you away,
And it's not far away,
Not far away,
Not far away,
Not far away,
Oh, oh.
The system that breeds[?] you and feeds you will through you away.
And it's not far away,
Not far away.
Oh, oh.
Total chaos, total destruction.
(Not far away, not far away.)
Social collapse, moral corruption.
(Not far away, not far away.)
I feel it in my bones, it gets closer each day.
The future is here, and it won't go away.
They're gonna segregate the people,
They're gonna put you in your place.
And no one's gonna listen when you try to plead your case.
And those who think they are immune will get slapped in the face.
Chaos will rule,
No one will be safe,
The ending is near,
And it's not far away.
The future is here and it's ours to dictate,
The ending is closer so why hesitate,
Oh, oh.
The ending is near, and it's not far away.",Not Far Away,1985
Ray Davies,"Look at all the people around me
Same old faces joining the queue
For return to Waterloo
Return to Waterloo

Started off this morning as usual
Checking out the mail and all the bills to pay
Maybe something special's going to happen
Maybe this is my lucky day

The forecast says heavy weather
So take your umbrella just in case
Will I get away, will I see it through
On the return to Waterloo

Return to Waterloo
Return to Waterloo

Somehow you feel that the world's been passing you by
Can't help thinking somehow they're living a lie
Now I'm asking questions, I never thought I'd ask them before
Like ""why"" or ""how"" or ""what am I doing it for?""

Will I reach my destination
Or will I get off along the way
Will I reach my destination

Will I reach my destination
Have I stopped or am I only going slow
Have we got a couple more stations
Or is this as far as we all go

The headlines cry out from the papers
""Inflation,"" ""murder,"" ""wars,"" who really wants to know

It'll cost me more in 1992

Ray Davies,"I always knew that they'd get me somehow sooner or later
But with a bullet in the head, a knife in the back
Not a pocket calculator
Sorry mister, you're all wiped up
You're all washed up
Sold you out

Got no dreams, got no ambition
Can't decide, cause there's no decision
Got no claim to any position
Can't compete with the competition
You're always complaining
It's so depressing
But if you're old enough
Start to confess it
You say, you sold me out
To get a better deal for yourself
You sold me out
And now we want some of your precious wealth
Because you sold me out
Sold me out
Sold me out
Sold me out

You sold me out
To get a better deal for yourself
You sold me out

Try to draw it out, the joke's on you
Put up the empty sign

You sold me out

Ray Davies,"It was clear to everybody in the family that as a cripple I was a complete
Failure. I did no better at college, actually. I went to the Hornsey College
Of Art. Hornsey, with the emphasis on horn.
But being at Art College in the mid till late sixties was quite an experience.
Everything was changing in Britain: fashion, style, art, theater.
But the thing I enjoyed most about Art College were the chicks.
Exactly. Don't think of me as crumpet man, do you? Do you?
But there was one chick in particular. She was in the sculpture
Department. She was a complete goddess. She was like one of these
Continental film stars. Her body was shaped like a Gretch country
Gentleman guitar. But like a Gretch country gentleman, she was too
Expensive for me.
But every night I persevered. I carried her easel up the stairs to her bedsit.
All these stairs to this attic apartment. But once I was inside her bedsit
I'd sit down and talk to her about politics, art, literature, ...revolution!
The usual crap, do you know what I mean? And this girl would lean
Against the refrigerator, sip her cocoa and stare at me as if to say
""You can talk all the bullshit you want. You ain't gonna get anywhere
With me"". And she was right, so I like to dedicate this next piece
To that wonderful prick-teaser of my youth.",Art School (Dialogue),1998
Ray Davies,"My art school babe with your palette-knives and brushes
Painted face, Egyptian eye-brows and bright red lips
Pale white make-up, tight black skirts like Juliette Greco
And there's me quoting pretentious chat up lines
From Marcel Proust, Jean Cocteau and Jean-Paul Sartre
Sitting by a gasfire in a drafty bedsit
The art school babe quotes William Blake and she rolls a joint
And I think ""Oh oh, I've scored"", start to make myself at home
But the room starts moving as she starts to get me stoned
I close my eyes and give in, the room goes in a spin
My lips are dry, I wander around with a ridiculous grin
I grovel on the floor, I think ""Yeah I think I can make her""
Then I wake up and realize I've been kissing the refrigerator
Art school chaps with creative grand illusions
My sketch pad at the ready, my eager charcoal in my hand
Boring the world for hours with political theories
Just to impress anyone who listens while my art school babe
Just puts another inch of make-up on her face
And she says to me:
""Arty farty, you'll never fool your Auntie
Who knew you when you picked your nose and wet your pants""
How did she know that?
Arty farty, I try to throw a party
To impress my peers I struck a creative stance
Art school cat, ah, I was really on a mission
I made my play for my art school babe
By humming jazz tunes with words by Ferlinghetti
I thought I was ever so cool
But I was really such an obvious, pretentious, irritating little fool
For my art school babe",Art School Babe,1998

When the dawn begins to crack.
It's all part of my autumn almanac.
Breeze blows leaves of a musty-coloured yellow,
So I sweep them in my sack.

Hiding from the weather.
Tea and toasted, buttered currant buns

Seem to come from my street

Ray Davies,"Got back to the front room, Dave was plugged in to the green amplifier
Pete was on the bass, they sounded great
Dave had this great way of playing the guitar
The way Dave played was very individual
I'd been overwhelmed by all the culture
Art School prays the life I'd never really understand
I sat down and started to jam,
Was astounded by the speed of Dave's hands
The way Dave played guitar was very similar to the way he spoke
Exactly
I thought to myself ""This is the way it's gonna be.
I'm gonna join this band, leave college behind.
Forget culture, rock 'n' roll is where it's at""
And daytime was dawning
We were up all night, we were all yawning
But we were playing, raving
Sometimes so loud, to the early morning
Our friends keep knocking at the door
The neighbours shouted out ""No more""
They even sent the police around to hear us play
And this is the way we played
We thought ""If we could annoy all of the neighbours with the green amp
Think of what we could do with a four piece band""
But there was no doubt Dave was the star,
A connoisseur of the old twelve bar
And even dad said ""That boy is bloody marvelous""
As I said Pete was on the bass,
So the only way I could SLY my way into the band
Was to become the rhythm guitar player
While we were bouncing up and down
The house was shaking to the sound
Of the full distortion from the gramophone
We had stayed up playing all night long
Ran out of other people's songs
So we started making music of our own
And dawn was breaking, my mind was calculating
This time there's no more waiting

Ray Davies,"In the book X-Ray the decrepit old rock 'n' roll singer talks about this
Mystery girl he used to know when he was on the road. It's a girl he calls
Julie Finkle. Julie Finkle was really a mixture of lots of different people.

Churchbells ring out through the land
You were born in London, England
[London, London, through the dark alley-ways and passages of London]
And there's a tap by a reservoir, leading to a stream,
That turns into a river estuary that eventually opens to the sea
[London, London]
And there's a docker by a wharf, sending cargo overseas,
Unloading foreign trade from a large ocean vessel
In the mighty metropolitan port of London
[London, London, through the dark alley-ways and passages of London]
When I think of all the Londoners still unsung
East-enders, West-enders, Oriental-enders

Ray Davies,"My name is of no importance. You see, I'm a product of a century
Which started at the height of class-conscious imperialism and ended
With a society so reduced to totalitarian commonness that in my final
Years at college the saying 'mediocrity rises' became very popular.
And being mediocre, I rose. But you're not supposed to laugh at that.
My generation has been taught to be so in touch with the latest fashion
That we have become faceless; we're victims of design.

Ray Davies,"I sat down and started to write a song on the old upright piano.
I played these crude chords with my left hand and thumbed out a kind of
A blues riff. I thought of a melody to go with the phrase
""Girl, you really got me going
You got me so I don't know what I'm doing""
Then I called Dave in from the kitchen where he was having dinner
With the rest of the family. And he picked up his guitar and plugged it in
To the green amp. He started playing along with the riff I was playing
On the piano and as the amp warmed up I heard that wonderful
Distorted sound. I taught Dave the song and some of our sisters came in
To listen to it. Mum hovered around by the door, half afraid that the
Neighbors would call the police again.
When we got through the song for the first time our small audience
Applauded. I'd written ""You really got me"" and it happened in the
Frontroom. Because all the important things happened there.",Writing the Song (Dialogue),1998

And the spirit can do truly wondrous things

For a consultation about my physical health

Ray Davies,"It was back to the drawing board, and I think it was out of frustration
We wanted to sound as distorted as Chuck Berry's guitar on Memphis
Tennessee. We played the record so many times on that old radiogram
And so loud, that some of the speakers were crackling in the radiogram,

Completely distorted. And the valves were rattling in the machine.
So, in fact, you know, God save the Queen sounded like Chuck Berry.
Everything sounded really distorted. And Dave and I thought
""How can we make the green amp sound that distorted?"".

So Dave took one of mums knitting-needles and he stuck it into the
Speakers of the little green amp. The Dave played a chord. Pfft.
It sounded great, yes! Brilliant. That's the sound.
Dave rechristened the green amp ""the fart box"".

Now as I said the front room was a place where we had celebrations
Usually, singsongs.
When we very young, when I was 13 years old, our oldest sister came
Back from Canada where she had emigrated after the war and she died

In tragic circumstances. So at the age of 30 she was burried and we had
A new experience in the front room: a wake.
But Dave and I were surprised that these adults, still drinking and singing
Songs. We thought that was odd as they were all dressed in black,

That it was a sad time.
It's hard to describe the front room. It had a really magical quality to it,
Really spiritual in a way. I went to a church school, but the closest I felt to
Religion was not when I was singing in the school choir or when I was at

Sunday school which I always went to. But it was more when I rehearsed
With Dave in the front room.",The Front Room,1998
Ray Davies,"And as I walked round those tidy streets I thought to myself
""How can anybody be at all unhappy in such a perfect world?""
How wrong I was!
There's a little hunchback man, he used to walk round the streets
Of North London. His head was bowed, forced to look at the ground by
This cruel, debilitating hump on his back. And all of my school friends
Had a name for this hunchback. They called him the freak.
And every time the freak walked down the street my friends would laugh
And I laughed with them.
Now my dad was a sports fan. But in order to achieve all the ambitions
My father had for me, I trained really hard and eventually I became the

Captain of the school team, until one cold winters afternoon I sustained
An injury. Actually it was kick up the arse, but ... hey.
I was sent to a specialist and he took x-rays of my back, examined me
And he said ""Well you're gonna have to give up all sport for all time,
Otherwise you're going to end up a hunchback like that man I see you
Laughing at"".
Maybe that was meant to scare me, I don't know, but all of a sudden I
Started to look at that freak in a new light, because in him I saw my future.
I would become a freak.
But we all know that ugliness, like beauty, is only skin deep.",Hunchback,1998
Ray Davies,"The phone rang, it was a call from Larry. ""Hello, cock. Cock, it's time for
The third single"". If this is a flop, if the third single doesn't make it, our
Career would be over. I'd written another song that we played on stage
Quite a lot. It was called You really got me. And the audiences loved it,

No, the audiences loved it. They liked it because they could dance to it.
But the record company hated it. They said ""You can't record that piece
Of rubish. And we don't like the sound of that terrible distorted green
Amplifier. No, no. You can't record it, that's final"". But Robert and

Grenville thought it was marvelous. ""Don't you think so, Grenville?"".
""Oh, every time they play 'You really got me' I get shivers up my spine"".
""I think it's a hit, cock, I gotta tell ya, I'll state my reputation on it"".
Now, with management like that, how could we fail?

But the record company said ""Look, we don't believe in it. We're very
Sorry, we don't believe in it. If you want to make the record, fine, but you
Have to pay for the recording yourselves"". And that was really cruel,
Because they knew we were broke. But Robert knew a man.

""Here, Ray, here's 200 quid. Go in the bloody studio and make that
Record. And make sure it's a bloody hit, what?"".
You see, Mick Avory hadn't signed the recording contract, and they said
He couldn't play on the record. We'd have to get a session drummer in,

He's a guy that'd come in and play for hire. And they said this thinking
That we'd be loyal to Mick and cancel the session. But we weren't
Gonna do that. But at the last minute we snug Mick into the studio.
He can only play tambourine, but at least he was on the record.

I'd written 'You really got me' as tribute to all those great blues people
I love: Leadbelly and Big Bill Broonzy. And Dave was playing the song
In the studio that day, but he was playing it in the style I'd written it.
But then Dave plugged the guitar into the green amp, and he plugged

The green amp into a Vox AC30, and it sounded hugh.
And when Dave played the opening chords to 'You really got me'
They were so loud that the session drummer forgot the complicated
Little patern he was gonna play at the beginning and just hit one beat

On the snare drum as loud as he could, pow, as if to say to Dave
""You noisy little bleeder. I can play just as loud as you can. And I've got
A big stick"". But that's exactly what we wanted, you see, we wanted to
Sound loud. Now we sounded like a group.

Halfway through the song it was time for Dave's guitar solo.
This moment had to be right. So I shouted across the studio to Dave,
Give him encouragement. But I seemed to spoil his concentration.
He looked at me with a dazed expression. ""Fuck off"".

If you doubt me, if you doubt what I'm saying, I challenge you to listen
To the original Kinks recording of 'You really got me'.
Halfway through the song, after the second chorus, before the guitar
Solo, there's a drum break. Boo ka, boo boo ka, boo ka, boo boo.

And in the background you can hear ""fuckoff"". You can, you can.
When I did the vocal I tried to cover it up by going ""Oh no"", but in the
Background you still hear it ""fuckoff"". And it's even clearer on CD,
It's really embarrassing.

Well then Dave looked like you'd done something wrong, his mouth
Relaxed and his jaw dropped. But it was halfway through the most
Important track we'd ever do. And if it wasn't a hit, it would be the last
Track we'd ever do. And the lead guitarist stops playing before the solo.

But then Dave's eyes squinted and his face broke into that arrogant
Sideways grin I've learnt to love and hate over the years. You see,
He hadn't heard me shout at all. He just thought of looking at me
At the same time as I looked at him, a kind of telepathic way of saying

""This is it, remember, the front room"". Then he gritted his teeth and
Sneered at me one more time and cocked an attitude before turning
Away into the corner of the studio to play himself into rock 'n' roll history.",The Third Single,1998

Is there life after breakfast
Full of possibilities
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast
So don't live in agony
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast

Cheer up son, put on the kettle
There's no point in being glum
Make your mind up, try to forget her
Boil the tea and I'll be mum

Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast
So don't live in agony
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast

After breakfast
Life after breakfast
After breakfast

Just because all of the plumbing
Isn't all it used to be
Turn the tap, see, a little bit's coming
That must make you feel relieved

Don't turn into a total embarrassment
To your friends and family
Get out of bed, the whole day's ahead
So take the pills and drink your tea

Is there life after breakfast
Full of possibilities
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast
So don't be so depressive
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast

Is there life after breakfast
Full of possibilities
Is there life after breakfast?

I feel I've known you all my life
I haven't seen you for a while now
How's the family? How's that beautiful wife?

I hope your dreams were not forgotten
And you've become downtrodden

Get your health together
Get your wealth together
Get yourself together
Jones, you were my next door neighbour

Mr. Brown, you're so ambitious
You ran off with an Essex blond
You've broke the bank to keep two women
You're over extended, now, it's all gone wrong

Now, you're right back where you started
Still, you shouldn't be broken hearted

Get your mind together
We can still climb together
A step at a time together
Brown, your world was turned upside down

I know it's not the same
And everything changes
But behind front doors people think that they can hide

We win and lose, we laugh and cry
Live and learn, at least we try
Oh, give it a try

Ba, ba, ba, together
Ba, ba, ba, together
And we can go miles together
All of my next door neighbours

Get your style together
Put a smile together
And we'll go miles together
All of my next door neighbours

Mr. Smith, another story
I wonder what became of him?
They say he threw the telly through the window
He went berserk and jacked the whole world in

They say he may have hit rock bottom
Still, he went out with a bang and so he is not forgotten

We had our tiffs together
Our rows and our rifts together
But let's learn to forgive together

Now the tabloids have the news
Cross my heart, it just ain't true
I never thought it of you

Name, names and every line
Is feeding their suspicious minds
I'm not bitter or angry, I'm only feeling sympathy
You really found the time

To feed the reporter with your views
See the reporter, break the news
Read the reporter, join the queue

Spread the news, scandalize
Words cut like a thousand knives
Take the cash, bag the prize
For playing games with other people's lives

Excuse me, I just vomited
Tell your story, it's your call
So autobiographical but oh, so trivial

To help improve the circulation
They'll pepper it with lies
It's only other people's lives

Feed the reporter

Politicians dressed in drag
Careers stopped with a quick back stab
While anonymous informer flees
And leaves us with our fantasy and erotic visions

Who did what, when, to whom
In the dominatrix room?
Tabloids daily titillate
Each sordid tale reverberates
All across the nation

(What can I say?)
Feed the reporter
(It's a vendetta)
Read the reporter
([Incomprehensible])

A rumor then a vicious phrase
A poison pen can wreck your day
And weather words that crucify
As tabloid judges sharpen up their knives

Read the reporter, black and white
See the reporter victimize
See a poor sucker crucified

Betray your friends and get the prize

Ray Davies,"When the heat stops you sleeping at night
And the dead leaves rustle around
And the calmness keeps you awake
And you pace around the room

That's the zombie in you manifesting itself
And you cry out loud and nobody can help
And it's a one way sign to the gates of hell
And there's no way back
No, there's no way back
Ain't no wonder you can't sleep at night

You just heard the voodoo call
So you pace around, do the zombie crawl
And you shuffle around in the prison cell
Doing the voodoo walk, dancing with yourself
And you just can't blame
The zombie inside of you

Or the voodoo curse hanging over you
Or the zombie walk, like an old soft shoe
Where the voodoo man's talking inside of you
Doing the voodoo walk, voodoo walk
Ain't no evil spirits round here
Or zombie people or demons with pointy ears
Ain't no spooks waiting to appear

Doing the voodoo walk
Talking the voodoo talk
Or the voodoo howl
Doing the voodoo walk, voodoo walk

Voodoo walk, voodoo walk
Doing the voodoo walk, voodoo walk

And the days are like living in hell
You're not well but you just did it to yourself
You know the look
You can tell by that haunted stare
You're never quite here
You're never quite really there
And the cemetery's empty
'Cos the zombies are everywhere

Or the voodoo howl

Or the voodoo growl

Go get a life, get a life
Now that I'm here I can't understand
Why anyone is asking me, if I could give a damn
I could say there will be laughter, you will never cry

I was wrong, I will cry, I will love you to the day I die.

Touch the sky, hopefully

It's cooler than the street
I been watching the setting sun
As it bounces off the avenue
Turning into gold dust at my feet
Carlos and Yolanda
Dancing in the hallway
To an old melody
Spanish eyes and soft brown curls
My love, my love
Come to me

I believe I'm in the power of st. Lazarus
And he holds me in his sight
I know that these jitterbug days I'm living

Tonight, tonight

Song-birds sing, winter turns to spring

I know such enchantment can be 
'Cause it happened one evening to me

That certain night the night we met 
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz

That when you turned and smiled at me

And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square
How strange it was, how sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
With that hazy, crazy, night we met

Is there a meadow in the mist 
Where someone's waiting to be kissed? 

Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring 
Where my heart can go a-journeying 
Over the shadows and the rain to a blossom-covered lane? 

And in your lonely flight haven't you heard the music of the night? 
Wonderful music, faint as a will-'o-the-wisp, crazy as a loon, 
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh

Skylark, I don't know if you can find these things, 
But my heart is riding on your wings 
So if you see them anywhere 
Won't you lead me there",Skylark,

Upon my window pane tonight

And now you've gone to find another

I'll get along without you now, that's plain to see.
I don't care what happens next, for I'll get by somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.

It was just a year ago when I first met you;
I learned to love you, and I thought you'd love me too.
But that's all in the past, and I'll forget somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.

Now that we have really parted, I can't believe we're through.
I don't blame myself; I'm sure I can't blame you.
There was something had to happen, and it happened somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.

After all is said and done, I'll soon forget you,
Although I know that it will be so hard to do.
Let things happen as they will, and I'll get by somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.



",It Makes No Difference Now,1991
Ray Edenton,"It was midnight on the stormy deep
My solitary watch I'd keep
And think of her I'd left behind
And ask if she'd be true and kind

I never shall forget the day
That I was forced to go away
In silence there my head she'd rest
And pressed me to her loving breast

Oh Willy don't go back to sea
There's other girls as good as me
But none can love you true as I
Pray don't go where the bullets fly

The deep deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other's bride
But still my thoughts will sometime times stray
To thee when thou art far away

I never have proved false to thee
The heart I gave was true as time
But you have proven untrue to me
I can no longer call thee mine

Then fare-thee-well I'd rather make
My home upon some icy lake
Where the southern sun refused to shine
Then to trust a love so false as thine",Midnight on the Stormy Deep,1991

Memories that make my heart grow cold

You'll be back within my arms to stay

The castles we built of dreams together
Are the sweetest stories ever told
But in my dreams they live again, sweetheart

Ray Edenton,"I tried so hard, my dear, to show 
That you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do 
Is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past 
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

Another love before my time 
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now 
For things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said 
That make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts 
To see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love
Yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

There was a time when I believed 
That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart 
Is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you
The more we drift apart

And melt your cold, cold heart","Cold, Cold Heart",1998

You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.

They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away

Just make your mind up
The piper must be paid

The candles flicker and dim
You danced and dreamed through the night
It seemed to be right

Just being with him
Now you must wake up
All dreams must end
Take off your makeup

I must make some changes from old to new
I must do things just the same as others do
I'm goin' to change my long, tall daddy for a little short fat

I must have some lovin' or I'll fade away

Ray Ellis Orchestra,"In '43 they put to sea, thirteen men and Kennedy
Aboard the P.T. 109, to fight the brazen enemy
And off the isle of ol' Lusana, in the strait beyond Nehru
A Jap deatroyer in the night cut the '109 in two

Smoke and fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
Yeah, the thought they had the best of a mighty good man

And on the coast of Kolombangaro, looking through his telescope
Australian Evans saw the battle for the crew had little hope
Two were dead, some were wounded, all were clinging to the bow
Fighting fire and a-fighting water trying to save their lives somehow

Smoke and fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
Yeah, they thought they had the best of a mighty good man

McMahon the Irishman was burned so badly, he couldn't swim
Leave me, here go on, he said 'cause if you don't we'll all be dead
The PT skipper couldn't leave him, a man to die alone at sea
And with a strap between his teeth, he towed the Irishman through the sea

Smoke and fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
Yeah, they thought they had the best of a mighty good man

He led his men through waters dark, rocky reefs and hungry sharks
Braved the ennemy's bayonets, a .38 hung 'round his neck
Four more days and four more nights a rescue boat pulled into sight
The P.T. 109 was gone but Kennedy and his crew lived on

Now who could guess or who could possibly know
That this same man named Kennedy

Would be the leader of the nation, be the one to take command?
The P.T. 109 was gone but Kennedy lived to fight again

Smoke and fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
But JFK and his crew lived on

Which proves it's hard to get the best of a man named John

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course, I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

What a guy
What a fool am I
To think my breaking heart
Could kid the moon
What's in store
Should I fall once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

Except perhaps in Spring

   She really made the Woolworth counter shine              
   Eddie was a sweet romancer, and a darn good dancer
   They'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime
 
Eddie played the steel guitar, and his mama cried cuz he played in the bars
And kept young Rita out late at night
So they married up in Abilene, lost a child in Tennessee
Still that love survived, 'cause they'd sing

   Dance a little closer tonight
   Dance a little closer to me, 'cause it's closing time
   And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
 
One of the boys in Eddie's band took a shine to Rita's hands
So Eddie ran off with the bass man's wife
Oh but he was back by June, singin' a different tune
And sportin' miss Rita back by is side.  And he sang...

Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me, 'cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
 
Eddie traveled with the barroom bands till arthritis took his hands
Now he sells insurance on the side
Rita's got a house to keep, dimestore novels and a love so sweet
They dance to the radio late at night.  And they sing:

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,

And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue

Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

And dream I'm dreamin'

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1998

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus

You've just got to see me through another day

Thought I'd see you one more time again

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you

Some men search for silver some for gold

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

How I'll hate going out in the storm!

All the way home I'll be warm

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

For all you care, this bread could be my body.
The end! This is my blood you drink.
This is my body you eat.

Ray Hatch,"My mind is clearer now.
At last all too well
I can see where we all soon will be.
If you strip away The myth from the man,
You will see where we all soon will be. Jesus!
You've started to believe
The things they say of you.
You really do believe
This talk of God is true.
And all the good you've done
Will soon get swept away.
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say.

Listen Jesus I don't like what I see.
All I ask is that you listen to me.
And remember, I've been your right hand man all along.
You have set them all on fire.
They think they've found the new Messiah.
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.

I remember when this whole thing began.
No talk of God then, we called you a man.
And believe me, my admiration for you hasn't died.
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied.
Nazareth, your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood He'd have made good.
Tables, chairs, and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best.
He'd have caused nobody harm; no one alarm.

Listen, Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied; have you forgotten how put down we are?

I am frightened by the crowd.
For we are getting much too loud.
And they'll crush us if we go too far.
If they go too far

Listen, Jesus, to the warning I give.
Please remember that I want us to live.
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour.
All your followers are blind.
Too much heaven on their minds.
It was beautiful, but now it's sour.
Yes it's all gone sour.

Listen, Jesus, to the warning I give.
Please remember that I want us to live.

Ray Heindorf & His Orchestra,"Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I am so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils

At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret anymore",A Secret Love,1988
Ray Heindorf & His Orchestra,"The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
Suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away

No more his eager call
The writings on the wall
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray

The man that won you
Has run off and undone you
That great beginning
Has seen the final inning
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will
Be the same

Good riddance, goodbye
Every trick of his you're on to
But, fools will be fools
And where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he will turn up
There's just no letup the live-long night and day

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman looking for
The man that got away
The man that got away",The Man That Got Away,1993

The black hills of Dakota
To the beautiful Indian country

The windy city is mighty pretty
But they ain't got what we got, no sirree
They've got shacks up to seven stories
Never see any Morning Glory's
But a step from our doorway
We got 'em for free

They've got those minstrel shows
Pretty ladies in the big chateau's
Private lawns, public parks
For the sake of civic virtue
They've got fountains there that squirt you

I just blew in from the windy city
The windy city is mighty pretty
But they ain't got what we got
I'm tellin' ya, boys
We got more life in Deadwood City
Than in all of Illinois

You should-a seen me a-windo' shoppin'
A-windo' shoppin' with eyes a-poppin' 
At the sights that you see there, yes sirree
Press a bell and a moment later
Up you go in an elevator 
Just as fast as a polecat a-climbin' a tree

I heard claim hundreds came 
To a thing they call a baseball game
Cigar stores, revolving doors
They got new inventions coming
'Stead of outdoor, indoor plumbing

Ray Heindorf & His Orchestra,"A woman's touch, a woman's touch
The magic of Aladdin couldn't do as much
She's a wizard, she's a champ
And she doesn't need a lamp

A woman's touch can weave a spell
The kind of hocus pocus that she does so well
With the magic of a broom
She can mesmerize a room

With a whisk whisk here and a whisk whisk there
And a dustpan for the cinders
With a rub rub here and a rub rub there
She can polish up the winders

Then presto chango 
Suddenly, the sun comes shining through
And what does Mr Sunshine say to you?
How d'you do?

It makes you blink, to stop and think
A woman and a whisk-broom 
Can accomplish so darn much
So never under-estimate a woman's touch

A woman's touch can quickly fill
The empty flower boxes on a window sill
One smile from her and zoom
Little buds begin to bloom  

A touch of paint, a magic nail
Can turn a kitchen chair into a Chippendale
Even make the lamp appear
Like a crystal chandelier

With a tack tack here and a tack tack there
And a hand around a hammer
With a mop mop here and a mop mop there
You can give a cabin glamour

Then gosh, almighty, all at once
The cabin that we knew
Becomes a shining castle built for two
Me and you

The pies and cakes a woman bakes
Can make a fella tell her 
That he loves her very much
So never under-estimate a woman's touch",A Woman's Touch,2013
Ray Heindorf and His Orchestra,"I speak to the stars
In a sky full of wonder
In a world full of magic
It may be they can hear
What my heart is thinkin' of
(We can hear your heart)
(We know what you're thinking of)

I speak to the stars
And I ask them to tell me
Am I making a blunder
Is this just an illusion
Or is it really love
(Is this really love)

Do I make too much
Of the promise in a stranger's eyes
What will happen when the magic dies
Am I riding for a fall

I speak to the stars
And I wait for an answer
Little stars won't you tell me
But they don't seem to hear
As they twinkle up above

So I turn from them
And speak to my heart
And my heart tells me
I'm in love
(You can trust your heart)
(For your heart will never lie)

The thrill is gone!
I can see it in your eyes,
I can hear it in your sighs,
Feel your touch and realize
The thrill is gone.

For love is old.

Birds were singing, skies were blue.

Walk without my arm about you, Baby

I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind

Why do you just elude me

Ray Herndon,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

But a, it's kinda been forever since we been in
The kinda situation not involving other women
And it's pretty obvious that you're kinda trippin', like
""Who the hell is this bitch lookin' a hot mess
What you fell for this chick""
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it
I'm like, ""you need to go somewhere else with this shit
Because I ain't gon' put up wit you
Talkin' bout how she make you uncomfortable
I mean, shit I'm only 17
And um, a perfect couples only in a dream
And right now I'm pretty much away for this relationship
I think we should wait for it
I mean later we can try things out
But not right now

She ain't gon' tie me down
So why you on the road
You wanted all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What you want right now
What up right now,
I think you need to close yo mouth
'Cause you ain't gon' tie me down, tie me down, tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down

Ha, ha, aye girl waddup
No I'm not gon' make a scene
But you cant tie me down like a pair of shoe strings
Yea you cute, so what
But let's get it through your head
Yea we make love, sex weed all in the bed
It's the best and I love her but things don't change
When I'm not faithful you be feelin' ma pain
Now you stuck like a stain and I cant believe that
Baby girl one hundred,I ain't tryna do that
Got too many girls and I ain't letting go
'Cause my life is great and you ain't nothin' but a hoe
Yea you come to my shows and you very supportive
Just showed me a camera and my show recorded
It was nice, I'm surprised that you still standin' here
As you know I'm a man and I have no feelings
I'ma start from the top, girl this ain't no lovin'
I'm a New Boy, girl so

She ain't gon' tie me down
So why you on the road
You wanted all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What you want right now
What up right now,
I think you need to close yo mouth
'Cause you ain't gon' tie me down, tie me down, tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down

She ain't gon' tie me down
So why you on the road
You wanted all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes

And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry

A smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

I can't fake it love, 'cause everytime I open my eyes I picture me and you wakin up,
She alway's teasin me doin that sexy stuff, now it's goin up and down and down and up
Sometimes she wears weaves and got a nice round butt, 
She like to smoke weed and not talk to much, 
She let me be me and not givin a fuck, and maybe one day 
I'll get her finger froze up, will see when we get older (older), 
But now I'm doin it Prince style
With the mink fox on my shoulders, ""Heat"" tucked in my tux pushin a VT ?, 
She's always on my mind that's why I know she's controlin' me, 
She like's kissin and holdin me
And she real cool with my Moms and Brandy, 
My Pops and the rest of the family, that's another reason

We can hit crustaceans and eat soufle, 
And you know I keep my keys when I park valet, I spark that

Ray J,"[Verse 1]
What is it you want from me
I'm tired of playin games baby
Do you think
That I would sit around and play the fool
When its really up to me
Basically do what I please
And you think
That your the one controlling everything

[Bridge]
At first I was so big on you
Then you started to change
You begin to play these games
Never thinkin you would be the one to lose
Now your tellin me what your gonna do
I'm tellin you to tell the truth
But you see I'm through with you
Coz you tried to play me
And that just ain't cool

[Chorus]
If I owed you
What would you do do
You thought that I'd be
So caught up in you
You thought that I
Couldn't do what I had to
But this ain't a game
Now you tell me who's playin who you
Thought that i would be some kind of fool who
But I jus go and do what I had to
But his ain't a game

[Verse 2]
I duno what makes you think
I would be the type of guy
Who would be
So forgiving after dark baby
If you wana play with me
Always messing with my head maybe
You'd be
Spending the best of your life with me

Now that you know that I'm 
Not the one to play
Keep my respect n I'm
Over you
I don't understand why you
Play to lose
I can't believe that you
Would play me
You had me fooled
Thinking I could put my trust in you
But you jus can't show me you
Had the best of me, so baby plz
Stop thinking that you could handle me

Ray J,"Damn baby,
I just don't understand were we went wrong,
I gave you my heart,
I gave you my soul,
I gave you...

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first.
It was about 8 yrs ago, don't act like you don't know.
We're were sitting at home in your mama's living room
'Cause we couldn't be alone Ã¢?? you see

Your mama knew I was something else she knew how I felt.
Back then we were in school, and that's your favorite excuse.
See growing up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you.
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it, here's my wish list.

First one, I would create a heart changing love,
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up,
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'd be okay if I get one.
If I had one wish, we would be best friends, love would never end, it would just begin.
If I had one wish, you would be my boo, promise to love you, trust me I trust you.
If I had one wish, we would run away, making love all day, have us a baby.
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life and you'd be my wife, make it right this time.

If I had one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish.

Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in?
If so then search and I'll go. Then I can have you for sho, then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing, me Ã¢?? so girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe. I swear if I lose a second chance with you, I wouldn't know what to do. I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic. I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick.
Here's my wish list:

First one, I would create a heart changing love,
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all the way up,
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'd be okay if I get one.
If I had one wish we would be best friends, love would never end, it would just begin.
(Starting here right now)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo, promise to love you (promise love) trust me I trust you. (I'll trust you)
If I had one wish, we would run away (yes we would), making love all day,
(feel so good) have us a baby.

If I had one wish,
I'd (make you my whole life) make you my whole life and you'd be my wife,
Make it right this time, if I had one wish.

I don't even know how we ended upon this road;
And, even though we are grown, girl I just want you to know.

If I had one wish, we would be best friends, love would never end, it would just begin.
If I had one wish, you would be my boo, promise to love you, trust me I trust you.
If I had one wish, we would run away, making love all day, have us a baby.
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life and you'd be my wife, make it right this time.

I still know is you just by your touch 

You took me swimming in the ocean 
Had me flying cross the coasting 
You always keep me focused (yeah hi yeah) 
You told me, you love me 
And in my heart I know you mean it 
And no working come between us (yeah hi yeah) 

So gone 
Baby we going to shine like crone 
I know you hate being alone 
So I'm going to take you far from home 
And girl 

I know you want to try new things 
Like a photo in a magazine 
Of me and you together 
You got to trust me 

All of the things you said to me 
And all of the things that you did for me 
All of these things just let me know you care 
And all of the things that you got for me 
All of the things that you stop for me 
All of these things just let me know you care 

And you look so good 
Yes you do 
And it feel's so good 
To have somebody out there 
That loves me to 

And if anybody out there 
Has been in love 
Then it's easy to understand 
She is the only one I'm thinking of",Exotic,2005
Ray J,"Pullin' up to the club 
Six coke dealers in my truck 
Slidin' to the v.i room 
Hypnotik is in my cup 

Then I felt someone grab me 
And say ain't you from Cali 
Then say welcome to Miami 
Yea she was on me heavy 

So I brushed up like whats up 
So her jeans was tight as what 
I say next she made me step 
Back a minute she was wet 
By then I was so ready 

She got my tank top so sweaty 
Tossed her up like Machiavelli 
And yea she was on me heavy

Oh keep sweatin 
Uh uh keep swe'tin'

3am club is packed 
Sure by now she's feelin' that

Yea she knew I made it known 
Sweat drippin' down her face 
Took my mind to a different place 
Club was cool 
If I had my way yea we'd be at my place 
Krazzi how she was down 
Looked at me and said lets bounce 
Gt coupe in velor 
Looked at her and said swell huh

Almost to my crib and she's down 
For whateva' you know I'm down 
Yea she'll be sweatin' for me now 
Come on

Woke up in the mornin'

Another 4 on the rug 
And they keepin' on touch 
Everybody do the snake 
Wen they fuckin' wit us 
Now chicks love me 
Well at least they say so 
Or maybe its the money 
Or the sweet 
See I dun give a fuck

And everyone's a playa'

You can if you feel me 
We can rock away

I just wish that I could hold you 
While you're slipping through my fingers, as I'm playing the piano, 
What is that sound it sounds so beautiful 
And I just wanna be close to you 
Close enough that I can feel you 
I'm already wondering where you are 
And it sounds like it's coming from my guitar. 

[Chorus]
Melody, said that I love you 
Melody, said that I adore you 
Melody, said that I need you 
You can call me foolish and I might be but I'm in love with a melody.

Now you come humming in my write too 
As the music's playing in my radio 
I hear that sound it sounds so beautiful 
It makes me wanna just embrace you 
Your close enough that I can taste you 
I know just where you are c'ause your right here next to me.

Ray J,"Can I talk to you for a minute?

You know, I be thinking to myself
We had a lot of good times together 
(Come on, baby, come on darlin', darlin')
We did everything together

Yeah, we would wake up early in the morning 
(All I need, all I need
All I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Use to watch the sunrise
(One wish, one wish)

Use to watch the sunset 
(All I need, all I need
All I need is a chance to make it right)
We was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Damn, I miss those days
(One wish, one wish, one wish)

(All I need, all I need
All I need is a chance to make it right)
If I could, if I could just hold you in my arms
You know what I mean? 
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish, one wish)
It just feels so good
(One wish)
One little, itty, bitty wish
If I could just have one wish

Damn baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now tell me is this the only way
I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho'
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown
Girl I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away

Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Living life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of the world's delights
(High!) high hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight
(We!) no we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do
You won't go wrong
This is our family jewel

'Cause I know how to treat you girl

Hush, hush keep it on the low low

Ain't no keys they be passing out poho
Hit the club get 'em on the dance floor

Slow it down we can chopped and screwed this
Throw this down like something foolish
Slow it down we can chopped and screwed this
Take it to the crib we can go to do this
