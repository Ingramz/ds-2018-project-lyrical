Leah Robinson,"I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
I wish, I wish, I wish
Ghetto America

Rollin' through the hood, just stopped by to say, what's up
And let you know your baby boy ain't doin' so tough
Even though you passed, goin' on four long years
Still wakin' up late at night cryin' tears

Just thinkin' about those days you used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember, we'd brag on how rich we would be
To get out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody is sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half

I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
How I used to kick it on the front porch
With you
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
With you
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now, I'm just missing you

How I wish, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know, I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay

And if I make it out, this thug life
See you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Ever since this money come, it's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say, boy, you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness

Man, I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin' this real shit off like a gun
I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I was iced up with a Bentley and a house

That's why fake-ass niggas get fake-ass digits
And fake-ass players get a real player hatin 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come round
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof until my shit is goin' down

And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody is sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half

I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
And how I used to hoop off in them to tournaments
With you
And how I used to club hop on weekends
With you
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay

And if I make it out this thug life
See you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Voices in my head been tellin' me to come to church
Say, the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreamin' of windows, black-tinted like a hearse
But wakin' up to life sometimes seems worse

And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies, man
Want me to save the world, I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans

And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half

I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
How I used to street perform on Friday
With you
And how I'd go to church on Easter Sunday
With you
Instead of y'all throwin' them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

Oh, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay

Oh, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay

Oh, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down on me
Sayin' everything's okay

Oh, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow",I Wish [Version],2014
Leah Siegal,"When you play by the rules of the world
The world will rule you!
When you play by the rules of the divine
You will rule the world
Bring back 

[Chorus]
All the way from Heaven to the stars
The stars pass along,
The moon turns to sky
The sky turns to you
I’m falling, I’m falling with no parachute
I’m falling for love with no parachute

All the way form the heaven to the stars, to the moon, to your heart
We only fail to get up to you
My world is new, I put it on the cross
Get thanks to the Lord, the legendary fall
Fuck you, no pause, niggas make God bless us all
Form the.. to the roof, to the head, to the floor
It’s a long fall and a lot of nigga fall short
And a lot of niggas fall off
But not me, I could never see the ball drop
Unless is new year in the heart of New York
If you’re new to the block, get a little rough
Especially if the heart ain’t wide enough
'Cause I’ve been through it all, and it’s even more
Only niggas get the fall.

[Chorus]

If I get it from the Heavens above to the fire to my ass
Nobody surpasses death, it don’t lasts
Now you kill me
I’ve already been dead, I’m a wholly spirit
Watch my flow fly around like a G6
While my body stays down in the audience.
I’m living this life limitless
If it ain’t fly has no relevance
If it ain’t domestic, it’s not intelligent
You should be smart and jump of the…
The dark side, is a long ride…
Just to been through it all, and to see even more
To fly, the niggas get to fall.

[Chorus]",Parachute,2012
Leah Siegal,"[Chorus]
Pray for the day, your pain goes away
And for the time, wasted on goodbye
Can't get back the time, but you stay on my mind
Forgive me for the lies and all the tears you've cried

Yeah; so I pray, every night for a better day
It's like the world's Ike and I'm Annie Mae
But ain't no bitch here, though I shed so many tears for ya
Only cause a nigga care for ya
I'm talkin' 'bout the world over, wake me when it's all over
I don't know if it gets any colder, or any warmer
I'm weak but I'm gettin' stronger
Forever young but I'm gettin' older, lend me your shoulder
But I don't wanna cry on it
But at times I feel a need to lie on it; closure
And some things will never change
I could be last but still way ahead of the game
I do my bid to go hot like 'Pac like Wayne
Like Rick like Ray even muh'fuckin' James
I'm just sayin, (Love Is Pain)
And all I ask of y'all is keep Rule in your prayers

[Chorus]

Yeah hope to see you when I get there
Mile high heavenly skies will be a breath of fresh air
G5, nobody on my plane cause it's private
On my way to St. Elsewhere
I swear, I know they say the good die young and
I guess that's why I'm so scared
But I refuse to die and I won't die
Until history records my greatness, Amen
I see angels, I see demons
I hear laughter, people screamin'
Makes me wonder what's my reason for being here
And so I'm kneeling

[Chorus]

Sing a prayer for me
But don't nobody shed a tear for me I'm dyin' inside as it is
If, lonely is the way of the walk
Then, I'm practically lyin' in a coffin
How often do you tell someone you love 'em?
I bet not as often as you say you love summer
And it's gonna be the coldest winter ever while I'm locked up
CL and A-Team, one love and fuck fame

[Chorus]",Pray 4 the Day,2012
Leah Smith,"The gift of God has given got me so amazed
I get better than if earned like I'm overpaid
I ain't deserve it at all homie I know it's grace
But God gave me a wife to hold for all my days
She got me more than dazed
Babe, your more than antidote to lonely days
You're my partner, you got my back with no delays
You don't just hold me down, you help me behold his ways
We seek His holy face though the surface is only grazed
Babe, I never thought that I would be the type
To choose and chill with my wife over trying to sleep at night
But, we kick it real hard, you never leaving right?
Well good, 'cause I love the ways that we alike
I found a good thing, praise God for wedding bells
This marriage is a picture of the story heaven tells
That means this oneness can't be severed, well very well
By God's grace I married well. I Found a good thing.

[Chorus]
You'll always be my love (oh my my my)
You'll always be my love (my oh my)
I love you, I'll never leave, I want it to be
Always you and only you, I've found a good thing.

They say that boy insane. He gone he lost his brain
He too zealous, he's just trying to go against the grain
He's got his whole life ahead of him, so this is strange
But they don't get that getting other chicks just isn't gain
And marriage is a pain, in fact it's love and joy.
God's plan for man and woman they wanna destroy
By acting like it's prison, avoid it cause it's hard
Look honestly if it don't hurt than you ain't loving hard
Look at Jesus on the cross he got a ton of scars
Laid his life down for his bride cause his love is large
My Lord he set the bar high, and I'm falling short
But I'll be standing with my Savior when I'm called in court
So please forgive me baby when I don't love you right
You're so patient with me girl because He's in your sights.
So let's take on the world, let's love em hand in hand
Bye bye to boyish ways, hello to family man.

[Chorus]

We prayed our wildest dreams his will be done we said.
So let's be praying bracing ourselves for what comes ahead.
We pleaded with the Lord that he would give a child
And he graciously gave, though it took a while.
That is a precious little soul. One who lives and moves.
Never forget the way you smile when you broke the news
And now your belly's growing, baby your skin is glowing
I already love him I can't wait to get to know him.
Till then I'm praying for him, that Jesus would sustain
Our little baby protect him so his life remains.
Through all the joys and pains, you know your husband's here
We'll run this race together. Let's get this one thing clear
I'll never leave your side, I wasn't playing with you
When I wrote them vows, baby girl I'm staying with you
And there ain't nothing that can separate us in this life
Can't nothing ever separate us from the love of Christ

For ever ever ever
The Lord gon be with us for ever ever ever
So girl I ain't gon leave you ever ever ever
The Lord gon be with us for ever forever ever
So girl I ain't gon leave you ever ever ever
The Lord gon be with us for ever ever ever
So girl I ain't gon leave you ever ever ever
The Lord gon be with us for ever ever ever
Ever ever

Leah Smith,"I feel thorns where my crown was
(I be weak but I'm alive)
From the dusk until dawn yeah
(I'll survive 'cause I got) sweet victory
Nobody can take it from me sweet victory
'Cause I got (sweet victory) yeah

You see me limpin'
I know you see me limpin'
You can't tell on these CD's but bro I'm knee deep in it
I'm waiting in my weakness he may be deep in it
I be lyin' through my teeth to say I don't resent it
Even as I right these lines I'm close to tears
Body ain't be workin' right for 7 years
So miss me with that keep your chin up try to smile
Bro I'm 26 I should feel better by a mile
Keep all your anecdotes and cute quotes
I'll pass some clichés for true hopes it too dope

I feel thorns where my crown was
(I be weak but I'm alive)
From the dusk until dawn yeah
(I'll survive 'cause I got) sweet victory
Nobody can take it from me sweet victory
'Cause I got (sweet victory) yeah

Toast to the King
Cheers to the ceiling
Feeling good we gon' make it to the finish (sweet victory)
You hear me
Holla if you feel me
Yeah we still runnin' even though we limpin' (sweet victory)
'Cause we winnin', yeah we know we winnin'
Even though we're winnin' we're still in it (sweet victory)
'Cause we winnin', yeah we know we winnin'
Now we livin' (sweet victory)

They see me on the stage
They like that boy the man
They hear play on them songs
They clappin' in them stands
They like ""I bet you got a lot of good stuff from other bands""
So when I say it's been a few hard years they think I'm playin'
But you don't know my life boy
You don't know my life boy
You don't know what it's been like on my wife
Don't know my fight boy
Being in the trenches steady tryna' fight my foes
And when I couldn't fight no more it brought me low, low
It brought me low I know can't bet it low

I feel thorns where my crown was
(I be weak but I'm alive)
From the dusk until dawn yeah
(I'll survive 'cause I got) sweet victory
Nobody can take it from me sweet victory
'Cause I got (sweet victory) yeah

Toast to the King
Cheers to the ceiling
Feeling good we gon' make it to the finish (sweet victory)
You hear me
Holla if you feel me
Yeah we still runnin' even though we limpin' (sweet victory)
'Cause we winnin', yeah we know we winnin'
Even though we're winnin' we're still in it (sweet victory)
'Cause we winnin', yeah we know we winnin'
Now we livin' (sweet victory)

They like I here you talkin' wins but I see your losses
You celebratin' crowns but I see your crosses
That's the paradox that don't fit in your Mary box
You might not understand if you walk in this pair of socks
The Victor ain't the one that's winnin' seventh inning
Trophies don't go to the ones that got a good beginning
When I say I win I don't mean the state I'm in
I mean that day when the grace got fade out then
I'm winning 'cause I ran with Him

The crown of thorn
Declares your King
A scarlet robe can't cloak Your majesty
They nailed Your hands
You mailed our death
From the cross You reigned
Your Kingdom knows no end
Oh, Jesus
You won it all
Oh, Jesus
Victorious
Oh, Jesus
You won it all
Oh, Jesus
Victorious
Oh, Jesus",Sweet Victory,2014
Leah Smith,"I want this moment for a lifetime,
I mean a lifetime
You give it all til nothing's left
and that's the right time
I been buildin' this foundation for a minute
You ain't gotta be optometrist for you to see my vision
I'm a voice for the voiceless
Like that D boy buildin' his kingdom, brick after brick
That's feelin' that God done lost him and thinking he got no options
Don't know what that life will cost him.
I swear that's some of my family y'all
And you know that I do this for y'all
So you see God the only reason I made it at all
I sit down and hear your heart, like a stethoscope
Then I get up on this mic and tell it for the world to know
Unless the Lord buildin' it, I can guarantee it's broke
That's why I be spittin' with all this passion when you hear my flow

Now I can tell you 'about my new home
Brand new car that's on chrome
But two years later that's old, everybody's moved on
Gone, I'm tryna make it count with this song
Yeah, with this song

I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 

It's crazy how times change
Tryna redecorate my life, switched the pictures in my mind frames
Went from hidin' to seekin', trying' to find faith
Now we speak with our feet and our hands, call it sign lang
You age, we get older turn pages
Corners folded, tryna hold on to our place in this maze
See we gave, years of grown' fast pace it's clear to know
Want a direction we would go and that's what we call His grace
And we're still here
No more letters in them bottles, message still clear
Lived our lives for a throttle, tryna fail fair
Ever our foods flash MacDonald's, slow it down
Change up the pitch somethin' like vibrato
But eventually we find this
If you mention all the times that you acted wild and mindless
Rewind it, that's simply just a line that
Minus sign, it change the sum of our lives
Man, this victor is timeless

I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 

I wanna leave somethin' important on this Earth before I die
So many watches I done purchased, but I still ain't buyin' time
You see doubt is like a brain tumor, it torture those alive
So I'm askin' God to please remove this evil from my mind, yeah
I wanna live without these chains on me
So much dirt, I wanna live without these stains on me
Lord I need Your grace on me
God I live to see Your face only
And by faith only, You know that I want this to last forever

I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever 
I want this to last forever, ever, ever, ever",Last Forever,2015
Leah Song,"I'm cutting the bad fruit off of my tree to
Lighten my load and grow me tall
Just like my dogma, this fire pit mantra
Covered in ashes, now take me home
Shedding my antlers and making up answers
To the mystery of nature, so reach for the sun
Spruce tips and cedars now free up them rivers
The salmon will run, no dam can hold
Uniting the nations, it's gonna take some patience
So unzip your sheepskin, the wolves have returned
(Ah-ooooo)
The wolves have returned
(Ah-ooooo)

I call to the spirit, brother I hear it
Union of all things, like words on the sky
I read the totems, my ancestors wrote 'em
Now I sit patient, as I wait on the tribe
This runs through all things, like thunder and lightning
Song everlasting, well always I learn
Pull off the old skin, now we are kindred
Open and listen, the wolves have returned
(Ah-ooooo)
The wolves have returned
(Ah-ooooo)

So channel the old ones, with each waking new sun
Walk with your totem, conditions unsaid
Walk from the mystery, a love where you feeling
Myrrh for protection, a spear in your hand
In light of our dreaming, never meant to be easy
Sometimes there'll be water, sometimes you'll be dry
Footprints in tandem, in this ancient sandstone
Grandmothers reside, and I'll be by your side
Oh, I will be by your side
Grandmother, I will be your side, oh

Part of creation is making a statement
You can't escape it, she's coming for you
If it was up to me, I'd teach that the lonely
This is just part of the courage it takes
Maybe it's the music, it's moving right through us
All of the songs that will outlive me
I'm running the song lines, I'm wrapping my prayer ties Preserving the old way, my wolf has returned
(Ah-ooooo)
My wolf has returned, oh
(Ah-ooooo)

Leah State,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,

Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,

While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

I love the old fashioned things

Upon a window pane

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Together we're going a long, long way

We're lyin' back to back, a half-inch from the edge

Even when I push you away, want you to pull me back
When you can make it okay, I still want you to wait
You say what you say, and I do what I do
At the end of the day, I still love you
Even when I push you away, pull me back
Pull me back

We're both wide awake, pretending we're not
Wish I could hear your voice, just not the tick of the clock
I wanna turn the memory's dial

When you can make it okay, I still want you to wait

At the end of the day, I still love you
Even when I push you away, pull me back

Leandro & Leonardo,"Quando você passa sorrindo
Mostra esse olhar atrevido
Juro dá vontade de te agarrar

Põe meu coração em perigo

Arrastando tantos desejos

Leandro & Leonardo,"Em um bar de Ribeirão Preto
Eu vi com meus olhos, esta passagem
Quando o champanha, corria a rodo
No alto meio da granfinagem

Nisto, chegou um peão
Trazendo na testa o pó da viagem
Pro graçom ele pediu uma pinga
Que era pra rebater a friagem

Levantou o almofadinha
E falou pro dono eu tenho má fé
Quando caboclo que não se enxerga
Num lugar destes, vem por os pés

Senhor, que é o proprietário
Deve barrar a entrada de qualquer
E principalmente nesta ocasião
Que está presente o rei do café

Foi uma salva de palma
Gritaram viva pro fazendeiro
Quem tem milhões de pés de café
Por este rico chão brasileiro

Sua safra é uma potência
Em nosso mercado e no estrangeiro
Portanto, vejam que este ambiente
Não é pra qualquer tipo rampeiro

Com um modo bem cortês
Responde o peão pra rapaziada
Esta riqueza não me assusta
Toco em aposta qualquer parada

Cada pé desse café
Eu amarro um boi da minha invernada
E pra encerrar o assunto eu garanto
Que ainda me sobra uma boiada

Foi um silêncio profundo
Peão deixou o povo mais pasmado
Pagando a pinga com mil cruzeiros
Disse ao garçom pra guardar o trocado
Quem quiser meu endereço
Que não se faça de arrogado
É só chegar lá em Andradina
E perguntar pelo rei do gado",Rei do Gado,2003

quiero un hangar
y una torre de lanzamiento

Hoy nuestra aldea es todo este mundo
y no es un mero pretexto

A lo mejor tener sed enloquece al desierto
Será la locura que nos hace bailar

Ya limpiaste la casa
ya limpiaste tu cuerpo
ahora tienes el tiempo

le doy respiro a los sonidos

Abandonar la tierra
y sentir la ingravidez

Desordenado es el afán
que nos hace bailar, bailar, bailar.",Casa,2003

Vai trovejar, vai cair
Um temporal de amor

Doido pra sentir seu cheiro
Doido pra sentir seu gosto
Louco pra beijar seu beijo
Matar a saudade
E esse meu desejo
Vê se não demora muito
Coração tá reclamando
Traga logo o teu carinho
Tô aqui sozinho
Tô te esperando

Quando você chegar
Tira essa roupa molhada
Quero ser a toalha
E o seu cobertor
Quando você chegar
Manda a saudade sair
Vai trovejar, vai cair

Bate o desespero, vem saudade sua
Pertinho do céu num baixo astral danado
Neste apartamento eu louco alucinado

Foi o seu olhar que me deixou assim
Louco apaixonado tão fora de mim

O gosto do seu beijo ainda em minha
Boca eu sinto
Forte demais para se esquecer
Você foi ilusão, virou paixão difícil de esquecer

Horizonte azul, vermelho, luzes a brilhar
O seu corpo nu no espelho, lembranças demais

As luzes da cidade olhando aqui de cima
São manchas de saudade, inertes na neblina
Loucas fantasias vem nesse apogeu
Busca no meu corpo encontrar o seu
Coração não bate, apanha no meu peito
Morto de saudade, eu choro não tem jeito

Leandro y Leonardo,"Em um bar de Ribeirão Preto
Eu vi com meus olhos, esta passagem
Quando o champanha, corria a rodo
No alto meio da granfinagem

Nisto, chegou um peão
Trazendo na testa o pó da viagem
Pro graçom ele pediu uma pinga
Que era pra rebater a friagem

Levantou o almofadinha
E falou pro dono eu tenho má fé
Quando caboclo que não se enxerga
Num lugar destes, vem por os pés

Senhor, que é o proprietário
Deve barrar a entrada de qualquer
E principalmente nesta ocasião
Que está presente o rei do café

Foi uma salva de palma
Gritaram viva pro fazendeiro
Quem tem milhões de pés de café
Por este rico chão brasileiro

Sua safra é uma potência
Em nosso mercado e no estrangeiro
Portanto, vejam que este ambiente
Não é pra qualquer tipo rampeiro

Com um modo bem cortês
Responde o peão pra rapaziada
Esta riqueza não me assusta
Toco em aposta qualquer parada

Cada pé desse café
Eu amarro um boi da minha invernada
E pra encerrar o assunto eu garanto
Que ainda me sobra uma boiada

Foi um silêncio profundo
Peão deixou o povo mais pasmado
Pagando a pinga com mil cruzeiros
Disse ao garçom pra guardar o trocado
Quem quiser meu endereço
Que não se faça de arrogado
É só chegar lá em Andradina
E perguntar pelo rei do gado",Rei Do Gado,1999
Leandro y Leonardo,"É noite o carro está rugindo
Parecendo fera
Voando baixo em Campinas
Na via Anhanguera

Já estou vendo ao longe
A linda e doce Ribeirão
Toda iluminada
Feito um céu no chão
Na noite azulada
De uma primavera

A saudade já não cabe
No meu coração
Grudada como faz na estrada
Os pneus no chão

Já deixei pra trás

Entrando em Goiás
Quase que eu decolo

Que eu já cheguei

Que eu busco agora
Se me chamam com desejo
Pra mim não tem hora

É por isso que eu ando
Em alta rotação
Feito um asteroide
Na escuridão
O motor do carro
Parece que chora

O sol agora está nascendo
Está chegando o dia
Mas sei que valeu a pena
Tanta correria

Eu quero estar nos braços dela
Daqui a pouquinho
Pois passei a noite
Voando sozinho
Dentro desse carro

Pour arriver à toi
Pour arriver souffrant
Où étais-tu, mon âme
Pendant cet heureux temps de misère
Et de vent?

Maintenant, je m'assois
Et je vis avec toi
Qui as daigné mêler ton âge
Avec le mien
En sortira un lien

Faux ou vrais

And rounds up the cattle each fall.

In our front yard
I thought by now that they should all be gone.
With winter 'round the corner
Snow on its way
Surely something must be wrong.
Then in that old oak tree I finally saw her
Where she sat gazing down upon her mate
And the song that she was singing
Seemed to say ""I'll be right here""
""I'd like to go, but your love's made me stay.""

He's got a broken wing
And that's why he can't fly
She just can't leave him there
So she stays by his side
They're just like you and me
Oh you should've heard her sing
They won't give up
It's just a broken wing. 

I wish we all could learn
What they seem to have found
To love our families
When trouble comes around
I'll bet that God saw fit
To show them unto me
Him on the ground

What so proudly we hailed,
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,
Through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched,
Were so gallantly streaming.
And the rocket's red glare,
The bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night,
That our flag was still there.

For the land of the free, and the home of the brave.",National Anthem [Acapella],1997

Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love, it is a hunger

And you, its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

And the road has been too long

In the spring, becomes a rose",The Rose,1997

And when he asked the father why has thou forsaken me. 
They watched the savior die of his own choice. 
I've never seen ten thousand angels cry 
But I'm sure they did 
As they stood by 
And watched the savior die.

He couldn't bear the sight

The skies turned to grey

All things change, 
But there's always someone, 
The heart never forgets, 
No the heart never forgets. 

You can find someone, 
And live your life, 
Put an old memory out of your mind, 
But the heart never forgets. 

The heart never forgets, 
No the heart never forgets. 
You can find someone, 
And live your life, 
Put an old memory out of your mind, 
But the heart never forgets. 
No the heart never forgets. 
Ooh, yeah.

LeAnn Rimes,"How do you cool your lips
After a summer's kiss
How do you rid the sweat
After the body bliss
How do you turn your eyes
From the romantic glare
How do you block the sound of a voice
You'd know anywhere

[Chorus]
Oh I really should have known
By the time you drove me home
By the vagueness in your eyes
Your casual good-byes
By the chill in your embrace
The expression on your face
That told me you might have some advice to give
On how to be insensitive

How do you numb your skin
After the warmest touch
How do you slow your blood
After the body rush
How do you free your soul
After you've found a friend
How do you teach your heart it's time
To fall in love again

Oh you probably won't remember me
It's probably ancient history
I'm one of the chosen few
Who went ahead and fell for you
I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch
I fell too fast, I feel too much
I thought that you might have some advice to give
On how to be insensitive

If tomorrow for some reason
Somehow I could not hear
In silence there'd be music
Of a love that's always here

Cause I love longer and wider
Deeper and higher
Cause I've been loved
More than anyone deserves

And if I woke up in heaven
And I could not feel your touch

Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

To the California sun

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

Praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary 
The middle man made it possible that I could go free 
A hill called Golgotha the place of a skull 
No yellow flowers, no trees in bloom the scenery was so dull 
Three crosses stood black and bold against a darkened sky 
And not from pain but a broken heart that middle man died 
I love that man in the middle because I know he first loved me 
Praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary 
The middle man made it possible that I could go free 
I love that man in the middle because I know he first loved me

Only inches from the edge
Where she's almost falling
Stares at the sky till she's drowning in the rain

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

LeAnn Rimes,"You're top man on the scene
You don't think life comes in between
But hey, she's just seventeen
She feels that she's a worldly girl
But man you've been around the world
She is just some worried daddy's girl
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way
Let her down easy
Her heart is on a dime
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time
In her strawberry eyes
The way she sees you signifies
That she's susceptible to your velvet lies
But if you must lay her down
May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown
And please do not lead her on when you leave town
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way
Let her down easy
Her heart is on the line
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time
She's a woman now
With a daughter to make her proud
In her crayon world of paper clouds
She still remembers you
The first boy that she gave it to
And she laughs at how little then she knew
Her daughter's five and her grandfather adores her (of course)
Let her down easy
Her heart is on the line
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time

Everybody knows some turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways

In my daddy's arms I felt secure

They were told to follow the star up in the heavens
And it brought them to the stable of the little baby child.

Is this the ruler, born here tonight
Should we lay our treasures, here by the cradle

Come from the smallest of things

LeAnn Rimes,"No one seemed to notice the man beside the road
He was just a ragged soldier out there in the cold
But he seemed to have a purpose only known to him
As he walked along the streets that night through the town of Bethlehem.

In his head he held a memory of all the wars he'd known
In his hand he clutched a medal for the bravery he'd shown
And the weight of every battle he carried in his heart
But his eyes were clear and searching for a manger in the dark.

[Chorus]
Some are born to greatness, some are born to fall
Some are bound to be forgotten like they never lived at all
But we're all born to know Him and stand before His light
Like the soldier who found his king tonight.

He had marched for politicians, served under their command
And he fought for all the causes that he did not understand
But it was something deep inside him now that led him on his way
With a single star to guide him to were the baby lay.

[Chorus]

He stood before the Son of God, come to pay our debt
He smiled up at the soldier that the world would soon forget
So he held out his medal and said this for you I bring
There he swore allegiance to the newborn baby King.

We danced and played around til' dark
I had them wrestling for my first kiss
Turned into a fight and they missed

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Full thrust, fall in the hole, roll wit the rush
Untouchable chunk of earwax and soul

Down slope, elegant as Fantasia
Killer whale tale inhale, black male from Asia
All out the wood works, hood shirts and wizards

You physical bitch, watch for the imperial blitz, serious shit
Submit, subject to the wreck wartone, and thought poems

Aiyyo yo
I spit bars
Travellin tremendous speed measurin far
Been bustin satellites circlin Mars
Verbal onslaught, bring forth physical force
Of a hundred wild niggas piled in a Trojan Horse
Thought method, set it on generic mic ethic
Professional neck shit, left foes beheaded
This music, is mind control like computer chips
Been doin this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
Wit turbo tactics, maneuver like a trained soldier
Hall of Fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over
Ayatollah, high roller nine totter
Mind controller, 2009 time folder
My coalition, bring the demolition
Wu-blade decision, slate the competition, wit no intermission
Spittin hazardous darts, up front like Rosa Parks
Makin million men march

[Method Man]
Yo, who got next? Meth got next
I chin check, all these MC's line em up god, I go ? hard
Declare holy war, it be hard to dip and dodge
Police squads tryin to bogard, we rip and rob
The boulevard ain't safe for your kids, that's how it is
In the ghetto, we ain't scared to death, but scared to live
So Goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy
Rusty-ass .38 Special, niggas owe me
Slowly I turn, face the one and only
Naughty By Nature, I Do My Dirt All By My Lonely
Ask Pretty Tony, when I got a bitch I keeps a bitch
36 Chambers, Enter at your own risk
Take that watch off and tuck your necklace
City never sleeps, streets is restless
Rap style'll slave you, when you least expect it
Pull the plug on your respirator, leave you breathless
Wu-Tang forever and a day, better warn your boys
I deploy battleship rap, seek and destroy

Lebo M.,"Now if you want a role model 
Of a life most blissfully led 
Then look no further than Pumbaa here 
Than this laid-back quadruped 

Relaxation's the name of the game 
Be cool and be thick-skinned 
Let my lifestyle be your reference frame 

As long as you stand upwind 

Your guide must be this rhapsody 

I gets up when I likes 

He's got it all worked out 

I plans the day ahead 

He's got it all worked out 

When inspiration strikes 

He's got it all worked out 

I go right back to bed 

He's got it all worked out 

But though he may not be one of nature's dynamos 
His mind is on the ball and far from comatose 
Don't dismiss the warthog philosophy 

Take it from he! 
He's got it all worked out 

Take it from me! 

He's got it all worked out 

Now who wants to be a hunter 
Chasing food all over the place 

More often than not it gets away 

Who needs the thrill of the chase? 

Why move mountains to get your chow 
When you only need to move a log 

Make it your dietary resolve for now 
To eat like the old warthog 
Regarding food 

Hm

His attitude 
It's bugs for every meal 

I've got it all worked out 

So full of vitamins 

I've got it all worked out 

No need to cook or peel 

I've got it all worked out 

He eats 'em in their skins 

I've got it all worked out 

They're delectable, available, the perfect snack 
They ain't endangered species 
And they don't fight back 

Don't dismiss the warthog gastronomy 
Take it from he 

Take it from me 

Take it from he 
He's got it all worked out 

So remember when you see us staring into space 
We're caught between a pillow and a soft, soft place 
Don't resist the warthog mentality 

Take it from he 

Take it from me 

Take it from he 
Take it from we 
We've got it all worked out",Warthog Rhapsody,1995

Que o Zé do Caroço trabalha 
Que o Zé do Caroço batalha 
E que malha o preço da feira 
E na hora que a televisão brasileira 

Distrai toda gente com a sua novela 
É que o Zé põe a boca no mundo 
É que faz um discurso profundo 
Ele quer ver o bem da favela 
Está nascendo um novo líder

In the new millennium
You can't play with nobody's mind
Man
Deliberately messing up a good thing
Or holding up a grind
And
You already knowing life's a big fight
Against time
Man
Crime minds
Really shine
Who's dying
Is the kind
Man
When some of us
Find that life ain't beautiful
We switch to
Pharmaceuticals
Your nine to five
Ain't suitable
For the cuticles
I'm going bad
Currently I keep ending up
With even less
Than I had
Record company
Is dealing me something sad
How do you expect
A man to sit
And wait with three kids
For you to
Figure out
What Tech's SINGLE is
Going bad
I feel like
I just might
Act a fool
When I see 'em
Gotta a nigga
Feeling petty
Looking forward
To perdeium
I got some issues
Most of these record execs
Are soft as tissues
Defecate on they self
When they here some
I'm gon get yous
Understand this
When a Rogue's at
You're trying to hold back
His dough sack
And try to bozack
And he go cock
The 4 4 back
You chose that
So cut these ties
And I'll rise
Let's compromise
Or else
I'll hop a plane
With my guys

No one wants to see

For living expenses
They gave me like
Thirty-five G's
Picture me in a hospital
Shot up
With thirty I V's

Instead of moving
I should've kept all that
And continued to stay

Tugging on my zipper
While I'm hanging on
To my vows
Demons surround me
In triple
Stage darkness
And taunt me
They know I'm the good guy
Going bad
So they want me
All my family remembers
Way back in the day
I was good
But they doubt now

Mind state of a pirate
I'm irate
Used to be cool
Till some straight fool
Lit the pilot
Will I be that
Mid-town bound
In the middle of a riot
Or at a wherehouse
Shipping platinum
Shaking hands with
Violet
No love for the bane
False foes in the game
The Qwest wreck was a shame
Twas a journey full of pain
But Tech N9NE will remain
Hella brave
And untame
So make way
For the reign
I'm bringing Highland and Wayne
No thanks to Qwest
They on the receiving end
Of the gun
I cursed you
Everytime I climb
You're getting fired
One by one
But taking one with me
Cause she knows the true meaning
Of a modern day hippie
Who creates jewels off mushrooms
And bombs sticky
HOG STYLIN'
Mid West Side
And Newday
And King Tech & Sway
These are the people keeping me alive
To this day much love

But I don't do this for props and things

Got me spittin' on the mic tonight
I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spittin' on the mic tonight

Ayo I'll probly never be the type to spend two bucks on Von Dutch
But I wan touch hearts, see help the Man up, seen
I come to do what the Lord say
Got my lifestyle flipped to fit His forte yeah
I'm up early like moms and grits
Getting fed daily bread 'til my mind is script'd
And my rhymes intent is to point straight at the cross
Without using clever lines and hits
I know you'd probably be impressed if I cleverly used my melody
To share Christ without using His name heavily
But I'd rather be saying His name so much you could never get me confused
Or discredit me
'Cause I don't wanna do this, I used to be a Judas
It's only Christ in me that got me tryin' to make it through this
I'm givin up time, givin' up rhyme
'Cause it ain't about me getting mine dog I'm nothing

But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that

But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spittin' on the mic tonight

Ain't nothing sweet about me dog but Christ within
Prior to that your boy lived a life of sin
If you catch me givin' up money so folks can eat
It's really God working through me, dog I'm not that sweet
And there ain't a bone in my body that's naturally good
And without the fruit of the spirit I'm actually hood
Basically it ain't nothing great in me
But graciously my God likes replacing me
With His own characteristics traits and things
The wages earned from sin He erased them things
And gave me a new family tree
That the creator of creation hisself related to me
So if it seem like I shine bright in the limelight
Or I might think I'm tight man it's a lie right?
I'm gritty like J-Silas guess my worth
Man without Christ Jesus I'm less than dirt. I'm nothing

I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spittin' on the mic tonight
I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spittin' on the mic tonight

Cats say they gon' change the game
This is Christian rap, why they barely using the savior's name
Got flows saying they rhyme is tight
Christ gave us breath to spit God gave us the mind to write
We don't deserve to shine, naw We just clay
I just came to lift up Christ and not what's my name
When I drop this flow it might sound ridiculous
But Christ smack dab in the middle so conspicuous
Homey it's not clever word play is not what the Word say
Christ in Him crucified all day e'ry day
But have it your way and blab your name
And Christ died you just trying to grab the fame
It's nothing but sound bites nothing but loud pipes
Speakin' in vane man we nothing without Christ
We should use our last breath to rep the King Jesus
You shouldn't have to know our name after we leave here

I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that

I feel your pain homey, I got the same story
But since you came to Christ you got to bring His name Glory
No more living in the darkness, no more living heartless
'Cause you got that Holy Spirit dwelling inside your carcass
Your life's been changed up, rearranged up
You've been reborn and you don't have to do the same stuff
You live regenerate, you get the benefit of Christ crucified
But you got to live in it, God is preeminent
And forgiveness is unlimited, but stop and

From the flats to the drops to the burbs
Calling out to the cats who be dropping the word
Who be representing Christ, Not ashamed to share his life
Catching flack for his props in the world
To the cats that represent Him well while putting the Cross on the move
As they reaching for the cats who
Steppin into hell while they flossing new shoes
Packin gats and flossin new coupes
Making hoodrats doin' the do, acting a fool
But the jigga that figures pullin the trigger
With vigor can make him bigger needs to get in with the Cox Grave Digger
'Cause you live a life sin thats the wages of death
If you livin by the gun that's the way into debt
But if you living the life and living it right
Put your fist in the sky with all of your might
Til you way out of breath, chest pumping all hard due to heavy palpitations
Thirsting for the Lord with Heavy salivation
But you ain't fraud you'll pull a sinners card
'Cause you love the Lord and His habit of salvation repping like Steven
Getting stoned for the stone you believe in
Or slinging the stone into the dome of the heathen Philistine men

Lecrae,"Christ through faith
I talked to a cat the other day
And he was like;
""Man I really wanna come to Christ
But I gotta clean my life up first, get my sins together""
I told em, I used to think that way too
I thought I had to change myself before I could come to Christ
But Christ changed me
Let me tell you my story, it starts like this

It's 5:46 in the mornin', tossin' and turnin'
Chest burnin', sermons in my head keep reocurrin'
Havin' visions in my head of a kid
Cryin' at the feet of the Father, for all the wrong things that he did
Now I'm sweatin' in my sheets can't sleep
My mind keeps tellin' me I'm six feet deep
Don't remind me, even though I'm still alive I can't tell
The way I'm living my life I feel I'm going to hell
God they telling me I should accept you
That you had to leave the world, cause the world left you
Reason I can't change, like a mystery to me
So I make believe there really is a heaven for a G
Even though they say you loved the world so much, you shed ya blood
God I feel I'm too messed up for love
They tell me come as I am but I smell like smoke
My whole lifes full of sin cause it's all I know
The bible told me that you died for my sins
If I believe in Christ, it'll save me from the end
But I'm scared to ask you, to save me my heart
So evil, I got thoughts, that's full of hatred hurtin' people
I thought at first I had to clean up my life
Now I'm hearin' I just need to cling to the light
I'm ready to do it, but Lord I pray you understand
My life is a mess, will you take me as I am

Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly
But you came down and died for me

Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly

I'm sick and tired of trying to me the man, my daddy never taught me to be
I'm grown up now, life ain't what I thought it would be
I made many mistakes in my past I can't fix
Now I'm staring at this crusifix tatted on my wrist
Is it true what they telling me, am I just crazy
Did ya bleed on the cross, for my sins to save me
But why would ya die for me
My whole life I've been working for Satan, while He fed lies to me
And now I'm hearing too much, trying to get a true touch
Of a love that can change me, I'm all screwed up
Figure Hell is what I deserve
But your word says we all fall short so I guess we all outta burn
Teach me I wanna learn
How you could save a wretch like me, before death says it's my turn
I think I finally understand
No matter my past, you'll still take me as I am

Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly

My father had a few last words to give
I be telling people the reason to live
The reason to die, united with the King in the sky
This life is passing us by, I got no reason to lie
You'll never give the world enough, they'll hunger for more
They figure there ways are nuthin to the wonderous lord
More security than the man that left you
More love than the moms who kept you
He'll always accept you
Be everything your supposed to
Let Christ rule ya heart, mind, body and soul cause He chose you
And if the world don't know you
It don't matter you're Gods child and he'll never disown you
Ya purpose on earth is far from worthless
That's why ya glorified like ya life's been purchased
And it don't matter if the world don't seen us
We still mean the world to Jesus

Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly
But you came down and died for me

Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly
But you came down and died for me
Will you take me as I am

Yeah, we're saved by grace through faith
It's not works
Ain't nuthin you can do, ain't nuthin I can do
That could get us this grace salavation that we got man
It's only Christ
So if you feel like you gotta clean yourself up
Before you can come to Him
Forget it
Just come to Him
He'll take you as you are, and he'll change YOU

who knows you Lord but just hasn't
hasn't been seein' you in the right view lately, Hear me out

Father, I'm prayin' for a friend he and I are pretty close
and out of all my friends for this one I'm concerned the most
He say he readin' daily but he ain't really learnin'
He been in church but say that he ain't moved by any sermon
His face weak, he ain't prayed in a week
he wake up and just weep with his face in the sink Lord
you gotta help my man, I'm prayin' for him daily
he ain't sinned but it just seem as if he goin' crazy
He say he feelin' trapped, can't even head up 
the mall coz every lady's half-dressed temptin' him to lust and fall
He keep the TV off, videos just make him feel 
that he ain't really nothin' without money, girls and shiny wheels
The other day he told me that he felt less a man 
coz he ain't have a five-year plan or a piece of 
land and man it's crazy coz his family think so much of him
plus he got a godly wife who always showin' 
love for him but he's strugglin', even though he talk to me
I tell him what to do but he don't listen when he oughta' be
I'm scared for him coz there's people that look up to him
he got some younger siblings who been changed by 
what he's done for them but is it done for him
Lord don't let it be, if he don't wanna talk to you then 
Father hear from me, is it done for him
Lord don't let it be
if he don't wanna talk to you then Father hear from me

Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, yeah, I'm prayin' for you
Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, yeah, yeah, I'm prayin' for you

God, his condition is worsen since we were 
last conversed and I'm with him now and he ain't 
doin' well and this I'm certain
He say he tryna' trust you, doesn't wanna disgust 
you but he was in the mist of sinners
and did not discuss you and just today his anxiety's 
got the best of him, he knows Christ but 
for hours refuse to rest in Him
he's not the best of men but Lord 
I know he really loves you and I can't understand 
why lately he's not thinkin' of you
People trust this dude, you could crush this dude
Father he needs more of you I pray you touch this dude
what can I say to him? I'm determined to pray for him 
Father empty and brake him I pray you'll just have
your way with him, coz there's a change in him 
and the effects are strong, I pray you open up his
heart before the next song and when he gets home
I pray he'll open up the sixty-six book love
letter you wrote and soak it up coz he ain't
hearin' You and he ain't feelin' me and God
I know it's killin' You because it's killin'
me and matter of fact there's somethin' else
he's concealin' see, the person that
I've been prayin' about is really me

Lecrae,"Carlos was born in killa cali
Was walking down an alley and caught a 
Bullet in his head that left him bleeding badly
He lost everything at that moment except his life
He lost his hearing lost his movement and he lost his sight
He laid there in a coma
But man nobody cared
The gospel preached in his neighborhood? nobody dared
But los got up out the coma got and was able to hear
A missionary shared the gospel to his open ears
He got saved got trained got discipled
Back to hood
You could find em preaching the bible
He led a homie to christ from his same hood
Part of church plant
Come on now ain't his name good
This is blessing but I'm stressing that this is not the norm
We need leaders and belivers to help carry it on
But who would minister in a sinister part of town
I pray if jesus is calling you that you would be found

Eric used to go to bible study as a kid
He got older and started doing what the hood did
A rival gang caught him slippin tried to take his life
But the jammed up so them beat him nice
He woke up in the hospital singing bible songs
Praise god he had a place to learn the bible from
But then he gets saved and wanna preach christ they 
Make him change his whole culture and way of life
He gotta get him a bachelors wear a suit and tie
Go to seminary
By then all of his boys will die
Jesus came to invade culture outta nazereth and used 
A couple fisherman who people saw as hazardous
The feet are beautiful if only they'd go
If ain't nobody in hood preaching how will they know?
Eric is better used taught trues in his context
Somebody please plant a church in his projects

In luke 4 16 on down to 21 jesus says 
He's messiah says hes the chosen one
But more than that he quotes isaiah
That shows our savior targets oppressed 
Captive blind and the broke I'm saying
Had a heart for the poor had a heart for the low
And 1st john 2:6 is way we should go
In dueteronomy even tho they under the law
The tithes every third year the poor got em all
I ain't sayin you wrong if you live in burbs
I'm sayin turn your attention to the hood cause we hurting
Man if you ain't burdened please pick up your word an
Tho this world is going down while we here we can serve him
We bring this to the streets because we knew the streets
I pray that more would be burdend to have beautiful feet
You never knew the streets but truth is what you preach
I pray to god you'd be burdened for beautiful feet
Go, go, go (run with those beautiful feet)

Lecrae,"It's like I'm tired of life
Lord I'm wrong, why I can't get right?
And when it's dark, why it can't get light?
Why it can't be light?
It's so heavy, why my sin won't let me see the end?
Come get me!
Please come get me!
My thoughts, my mind, my ways all evil
I'm s'posed to be Your people, I'm s'posed to see Your sequel
I said I'd never leave You
But I'm so left, I ain't right
Lord, I'm sleeping with death
Man, I'm cheating with death
Am I deaf? It's like I don't hear You
I say that I'm a Christian, but it's like I don't fear You
I'm on a selfish island and I am nowhere near You
God, I really need You even though I don't appear to
I'm drinking out a broken cistern that could never hold water and I'm gonna get burned
Though I try, I never satisfy to quench this yearn
I hear You calling, but it's like a fight for me to just turn
Lord, I deserve to burn

I'm feeling schizophrenic
Maybe I ain't saved, 'cause I gotta get high just to block out all the pain
Seen death, seen hurt, seen a whole lot of things
But instead of running from it I'm running away from change
It's like I'm outside in the ice cold weather
The rain's coming down, I keep getting wetter
I know I'm getting sick and I could die any second
But still I refuse to let Your truths make me better
I'd rather eat flies and maggots instead of bread
And it's killing me slow, but I can't get it through my head
You were stabbed, You were murdered
And for me is why You bled
But I spit on your bloody face as if I never cared
Lord, how dare I compare my pain?
Your father turned his back
And You were left to hang
I don't know why You did it, that I can't explain
How can You love this sinner who's desecrated your name?
Lord, I deserve the flames

I know I tell lies
I know I do dirt
Apart from You, I'm nothing, but You can give me worth
I don't know if I know You
But still I know I should
I know these days are evil and only You are good
I've come to this conclusion that I would like to change 
'cause all the world's money and fame cannot sustain
I know that I should turn but that's the hardest thing
Cause do I really feel that having Jesus is a gain?
The world is so tempting
Satan is a beast
He hypnotizes my eyes to say the least
But Jesus be my treasure! To know You is to live
And I am here dying, trying everything there is
All I need here is You
Help me turn 'way from sin
Lord, give me grace to turn away and the fear to not give in
I know that I'm not perfect but I could rest in Him
I know I don't deserve it but still I take your hand
Lord, let me take Your hand

Help me Lord before there's no time left

Lecrae,"Yeah she may look gritty
When her man come back she gone look so pretty 
She the Church
You might see her acting crazy
Be patient with her tho cause she still God's baby 
She the Church
Before you dis her get to know her
Jesus got a thing fo her and died just to show her 
She the Church
She ain't bricks and buildings
She all of God's people Men women and children

A building of beings being constructed
Christ is the cornerstone
Foundation build on another and you's a goner holmes
She' built on em, supported by him
Conformed to him, now she's a body of bodies who transform through him
A temple that breathes we are the halls
We are the floor board or more we are the walls
Manifold wisdom of God no longer a mystery
The church is the pinnacle of our salvific history
One flesh union homie
The Tri-union is glorified through our corporatized communion
Still the present reality is she was born a casualty though she's made alive
She's affected by depravity
Once lived in sin and enslaved by her lust and
Folks catch her slippin and they turn away disgusted
She's a work in progress Christ is the head of her
And He wash her clean with the words that he done said to her
She's already pretty but she's really not dressed 
And sometimes she look silly but she's far from a mess
Yes, please so don't be dissin cause Jesus done paid grip an
And if you didn't then should caller her Misses
I'm talking bout the church

Her name is ecclesia meaning the the assembly
Bows to (the Trinity) No other Divinity
A body family and community she is all one
But on earth you see her in congregational small ones
A microcosm or a small scale example
But yes it is the church even though it's just a sample
Invisible spiritual
Physical visible
Not a brick temple never that simple
This a not a building
She is not bricks
She's a world changer but ain't bout getting rich
Perpetrating fakes cause a lot of folks to hate
Plus her hands get dirty and her feet get scraped
And sometimes her body parts start acting outa place
Legs tryna be arms
Arms thinking they the face
But she'll never be replaced with a one man 
Band or a small Taliban with no body in command

Some don't get it so they hate
They say she's on a paper chase they say she's really fake
So they go start a ministry so they can do the work
But they don't understand how Jesus feel about His church
And yeah they make disciples
They got plenty conversions
They take care of the widows and the orphans they be workin
But none of them are churchin
No church structure
No elders and no discipline
They don't have a conductor
And they so they don't submit
But quite a few of them baptize
People how I pray that you'd look at this thing from God's eyes
Take responsibility inside the whole council 
Not just the area where you might have a mouthful
Who should people submit to
Who will conduct the discipline
If excommunicated what body will they be missing then
Look at Ephesians 4 where Paul gets practical

You really need a

You done tried almost all the drugs
And from Vegas to NY you been to all the clubs
You wanna change
You tried new shoes and clothes
But after while you still low so you know you gotta change
Maybe if you could get a new you or new crew
A new do, that would suit your change
A new somebody to lay with
Cause the last 5 just ain't make it they all betta change
A brand new car on sixes the one you got 
Now needs fixing and plus an oil change
You tried a new place
New clothes, new tastes
New ways, new face but you still need a change

You don't really know what you were put here for but before you go
You looking for a change
You trying find a home you can call your own cause 
You way too grown to making that chump change
Life's too short you been down to long

Now you got oprah on thinking maybe she 
Can help you out your hopeless zone
She gone change you
You even tried the church the pastor 
Gave you bunch of rules they ain't seem to work
You don't change
You tried another one tho that gotcha 
Feeling good inside and gotcha runnin fa mo and mo change
But all about you not God not truth
Just because you wear the suit don't mean you been changed
Christ is just a means to money, plus health
Your like the master and hes the dummy
No change

Well if not that then maybe it's better to be 
Confused and forget all facts and all change
Still been chasing change, and look where it 
Gotchu depressed ain't a thang not u ain't making no
You tried to find God
The horoscopes and stars
Ain't get very far
So far no change
What if life ain't supposed to be gravy
Fulla hurt pain, death, rape, murder and craziness
If God made everything Good then you still 
Gotta live in the hood what's really good
It goes back to Adam in Eden when he ate 
That fruit believin somehow that he could
Man disobeys God now both are at odds
And life is just hard cause our hearts need
You can't find hope in cars
Hope in money, or people
Only hope in God he can change you
Jesus felt the pain, he was hated, hurt
Slandered and slain his death brought
Be a slave to your sin, hate God love money
Love lies, Christ died so you can be changed
It's kinda fun for a while but you'll lose that smile
When your lights go out
And the pain won't change",Change,2008
Lecrae,"I'm so desperate, I can't believe I've sinned against you
Create in me a clean heart (I'm so sorry)
Your mercy is what I need

Woke up this morning too depressed and shamed to leave my bed
Can't stand to see my own reflection so I hang my head
Feel like a disappointment like the scum of the earth
I'm so hurt I know you see I can't cover my dirt
My souls dying hearts weak and I can't even cry
I'm sposed to run to you but WHY I'm such an evil guy
The sun's shining but for me it's the darkest of days
Try to pretend it never happened but the guilt remains
I leave the house it feels like everybody knows I did it
Feels like they reading my mind and know the sin I committed
Through your blood I'm aquitted but my heart doesnt get it
Oh God I'm desperate for Help cause I'm grieving your Spirit
I couldn't sing in the sunday service, Lord I felt fake
And when they started communion I just made an escape
I'm in need of your grace
Feels like you hid your face
Lead me back to cross and show me my sins erased

I'm waste deep in my pity
Is Satan tryna trick me and tell me you won't forgive me
Cause it's startin to get me
Jesus help me quickly I hate wrong I've done
I know we all fall but I feel like the only one
Feels like I should be shunned
Should I punish myself
I know it's dumb cause by your death all my sin has been dealt
But my sin is been felt
I didn't want to do it
But what I want to do I don't
I swear I'm gonna to lose it
Try to open my bible I need to read your pages

I need you Lord but my guilt has got me feeling so faithless
Help me see where your face is
Take me back to the basics
Help me find my joy in you and not people and places
My sin is ever before me I turned my back on you
Oh father break and restore me to bring me back to you

Have mercy on me God according to your steady love
Wipe away my transgression and wash me in your blood
Create in me a clean heart renew a right spirit
Don't take your Spirit away your Presence keep me near it
I'm waiting patience on you Lord I know you hear my cry
Restore your Joy in me
For you alone I live and die

It's you I Glorify cause you don't want my sacrifice
You want me broken and contrite trusting in the Christ
I confess to you my sin and you show me mercy
I turn away from it demonstrating that you are worthy
Over lust, over pride, over all sin
Is my affection for Jesus is who died for all them
I was lost now I'm found I was toss to the ground
My sin weighed on me heavy but I am no longer bound
As sure as Christ wears the crown
I know that grace will abound
And even when I feel lost I know in You I am found",Desperate,2008
Lecrae,"I know a lot of people out there scared they're gon' die
A couple of them thinking they'll be livin' in the sky
But while I'm here livin' man I gotta ask why, what am here fo' I gotta figure out
Waste my life no I gotta make it count
If Christ is real then what am I gonna do about
Everything in Luke 12: 15 down to 21
You've really gotta go and check it out
Paul said if Christ ain't resurrected we've wasted our lives
Well that implies that our life's built around Jesus being alive
Everyday I'm living tryin' to show the world why
Christ is more than everything you'll ever try
Better than pretty women and sinning and living
To get a minute of any women and men that you admire
It ain't no lie

We're created for Him
Outta the dust he made us for Him
Elects us and he saves us for Him
Jesus comes and he raises for Him
Magnify the Father why bother with something lesser
He made us so we could bless Him
To the world we confess Him, resurrects Him
So I know I got life
Matter fact better man I know I got Christ
If you don't see His ways in my days and nights
You can hit my brakes you can stop my life
Then I lost my rights
I lost my life
Forget the money cars and toss that ice
The cost is Christ
And they could never offer me anything on the planet that would cost that price.

Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my
Don't wanna waste my life

Armed and dangerous
So the devil just can't hang with us
Christian youth them will stand with us
Living and driven, given a vision, fulfillin' the commission he handed us
London to Los Angeles, the rap evangelist
My daddy wouldn't abandon us
I gotta backpack full of tracts and I keep it on the Johnny Mac
So are you ready to jam with us
So let's go, give me the word an let's go
Persecution let's go
Tribulation let's go
Across the nation let's go
Procrastination let's go
Hung on the cross in the cold
Died for the young and the old
Can't say you never know
Heaven knows how many souls are going to hell or to heaven so we gotta go in to get them

Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my
Don't wanna waste my life

Suffer, yeah, do it for Christ
You're trying to figure what to do with your life
If you make a lot of money hope you're doing it right
Because the money is God's you better steward it right
And stay focused, you ain't got no ride
Your life ain't wrapped up in what you drive
The clothes you wear, the job you work
The colour your skin, naw you're a Christian first
People get to living for a job
Make a little money start living for a car
Get 'em a wife a house kids and a dog
Then they retire they're living high on the hog
But guess what they didn't ever really live at all
To live is Christ and that's Paul I recall
To die is gain so for Christ we give it all
He's the treasure you'll never find in a mall
Your money your singleness marriage talent your time
They were loaned to you to show the world that Christ is Divine
That's why it's Christ in my rhymes
That's why it's Christ all the time
See my whole world is built around Him He's the life in my lines
I refused to waste my life
He's too true to chase that ice
Here's my gifts and time 'cause I'm constantly trying to be used to praise the Christ
If he's truly raised to life
Then this news should change your life
And by his grace you can put your faith in place that rules your days and nights

Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life

Lecrae,"I know you might a seen on the TV
You hear on the radio and CD(fall back)
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me you might wanna (fall back)

The enemy crafty and misleading
That's why I use the word of God to Lead me
And I ain't eating everything they feed me
Tryna deceive me so I gotta fall back

Lies in them songs lies on television
No telling what lies on the television
Learned sacrasm, sexism, racism
Learned to worship money cars
Learned to hate Christians
All the Christians in the movies so typical
Alcoholic, child molesting, hypocritice and mystical
They say since everyone is doing it it's normal
But Jesus says be transformed and don't let them conform you
You ain't thin enough you need diet
You need a psychic everybody does it you should try it
Spring break hit the beach what you sposed to do?
Be careful what you let the media impose on you
You learned how to find peace from TV shows
You learned how to ride clean from them videos 
In 30 seconds a commercial have you mixed up
(call now and we can have your whole life fixed up)

These days if you watch the, box you should block your
Mind in these times, and them lies that could lock you
They telling girls in our world to be hot stuff
And telling dudes link with crews on the block tough
Plus I'm feeling like they mock us
They think that God is old school like a box cut
But I'm sure that His flock's tough
And we can judge what is bug, and live pleasing in 
His sight when the clock's up
I hope we gazing through His lens with eyes
So we can defend what it is when we get they lies
It's on that cash that they fix they mind
Man they always sayin cheese like it's picture time (be easy)
Tell em cool it with the mind games
I'm chasing Christ, I'm renewed in my mind frame
And removed from them tired games
Then say my life it ain't mine man
We must remove the damaged parts like a tire change

Be rebel let the word of God lead you
Satan uses media to tempt you and deceive you
He will lead ya leach ya leave ya
So be careful as you navigate thru media
Take heed fo gravity get the best of you
And you find the concrete bench pressin you
Use the word of God to help filter all that
Before you fall into the trap you better fall back

You know what I call that? I call that maturity
Learnin how to fall back so you can live in purity
Learnin how to walk that and saying them you ain't luring me
The media is meeting us with lies but He's curing me (be easy)
I know them guys trying to hype you
But cling to the Lord's Word, flee from them vipers
We spitting aiming at your heart like snipers
We'd like fa you to desire God like Piper",Fall Back,2008
Lecrae,"Go hard or go home
Lord use me up

Lord kill me if I don't preach the gospel
I'm still in my 20's- but I'll die if I got to
Already dead- so forget my flesh
I done been crossed over see the full court press
I'm a full court mess if the lord don't use me

Running from my trials thinkin everythangs groovy
If the cross don't move me then I don't wanna breath no mo

If I ain't seeing christ potna I don't wanna see no mo
Rep every day withouth worrying about bruising
I been to china mayne I seen some real persecution
If u didn't know em would ya life look the same
Can they tell you value jesus by the way you rep his name?
Man what's the point of living if I'm living for myself
Lord empty out my life before I put you on the shelf so for 
God I got hard I don't' wanna die tonight
It's too many people living who ain't heard about my christ
Go hard or go home
Lord use me up

Went to asia had to duck and hide-for sharin my faith
They tell me water it downwhen I get back to states
They say tone the music down you might sell a lot a records
But it's people out here dying and none of em heard the message
Took my wifey on mission trip central america
Shared her testimony 40 people stood and stared at her
When she said jesus shoulda seen it was insane cause 
40 out of 40 never heard of jesus name
Aw mayne we ain't focused on the war we just kickin it
Worried bout our image and our space up on the internet

Take me out the game coach
I don't wanna play no mo
If can't give it all I got and leave it out there on the court
Thank you for the grace for the will and the desire
Got me
Living for your glory stead of living to retire
But I pray I'll never tire of going hard for messiah
I don't need no motivation you the reason I'm inspired

Go hard
Go home, go hard
Go home

That's what that is baby
That what that mean
That what that mean

That what that is baby
That what that mean
That what that mean

Wha-what that mean?

That mean that we, should be out up in ok streets

Not just in houses with our bible's summrizing what we read

Man this ain't deep (man this ain't deep)
Why we ain't doing what we read

It's like we sleep (it's like we sleep)

But sinners sleepwalk when they sleep

So why can't we (so why can't we)
The redeemed of the lord

Act out, what he said
And make a scene for the lord

Action-cut, say what, like we was the director

But you better get a grip like movie sets, and get to stepping
(martin)
I know you done it
Da-done it, da-done-and heard it all
You was going hard for the lord before you heard this song

But don't play yourself to save ya self
And walk in fear

Scripture's like a mirror
The truth is closer than it appears",Go Hard,2008
Lecrae,"These brothas passin me and they all rollin 
Fly coups they throw some d's on but they still ain't got the truth
They blow they cheese on it then they die and what's the use
I'm so secure in jesus all I want in life is fruit
I I don't need no fast money
Nope
Don't need a fast car
Yeah the faith is a race but I't ain't a nascar
Homeie you and god got beef cause you keep 
Chasin money like them hundreds got feet

Buddy wanna be rich but even 50 done said that 
He still feel hungry even tho he got bread
Make em throw away they life got em runnin from feds
Love of money's like crack both of em will leave you dead
When you die and face god ain't nothing left to be said
Instead of chasing the truth you take a lie to the head
And homie all I can do tell you what jesus said
Repent and turn from your sin cause the kingdom of god's at hand

People they want chesse american mozzerella
The enemies rat trap might snap any second
'm like that dude in matthew who after finding a treasure
Gave all he had to get it that's a real go getta
People dying over wood grain chrome and some leather
They got expensive tastes but the faith tastes better
I know the ice wet but the living water wetter
But don't believe me read the 13 letters
Or you can the torah the gospel and all the prophets
But homie I promise you'll never profit chasing profit

Now look at 1 timothy 6 it's so clear
You chase the money and wind up in a snare
Now a vow of poverty no it's not there
But you pursue god the rest he takes care
You don't step on his back in order to get rich
If you do then you're in sin and ordered to repent
You come come to christ for god
You come to daddy for worship
He ain't take that cross to fund your vanity purchase
Even though we all agree that death is certain
It seems we believe there's banks beyond earth (that's crazy)

Money dough cash paper
If it was a woman I promise I used to date her
Now that we broke up she be callin ya boy a hater
Cause all I do is use her for golorifying my maker
My treasures in heaven christ is my satisfaction
If I was broke I'd be richer than folkv never had em
God is the gospel not a new bentley
Was empty and he gave us life and that's plenty
Get me homie I could spend six centries
Simply saying I'm satisfied in the sensie
An it's sickening, that knowing god ain't 
Enough we gotta tell em they can get rich quickly
Now this is heresy
False it's not true

They still had joy",Got Paper,2008
Lecrae,"Yeah they tell me sugar coat it, dumb it down but I can't
Might as well could deny the Jesus and be ashamed but I ain't I'm a saint
Til the day I see the grave I'm going hard in the paint
It's the only We hope we got dats why I'll die for the faith I'm a saint

Used to be where I could only trust me and myself
And then that Heavy
Metal devil that could send em straight to he'll with it
Thought it
Was no helping it my selfishness was celibate I sell a bit but I make
Sure I don't sit up in that cell a bit
I'd yell a bit but only when
Hurt came for certain
Illiterate ain't know that the word came
But
Then that that light hit me and unblinded me
Jesus paid a price me

That's how I gained the right ta be the son of God I'd like to be

Changed my heart and gave me a desire for his work mayne
Kill me if you want but
I'm gone get back out that dirt mayne
Not yet what I'm
Gonna be but not what I used to be
Bless his name forever who would
Chose me and start using me
Used to love my sinning fulla greed fulla
Hate
I might say that I love Jesus
But that talk was really fake
I'd
Be lustin for ya cousin if it wasn't for his Grace
Yeah he took me outta
Nothin and he made ya boy a saint

You got to understand Jesus agreed back in eternity 
to sign a bloody covenant and take a deadly turn for me
He ain't just agree he fulfilled it to the death of em
He took that bloody cup that's meant for us str8 to the neck
And yeah he swallowed all that bitterness
That pain and affliction
Ain't a soul in hell with pain comparable to this one
Brought me to repentance
Homie I'm blood purchased
And daily I'm conformed to his holiness so I worship
Jesus finished the work
He resurrected on High
That means he beat death and best believe so will I
See some believe they can fly
But I believe I can die
Resurrect leave the earth
And live forever with God
He will march through the sky while the stars sing his praises
The planets dance around and the universe is amazed
And me I get to gaze upon his beauty for days
Man if I could be anything baby I'd be a saint

You might think I'm crazy like some kinda urban misfit
But first I
Hated church I'd only pray to give my wish list
I'd be just like you
Doing my dougie in the club folk
I promise I ain't it choose it I was chosen to loved on
Eyes low blowing dro that's the life I used to
Know
But Jesus chopped me up and slowed me down just like that
Houston flow
A dead man until somebody hit me with the hardest facts
The Gospel hit my heart I guess that's what you call a heart attack

I'm looking at Ephesians 2 like what did Jesus see in you
Nothin
By
His grace he chose to love on folk like me and u
And I don't
Understand it homie I Neva planned it
I was chasing money and fast
Women and man
Then I met the great I am
Son of man
Or the lamb

Snatched ya boy up outta hell
And got working for his plans
Used think I was the man

Lecrae,"Hair, check!
Shoes, check!
A brand new fit, lookin' cool, check!
I'm lookin' in the mirror like oooh, yes!
To cover for an insecure dude, check!
But she won't feel me and they won't like me
If I ain't in them J's or them brand new nikes
Let's dig deeper inside my psyche
When it's all said and done even I don't like me
He live in the gym and his hair stay faded
Late model car so they think he made it
He's Christian, he gave his life
But he still ain't satisfied in the savior Christ
Still finds his identity in looks and cars
If he only knew that he ain't have to look so hard
If he looked in God
It may seem odd
But he be so satisfied, he can leave it all

I'm not the shoes I wear
I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm not the house I live in
I'm not the car I drive, no

I'm not the job I work
You can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ

Got her hair done, toes, nails
Is that Her, well it's hard to tell
Cause she's so caked up in all that make up
It's like she tryna make up for what she ain't but
She's a saint, but so confused
Cause she's been rejected by all these dudes
That tell her on a scale of 10 she's a two
But that ain't true
If she only knew
In Christ she is loved, she secure and accepted
Never be rejected by God whose elected her
Her beauty is her Godliness
And she ain't gotta flaunt it cause it's obvious
Identity is found in the God we trust
And any other identity will self destruct
Identity is found in the God we trust
And any other identity will self destruct

I'm not the shoes I wear

I'm not the job I work
You can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ

Hey, how do I gain success
Why do I say I'm blessed, huh
Is it the car that I drive
Or the place that I rest
Or the way that I dress, now, now
Is the cause of my pride
The stage and the set
Or my face in the press, now, now
It's the applause that dies
When the praise is less
If my face is depressed, then, then
It's cause my value and worth is in the volume of the work I produce in the booth
It's a prize and a curse if defined by the perks when the truth is through
Man I won't feel like I don't want to live no more, no more, no more
Cause they don't like me, like they did in 04, 04, 04
So I swallow my pride empowered by God, I'm complete in Him
He's got peace God's priest, I'm in
In His presence weak is strength
Meet His kin
We His brethren

The one you used to call your friend
I know you ain't forgot me?

Oh yeah you always get me caught in sin

Here you go with that again
You act like we ain't cool or sumthin
Let's go smoke a Kool or sumthin
Talk and sip a brew or sumthin

Naw man I ain't trusting you
Ain't nothing but lust in you
Thanks be to God I obeyed the teaching I was entrusted to
Cause when you pass by you just want ya boy to backslide
Have me feeling sick like I'm coming down off a crack high

Man that's a flat lie
You act like I'm the bad guy
You know when me and you get together we have a grand time
Let's take it back. All the way to like the 6th grade
Last thing on your mind back in the day was trying to live saved
Remember house parties, kissing in the dark?
Man that was innocent fun come on

NOW don't start
See dawg I live by the Spirit so I don't gratify
All them old sinful desires that never satsify

Aye come on KILL THAT!
Look me in my face and tell me I'm a lie
You ain't feeling chasing women, getting drunk
And getting high, stacking money, staying fly
Living up the playas life, we was
Having fun now gone try to be religious guy

Aye Yo man first of all LOWER YOUR VOICE! Who you talkin' to?
Handcuffed in August '02 I got caught with you
Truck flipped over on 35 that was all from you
I'll mess around and lose my life man tryna walk in you
I'm standing on these stages and got these people believing me
What I look like trying ta gratify this disease in me

So Now I'm a disease? Man please. I got yo back dawg
I ain't saying drop the Jesus and be a rap star
All I'm saying is when it's you and me let's be real folk
We ain't gotta be selling drugs and tryna kill folk
Maybe just a lil

What? A lil this, a lil that, a lil BET late at night
That's like a lil crack, see you ain't gone lie to me
I see how you be tryna be
BET tonight becomes addiction to pornography
And that's in no way honoring the God who's ruling sovereignly

Man you know you miss them old days

Yeah you right possibly
But after that I sober up and think of Jesus holding up
His skin up on the cross for all them drunken nights I'm throwing up
Every thought of blowin up is captured in his flowing blood
I start thinking Philippians 4:8 when you showing up

You know I ain't gone quit right?

Yeah I know but I'm dead to you
And one day I'll be present with Jesus who died and bled from you

I know when you hear this beat it sound like something to step with
But morals and music you want them separate
Like garnish on the side something ya'll don't mess with
That christo-centric rap electric
You might like rap that's wild and wreckless
A soap box for lots young and restless
They got ya head bobbin til ya lose ya necklace
Or betta yet bobbin til it leaves you neck less
You know where death is, where no more breath is and 
3rd graders learn how to leave you chestless
Where god is dissed, dismissed and distant and far 
From their hearts cause they hard and wicked
Sin hates god for real
That's he's rarely talked about and he don't get the mass appeal
You might see sin sharin' a meal that it eats while 
It cheats on the spouse out seeking a thrill

They walk in the church dressed flyer than sea birds
She came to see him he hopin' to see her
They motives ain't right and they heart ain't either
And over god they choose to feed they fever
See he don't understand that it's christ who bled for
Every second glance every turn of his head yo
And she don't really get that
Jesus did that
For every time she fantasize about his six pack
They sure like al b
To connect like his brows be
And with they bodies spit in god's face so foully
Sin so
Bad it's a liar
It's says we on the throne tells god to retire
It's says he ain't enough
And it says we want more
Is says he ain't just and it says he ain't lord
Sin is the laugh at his power
Rape of his mercy
Mock of his patience
It say he ain't worthy

I been duped and been schemed
Like the lord was cool with my sinning
Mocking the cross living unrepented
My sinful life kept us so
Distant
I know lord and been king
Let him run your life like a
Simmons
Then you'll start loving his righteousness and we start
Looking just like his kids

Live free by his mercy and grace
Live free by his mercy and grace and tell the world I'm gone

Lecrae,"Yeah, I got a question, after the show
After the set, after the music stops, what's next? 
Are we just writing songs or are we concerned 
With uniting a people to follow 
The great commission of christ
Yeah let's get it, let's go

Back in the day I was a lunch line rapper
After that I guess I was a punch line rapper
Then I got saved and sometime after
Ya boy came back as a frontline rapper
And when I say the frontlines, that's not a front line
I'm out here preachin' christ on the frontlines
And no it ain't about rockin' stages 'cause 
Some of my engagements are out on the pavement yeah
I'm out to take the bible, create disciples
Who make disciples, disciple-cycles
That's why I want the beats to knock so after 
The music stops you can meet the rock I pray
That you would know him well, this is like show and tell
It's more than a show, I'm showing you emmanuel
So yeah I'm hopin' that you're likin' the flow 
But it's only so you could know that 
God I'm writing it for let's go

After the show, after the set
After the music stops what's next?
Will there be fellowship, prayer, disciples
Will you open your bibles after the music stops
After it's over, after it ends
After the music stops, what then?
Will you understand that christ is king?
Or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops

I recorded a couple songs some fast some slow
So the listeners would know the importance of the show
The importance of the show not to excite 
These folks but make god's truth relevant
Ignite these folks
Discipleship is our call but we make disciples
This is not a suggestion, create disciples
The teachin' is a process, it's not overnight 
And it's not a stage and a mic nah, it's life on life christ 
Walked with twelve, ate with twelve
Talked with twelve, shaped the twelve
Invested in 'em well you could say that he made the twelve
Who made many more, who made plenty more
Now it's on you and me if there's anymore
1 teach, 2 teach, 3 teach, 4 teach, 5 teach
6 teach, 7 teach more, this is what we've been commissioned
It's the reason why I write
So that you could hear the truth
Not so you can say I'm tight whoa

After the show, after the set
After the music stops what's next?
Will there be fellowship, prayer, disciples
Will you open your bibles after the music stops
After it's over, after it ends
After the music stops, what then?
Will you understand that christ is king
Or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops

So, we write this for the right the speak of was righteous
And then we mic check for a culture who likes the hypeness
Some say we keep it crunk, some say we hype man
We just wanna pump the resurrection of the christ man
We in the -burbs and the hoods that's hostile
We share a common view like synoptic 
Gospels and you know we keep a couple young dudes 
Around us and teach 'em the same truth god used to ground us
This is a lifestyle so, when the mic's down 
I pray people follow christ when they turn the lights down
I pray that everybody playin' this song will be 
Challenged by everything I had to say in this song
I don't do this for the money
I don't do this for fame, I don't do this so 
The industry can know my name, I do this in hopes 
To glorify yeshua the king, if you're feelin' me 
You know you should be doin' the same let's go

After the show, after the set
After the music stops what's next?
Will there be fellowship, prayer
Disciples, will you open your bibles after the music stops
After it's over, after it ends
After the music stops, what then?
Will you understand that christ is king
Or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops",Rebel Intro,2008
Lecrae,"This song right here is for everybody out there looking for truth
And who says, ya know, we all in the same boat
Christians, Muslims, everybody like that'(yo)
You're looking for truth
(Oh) I got some answers man
(So good to me) uh let's get into it.

Let's go'
Night and day I ain't scared to sayin we different
They play the prostitute, but they like to say they just intimate
Idols in their heart, they can't seem to lose the grip on it
Seem em walking in the direction they can get crippled with
Our world is different like Whitley and Wayne, mayne
They say we look the same, but we ain't chasin' the same thing
It all boils down to they think everything is relative
Jesus might as well be a South American president
Very evident they say that Jesus was heaven sent
They lifestyle reflects that they worship they self instead of him
They don't acknowledge the Christ
If they did, they wouldn't worship themselves by the way that they live
All these rappers say they got guns that spray of 16
I got a Luke 9 that can take all 16
That's the Bible, the one they call
But they don't care about the author,
They think he's a joke

Man, see some folks say,
""All truth is relative, it just depends on what you believe.""
You know, ""hey man, ain't no way to know for sure who God is or what's really true.""
But that means you believe your own statement,
That there's no way to know what's really true.
You're saying that that statement is true.
You're killing yourself. If what's true for you is true for you
And what's true for me is true for me,
What if my truth says yours is a lie' Is it still true' Come on man!

I promise everybody is askin the same questions,
""Who am I' What is my purpose and my direction""
Probably believe that you exist for no other reason
Than self satisfaction, hedonism, and pleasing things
Life's about you gettin' yours and being happy
Even if it means a divorce and switchin' families
Your job, your house, your car, your spouse
It's all for the glory of you else you out
You go to school, get ya degrees, and get a job
So you can make a whole lot of cheese, 'cause life's hard
You never thought of livin to please a real God
And that's the reason He made you
(See) He gave you breath to breathe, the chest to breathe it
So you can taste and see He's the best, believe it
He made us for His glory, and not for your own, homie
Our God is holy'you should repent and die slowly'

See, there's this thing called ""Secular Humanism"",
It says man is the source of all meaning and all purposing.
You know what I'm saying
We're just the result of a big cosmic explosion.
We don't really have a purpose or meaning,
So we just come up with our own purpose.
We're the source of our meaning and our purpose.
How can a man, which is the product of chance,
A finite being be the source of purpose and meaning
You can't! You're created with purpose man!
Get with The Creator yo!

Man, everybody got a problem with God
And when you mention the Christ,
Then they really get to turning the knob
But some say they roll with Christ
Cause some rappers made him seem like
He was cool with all the sin in they life
No!
But then some say,
""How could God exist when all this evil stuff in the world keep persistin""
Wrong question, ask again
How come God ain't let you feel the wrath from sin'
What you thought last night deserves a first class flight to Hell
Where God doesn't dwell, you got that right
But he brought back life on that cross that night
Christ died
You ain't know that it cost that price'
All of God's anger poured on His Son
Been together through all eternity
Now He was shun
Praise God for the life that was won for us
Ain't got a beef with God because the Son was Christ

Look, man, some people say that God ain't real
Cause they don't see how a good God can exist with all this evil in the world.
If God is real then He should stop all this evil,
Cause He's all-powerful right'
What is evil though man
It's anything that's against God.
It's anything morally bad or wrong.
It's murder, rape, stealing, lying, cheating.
But if we want God to stop evil, do we want
Him to stop it all or just a little bit of it
If He stops us from doing evil things, what about lying,
Or what about our evil thoughts
I mean, where do you stop, the murder level,
The lying level, or the thinking level
If we want Him to stop evil, we gotta be consistent,
We can't just pick and choose.
That means you and I would be eliminated right
Because we think evil stuff.
If that's true, we should be eliminated!
But thanks be to God that Jesus stepped in to save us from our sin!
Christ died for all evilness!
Repent, turn to Jesus man!""",Truth,2008

Yes sir, back on that thang, reflectin on life an it's happiness mayne,
Since I was born I had what I needed, when I think back ain't been lackin a
Thang. Clothes I got, soda pop, the home I got, the cash in the bank, the
Bros I got, the shows I rock, none of us lacked it was passed from the
King, So many things was on to us, we holdin up on some dough for lunch and
I'd say my grace and then get with the game. Never really thought of his
Mercy flows, never really heard the words before, every good thing is
Comin' down from the Father of Lights like a passionate rain. Yeah tell
Them to get back, yeah how they think they get that, my Father gave me gift
Wrap though He don't have to give jack. We ain't earned a single thing, oh
Homie, don't miss that, He gives because he's merciful now spit that, don't
Get it twisted. Hey yeah some of us are strugglin' they off in hoods, but
Still get mo' than they deserve look all he He does is good, He gives
Freely and He's perfect in His distribution, look, don't get it screwed up

Some things that I think are good in life they make me nervous, anything my
Father give me though I know it's perfect, anything I get besides my death
I don't deserve it, used to think that I was good to have cash splurging
(Ooo! ). I was a trap star, sixteen phat car, anything that made me feel
Good was good, that far, kept them bangers with me like I'm good, gon' act
Hard, even kept that green bay too (yeah - Brett Farve). See my whole
Thought of good was out of context, didn't know what good was cause I
Hadn't seen the Son yet, ran around with different girls like it was a
Contest, young and dumb, foolish, too, I was on some nonsense (ooo! ).
Thought it was good that the whole hood heard of me, they thought it was
Good that other hoods wanna murder me, somebody call the cops cause it's an
Emergency, now I know what good is - it's God's love and mercy.

To stay alive but the truth we ain't all buying
Those of us who buy it, We're never bought from

Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to
You're teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like,
I just gotta be like you

Dear, Uncle Chris, Uncle Keith, Uncle Ricky,
Before the Lord get me, I gotta say something quickly
I grew up empty since my daddy wasn't with me, shoot,
I wasn't picky I'd take any male figure you
Stepped in at the right time,
It's 'cuz of you that I write rhymes
You probably never knew that
I loved the way you used to come through,
Teach me to do the things that men do
True,
You showed me stuff I probably shouldn't have seen,
But you had barely made it out your teens,
Took me under your wings
I wanted hats, I wanted clothes just like you,
Lean to the side when I rolled just like you
Didn't care if people didn't like you,
You wanna bang, I wanna bang too
Skyline, pyru
If you would've died, I would've died too,
You went to prison, got sick, lost your pops,
Yeah, I cried too
You never know who's right behind you,
I gotta a little son now and he do whatever I do
But it's something deep inside you,
That tell you it's gotta be more than doing what other guys do,
They had nobody there to guide you
But I followed your footsteps and this shouldn't surprise you,
You realize you, You realize you, you,
Yeah,

I just wanna be like you,
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to,
You're teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like,
I just gotta be like you

Now all I see is money, cars, jewels,
Stars
Womanizers, tough guys, guns, knives, and scars,
Drug pushers, thugs, strippers, fast girls, fast life
Everything I wanted and everything I could ask life
If this ain't living and they lied well,
I guess I married an old wives' tale
Wow, fail
I don't know another way to go,
This is the only way they ever showed
I got this emptiness inside that got me fighting for approval because I missed out on my daddy saying, way to go,
Ain't get that verbal affirmation or know how to treat a woman,
Know how to fix an engine,
To keep the car running
So now I'm looking at the media and following what they feed me,
Rap stars, trap stars,
Whoever wants to lead me
Even though they lie they still tell me that they love me,
They say I'm good at bad things at least they proud of me

I just wanna be like you,
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to
You're teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like,
I just gotta be like you
(Like you)

I was created by God but I ain't wanna be like Him,
I wanna be Him
The Jack Sparrow of my Caribbean
I remember the first created being,
And how he shifted the blame on his dame
For fruit he shouldn't have eaten,
And now look at us all out of Eden,
Wearing designer fig leaves by Louis Vuitton
Make-believing
But God sees through my foolish pride,
And how I'm weak like Adam, another victim of Lucifer's lies
But then in steps Jesus,
All men were created to lead but we needed somebody to lead us
More than a teacher,
But somebody to buy us back from the darkness,
You can say He redeemed us,
Taught us that real leaders follow God,
Finish the work 'cuz we on our job
Taught us not to rob
But give life, love a wife like He loved the Church,
Without seeing how many hearts we can break first
I wanna be like you in every way,
So if I gotta die everyday
Unworthy sacrifice
But the least I can do is give the most of me
Because being just like you is what I'm s'pose to be
They said you came for the lame,
I'm the lamest
I made a mess, but you say you'll erase it,
I'll take it
They say you came for the lame,
I'm the lamest
I broke my life, but you say you'll replace it,
I'll take it.

When nobody knows that you claim me
Or when you mess your life up, get mad, and wanna blame me

Momma want some more Obama in me
The hood want PAC hip hop
Wanna see the Common in me
And since it's a senseless contradiction
I end up a misfit trying fit in
This ends when I stand up
And see the hands that are standard
Holy is the lamb (Holy is the Lamb)
Now we holding you to man up 'cause we were made
In his image start looking at what you came from.

Right after Adam every atom in our anatomy had to make
Adamant after what Adonai is against
Let me take you back to the tree and Eden,
If you read it you'd see that Eve was deceived,
But Adam's the one who let her eat it (Man up)
Standing leading no, we ain't leading we (Bump that)
Basically little boys with muscles and a mustache!
The femininity, we need a remedy that God made a
100 percent masculinity

We the last, yeah
Where the men at, seems like they all lost,
None of them are on the scene, seems like they died off.
They extinct but my dream is to rise up,
We chasing the prize of the King, the divine boss,
But we fell away, now we ungodly
We lose and we really got the blues like Navi,
I want to celebrate the dudes that's beside me.
Fellas let's elevate, we through with the lies man.

They lie, go ahead say boy get your shine on
If a sucker try to block you get your 9 on
And what I heard you gotta do to be a man now,
Stand up for yourself so I took it in my hands now.
And that's the problem man we busy trying to solve it
All the while we walking dead man somebody bring the coffin, boy drop
Peach fuzz now you think that your a man 'cause you feeling yourself
You need to man up!

Sex and models and tippin' bottles
Pack a pile of excuses right next to your bottle caps 
A Rolodex filled with names that you aim to please
Next to the stack of money buildin' up a heart of greed
Ice on his neck, givin' jokers the cold shoulder 
You drunk off pride plus you loving the hangover
You gotta whole lotta stuff that won't amount to gain 
Life will never make sense because you never made change  

We got it twisted, sick like a fever
Lil' man live to stack dough, Keebler
Man up, get up out of that treehouse
Leave them cookies alone, it's time to eat meat now
Tryna show you a new way to live now
No charge, you can call it a freestyle 
Without Christ you won't know what a man is
You a boy in a man's body like Tom Hanks in Big

Being a man got nothin' to do with age
You can be a boy 'til the day you lay in your grave
None of us behave like the image of who we're made 
'Cause we fallen the ways it's better known as depraved 
Running from responsibility really we crave
The easy way out of places that call us to pull our weight
Man they blowing through every day decisions are made
Responding to the call God's giving 'em from the gate

Man up!
Let the process begin, separate the boys from the men
Man up!
Doesn't matter how you started partner, it's about how you end
Man up!
Jesus is the model follow us we go follow him

Why you blowing them stems I'm bout' to flow again
I know the smoke ain't the only thing going in
I gotta whole lotta truth you can roll'em with
Feel it in your chest, yes, breath
It's what you breathe in never thinkin' that you blessed
You hear it in the back, right, left 
Your body feeling right but your soul getting left 
You think you gettin' high but you really getting low
The devil got you blind from the weed that you blow
You worshippin' a tree instead of worshippin' the king
When he made everything Romans 1:23
Chase that high all the way to into the grave
You lost in your low so you're high everyday
And everything you crave only makes you a slave
And Christ is the only way you ever gonna 'scape
If it's one hitta, quitta, get it
In your mind that your time's gon' pass
And if you gon' get it, spit it, lick it
You got one life and it ain't gon' last
You ain't stimulated, you manipulated by a hater
And he hate it when you rehabilitated
If smoke is the evidence, you takin' His benevolent gift
And telling him split while you're in hell in yo hit , so get up

Ohh, you think you high but you really getting low
Yeah, you gon' hate it but I had to let you know
That in the end we all gon' die, can't escape it if you try
I know your lighters up but I'ma blow your high (Eyyy!)
I'ma blow your high (Eyyy!) I'ma blow your high
I know you're trying to free your mind
But you just wasting time
And Jesus is alive

[Canon:]
Wait a minute ya'll
Let me take it down a river while they rolling down the hedonism boulevard
Anything that got em' feeling, maybe money or the Lamborghini in the magazine about the sports car
Everybody wanting satisfaction 
But there's no regard for The One who has it
And everybody wantin' grabbin'
But you gotta get it from above where they stash it
You can try to get high
You can feel alive
But the reality, your soul dry
You gotta find anybody with a better high
You ain't fillin' half of the $20 bag full of weed that provides it
Gotta make a U-turn cause if you turn
You can see The One who turns
But if we never make that turn 
You will never be content with the high you've earned
You will never be happy
Running with the love of kush
For the love of kush, I promise
You can either be a slave to an object
Or rather be a slave to the God who's honest
They ain't never seen a high like I got
But they fallin' in the puddle like a raindrop
Steady running from the top of the balcony
Looking over the Hollywood valleys falling from the rooftop

Ohh, you think you high but you really getting low
Yeah, you gon' hate it but I had to let you know
That in the end we all gon' die, can't escape it if you try
I know your lighters up but I'ma blow your high (Eyyy!)
I'ma blow your high (Eyyy!) I'ma blow your high
I know you're trying to free your mind
But you just wasting time
And Jesus is alive

The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
Who by the unrighteousness they request the truth
For although they knew God, they did not honor Him or give thanks to Him
They became futal in their thinking
They exchanged the truth of God for a lie
And worshiped and served the creature instead of the creator who is Blessed Forever

Lecrae,"Started with hangin' posters on my bedroom walls.
To battle rappin' for status up in the school halls.
Just call me double sushi, thought I was too raw.
And hip-hop was my home, I had my shoes off.

6'3 in high school, well skip a hoop dream.
If I don't blow up then maybe I'll try this school thing.
I went to college to do my family a favor,
But I couldn't pick a major cuz I wanted to be MAJOR.

I tried sellin' work, but it didn't work.
So I worked, shopping center clerk, finna go berserk.
Lunch break, see me writin' 16's over Mickey D's,
Skippin' class, makin' beats, over 60 keys.

And I love that even though I'm just chasin',
Selfish ambition couldn't tell your boy nathan.
Watch out all you rappers cuz they finna let 'Crae in,
But I was sleepin' on the Son, like a Days Inn.

And you can have the money, and you can have the fame.
For me I want the glory, I'm livin' for the Name.
See life is just a picture, I see outside the frame.
I'm livin' for a Kingdom that I ain't never seen.

And imma chase that, imma imma chase that.
Found the key to life and best believe that imma play that.
(Glory) imma chase that, imma imma chase that,
(Glory) imma chase that, imma imma chase that.
I remember chasin' the green, feelin' blue.
Only check I'm countin' is the mic check, 1-2.
All I wanted was the money and the fame and the new,
Somebody on my arm when I walk inside the room.

All I wanted was doom.
The same kind Alexander the Great felt when the earth ran out of room.
He conquered all he could, but yet he's feelin' consumed.
By this neverending quest for glory he couldn't fuel.

Like a typical fool,
(I would go hard) shootin' for the moon,
But there's only one sun (Son), no co-star.
Chasin' glory I shouldn't own,
Instead of living to make His name known,
I'm runnin' after His throne.

I thought bein' on TV where everybody could see me
Was nothing short of the easiest way I could see to please me.
I'll never be who I used to desperately wanted to be,
I'm too worried 'bout the Lord gettin' credit instead of me.

And you can have the money, and you can have the fame.
For me I want the glory, I'm livin' for the Name.
See life is just a picture, I see outside the frame.
I'm livin' for a Kingdom that I ain't never seen.

And imma chase that, (Glory) imma chase that.
Found the key to life and best believe that imma play that.
(Glory) imma chase that, imma imma chase that,
(Glory) imma chase that, imma imma chase that.

I used to wanna do it big.
When you're only focused on yourself that's small.
And they, they used to tell me as a kid,
That I could do anything that I want, except fall.
And now that I recall, I was chasin' my goals.
And everytime I caught'em they multipled into mo'.
I never even thought about whether the Lord approved,
Call it selfish ambition, I call it, ""I'm makin' moves.""

But history repeats itself, evil's what it is.
'Cause Lucifer was cast away for doing what I did.
Created by the God who spoke the earth into existence,
Instead of chasing the Father's glory, he was chasin' his.

He lies to us all, told Adam he could ball.
""Why you followin' God when you could go get it all?""
I'll tell you what's better, or better yet worse.
Chasin' your own glory by doin' the Lord's work.

So holla if it hurts, but we were made for greater.
Our greatest satisfaction is making His name famous.
So if we're never named among the greatest,
They don't critically acclaim us,
Ain't nothin' to be ashamed of, we gave it up for the Savior.

Imma chase that, imma imma chase that.
And the Lord's goodness, you should - you should taste that.
And you ain't livin' 'til you livin' for His name, yeah.
(Glory) imma chase that, imma imma chase that",Chase That (Ambition),2011

Fear says Imma perish but that ain't what my Lord say
He said I ain't guilty though I still ain't have my court date
Tasted and I've seen even though it's just a forte
I don't know what they feeling I don't know what they thinking
But my soul's invincible like Mario when he blinking
They see me full of joy like ""I don't know what he drinking?""
Cup is full of living water bro I sip it and thank Him
Yessir may not win Grammy or get another stellar
But I get rewards from my Lord there ain't nothing better
I may not jot again I may not sell a milli 
But I've been purchased by my king He's forever with me 
So what they talking bout no they can't knock me down

That's why I'm making noise that's why I'm running hard 
That's why I go gorilla spitting them monkey bars

Pressure creates diamonds and fire refines the gold 
Ain't nothing on this planet that satisfies my soul
I'm living for tomorrow today is out of control for sho
I'm good take all my money
I'm good here come the pain
I'm good ya they can kill me
I'm good to die is gain
I'm good I ain't insane yet we don't feel any pain
I'm the same you can't take us out the game
Cause homie we good

I done been through the fire I survived all the floods
And them writers is with me they all covered in blood
Drag my name through the mud they can hate they can gossip 
But my passion for Jesus they ain't never go'n stop me
I was dead I guess that made me better than I ever was
Look at me I'm good partner I'm on my forever buzz 
If everything I have is taken I can take it
They say I never make it I know the person who made it 
My life is hidden in Him so when I die I gain
And Jesus really be walking with me so how I'm lame?
My life is full of pain problems and such 
But I'm focused on forever in eternity's touch
While the world try to fight me Pharisees try to stone me
I am Tebow in the fourth quarter they can't hold me 
Ya the Lord is my coach got me off in the zone
Tell my mama that I'm good when he carry me home 

[Chorus]

Hey man we been beat down we been persecuted
Beat down and mocked but that ain't go'n stop us
No sir. We good. We know where our eternal resting place is at!
Hey trip talk to em man.

I know that Imma suffer that will only make me tougher 
Death is just a doorway to take me to my faithful lover 
The lover of my soul is with me you can save me brother
But you can never knock me down and take me under bring the thunder 
Let the storms come to hunt us and hurt us 
They can't take our Lord from us bro we got us a verdict Not Guilty
He's with us and He stays present He never leaves me
He even gives me stage presence

Those who knew me be like ""who he? "", they're trippin off the new me
They like man where the old 'Crae. You crazy, you can't fool me.
I'm a party so hard that the law tryin' to find me
I pray to God they ain't find me. But then I hear a {whoo-whoo}
Lookin' in the rear view when they are right behind me
Roll down my window, ""Boy, what's your name?""
'Cause you was doing 85 in the passing lane with no traffic, man
Then I give them my ID, and guess what they say
""This boy here crazy, now that's just Crae""
And I was psycho, wild as the hun is
I go like the Chi, doing whatever I wanted
Until I was confronted, heard about Jesus and I changed
They're like man what you do, somethin' bout you just ain't the same.
I was dead. The old me was nothing but a sucker
Sucked the life out of my mother, just to get the stuff I wanted
Now I'm milk carton status and different, can't explain it
Put the APB out on me, if they find me, that's amazing.

These folks is killing for less money than they can borrow
Create and you will sorrow for families left feeling hollow
Then the son of a gun victim fleshing out his anger
Coloring cartoons of strangers who getting strangled
And the daughter let a stranger, the school call him a counselor
Do some dirty things, but he promise that he would counsel her
Baby momma can't identify the man that killed him
It's the same low down dealer that she always get her pills from
And the son is getting older, streets is making him colder
But his momma's out cold, cause she ain't never quite sober
His sister's 15, but you probably think that she grown up
'Cause she was with some men, acting way too grown up
And don't nobody care though, the schools ain't teaching
McDonalds selling poison, got people working for cheap an
The military, drug's, or prison only way to eat, man
It's cold in the streets, let the track bring the heat in

This world's cold like no clothes and snow blown
Like when the devil take the breath out of a baby's nose
And the people won't hear more metaphors and word-play
My sister's sick of stripping, she need hope up in my words, man
She pull up to the mall where she valet her little Mercedes
Wishing she had some romance, healthy family, couple babies
And the gentleman she love, he already got a wife
So she's accepting her plight, she's a lady of the night.
And she saw 'em in the park with his daughter, they holding hands
Arm around his woman's shoulder, he ain't give her not a glance
She accepts her sad reality, she doesn't stand a chance,
One woman gets the man, the other woman gets the dance.

It's a cold world, real cold world

Lecrae,"[Verse 1: Propaganda]
Slang came from a land where they suffer from the effects of depravity like gang bangin' and earthquakes.
Most famous no namers split a brain and plant a taste for the King of kings. I know it's a strange concept.
Pedalin' redemption boy what more can I say make me and Lecrae been trying to make Him famous since ninety three.
Fillin' these 58′s with phrases that would deem us unfit to succeed among these heathens.
It's so crucial in the belly of the crucible that you would understand that stage like your morning candle.
It's handin' out cancer that's why fame was never the aim and the back is the front – homie left side up!
That's a concept

Misconception
Those deadly habits have me losin' my cool...
It's what your frame of mind has chosen.
I'll leave your brain stimulated...

[Verse 2: Braille]
So many mis... conceptions- missin' the mark- mis-directed- drivin' reckless and aggressive
Fueled by our false perceptions- our methods need corrections-
Spittin venom in their face and violate the ones we should protect it's an attempt to motivate
Neglect our obligations place the blame on someone else point out the flaws in other people and take the focus off ourselves
Those who have been abused – view leadership as illegitimate so they don't think it's necessary to play by the rules or submit
They see authority as nothin' more than a power-trip – they don't want to be plugged into it
They'd rather see that power stripped – get it? Power strip... It's unfortunate
Disproportionate the door is wide open for false teachers to twist the truth and distort it
No examples left to follow left to our demise actin' foolish but can't see it so we're wise in our own eyes
The life and crucifixion of Christ is a beautiful depiction of service and submission – within a leadership position

[Verse 3: Odd Thomas]
You probably have it all figured out, right? Like your the type that believes that if you act right then that just might make you righteous in God's sight
You've been a really good person, you followed the good book as much as you could, you probably didn't go to church as much as you should, but it's all good
I mean you never really killed anybody, never really steal from anybody, you never lusted much, or did much, touching of any bodies.
You never use the Lord's name in vain, and you respect you neighbor, you try to maintain peace, love your enemies and not hold on to anger
You really believe that you could receive God's favor by your good deeds and right behavior
But you're dead in your transgressions and need a savior
Cause you could never win God's approval with the removal of sinful discretions – your righteous acts of removing God's wrath is in fact the biggest misconception...

[Verse 4: Lecrae]
Since my conception I've been riddled with deception
Televised lies devised to lead a blind insurrection
Against the resurrection - and the greatest misconception the world believes the Christian is foolish without direction.
And they knock it they knock it but what does it profit a prophet to be socially ostracizing no we ain't stoppin' the mocking
But if there is anything I can do to raise the stock in the market for a Biblical worldview then there's no longer an option
Here with the humble beast, ain't no subtleties, ain't no tongue in cheek, this is what I mean, they don't understand anything about the faith I believe, and they want to belittle me
But it's cool though. They just know the pseudo, the fake faith, the false one, the western God that's man made, not the Biblical Awesome

(And they say) You only live once so live it up tonight
I hope we live twice cause I can't wait to give up this life
Don't get me wrong I love my fam and my experience
Been around the world and back seven wonders I done seen 'em
Number eight is just us wonderin what happens when we perish
And I don't want no regrets I'm a tell the ones I cherish
That I love 'em thinking of 'em on this red eye flight to Paris
If I die before I wake at my wake please tell my parents
That your son will positively wake in paradise
Life is like a pair of dice so watch the ones you rollin with
Roll the clip of my life you gon' see a bunch of empty bottles
Broken hearts and blurry nights, Facebook likes and twitter follows
I'm not livin for today cause tomorrows looking pleasant
And the future is a gift even though this is the present
Yea I do believe in heaven but my actions ain't the key
Them gates remain locked if everything follow me

I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart heart heartbeat
I'll tell 'em I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart heart heartbeat
And I die with no regrets

[Verse 2:]
You not a leader cause they follow you on twitter
And you not a man based up on your age and your gender
If you die tonight you'll probably die a boy
Chasing toys objectifying these women thinkin they gon' bring you joy
Don't you want more than last night's braggin rights
What's yo life?
I know it's hard to think about underneath these flashing lights
Scratch the surface money's worthless when it comes to finding purpose
If you keep the end in focus you can't keep it when it's over
And when it's over there's something else starts
Only thing that's really gon' matter is that hope inside your heart
What you trusting in what you lusting in
For that busty momma that's strutting in
And you popping bottles you throwing dollars
That's cool but partner this just in
That you gon' live forever whether you want to or not
Some of us gon' end up holy some of us gon' end up hot
Tell this life to keep my problems kiss my momma when I'm gone
Tell her I have no regrets and I'm home I'm home

If I'm thinking too hard, don't try it, they'll never buy it.

They want inherited wealth, so I'm giving them the business
You are not your momma, your daddy, whatever happened
You are not the product of all of yo life's misshappnins

Looking for identity in the things that you givin
The gift, not the giver mayne it's cold in the winter
When you face your life existence stop looking like you's a winner
That S class Mercedes, Bugatti, yeah that Bentley
Won't fit up in my coffin when I die, can't take em with me.
But still I let em tempt me, and show me what I'm worth
But none of then can solve my problems or my hurt.
Reject me

This is not the first time I'm far from just gettin my feet wet
And this is won't be the last time I tell the world about your love and they tell me I'm a reject

Confessions of a millionaire, lifestyles of the famous
There's nothing I can't I have, you say it looks so amazing
Well, I would trade it all away for my sanity
Confessions of a millionaire

I've flown first class, flown private jets
Rode in the foreign cars, still so unimpressed
'Cause after she spent all that money on her chest
She thought it make her life better, but she finds she still depressed
Ain't nothing wrong with havin' it, matter fact, go and get it
But if you find identity in it then go 'n forget it
You gain the whole world but lost the only thing ya' own
'Cause everything else is just a temporary loan

Lecrae,"Turn the music up inside my session
These folks gotta hear my message
You put that beat on, I beat on this track to relieve my stressin’
I see more trials than Cochran, while TV tryna’ box me
Them magazines ain't on my page, but ain’t none of that gon’ stop me
Keep the fame and acclaim, I won’t be a slave for a chain
And why stay the same for the change, let’s talk ‘bout change for a change
Mundane, killa’ bang, sell cane for the gain, pump vanity in your veins
No, they hopin’ I quit, ‘fact they hopin’ I die, no, they hopin’ I'm plain insane
‘Cause they know I ain't playing, got my faith on display
And I got some ridas behind me, and they mean what they saying
Knock, knock. Open up. We at yo’ door. Hope you prepared now
And I think it's clear now, potna’ we here now
And don't plan on goin’ no where, consider yo’self infested
And these strings all up in yo’ veins, consider yo’self infected
And what we say we live out, ‘fo we give in we give out
And when we die we come back, tell Death he’ll never win out
They ain't never stop us, pop us, drop us, watch us pop right back up
And we never gone die, that’s why we ride & rise like Pac got back up
Go’n back up, call back up, everybody go home, just pack up
We plugged into the Highest power, that why we ain't gotta act tough
No poker faces, just smokin’ aces, my house is full
My temple is a dwelling place, my Master’s masterful
You just full of yo’self, you just food on the shelf
Eaten for breakfast, talkin’ reckless ,boy I know the chef
You don’t want he’s cookin’, it’s not easy to stomach
And your words will be eaten, folks’ll be readin’ yo’ vomit
The recipe for disaster asks for blasphemy
And as for me, ask for me, I give you gravity",The Drop (Intro),2012

Quit tryna’ act like the trap is cool, ‘cause we tired hearin’ that garbage
Hey, bags of white, pints of lean, I been on dope boys since a teen
But this ain't what we meant to be, and y'all don't make no sense to me

‘Til ‘dem boys caught him, hit him with them two shots
Now, he in the station singin’ like he T-Pain
The bullets made him lean, now I guess he’s 2 Chains
He bought that big-league cannon, wrapped it ‘round a 300
Now matter how you put it, boy, that’s still a 300
Stop that fakin’ and the flatchin’ cut it off
Frontin’ like your paper longer than the Power Ball
He think he Scarface, guess he ain’t seen the movie
Keep on fakin’ ‘til you face down in a Jacuzzi
With some killas in you room with some real guns
That don’t make noise and ain’t plastic but they real guns

Careful with that cannon boy; you might just shoot ya’ self

You ain't really no ghetto boy, why you fakin’ that hard face?
That just made him furious; somebody call Fishburne

Hey, I know you think you the one, homie
But can’t nobody escape gravity

Yes sir, it’s about to go down
It’s spiralin’ to the ground, but I don’t think it’s gon’ slow down
This fallen world is fallin’, this building’s ‘bout to blow down
We just goin’ in circles, we don’t get another go ‘round
(It’s goin’ down) What happens when your life is leveled, bro?
A storm is comin’, can’t nobody’s levies hold,
It’s heavy, bro, but I gotta let you know
It’ll help you look beyond this world like a telescope

It’s goin’ down, rather comin’ down wit’ it
Cold world, condition is sin, here is the illness
It’s sickenin’, affliction so erotic, sickness so hypnotic
Desirin’ this virus even though we know it’s toxic
Godless, hallowin’ the gods that is counterfeit
We live from ‘de party o’ ‘de dearly departed
The darkness is flowing from my nostrils
We’re so psychotic, we still partyin’ like we not sick
YOLO, homie, so pour another glass
Roll another one up, let’s put on another mask
Another bundle o’ cash, another shorty to bag,
Same thing e’eryday, groundhog under grass
Man, turn the music up cuz I don’t wanna hear the truth
‘Bout the things I’m living fo is dead and I’m the living proof
Shoot, the sky’s fallin’, ain’t no need to panic
Unless we party ‘til it cracks, seeing Jesus standin’
Coming down

You scared, I’m not
There’s a time for everything,
A time to be born and a time to die
There’s a time when the world as we know it will end
When that is, I don’t know
But it is goin’ down

Listen, it’s goin’ down, down, down holla’ “Mayday!”
Them fiends looking for candy and them dealers got that pay day
I seen them child soldiers; they was loading up some AK's
Ain’t playin’ Modern Warfare. Don't you know ain’t a war fair?
Scales are never even, but they be triple beamin’
They keep them fiends fienin’, the Devil stay scheming
And dreamers steady dreamin’, but ain’t no hope here
Ain’t no satisfaction in money, women, and clothes here
Oh yeah! Them Christians in Christian Audigier
Hey, can't some young men say the stuff we gotta say
‘Cause everything is fallen, it could happen any day
Your world come tumbling down and ain’t no way to get away
You ain’t never gon’ say you ain’t hear it from Lecrae

Lecrae,"But should I fall
I'm still free from it all

Round of applause, I pause to take a photo op
None of it's real; it's just Photoshopped
Crop out my flaws then my failures, my aches and all my ailments
Now I'm picture perfect, take all my dirt and conceal it
Really, I no better than any
But they pay me a pretty penny to sit and look pretty
Not to big, not skinny, be whatever these fans demand of me
'Cause otherwise they probably wouldn't love me
The show goes on even after the curtains close
I smile and pose, put my signature on they clothes
They lift me up so high that I'm surely about to fall
The higher that I go the more unforgivin' they are
No grace and no exceptions, all they want is perfection
The man in the mirror can't even see his reflection
You live for their acceptance, you die from their rejection
But even if I fall, I fell in the right direction

[Chorus]
Cameras flash, the curtains call, the credits roll down the screen
Critics laugh, they hate us all as they applaud
But should I fall
I'm still free from it all

Life is a cage, a prison of everyone's approval
Fight for acceptance and struggle so you don't ever lose it
But livin' for their acceptance has got us stressing
Insecure people obsessed with leaving impressions
Ladies spending time on their faces painting pretty lines
To you and me it's make-up, but to her, it's a disguise
You look her in her eyes and see her soul cry
'Cause living for other people's got her living a lie
Hadn't slept in day, close his eyes and he pray
Someone would miss him if he fell like a star out of space
But I'm sure they'll replace him, just a name and a face
They say they love you, but it's easy to fall from their graces
Live for everyone else gotcha losin' yourself
Why be slave when made to be free from the guilt?
To be free from the shame, you are more than a name
If you go down you got the freedom to get up again

[Chorus]

Every moment is passing; just let 'em go
In fifty years, man, who cares? We'll be super old
Many winners will lose, many heroes will fall
And if that's me I'm still (free from it all)

[Chorus]",Free from It All,2012
Lecrae,"It's gravity
Keeps pullin' me down

I pen songs for the perishin' and parishioners
Them hearers and them listeners, the home and the visitors
This is not a game, you can't tame or make it purty
They say the earth cursed, so our mouths stay dirty
There's mud on the track, a slug in ya' back
Police done pulled you over wit' a gun in ya' lap
And you ain't the power to make it through this parade
The workers can't keep the profit everything here is vain
My job oppressive, I strive for my blessin's
The pastor so corrupt it's hard to ride with his message
Riches destroy the owners, the government think they own us
My onus is to keep the police from ridin' all up on us
Leavin' money to kids who spend it on getting' blitz
Say, what's the point of livin' to give it up in the end
Then again, all my sin has been pinned to the cross
I know I'm free forever from this land of the lost

[Chorus]
Yeah, every time I think I'm flying
I'm just falling
So close to touching the sky
But gravity keeps pulling me back down
But I can't stay here forever
I want to go, ooh one day! 
I want to go
Somewhere where there's no gravity

Somebody told me there was no such thing as truth
I said, ""If that's the case then why should I believe you?""
Murder, money, and mayhem, every place that I lay in
My problems follow suit, I'm tailor-made for this, ain't I?
It's deep. You wanna go deep? I'll take you deep
Reality is really just cheap
Yo' eyes wide open apparently, but you sleep
And everything you have in your hands you'll never keep
So why hold on, I flow on to go on, before long I float on
Eternal life is what I'm thinkin' I'mma bank my hope on
Believe me, easy is irrelevant
The devil want us burning for the hell of it
Elephants in the room say we can't talk about impending doom
Or we gospel rappin' or preaching people out of they shoes
It's cool, I'll be that dude. We glued to our depravity, 
Until somebody free us from this gravity. Fly!

Them beams on blocks including my own pops
Homie I seen too much to drink them two cups
Can't lean on the lean already way too screwed up
Was way to gone I was way to cold
Fifty yard hail Mary I was way to thrown
I was Tarzan raised by gorillas and the beasts
High on them trees when I gorilla'd the beast

When it's all said and done
You and I are the lucky ones
We fought many
And we'll fight the night until we see the sun
We are the lucky ones
We are the lucky ones
We are here

Under the sun, I found we were left to drown
Evil abounds, weight is pullin' us down
No sight or sound, impaired to His care
Chasing after the wind, running after the air
Deserving of desertion, servants of destruction
And everyday we taste of a grace that we're unconcerned with
My sin I should be burned with, I'm guilty, filthy, and stained
But He became a curse, drank my cup and took my pain
And for that he reigns, through faith I'm changed
And I don't have a reason why he loosened up my chains
I don't believe in luck; I believe in grace
But they say we're lucky cause we seen your face
And we heard Him call us, and He heard our answer
And He gives us second chances when we throw our hands up
So weary and broken, hopin' His arms will be open
Unconditional love has got us locked into focus
(I guess we the luck ones, huh?)

[Chorus]

You're greater than my shame, guilt, my doubt, and my past
Fortunate to trust in you cause I've doubted your plans
I've questioned your ways, every question I raised
Is foolishness compared to mountains, the wind, and the waves
You're so mindful of us, we rise from the dust
You love these cheating, beating hearts and these eyes full of lust
Gave us power to fight it, though we cower in quiet
We have the faith to start a riot; how can we deny it?
Fire inside us that you kindle when it starts to dwindle
And simply put I'm sinful so your love is essential
I don't believe in luck, no, I believe in grace
But they say we lucky cause we seen your face
Lord, we heard you call us, You heard our answer
And you give us second chances when we throw our hands up
I'm weary and broken, but your arms will be open
Unconditional love has got us locked into your focus

See, I'm not sayin' I'm always right
And I ain't sayin' that I'm perfect

Lecrae,"Yeah

Awakened from my slumber by the thunder, lightning clapping
Raining on my window pane and praying I make something happen
A preacher's prophecies never bothered me when I was younger
Sitting on my Grandma's lap, as she cried I often wondered
What was her tears for?
Could it be for my grandfather?
Or maybe she felt for me 'cause I'll see more of those cold tomorrows
Then she see the world will up and turn on me
'Cause the morals that she often spoke were meant for 1923
I fall asleep off in her arms, a Psalm was spoken
The Lord is surely my shepherd, he lead me to the water
Thought that often stuck with with me
Amongst the wolves that run the streets
Out here paying dues to lose
I pray your angels come for me
A non-believer I never have and never could be
Lord give me time to peep the signs I should see
Sipping got me feeling like a player riding clean
Bending corners hoping I might find my Savior on the curb
I rarely go to Church
False prophets rocking Prada so I rarely feel the word
Jezebels lurking in the pews on the first
Preacher's weaker than the deacon 'cause it's hard to fight the urge
It's hard to live and serve when you on the Devil's turf
Sell your soul for the low with no sense of what it's worth
Don't get it twisted, I ain't no saint, I ain't no pastor
But prayer ain't just for cloudy days and natural disasters
Aware of what comes after, I bet you ain't for sure
I was warned that Heaven ain't the only place to go
I'm doing what I can cause there really ain't much time
I leave this in the Lord hands
I'm tired of crying

Yeah, close it

Man down
Hope and pray and say I can’t turn (Man down)
He will find you, this world will grind you down
Don’t you be another (Man down)
Hope and pray and say you can turn (Man down)

Father forgive us for we know not what we do
Am I bias? I been pious put my nose up in the pews
Like Paul I bear good news
They think I'm pall-bearing
My message sounds like death to these hearers as they perish
Scaring to think we on the brink of death
But no one stops to look for answers on what happens next
Got a couple scriptures from my grandma
Sayings from a preacher
But can't live out these standards that we heard it takes to reach 'em
But when I look at Jesus
He live the life I couldn't
Suffered for my crime so I wouldn't
I used to have to sneak into movies 'cause I couldn't afford to pay
Explain to me how someone paved my way
When I hear K.R.I.T. Confessing I respect him
Cause most of us be lying like our lives don't need perfecting
Nothing that we can muster, nothing that we can change
Admitting that we're imperfect, offending God with our games
Look I'm just being honest so don't take me for no lame
I seen it for myself, I'm a product of this thing
Now I found true religion, and it's not inside a denim
And 'em overpriced shades are never giving us vision, let's go

Man down
Hope and pray and say I can’t turn (Man down)
He will find you, this world will grind you down
Don’t you be another (Man down)
Hope and pray and say you can turn (Man down)
I seen another to know, so urgent

Up, big bucks, no whammys
I swear I prolly lump somebody head for a Grammy

And I ain't fronting, I'm just telling ya'll what God say
Blood thirsty
Seek my own will since the day that Adam cursed me
The lust for power go to ya' brain if you let it
You say, ""What up dog?"" I hear ""god."" I'm so dyslectic
Sit on the throne, it's really a toilet, heart is septic

Wicked power exploits the poor, and it brings war
Power can be a field of dreams loaded with land mines

Lecrae,"Now, I'mma tell the world, tell the world, tell 'em
I'mma tell it everywhere I go
Tell the world, tell 'em
Yeah, I'm a billboard
Tell the world, tell 'em
And I'm broadcastin' like a radio
Tell the world, you ought to know
I'm brand new

I know one thing's true
I don't even really deserve to know you
But I am a witness that you did this, and I'm brand new
So, I'm ready to go
And I'mma tell the world what they need to know
A slave to myself, but you let me go
I tried getting high, but it left me low
You did what they could never do
You cleaned up my soul and gave me life
I'm so brand new, and that's all that matters
I ain't love you first, but you first loved me
In my heart I cursed you, but you set me free
I gave you no reason to give me new seasons
To give new life, new breathin'
But you hung there bleedin'
And ya' died for my lies and my cheatin'
My lust and my greed, and
What is a man that you mindful of him?
And what do I have to deserve this lovin'?

Tryna make the moments last
Holdin' onto the past
But like a hero in a dream
Christ came and he rescued me

And I'm broadcastin' like a radio
Tell the world
You ought to know, I'm brand new

I can't offer you nothin'
But your care and kindness keeps comin'
And your love is so unconditional
I get butterflies in my stomach
I got the old me in the rearview
Now the new me got a clear view
And I was so dead, I couldn't hear you
Too deep in sin to come near you
But you drew me in, you cleaned me up
So take me home, beam me up
Before you do, just let me tell the truth
And let these folks know that I done seen your love
And it's everlasting, infinite
It goes on and on, you can't measure it
Can't quench your love
They can't separate us from the love of God
There's no estimate
My face look the same, my frame ain't rearranged
But I'm changed, I promise I ain't the same
Your love's so deep, you suffered and took pain
You died on the cross to give me a new name
Ain't nothing like I've seen before, I got a beaming glow
I was low, down, and dirty, but you cleaned me, Lord
You adopted me, you keep rocking me
I'mma tell the world, and ain't nobody stopping me

Tryna make the moments last
Holdin' onto the past
But like a hero in a dream
Christ came and he rescued me

Lecrae,"[Chorus]
War, pain, violence should stop!

4-fever, 9 millimeter
‘Dem a’ want a heater 'cause the streets is finna heat up
Six million ways to die; choose 10
And if he don't die then he probably do ‘em again
From passionate catastrophe, to genocidal blasphemy
No respect for humanity, they resort to insanity
Head bang on the glass, call it window pain
Jumping out the window tryna’ get my frame through the frame
Close range; when he point, I just blank-out
Felt my heart sank when that bang thang rang out
Now you got yo thang out, you take life, you give it
You took his life away, but you gave yours up to system
No wanna listen, no reason for livin’
We bought the lie we can't be forgiven for all our sinnin’
Killin’ is the religion, service is in a prison
Ignorance got a slave and our name in the mentions

[Chorus]

Bad man, bad man, gun man, bad man
Squeeze bullet, pow-pow. Body bag man.
No bother with no war. No bother with no violence.
No bother with the six-feet-rest-in-peace silence

Grew up under Tupac: bible verse and two glocks
Say we ready to die, see a ghetto in the sky
Couldn't be more wrong than right shoes on the left feet
Highway to hell and we fighting for the best seat
No heart, bullet’s got no name
Little boys wanna bang but ‘dem barely got a brain
‘Dem barely got aim, but they shooting for nothin’
They rob a sister of her brother for a couple a hund’ed
They thinkin’ that life is cheap but it's expensive as ever
They'll be sentenced to forever for them heartless endeavors
I try to tell ‘em (simmer down brethren), but they like whateva’
Too scared of being broke to think about being betta’
Plus, we get bombarded by all these images of bravado
You ain't really a man if you don't follow these models
But the weakest ones follow, the strong reconsider
You can forgive much if you understand you forgiven

[Chorus]",Violence,2012
Lecrae,"I get a little weak sometimes
Teach me the way, night and day


Oh, I'm under pressure, man, I'm under pressure
Been tryna walk it out I keep ended up a stretcha'
Problems in life'll stretch ya', ain't got it all together
They say the change comin', but it's feelin' like forever
Oh, I'm on mission, they probably think missin'
Some screws, but it's these three nails that keep me drivin'
If God ain't with me, I know that I'm gon' fail
And ain't a wish in the well that can wish ya' boy well
Cells eaten by cancer got me lookin' for answers
Doctors say my daughter won't grow up to be a dancer
Just walked out that funeral, I'm right back in my cubicle
Lord, I'm ready for heaven; I'm just waitin' on the cue to go
Feel like givin' up and just blamin' it on my daddy
He never meant to have me, and problems keep comin' at me
I wanna walk with Jesus, but my legs too heavy
I'm hopin' prayer works 'cause the walls can't hear me
Come on!

So I drop to my knees and I scream with my might
I'm know that these walls can't hear me
I say, ""Lord, please won't you hear my cry?""
I know that these walls can't hear me
Maybe if I plead and I sing out loud
I know that these walls can't hear me
Jesus come walk, come walk with me now
'Cause I know that these walls can't hear me

Oh, D Wade died first, now my Uncle Skip gone
Then I lost my grandpa, and that's when it hit home
That people keep leavin' me, this world keep deceiving me
They sellin' me false hope, and I keep believing it
Come on!
I promise I think I'm going insane
Come on!
And gravity pullin' me down the drain
Come on!
My boys in Afghanistan goin' crazy
Staring at them pictures of they babies
Bullets flyin' everywhere, prayin' they gon' make it home
Lord, give 'em Hope. Without it, what else they bankin' on?
Everything is fallin' all around me, put yo' arms around me
Sinkin' in my sorrows got me drowning
Tempted to empty bottles and throw 'em off in wind
Devils lurkin' 'round the corner, just waitin' for me to sin
I pray that you sustain me and keep me from givin' in
Ain't gotta get me out; just get through to the end!
Lord Jesus, come on!

See I need some healing
'Cause I'm losing feeling
Lord won't you please hear my cry, yeah
Let your love rain from the sky",Walk with Me,2012

Hey, I know you think you the one, homie
But can't nobody escape Gravity

Yes sir, it's about to go down
It's spiralin' to the ground, but I don't think it's gon' slow down
This fallen world is fallin', this building's 'bout to blow down
We just goin' in circles, we don't get another go 'round

A storm is comin', can't nobody's levies hold,

YOLO, homie, so pour another glass
Roll another one up, let's put on another mask
Another bundle o' cash, another shorty to bag, 
Same thing e'eryday, groundhog under grass
Man, turn the music up 'cuz I don't wanna hear the truth
'Bout the things I'm living fo is dead and I'm the living proof
Shoot, the sky's fallin', ain't no need to panic
Unless we party 'til it cracks, seeing Jesus standin'

A time to be born and a time to die

Listen, it's goin' down, down, down holla' ""Mayday!""
Them fiends looking for candy and them dealers got that pay day
I seen them child soldiers; they was loading up some AK's
Ain't playin' Modern Warfare. Don't you know ain't a war fair?
Scales are never even, but they be triple beamin'
They keep them fiends fienin', the Devil stay scheming
And dreamers steady dreamin', but ain't no hope here
Ain't no satisfaction in money, women, and clothes here

Hey, can't some young men say the stuff we gotta say
'Cause everything is fallen, it could happen any day
Your world come tumbling down and ain't no way to get away

Hey beat check bass check microphone check 2
But none of that matters let the spirit come check you
So I play the background I know when to back down
Out here going hammer like Jesus is coming back now
I don't want the glory either why you think I go hard
Tell you like I tell my barber bro I don't want no part
Homie what's in your heart pride off in your pocket
You want all the credit boy what's in your wallet?
Sorry I can't control myself I lost it I ain't bout to lose it
Oops please pardon me for all this Jesus juice that I been spewing
Ruining my good shirt stomping got my foot hurt
Crucified for all my sins ya they call that woodwork
I spit loud as I walking round if you jump but that don't work
Like Elijah call them fire from the sky fireworks
Fire words at these people pray evil would be restrained
Lord we need you so we calling on your name like the Flame

One thing that's for sure I am not the one to rock the show

Paradise was lost Adam why you wreck it?
Messing round with trees and find out that he was naked
Then sin entered in boy I got a message Jesus
That they all infected and protection's been rejected
So I'm standing on stages off and on on these jets
Flight attendant is tripping just like she bout to flex
But I am not tripping on the way to as show
Gotta tell em bout Jesus cause they need to know
Oh no it really ain't about me bro
I shouldn't ever say that though what you think He saved me for
So that I can get on stage and the crowd get amazed and they pay me dough? Never
So this smiles on my face when I step in the place and I say hello? Never
I'm gonna preach this grace I'm a teach this grace then I say let's go
I don't have a heaven and I don't have a hell
I can't put you in either but He surely will
Jesus stepped on the scene showed up on the cross
Showed out when he rose he did both for the lost

You're the best thing that I found
You're the best thing that I found (that I found)

I used to get these feelings and think of these crazy things
But when you shine your light on me it's like you gave me wings
I thought I was depressed, you showed me how much more I was blessed
I'm thanking you lord, this I could confess
You know more than anybody all that I had to go through
I heard you when you said that's just somethin' I had to show you
For me to get to know you like I know you
And when the reaper tried to come to get me
You came to save me, I owe you
Some call you Jesus's father, but some say you the holy ghost
I know you love because when things get ugly you hold me close
This is why I try to live the life of 'just righteousness'
Feeling like the opposite something you wouldn't like for us
Coulda easily got addicted, couldn't kick it
You told me to never try it, that's why I never did it

Not ashamed of my struggle
I lost some battles but I'm still out here facing this trouble
Facing my trials cause they only make me stronger
Starving in these streets will only elevate your hunger
Beat me down and laugh at me, tell me that this is foolishness
They can't take my hope away, from and nobody's movin' it
Faith ain't what you make it, faith is all I got to make it
Tired of you forsaken, you naked left in it vacant
Forget them naysayers and haters and stay at it
Sometimes a dream broken is a dream worth having
My pastor
Can't rewind it and back up
Focus fixed on the future so tell my failures to backup
Get back up after you fall when your back is up on that wall
Ain't no backup that you control, just look back up at god and call
Sometimes the pain is the motivation of trust
And them scars are the evidence that the journey was rough, yeah
None of it was in vain, readjusted the aim
Missed a couple of shots
Still ain't outta the game

I ain't seeking out

Insecure whining makes it harder to hear
But uhh, that ain't here nor there
I swear I respect the kind of reject that
Wanna rebel and just reflect on real things like feelings
But these feelings are kinda suspect
Look, I came from a past so shameful
Took advantage of the girls by the handful
Had no remorse recourse was a boy until I ran into the source of the voice
Telling me everything I was on was wrong
Yessir, I was on my throne
Now I hear the same thing, same thing
But I hear it in a song and they wanting me to sing along
Woah, that's trifling, for a grown man that's stifling
I was on the same path for the wrath
I just never got paid for the trash I was writing
But like lightning, that light came and struck me
My life changed, and then suddenly
I met The Lord, and it wasn't even a Sunday
Maybe, one day, someday, you'll give ya' life up to Jesus
Instead of giving ya' life up to pieces

At 15 I ran away and never stopped running
I met a man who took me in 'cuz I was pretty though

And act like I'm enjoying it but really this is all a show
I feel degraded, purity obliterated
This is all I know and I really hate it
Mr. Minor are you listening? I know that you're a Christian
And got computer programs to block me from your vision
And every time you watch me you say that I'm the issue
Your pastor preaching about how not to let me catch you slipping
But maybe I'm a victim, maybe I'm just trapped in the system
And next time you pray maybe I might get a mention (please)
Before you talk about me remember that I'm lost
And your secret pleasure coming at a cost

Higher than a comet
Sippin' gin and tonic
Drinking till I vomit
Tatted on my arms, tatted on my face
Pants hanging low, nina on my waist
I be slanging soft, plus I got that hard
Die for my hood, ride for my boulevard
I got love for my dogs but never for these girls
It's M.O.E. 'cuz money rule the world
But Mr. Dee-1, I grew up crummy
Saw my pops get killed in front of me
Saw my momma do dope in front of me
Felt like ain't nobody love me
Uniform dirty, dressing bummy
Went to school they called me ugly
Caught the bus they used to jump me
God I just prayed to you Sunday
Now it's Monday, I'm starving
Sip sour milk out of the carton
Talk to myself while I'm out walking should I put myself in a coffin?
I don't know! All I grew up with was trouble
Ain't know no role model, I knew the struggle

And you got the nerve to wonder why I'm in these streets robbin'?
Well go and get batman, and go get back man

Ain't gluttony a sin? Why you staring at my gin?

I'm scared of possibly pushing people right over the ledge
When I say I pledge allegiance to the struggle
Then, I turn around and buckle
Under stress and under pressure
Bible on my dresser that can teach my pain a lesson
But I rather not address it
Address that's in depression
I'm scared if I confess it
That you gon' look at me like I'm something less
And I'm such a mess

C'est lui qui a peur d'admettre ses craintes
Et c'est lui qui ne pourra pas les surmonter
On trouve la liberté dans la confession
Et la liberté dans la reconnaissance

And it just so happen, I'm wrestling with my status
I'm trying to see me like He do, not focusing on this madness
They count on me, count me out on a count of they fear and doubts
Keep account of my wrongs, trying to keep me inside they house
Some just keep me around, I wonder what that's about
Yeah! They wanna be politically correct, I suppose
But, I'm comfortable in my skin
While they just pretend in they clothes
I'm scared of falling and failing in front of all of my foes
And I feel some friends are unfaithful
So, I keep my small circle closed
I don't want no handouts or favors, no functional saviors
I'ma tell that truth till it kill me and I'm chilling with my Creator
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus to all of my haters
For the ones that think I forgot him
And the ones who won't let me say
I ain't scared no mo'

At late nights, I can't sleep
Will I fall? Will I peep?
Through the curtains, all I see, fingers pointed at me
And they watching, and they watching
And I'm wondering what they thinking，thinking bout‘
At late nights, I can't sleep
Counting cash, counting sheep
Through the curtains, all I see fingers pointed right at me
And I'm watching, and I'm watching
And I'm wondering what they thinking, thinking bout'it all

I know you don't wanna hear the truth
I know you hate the fact that I actually have the proof
But I just need you to believe
I'm talking the good, the bad, the ugly

Remember back in '02
When I was in school and actin' a fool
My soul got saved
My debt had been paid
But still I kept running off with my crew
Sex on my brain and death in my veins
Had a main thang we stayed up til 2
Smokin'
Waking and bakin' we naked
My body was lovin' it
Soul was hatin' it
Time and time after time
Our bodies grew close the girl was so fine
Heard a heart beat that wasn't hers or mine
The miracle of life had started inside
My God
Ignored the warning signs
Supressed that truth I felt inside
I was just havin' fun with this
I'm too young for this
I'm thinkin' me myself and I
Should I sacrifice this life
To keep my vanity and live nice
And she love and trust me so much
That whatever I say she'll probably oblige
But I was too selfish with my time
Scared my dreams were not gone serve
So I dropped her off at that clinic
That day a part of us died

Come on everybody sit down

I remember back in the day
I was barely in the first grade
Got teeth mission'
Watchin' Tom & Jerry
Tryna go outside so I can play
I was told to watch out for strangers
Keep my eyes peeled for danger
Folks workin' late I had a baby sitter
I ain't 'bout to sit here and name her
I was almost 8 when she came in late
Woke me up with a game to play
Did a few things that's hard to say
And told me to keep that secret safe
Now how a young boy supposed to deal
I'm tryna act like it ain't real
Had my innocence just stripped from me
And I still don't know how to feel
And I wonder how to address it
Can't tell my family too messy
So I just embrace it it's hard to face it
I'm too ashamed to confess it
So I kept it in and ain't speak
Didn't think it hit me so deep
So into it I got promiscuous
And only God could help me get free
But I been forgiven
My Savior risen
I'm out the prison
I know that
I got the power to say to no to all of my struggles
God will control that
Every time we slip and we fall
Gotta get back up and fight on
We are not defined by our past
The future look bright
I see the light on

I just wanna turn it around
Be like oh oh oh ooh oh
Oh oh oh ooh oh
If I never went there, I would never know
Oh oh oh ooh oh
Oh oh oh ooh oh
Maybe I can turn it around

I wish I didn’t do it but I did it
Man it happened last night
Man I wish I would try to act like you ain’t never lost your sight
And I don’t even do it for the money
Except when I do it for the money
Trying to find yourself and you find yourself doing things in the dark kinda funny
I wish I had ten more wishes
I swear I got ten more visions
And life is a game that I can’t stop playing
Baby gimme like ten more minutes
I’m almost finished
I wish I had a little more time
I gotta whole lot of goals I wish I could achieve, I believe Imma lose my mind
Before I get to those
Yeah I miss the goals
But my shot was off
Can't tell what I lost until I count the cost
But I probably missed my calling
Wish I was a little bit taller
Wish I was a baller
Then again every time I get a little money
I be looking at the next man like he smaller
I can’t call it
And I wish I didn’t go and get high on the one first date
I was all zoned out, paranoid like “did you hear that noise""
And I know she probably thinking I’m cray (crae)
No pun intended
I wish I repented
A little bit quicker
Then again I didn’t pull the trigger
I know I said I have no regrets but I sure do wish every chance I get go figure

Wish I had another chance
Maybe I’ll do better
Maybe I’ll do better

He done pulled a lot of triggers
He done made a lot of mamas cry
And if you ask him why he do it he'd just say, ""I'm young and foolish""
Bang on you right before he made them bullets fly

He ain't have no sense of dignity, his daddy was a mystery
He'll probably end up dead or sittin' in a penitentiary
And tell the judge he can go to hell for the sentence
And it probably make no sense to you but listen to the history:
The new Jim Crow or the old one
People out here fightin' for equality and honestly I think they owed some
Back and forth some
Cleaver got a message for the people
Bunchy with 'em and they tryna stop the evil
And they cliqued up with they fist up
The whole neighborhood feelin' like they meant somethin'
Then it was a mix-up, fed's got 'em fixed up
End of the movement, back to the bricks, bruh
And Raymond Washington about to start the Crips up
They gettin' bigger every day and tryna fix stuff
They saw Geronimo Pratt dodgin' bullets from attacks
Guess they figure, ""We don't really want it this much""

You know originally, the gangs were created to protect everybody in the community
There was lynching and bombing going on and the gangs were there to protect
What people don't understand is that a lot of the leaders died
Medgar Evers (has been shot), Bunchy Carter (has been shot)
Fred Hampton (has been shot), MLK (has been shot in Memphis Tennessee)
These youngsters didn't have any direction
No leaders to look up to so they imploded on themselves

They say that Crip stands for Community
Revolutionary Interparty Service
Way before the genocide and the murders
A little after integration was the verdict
When bombs might go off at the Sunday service (baow)
They protectin' they community
Then it turn into diplomatic immunity
Then a fight against oppression was the pressin'
Now they keep on losin' battles and they started losin' unity
Now they beat each other blue-black
Force fed self hate 'till the truth crack
Got they own folks hidin' on the rooftops
They ain't finna take no more, they finna shoot back (baow)
Now they bond like a family they all bloods

Throwin' signs up, now the crime's up
We was meant to kill oppression now we loadin' 9's up

Now they got the drugs comin' in from Nicaragua
Government doe turned a blind eye, or they liars

It was a perfect storm
I mean, we're talkin' post-segregation
And what are you gonna do? 
The factories have closed and no one's hiring anybody from the urban community
Be'cause of what you look like
And now there's a war going on in Nicaragua and drugs are being imported into your community
Are you gonna to sell drugs or are you gonna be homeless? 
'cause the government's not paying attention

What's a reasonable man to say?
There's a high school in Alabama named after Robert E. Lee 
And it's eighty-nine percent black, you don't see the irony?
What it do to a psyche, it's simple, you don't like me
What I'm 'posed to do now?
Delusional calling that system criminal justice
Where the rich and the guilty are safer than the poor and the innocent
Why would we listen?
When American churches scuff they Toms on our brother's dead bodies
As they march to stop gay marriage
We had issues with Planned Parenthood too
We just cared about black lives outside the womb just as much as in
Young man gon' find purpose somehow
And a nation was at least around
And when them vice lords told him he was of royal decent
And that war on drugs felt much more like war on the poor
He figured forget it
So why don't you come stay a while?
Tell us that the son of man walked on Egyptian
And Eastern soil and wasn't just a Western construct
Or master used to control us
But what the Master used to free us
And it was a crooked system just like this that left the King of Kings bloodless

If you're so hard to lose

Take it away, I beg you, take it all away

I know I break your heart
Body of death, give me rest if my heart stops
Then it don't hurt no more, can't get worse no more
Can't pursue all these desires, it ain't cursed no more
No more lies about my worth no more
I understand the thoughts of suicide that do reside
But when I stop and think about my family, I feel new inside
I promised I would die a thousand deaths 'fore I cause them any pain
But somehow I end up killing everything
I cry for you
If you feel a dark, twisted, heart-wrenching, hate-to-see-your-own-reflection
Praying for an intervention, feeling guilt and feeling shame
I just call on Jesus name
Praying daily, can you take away this pain?
Take the thorn away
Still, it remains, I

Sunday morning, or Sunday mourning
I woke up dead inside from all the hurt I saw before me
Evil tryna take away my testimony
Starin' at my phone, feelin' like a phony
Oh, I cry for you, I would die for you
To escape the pain I feel from all that I've been through
I feel it in my soul and in my chest
Take away this ugly thorn inside my flesh
Give me death
But grace is sufficient to start my mission
I'm so far from perfect, can't believe they listen
But hear a broken man 'til your healin' happens
And hear a liar tell you truth to bring you gladness
I could never boast in my accomplishments
I can only hope in God with confidence
Opposite of optimist, You and I are consonants
Broken all the vowels, deservin' of every consequence
Will you cry for me, or will you judge me?
Will you throw stones at my head, or will you love me?
I could never be everything that you wanna see
But crooked sticks draw straight lines, just look at me

I ain't sayin' I deserve nothin'
I'm just tryna talk about the benefits
I've been punchin' in the clock
Tryna keep the kitchen stocked
Man it's a blessin' 'cause we ain't ever had a lot
But all we need is all we got

If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby I'm too busy countin' all these blessings, blessings

Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up

Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up

I put my mama in the crib, said, ""Stop stressin'""
I put my girl in a brand new diamond necklace
She said she need more of my love and affection
'Cause lately I've been workin' harder than ever
She said, ""Baby, you a boss, baby, clear your schedule
Dolla you a boss, let's do somethin' special
Take me on a PJ, we should go to Mexico
I've been down for you boy, since when the money was low""
Anything for my bae 'cause she a blessing
If you woke up this morning it's a blessing

If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby I'm too busy countin' all these blessings, blessings

I took so many losses
Coulda lost it
Left 'em leakin' like a faucet
Almost cost me
Everything that I got, all of my fam
Part of the plan
I was eatin' fried bologna out of the pan
Y'all don't understand
I was tryna get it
I'm in that studio tryna keep it pushin'
Patty pies, boy I kept 'em cookin'
All I needed was the Mary Mary
But the God in me was havin' commentary, woo!
I got angels all around like Anita Baker
Blessings fallin' in line, guess I need a taper
And every loss is a lesson
Tell my haters I confess
Treat 'em like the green bubbles on the iPhone
I probably never read the message

If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man

And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure

And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road

Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.

Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.

They say she plays guitar and cries and sings.

Led Zeppelin,"Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace
Await their place within the ring of calm
Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Await the call they know may never come
In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon 
To jeopardize the course, upset the run
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun 
As love in the halls of plenty overrun
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast 
Unending dances shadowed on the day
Within their walls, their daunting formless keep
Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed 
But no one seemed to question in anyway
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land 
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand 
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand 
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech? 
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' 
But no one there had heaven within their reach
Singing uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow

Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way

I heard the word, I couldn't stay, oh
I couldn't stand it another day, another day
Another day, another day

Touched by the timely coming
Roused from the keeper's sleep
Release the grip, throw down the key

Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take of the fruit, but guard the seed

Held now within the knowing

Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.

Runs straight and high.

Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying the stairway to heaven",Stairway to Heaven,1990

Does she still remember times like these?

I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die
My, my, my inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration look, see

And so today, my world it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
Thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I'm glad

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
Mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me",Thank You,1990

In the darkness can you hear me call

And then she turned to go,
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone.
Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all.
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe,
Rest not to lock your homes.
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all.
I hear the horses' thunder
Down in the valley blow,
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon,
Waiting for the eastern glow.
The apples of the valley hold,
The seas of happiness,
The ground is rich from tender care,
Repay, do not forget, no, no.
Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red.
Oh the war is common cry, pick up you swords and fly.
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know.
Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow,
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow.
The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath,
The drums will shake the castle wall,
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on.
Sing as you raise your bow,
Shoot straighter than before.
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold.
Oh dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the mornin' light.
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back, bring it back.

With flames from the dragon of darkness

When I finally did sit down 
I find myself no wiser than before 

She said we couldn't do no wrong

And a new day will dawn

And the forests will echo with laughter

Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen

But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder

In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

The type of sound, that will tickle your fancy
Reminds of this all classic high life tune, could you ink me
