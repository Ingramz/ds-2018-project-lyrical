Unwritten Law,"Deafness is a blindness
Deny the thoughts that burn inside
Will life go any longer 
A blank age in the book of life
Conceive this time behind me
Because the future is gone
Meet face to face with a bad dream
The thought remains
It can't go on

And will you be there standing
Call my name at the ending light
Well I set my soul beside you
God forgive this ending life
And Dave where are you going
This burning in my heart is growing
Down on myself I don't want to be
I set my soul apart
Constrict the feelings
I want to break free

Escape

And hey mother why aren't you his wife

Turn around and you have found
This shit now left by you
What it takes and your mistakes

What the fuck has happened 
To this thing called family life
Why weren't we the grizzwalds
And why was I denied yeah

When I was alone and down
You weren't there for me

Unwritten Law,"This is a question of the human
Race will this planet remain in
Space two world leaders get
In a fight we'll all be gone

In a flash of light
When I die for my country
I'll take no part in the destruction

I have no answer not my
Decision and if I spoke no one
Would listen is this the end
Of history, why should I care

Why should I worry

Maybe I just got lucky

And can we hold on to what we've got

Even painted my helmet with some paint that my pawpaw needed

But I won't get burned, still cold in south
Shit, dawg, just bring that microphone out
Yeah, I'm black on black, the intimidator
Still making noise like damn cicadas
This white boy got a little bit of flavor
Still keep it country like grape tomatoes

An explorer, going into space
Mathematics, quantum mechanics, the secrets of the universe

All I know is doing hard work
Blood, sweat and tears stained up in my shirt
Mama told me, ""Keep dreaming till the dream come to life""
Yeah I grew it from the dirt
Used to play, getting dirty in the mud
Now I'm grown, still dirty with it son
Rebel flag waving in the southern sun
This is who I am, you cannot take it from me
I don't twitter beef, I'm out here getting even 
Hiding in your bushes while your ass is sleeping
Jack the Ripper kind of vibe is when I'm creeping
Leave you like a broken sink, you're steady leaking
Big guns, clicked up looking like we're getting ready for the fucking purge
Toolbox got enough ammunition to wipe out a city from the motherfucking curb
Big game, big boots, big balls, big wallet
Shocking people like they stuck their head inside a light socket
Einstein-looking ass every time I drop it
I will never lose my shine, skin is diamond plate
They want me to stop but I fucking can't
Out there repping for my little country state
Cheatham county, baby, that is where I stay

A lot of people think that I'm something I'm not
One thing I am is everything I say in my songs
If anybody got a question 'bout the life I live
Ask up, don't paint a picture if you ain't even got the cam piece

I'm a loud mouth, crooked teeth, it ain't no doubt
Flag flapping in my truck, got pride for the south
I ain't a redneck commercial for the show to tell
I ain't your next dollar in your pocket looking like a drought

Fuck that, fuck them
I'm sick of people puttin' stereotypes on a kid
Other rappers looking at me tryna copy all of my shit
Your final needs in my face turn red

On a whole 'nother level but not even for myself
But for every single artist that is sitting on a shelf
Every kid with a dream who can't sleep that well
'Cause mom and dad they got the cops called 'cause all they do is yell

If you've gotta yell something, yell loud to the sky
Get the hell fired then ask God why

We only get one go make it worth that ride
Switch lanes, lights on and the seat reclined

I went from holes in my jeans and loose change in my clothes
Struggling for the pennies now my trucks have turbos
For people wishing that I would crash and fail
Now I'm burning up the city with that superstar sound
Still repping every single person in my zone
12 point buck racks mounted on my throne
I guess I'm robbing the hood with a backpack of arrows
The barefoot bandit chasing that dinero
I never would have thought I'd see the things I am
Sometimes when I'm high I gotta pinch my skin
Hoping that I don't wake up and everything is a lie
My pawpaw passed away then estate took the farm
You don't know my struggle or why I fight so hard
'Cause everything I've had has been taken even my own yard
Being kicked to the curb with the rent past due
Eviction noticed on the door and I had a breakthrough
Yeah I packed my shit, said 'Fuck my friends'
They was all on drugs not going nowhere
Just sitting in a room passing round that weed
That their parents paid for, on some petty-ass shit
So I put the blunt down, stood up in the smoke
I told them I wasn't going down as a hometown joke
So I bought a pack of pens and paper, let's go
I'm Upchurch baby watch the story unfold

If you're gonna yell something, yell loud to the sky
Get the hell fired then ask God why

We've done created something epic now they all wanna take it
All they see is dollar signs and return from my fuckin' greatness
Well bitch I ain't for sale and I'm damn sure ain't just show and tell
And there ain't a motherfucker that's alive right now that's gonna come top me on these scales

How many followers are all ya'll guiding? How many hoes ya'll takin' home?

I'ma make it rain like hurricane so cover
Really got some nerve doing what I do
Writing songs like motherfucker rules
Playing in front of hundreds, some pissed off
But I'ma make it man, we're gonna set a cause

Yelling to my buddies, ""Hey man, no cop, no stop""

We was cranking up the dial jamming Rocky Top
Hiding all our pot in our truck toolbox
Saying, ""Bubba I think we're good, they ain't gonna check there""
But if they do
But if the blue lights come I'll be stepping on the gas
Feeling like Earnhardt going Talladega fast

Water colored sky, water tower spray painted all

That's what I call home (I call home)
Just living in a country song

Rusty old trucks from the senior class
With ripped American flags waving in the back
With an exhaust so loud that it will shake
My whole town (Oh yeah it would)
With the CD skipping 'cause we done burnt it up
Jamming ""Flying Down a Back Road"" while we was on the road
Leaving black marks somewhere in small town USA (USA!)
It was ""Hey baby girl, do you need my Carhartt?
Yeah it's getting kinda cold I'm trying to break your heart""

With hair too long and big old letters that read ""Backwoods"" across my back
Sunburned to a red crisp, skin peeling like every week
Sneaking outta my bedroom window, man we thought we super slick
Smoking pawpaw's Black & Milds, drenched in A&F Cologne
Trying to cover up that wicked smell from all that marijuana smoke
Mama tried, Jesus watched, God laughed and Satan helped
What you expect? I grew up in a house that bumped the Charlie Daniels beat
So if you catch me in Georgia I got the golden fiddle
And I'm chasing the dream and I run at that old devil with...

Had people make me promises, they didn't follow through with that

Trying to catch or grab success
Now I fight to leave this struggle
Till the veins pop out my neck
From me screaming at this microphone 
To get shit off my chest
But at the time I couldn't flow 
And almost nobody had my back
Except my mama and she told me
""Don't ever give up having hope"" (I won't)
You can be a royal king if being a king is what you want
So I soak my skin in ink 
On how I feel in desperation
And I catch a couple Zs 
And I immerse and make a statement

And I close my eyes and drift through the weeds
Of the fields wide open with the owls and the trees
And the snakes in the creeks got that muddy water raging
After the white church is shaking and the thunder lights the way
And past the double doors that open 
Red velvet on the steeple
The only dream of mine is living dreams out for my people
So let me grab a pillow and lay beneath the willows
And I'll tell you all about it when I wake up from Tennessee dreaming

Yeah I went to sleep in a broke down Ford 
With a cracked windshield and barely any money
Now I catch shit from these folks 
For turning my life around and making myself something
But I ain't feeling bad, no not one bit
If you ain't helping yourself I don't wanna hear shit
'Cause I didn't have help in Music City
I'm a high school dropout, didn't even finish
No GED, no damn degree
Now I'm talking to folks with perfect GPAs
Asking me about choices they gotta 
Make while my voice on Rolling Stone magazine
'Cause my face is a imagine of a genre 
Across this road in all these American streets
And it freaks me out till I pinch my skin 
Just to make sure that this ain't a dream

Gonna walk down Broadway, watch the flames and the neon lights

I set the city to flames and watch the purple and blues
Captivate the little bars playing hillbilly tunes
Watch the tours coasting in slow motion happy with the motion
'Cause they think they'll get to see somebody famous in person
Look, I was born in Nashville, my experience is different
To me, it's nothing but a pit of snakes embedded with sickness

I don't hit up tin roof to see what's popping on the weekend
I sit in Centennial Park and watch the world rotate around me
And listen to people whisper how they think that I'm clowning
So go ahead and keep sleeping on the roots that I rooted here
I was born in Baptist Hospital back in 1991
And I ain't gotta wear boots to prove where I'm from
But you can cross the city limits, hear the roaring of trucks
When the world turns green I can still see the skyline
This hometown boy don't ever wanna be signed
'Cause we live with their talking and when we talk of this trash
Attach white to the label, see how businessmen act
And they don't want shit from the heart, 
they want them dollars for their pockets

You're with your friends and I'm with mine, the music's bumping loud
You used to be the girl that didn't go out on the town

Uh, yeah we ain't as young as we once was
Back when I had no tattoos, no ID to get in clubs
We walked Broadway looking at the lights and nightlife that we never seen
Breathing in those toxic fumes from buses sitting on Second Ave
Trying to sneak into the spots where all the big boys used to roll around
I was 130 pound soaking wet but I felt like Zeus when you was around
A long way from them county roads in a small taste of that city life
Sweet smell of that Jack Daniel's, old cigarette smoke and neon lights
With Alan Jackson from the background coming from a country cover band
And a homeless lady on a street corner killing it when she plays that violin
Johnny and June on them alley walls that slept up way back when
We didn't know shit about life just six months into having our license
And if these words were Polaroids these pictures would be priceless
But these thoughts up in my head keep replaying because they're timeless
So whenever you're out up on the town cheers to the times that we had

Yeah, huh, not as young as we was, right?
Now I've been kicked out of every bar except the one I'm sitting in tonight
I had about twelve drafts and two shots, now I'm in a back alley smoking pot
And stumbled into a fist fight with some jockey dudes and get roughed up
But it's all good, that Jack Daniel's got me fucked up as always
And if I leave this neon strip it's looking like I fought a saw blade
Got alcohol on my white suede, car parked on Broadway
No pretty lady in the passenger 'cause of dumb choices that I made
I start the Chevy and it's always her song bumping through them sound waves
One bullet in that pistol Smith & Wesson come take the pain away

Wondering if this path is the one that I'm 'posed to be on

And I realize camera flashes really will make you go blind
And I'm just blind in a sense, and not the cents that make dollars
I'm not gonna go crazy over shit to me that don't really matter
Who cares if you got money, shit, dawg, I got money too
But when you drop the materialistic shit then who the fuck are you

Tombstone and Mash, I'd dress up in his cowboy hat some
And I grab his guitar and pretend to be Johnny Cash on a stage
Just standing in the kitchen when I didn't know how to play
And I'm surrounded by snakes but I'm the one with the venom
I got the voice of the good people, mainstream won't even listen
I can't even get two seconds, shit, I'm the black sheep I guess
But I'm gonna conquer these obstacles with the blade at my neck
Yeah I stress out so I smoke and Mary Jane picks me up

Putting drop-cloths down on my hands and knees

Busting asses 7 days a week not knowing 
What I wanted with my own life

Fell asleep in Lalaland with them critters
Guided by the lightning bugs
Just listen to the bullfrogs sing soprano 
In a creek chorus underneath the moon
Farmhouse over yonder in the distance flickers 
'Cause the wind has gotten out of tune
I guess I drifted in the right direction 
And I went away, I structured all up on my own

Uptown Vocal Jazz Quartet,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,2002

If a rapper doesn't sing, well they call it wrong
While Remington raps on, coming on strong
Critics let their face grow long
Face my music for once I doubt if you can
You've been brainwashed too much as a public man

This is no kid

T.v.'s your pet your radio set, I scan
Popular music gives crap jams, you've been blinded, narrow minded
You know rap is big with the crowds nothing's behind it
They just dance if they like it, so they clock it
Don't be misled by my size when I rock it

This is no kid

Mr. Top-50 Biznizman talking so slick
Don't like our kinda music so he gives us the pip
Why a lie rappers only flip their lip
Both sides of the globe call this music hip

Still knocking on doors of pop to make discs
While big men fake it with crapoid artists
Discotheques' answer ain't raps they ask for
A quick jam, pay wannabees, a few plaster

Just think you're a master with your ghetto blaster
Pipedreams about gold, but big men go faster
But you've hyped the type of music that holds you in a grip
When you pay this critics give it a miss
Dissin' the circuit, you say ""Why, what this is!""
'Cause you rock like a kid, I gotta do it right

This is no kid

Absorbing the words, it's absurd
People go with the crowd like a herd
The bits, the music, the whole words
Copy the style without own effort

If they are the herd, then I must be the herd man
Inventing fresh jams firsthand
You said it was nothing, not worth a damn
Too hard, too noisy, my show a five or ten

But the media men clap their hands
Now you wonder, guess how we did the good hook
It's the guitar, DJ, bass, the drummer's foot
Crumb up y'all, you never get these roots

Diverse from upper-class,
See I'm all that
See I'm all that and it's a fact
I bleed when you beat
But a principle idea, belief
You can never crack

The music hits, fierce as it is
Check the brothers in the crowd that 'hiss'
Good grief

Industry check to mac, and wanna know me
I kick against control untamed like wild pony
Stay lonely like tony, attract like Coney Island
My style man, don't need no master, flasher
Test a prankster gangster like a gatt much faster
Get the band aid, the kid front hard knock
I sport more techniques confidential than Fort Knox
Sort of tool, glock, automatic on the static
Synthetic, plastic, you stay ready with the cascet
I throw a style, now a freak wants to test it
It's crazy mega fab, makes your hottie cher
I crush mc jaws who oughtta be chandelier
And drop the ltter, on the quitter
The survival-rival gets stranger
Much fitter
Worldwide you get served like stinky cheese
More force than a sexual intercourse
So mc's please!
Brothers amaze, keep 'em all in a daze
With the wild funk blaze
Good grief

One time for your mind now, as I have to climb now
Step by step now, where your rap now
I kick the flavor like a wes craven
People under my stairs wanna steal like raven
Black with breaks wanna croak when spoken to
Some shitty nonsense beat, you gotta be jokin' too
The rhyme enforcer, rhythm corsair
Hit the core with force, well of course oh !
Don't give me that lip lip
Like he thought that he could
I frown on bullshit like my name's Clint Eastwood
You come with fronts, stunts 'n poses
I welcome you to my jungle
Like my name was Guns 'n Roses
I blast the sound, you check the sound
You got to be down, you got to be down and be like Charlie Brown

So you rub your eyes
Never knew uds, so cool as ice?
Hear the vibes man, they'll stupefy
Ducks - categorize us as hard criers

No blurs, but obscure styles, these are higher
Profiles are low - as soon as we go
As a breeze straight from a deeper shade of soul

Five souls play the head role
Excite the middle between the two poles
The globe rotates from new to old
Uds take both to reach the souls
Narrowmind clydes, still holding a pose
What we pour 'n flow when we come close
To the contrary, they pinch their earlobes
They call it rogue-rock, but it's a deeper shade of soul

We blend everything, with the color of skin
Under the skin, we're in like Flynn
Ducks stare at us, as soon as we begin
To innovate the frame of thought they're in
Again, music's got to do with only feeling
Not where you're from, it's 'can' they yield in

Yeah, (what a coincidence) 
Well that?s how things happen (yea I know, I wanna have you just one more time) 
But you know what (what's that) 
You know what?s odd (what is it) 

Verse 1: 
What are the odds of me bumping into you again (one in a million) 
What are the odds of me seeing my first lover friend (two in a million) 

It's been two years since we both graduated, I still can feel how we both celebrated
I can't get over your voice on my phone, we've been apart for so long. 

Chorus: 
So I refuse to wait, my patience is out the door baby 
I refuse to hear you say, you don?t want me no more baby 
I refuse to blame, you for anything - me for any thing 
Lets not take finding each other in vain its not a coincidence baby 

Verse 2: 
Remember we use to sneak off when your mama dosed off 
Hit the back seat of my Chevy fog up the windows 

Made love to sweet lady our favorite song 
Kept it moving slow and steady to the tempo 

Then we would lay there and hold on to each other like there wasn?t a tomorrow 
I can?t get over your voice on the phone, we've been apart for so long

Chorus: 
So I refuse to wait, my patience is out the door baby 
I refuse to hear you say, don?t want to hear you say you don?t want me no more 
I refuse to blame, you for anything or me for anything 
Lets not take finding each other in vain its not a coincidence baby 

Verse 3:
You know, damn well, you?re suppose to be in my life
Riding by my side (Oh yeah yeah)
You know, damn well, you?re suppose to be coming home to me every night

Baby if you?re not that far away
Maybe we can spend the day
Catch up on all the loving we lost
Let me kiss you in your favorite place

Chorus: 
So I refuse to wait, I don?t think you hear me baby

Urban Species,"Now let me start this, if home is where the heart is
With her I feel at home even when we're apart it's
Strange but I can feel her presence beside me
So in a sense one could say that she guides me
Now I'm remembering the first time I saw her
Feeling this vibe, or whatever, let's say aura
But I never would have thought, see I never could have known
Outta one chance glance all this could have grown
And that's the beauty of it you see it grows and it's natural
What can I say in every way we're compatible
Talk is cheap at times we don't speak
Cos we're engrossed in thoughts that are deep
It's like two hearts, two minds, two bodies, two souls
Making one whole, now it's gotta be told
That what we have is more than just physical
Don't be so cynical, we got a spiritual love

Feels so natural
More than physical
Spiritual love
Feels so natural
More than physical
Spiritual love

We got a love I can trust let me tell you 'bout us
Underline the word love and see it ain't about lust
It's spiritual love oh, what a feeling
Impossible to measure it, one can only treasure it
Sort of like a legacy, maybe it's my destiny
Maybe it's a test of me, to bring out the best in me
Who knows, who cares, all I know is that there's
A reason for everything and whatever fate may bring
See I didn't plan this some don't understand this
They try to play the role of thinking that's what a man is
To me she's more than just a fashion accessory
And I'll protect her by any means necessary

Do I wanna settle down have myself some kids and a wife
I take the dog on walks and have a house with a drive
Then I wonder to myself can I handle that vibe
And then sometimes I wonder if we'll ever be free
Then I wonder if we are but maybe we can't see
I wonder about the youth that's running round with no
direction
And I wonder how to channel making use of that aggression
Yes I wonder what the worlds coming to
And I wonder what it's like ta have no home to go to
You got no roof over your head maybe a park bench as ya bed
And if I wasn't rappin'then I wonder what I'd do instead
Ya see I could be alone or in a crowded place
I get all introspective my mind starts to race
From one place to another strung together like beads
But no you can't stop the process once you've planted those
seeds

Wondering and I'm pondering and I'm thinking

And sometimes I wonder who I am and where I'm going
Is there anything to know if so am I worthy of knowing
I might wonder how and when my life is gonna end
Then I wonder to if I'm gonna come back again
And if I do would I have learnt from the mistakes I've made
Or will I have to carry on till all my debts have been paid
I wonder if there's really such a thing as UFOs
And if they exist I wonder if they're friends or foes
And if they're foes I wonder if they'll ever invade
Can they do a better job than the mess we've made
Like most of us I wonder what's the reason that I'm here
Are dreams a recollection of a whole different sphere

For me ta rock the microphone over beats and breaks
But those anxieties are gone when I hear the competition
Those kids and saying nothing that make me wanna listen
I wonder was it in vain our leaders died
I wonder why some people ain't never satisfied
'Cos no matter what youi got is like you always want more
I wonder, I wonder what's behind the green door
I wonder who shot J.F.K., I wonder what if my mum's OK
You know what I think I'll call her today

Music is my blanket

Emotionless the city lies
Cruel it is, it clouds my eyes
The dull the dark shades on my day

Locked up inside my metal cage
Always tense and filled with rage
Above the concrete fields below
With you i wanna go, wanna go

I see only what i wanna see
I'll be only what i wanna be
My blanket covers me, yes

Now as a yout man I was body poppin' breakin' on the lino
Traded in my lino for a pad and a biro
Used to stand in line just so as I could sign my giro
But now my ends meet in the best way that I know
(Hat, snare, kick) and the beats that go boom
See the music I consume to escape the doom and gloom
All the beats and melodies keep realities at bay
But what happens when the records done and starts to fade away""

Alone within myself again
I try to veil away my pain
The dirty grey surrounding me 'round
And now I hear no sound

""I feel like Melle Mel from way back in the days
As i wonder how i keep from going under
I got trouble on my mind like my name is chuck d
And like Marvin Gaye it makes me wanna holler
When the music hits me I feel no pain

I take the needle off the technics and put it in my vein
All my troubles get crushed as the rush hits my brain
And away goes trouble down the drain""

Where sins are made then buried

Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In,1958
Urbie Green,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1958

I could live without love

Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy

Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With ""Boy thought I told you not to go outside""
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go

About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you

You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (""You nasty boy."")
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1997

Urbie Green Big Band,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""

Gee but I'd give the world to see

Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,2007

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Urfo,"Cause she wouldn't give a guy like me no rap
She was walking down the street so I said ""Hello
I'm Kangol from UTFO."" And she said ""So?""
And I said ""So?!? Baby don't you know?
I can sing, rap, and dance in just one show
Cause I'm Kangol, Mr. Sophisticata
As far as I'm concerned ain't nobody greater
From beginning to end and, to beginning
I never lose because I'm all about winning
But if I were to lose, I wouldn't be upset
Cause I'm not a gambler, I don't bet
I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo.""
I thought she'd be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I'm a sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain't comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

Yo Kangol, I don't think that you're dense
Buy you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high IQ
And she'll take to my rap, cause my rap's the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
So isn't not every, her father's a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an ?electric camp? that wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on the back
That's what you get, it happened to me

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she's a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I'm the debonoir Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak to you if I can
And if I'm correct your name is Roxanne.""
She said ""How'd you know my name?"" I said ""It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, that crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated.""
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said ""You call yourself a doctor?"" I said ""This is true.""
She said ""Explain to me really what doctors must do.""
I said ""This is very rare because I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's enthesiology, opthomology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body.""

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,2006
Uri Caine Orchestra,"There's a time each year
That we always hold dear
Good old summertime
With the birds and the trees'es
And sweet scented breezes
Good old summertime
When your day's work is over
Then you are in clover
And life is one beautiful rhyme
No trouble annoying
Each one is enjoying
The good old summertime

In the good old summertime
In the good old summertime
Strolling through a shady lane
With your baby mine
You hold her hand and she holds yours
And that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsey-wootsey
In the good, old summertime

Oh, to swim in the pool
You'd play hooky from school
Good old summertime
You'd play ""ring-a-rosie""
With Jim, Kate and Josie
Good old summertime
Those days full of pleasure
We now fondly treasure
When we never thought it a crime
To go stealing cherries
With faces brown as berries
In good old summertime

In the good old summertime
In the good old summertime
Strolling through a shady lane

Uriah Heep,"I can see that look that says beware
Try to move in closer if you dare
So I must sit and play my waiting game
And for a while I know she'll do the same
Fly away

Watches like an eagle from its aerie
And like a bird of prey she captures me
But I am older and more wise than you
Bird of prey straight into me you flew
Fly away

Now every time I try to set her free, yeah
I'm glad to say she comes right back to me
But if I knew she didn't want to stay
I wouldn't try to keep that lovely bird of prey",Bird of Prey [American Album Version - Bonus Track] [US Album Version][,1970

See what I have found
A little ways away from here
While digging in the ground

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
It's nothing, just a picture-book
They had before the war

Daddy, daddy, come and see
Daddy, come and look
Why, there's four or five
Little Melinda girls
Inside my picture book

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
There were lots of little girls like you
Before they had the war

Oh Daddy, daddy, come and see
Daddy, hurry do
Why, there's someone
In a pretty dress
She's all grown up like you
Won't you tell me why 

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
That someone is your Mummy
You had before the war

Daddy, daddy, tell me if you can

Uriah Heep,"Grinning demons, smiling sideways
Laughing in my face
Here within my troubled sleep
There's such a lonely place
Running fast but never moving
I can't get away
Strange but realistic objects
Making me their prey

Then it's gone as fast as it came
Evil dream
Changing like the sun turn to rain
It would seem

La la la la la

Dining with the gods of beauty
On a distant shore
Tasting fruits of untold sweetness
Never seen before
Dancing stars with crystal voices
Beckon with their eyes
Unicorn of many colours
Rides to paradise

Then it's gone as fast as it came
Peaceful scene
Changing like the sun turns to rain
It would seem

La la la la la

Sleepless nights that last a lifetime
Crucify my head
Dreams of peace and then disaster
Wish that I were dead
Looking for the end of darkness
Seeking out the day
For escape with speed unthought of
Bearing me away

Then it's gone as fast as it came
Peaceful scene
Changing like the sun turns to rain
It would seem

Come into my dream",Dreammare,1970
Uriah Heep,"You came to me
With all of your lies
And I was taken in so well
It took me quite a time
To see the disguise
You made it very hard to tell
Now here you are again
But you're begging in vain
'Cause I really don't want to know

You came to me
With a little bit of charm
You had me down on my knees
I didn't really think
There was any harm
But all you ever did was tease
You took all the love
That I ever had to give
There was nothing left to show

Well, I remember everything
Everything around me
The long dark of winter
Till the breath of spring
Came close enough to drown me

So I'm gonna keep on trying
Till I feel like dying
And I lay down and pass away
But that won't happen till tomorrow
And by then I can
Borrow another day
So I'm gonna keep on trying",I'll Keep on Trying,1970
Uriah Heep,"Girl, before you go now
There's one thing I wanted to do
That's get you to come back
Because I want to make love to you

Got me real turned on
Yes, you have

But there's something in your eyes
Telling me you have to go
Something in your eyes
But you're trying not to let it show

Got me real turned on

Next time you come over
I'll buy you a bottle of wine

Never, never, never
Shall we fail
Stand up, stand up, stand up

Justice, justice, justice
Will prevail

There in the morning
Flying over the hills
While men are yawning
They are crushed by our wills
Never have I witnessed
People in fear
Not like today
Not in many a year

Go kill another
There are more close behind

""Are you out of your mind""
Though they are shattered
They just don't seem to yield

Uriah Heep,"I'm walking in your shadow
Ever since you went away
And the clock on the wall
Really hasn't very much to say
Oh, you left me bleeding
And left me needing you

In so very many ways
I was trying to attract your mind
But I'm the lonely one
'Cause I've had to leave it all behind

Lied and deceiving
Why should I be grieving you

Ride on a golden wave
Set sail for the sun
Make every cloud your slave
Don't be alone

Like a fool I believed you were true and had no disguise.
There's a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine,
But with tears in my eyes I'm no longer pretending you're mine.

It's the same ugly story of a woman abusing a man.
So I have to forget you though I'm not even sure if I can.

Uriah Heep,"She came to me one morning
One lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind
I know not how she found me
For in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me 
From a fight I could not win
Ah, ah, ah

She asked me name my foe then
I said the need within some men 
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of men or God
And I begged her give me horses 
To trample down my enemies
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life
Ah, ah, ah

But she would not think of battle that 
Reduces men to animals
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end
For she the mother of all men 
Had counciled me so wisely that
I feared to walk alone again 
And asked if she would stay
Ah, ah, ah

Oh, lady, lend your hand, I cried
Oh, let me rest here at your side
Have faith and trust in me, she said and filled my heart with life
There is no strength in numbers
I've no such misconceptions
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away
Ah, ah, ah

Thus having spoke she turned away 
And though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear
My labor is no easier 
But now I know I'm not alone
I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day
And if one day she comes to you 
Drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her as your prize and say hello for me
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah",Lady in Black [#],1971
Uriah Heep,"Cold winds and cloudy skies
Turned to sweetness in her eyes
Fantasies I realized
Came to life to my surprise

Rain came and took her away
Just when I thought
She was here to stay
Sun gone I was left high and dry
Love came by and touched me
And kissed me so long

Shine hard October moon
Eagle take me to her soon
Run swiftly silver stream
Find my love or let me dream

Half of me is all of her
I'd be much happier if I were whole

Leads me to my goal
Leads me to my goal",Poet's Justice,1972
Uriah Heep,"Stand up and fight
Or you'll lose your right
You gotta stand in a line
Fightin' hard to hold on to your mind

Seek and you'll find
Proud words on a dusty shelf
Find and you'll seek
Keep on keep on helping yourself

Put away all battle drums
And stand up and fight

Don't stand in a line
Hold on to your mind",Home Again to You [#][*],1972

On his horse of crimson fire.

Uriah Heep,"Was only seventeen
I fell in love with a gypsy queen
She told me ""hold on""
Her father was the leading man
Said ""you're not welcome on our land""
And then as a foe, he told me to go

He took me to a little shack
And put a whip across my back
Then told her ""leave me""
I was out for quite a time
Came back with her on my mind
Sweet little girl
She means all the world

Ah

Oh, I want my gypsy queen

Does this appear when you're around?
And the deeper in debt
The harder the bet

Your soul away

Is not reading to, reading today

Does the time seem right
For some rethinking?
It seems a gift that you have
Are you living a dream
Of express progress?

Dim and distant voices of the past
And I've seen so far into the night
And lingered in the land of no light

Far beyond the
Shrouded hours of dawn
Through the mist
Of daybreak I was borne
But the day was
Clouded still by night
Leaving me in the land of no light

Though I'd love to
Say hello to you
You might have to wait awhile
To say goodbye
For it must end as it began
And then start again

And lingers while he
Reaches out his hand
And he cannot know how it will end
Till he finds out if he has a friend

Uriah Heep,"In the magic garden
Some were singing
Some were dancing
While the midnight moon
Shone brightly overhead

The stars so gaily glistened
And the sphinx in silence listened to
The magician tell of
Lives that he had led

Let the bells of freedom ring
Songs of love to Friday's king

Let's all go to
The magician's birthday
It's in a forest
But not so far away
Much to do
And so much to say
While we listened to
The orchid orchestra play

Happy birthday to you 
Happy birthday to magician
Happy birthday to you 

Then at the dead of midnight
As we watched the dancing firelight
The air grew cold
And seemed to dull the flame
The fire died
The music faded
Filled with fear of death we waited
For now we knew
Some evil was to blame

I challenge you
I challenge you all
For all you own
And all you know
And I own the powers of darkness
I will steal what is mine

Surrender now or face my spite
I grant you it may be Friday night
But did you know this day
Also numbers thirteen

First I'll give you fire
I turn your fire into a sleepy stream
Yes, now I give you darkness
From your horror I'll create a dream

You cannot fight me
For I have the sword of hate
But one thing you can't see
My answer is simply
An impenetrable fortress
Of love love love 

The fear went as quickly as it came
The air was clear
The fire burned again
The flames leapt
The organ played
The swans sang
To greet the day

But when the vision faded
From this struggle and dream
Suddenly my illusion is diary
I've now discovered what is reality
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
Ive found you

Even if you're only
Even if you're only
Even if you're only
Destined for a while
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine

Ive found you
Even if you're only
Destined for a while
I'll be both most impressions

Standing at the source of the Nile",Sunshine,1973

And my love ever meet
Sweet sweet freedom

What I'm really tryin' to say
Is that I will be around
Should you find that after all
You can't get by
With what you found

Oh, it wasn't just my heart you took
And gently tossed into the sea
Though it's hard to find
The words I need 
I guess it was me

cause I need some place to hide
I done the ranchers daughter
And I sure did hurt his pride

Well, theres a
Hundred miles of desert
Lies between his hide and mine
I dont need no food
And no water, lord
cos Im running out of time

Fightin, killin, wine and women
Gonna put me to my grave
Runnin, hidin, losin, cryin
Nothing left to save but my life

Stood on a ridge
And shunned religion
Thinking the world was mine
I made my break and a big mistake
Stealin, when i
Shouldve been buyin

All that fightin, killin
Wine and those women
Gonna put me to an early grave
Runnin, hidin, losin, cryin
Nothing left to save but my life, life...

So I stood on a ridge
And shunned religion
Thinking the world was mine
I made my break and a big mistake
Stealin, when i
Shouldve been buyin
I was stealin
When I shouldve been buyin
I was stealin
When I shouldve been buyin
Stealin, when i
Shouldve been buyin ..
I was stealin ...

Uriah Heep,"A pilgrim at the gray of dawn
Leaving in the mist of morning
On his journey of goodness
Heaven sent, God blessed

Pilgrim laughing at the world
Spreading joy
At the touch of his hand
Wiping out all the misery
Making love and history

Those of us who don't know war
We shouldn't try to make it
So many did and even more died
Do you think you could take it?

Love lies waiting at my back door
Such a beautiful matter of fact
Life's like an apple
With love as the core
And I'll tell you ‘bout that

Just a man in my prime
Love was there
But I had no time
I was cheered and adored
And I thought fame
Was all the world

Battles won and victory cheers
Were the sounds
I'd heard for years
But the women I really loved
Was losing me
To all this blood

I only knew I had to win
And build a world
Where I was king
But leaders come and leaders go
And that's the truth
I came to know

Love or war I couldn't choose
And so both
I had to lose",Pilgrim (Extended),1973

Blinder than the blind eye

So what of my meaning
What am I trying to say
What of my caution
I'm a man anyway
I'm a man anyway",Blind Eye,1973
Uriah Heep,"I have heard the echoes in the dark
Dim and distant voices of the past
And I've seen so far into the night
And lingered in the land of no light

Far beyond the
Shrouded hours of dawn
Through the mist
Of daybreak I was borne
But the day was
Clouded still by night
Leaving me in the land of no light

Though I'd love to
Say hello to you
You might have to wait awhile
To say goodbye
For it must end as it began
And then start again

The day of darkness
Comes to every man
And lingers while he
Reaches out his hand
And he cannot know how it will end
Till he finds out if he has a friend
A friend",Echoes in the Dark,1973
Uriah Heep,"In the magic garden
Some were singing
Some were dancing
While the midnight moon
Shone brightly overhead

The stars so gaily glistened
And the sphinx in silence listened to
The magician tell of 
Lives that he had led

Let the bells of freedom ring
Songs of love to Friday's king

Let's all go to
The magician's birthday
It's in a forest
But not so far away
Much to do
And so much to say
While we listened to
The orchid orchestra play

Happy Birthay to you 
Happy Birthday to magician 
Happy Birthday to you 

Then at the dead of midnight
As we watched the dancing firelight
The air grew cold
And seemed to dull the flame
The fire died
The music faded
Filled with fear of death we waited
For now we knew
Some evil was to blame

I challenge you
I challenge you all
For all you own
And all you know
And by all the powers of darkness 
I will steal what is mine

Surrender now or face my spite
I grant you it may be Friday night
But did you know this day
Also numbers thirteen

First I'll give you fire
I turn your fire into a sleepy stream
Yes, now I give you nightmares
From your horror I'll create a dream

You cannot fight me
For I have the sword of hate
But one thing you can't see
My answer is simply
An impenetrable fortress
Of love, love, love

The fear went as quickly as it came
The air was clear
The fire burned again
The flames leapt
The organ played
The swans sang
To greet the day
And then we knew that
Love will find love will find love",The Magician's Birthday,1973
Uriah Heep,"It's raining outside
But that's not unusual
But the way that I'm feeling
Is becoming usual
I guess you could say
The clouds are moving away
Away from your days
And into mine

Now it's raining inside
It's kind of a shame
And it's getting to me
A happy man
Why should you want to
Waste all my time
The world is yours
But I am mine

Rain, rain, rain in my tears
Measuring carefully my years
Shame, shame, shame in my mind
See what you've done to my life

See what you've done to my life",Rain,1973
Uriah Heep,"Sunrise
And the new day's breakin' through
The morning
Of another day without you
And as the hours roll by
No-one's there to see me cry
Except the sunrise
The sunrise and you

Tired eyes drift across the shore
Looking for love and nothing more
But as the sea rolls by
No-one's there to see me cry
Except the sunrise
The sunrise and you

Sunrise
Bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again

Sunrise, new day
Hear my song
I'm tired of fightin'
And foolin' around

Uriah Heep,"We told our tales as we sat under
Morning's sleepy sky
With all the colors of
The sunrise shining in our eyes

One, then another
With a story of yesterday's life
Or of a lover who had
Gone in a moment of strife

No thought of sleep ever dwells
Upon the wise man's mind
Some task or audience
Stealing every moment of his time

Thus we have learned to live
While mortal men
Stand waiting to die
How can we do what must be done
In just one short life

And if you ask
Then you must know
If you still doubt
You should be told
It was not we
That made it so
It was by those
Who went before

And there you sit
Tomorrow's child
So full of love
So full of life
But you must rise
To meet the day
Lest you become another tale

Another tale",Tales,1973
Uriah Heep,"Do we live our lives in moderation?
Does this appear when you're around?
And the deeper in debt
The harder the bet
Your thoughts are one of a clown

Look out before you sign
Your soul away
The crystal ball, it seems
Is not reading to, reading today

Does the time seem right
For some rethinking?
It seems a gift that you have
Are you living a dream
Of express progress?
It's just a thought that you have

Oh, you should've know better

As it did for others

Uriah Heep,"I was walking all alone
Through a sideshow
With passion and pain
On each side
Something inside me was calling
For a chance to stay alive

At the time I didn't know
What was calling
As my head was buried in grief
Today I heard what was crying
My freedom calling me

And we all make our choices
Like a blind man feels his way
And the choice
I've made is simple
Passion over pain

When I got to
The end of the sideshow
And looked back
To where I had been
My eyes filled with
Teardrops of loneliness
For the ones
Who will never be fee

I thought of
The children in the sideshow
As they wandered
Around so confused
Some day
They'll make their decision
But which one will they choose

And we'll all make our choices
Like a blind man feels his way
And the choice
I've made is simple
Passion over pain

And we'll all make our choices
Like a blind man feels his way
And the choice
I've made is simple

Framed in magic on the wall

No one knows
What makes this picture
So inviting
To those who stand outside it

Maybe it's the dancers
Or maybe it's the dance
The dancer dances

Thousands fill the gallery
They pay their price to see a dream
They can make believe for free
Two hours' worth of fantasy
Maybe they pretend
The picture's them
Or maybe they just love
To sit and blend

Tonight the picture has no frame
Colours unleash and float away
To each and everyone of you
Tonight the spirit brings the news

Hoping for the sign

Gettin' stronger every day
There ain't nothing gonna stop us
Oh, there ain't no way

It's like a rolling ball of thunder
You know, it's never gonna stop
You know, it's gonna drag you under
See me soaring, thunders roaring
Things afraid again

Stand up, shout it out
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll
Stand up, shout it out
Sell your soul

Stand up, shout it out
Let the music take a hold
Stand up, shout it out
Rock 'n' roll

I got a solid silver reason
I got something you'll never buy
I've spent my life with rock 'n' roll
Oh no, would I lie?

But if you want to taste the freedom
Just let the music take a hold
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll
There's a thunder, see it and wonder
How to play the game, it's easy

It's gonna drag you under
Gonna take your heart and soul
You gotta stand up
You gotta shout, shout, shout, shout, shout it out

Uriah Heep,"He was the wizard of a thousand kings,
And I chanced to meet him one night wandering.
He told me tales, and he drank my wine,
Me and my magic man kinda feelin' fine.

He had a cloak of gold and eyes of fire,
And as he spoke I felt a deep desire,
To free the world from it's fear and pain,
And help the people to feel free again.

Why don't we listen to the voices in our hearts
'cause then I know we'd find that we're not so far apart.
Everybody's got to be happy. Everyone should sing,
For we know the joy of life, the peace that love can bring.

So spoke the wizard in his mountain home.
The vision of his wisdom means we'll never be alone.
And I will dream of my magic night,
And the million silver stars that guide me with their light.",The Wizard [Live][#][*],1983

Uriah Heep,"You're too vain, you're insane
You think the world will stop turning
'cause you ain't around

Blind eyes, cheap lines
You got the whole band playing
But you don't hear the sound
Your venom pen
Will never poison me
I won't be sticking round that long

Corina, what's this talk of glory
Between the sheets in halls of fame
Corina, just a hard luck story
Bratpack fever
Running through your brain

Your fast cars, rock stars
You were seen at the party
But you weren't even there

False name, the same game
Somebody's minding your business
You don't even care
You think it's all
Some kind of circus ride
You think that someone's
Keeping score",Corina [Live][#][*],1989
Uriah Heep,"She told the story
I listened with my eyes closed
So sad but so true
She whispered softly

I asked her why she did so
She knew that I knew
She was a skater
The ice was her second home

The country's finest
Everyone could see
She had a plan

To break across the border
Instead of waiting for
The powers that be

Cry freedom, sweet freedom
Tell the whole world
To get ready
Cry freedom, sweet freedom
Tell the whole world
That we're ready

She said goodnight
But just as I was leaving
A black car came into view
And waiting there
They could hear me breathing
They knew that I knew, cry freedom
 
Insane questions
They asked me what did I know
So strange, they let me go
But more they try
The stronger our love grows
I know that I know, cry freedom

Uriah Heep,"Well, I'm not superstitious
But there's something
Going on inside
Could be friendly, could be vicious
And there isn't any place to hide

It's my imagination
A blessing or a curse
No, I can't ignore it
For better or for worse
It wakes me when I'm sleeping
A thief that takes my breath away

And I find myself
Reaching for a lifeline
Throw me a lifeline and
Bring me back in time
I need a lifeline, throw me a lifeline
I'm going down for the last time

Sometimes I can't control it
Sometimes it isn't there at all
Sometimes I try to roll it
And wind up staring at the wall

I love the games it plays
I get in so deep that I get lost
For days and days
It sometimes leaves me shakin'
Standin' in the dark alone",Lifeline,1989

Nobody's comin', what'd you do that was so wrong?
Look back and turn back, look at yourself.
Don't be afraid just look at yourself.
If you need assistance, or if all you need is love,
There's no point in hiding, tell me what your frightened of.

She wears diamond rings
Knows how to walk
Knows everything
About love, she's not too sure

What she's looking for
Fresh from the woods
Out on the street
She's looking good
Looking so neat
She don't know if she should

'Cause she don't know
If she's bad or good
She don't care if it
Hurts her father
She don't care if it

Breaks her mother

She just wants what
She's never had before
All she wants is love, she's ready

She wants love

All she needs is love
She's gotta have it, someone to love
All she wants is love, she's ready
Gotta have love, she'll get it
All she needs is love

She's never had it, someone to love
She was a school boy's dream
High school queen
She had it all when she was sixteen
Stayed away from boys
'Cause she thought she'd get hurt

Why did she listen to
Her mother's words
Couldn't go out
Had to stay home
And how she hated
Being on her own
She needs love like everybody else
Now she's gonna
Get some for herself
All she wants is love, she's ready

She wants love
And she's gonna get it

Now I'm a free man

I need a new plan
But I've had no loving
For a year and a day
My lady's waiting
Got a taste for her wine
She's wearing money
But none of it's mine
She's been surviving
While I've been wasting away

It ain't quite the same
You can't hide it
I'm onto your game

Rough justice, there's no disguise
And I can tell by
The look in your eyes
Rough justice, I've had my share
I've done my time
But I'm still running scared
Rough justice
Coming down on me
Long arm of the law
Never setting me free
Rough justice, I bide my time

Back in action, I'm riding the crest
And putting all that
I've learned to the test
No complications
Taking it day by day
Freedom of movement
Freedom of choice
Free to be right back here
With the boys
Ready to listen
But you've got nothing to say

If I have a choice
You give it everything
You're selling God
But am I listening?

I hear you've seen the light
Your message comes to me
By satellite
You say I must believe
I say it's just another way
To deceive

If my salvation has anything to do
With your empty promises
And what you think is true
Well, here's my donation
If it's all the same to you

I am the voice on your TV
But I am one, and I am free
Always to say what I believe
I know you're only
A voice on my TV

The numbers on the screen
Will help me get to Heaven
So it would seem
The money flows and flows
And no one cares enough
To know where it goes

Look at all the millions
That you've taken for a ride
With the warmest words
And the coldest heart inside
And how much longer
Can I listen to your lies?

What are all the 
Credit card believers gonna say
When they hear about the scandals
And the lovers that you pay
And all about the meetings
In your secret hideaway?

I am the voice on your TV
But I am one, and I am free
Always to say what I believe
You're just a voice on my TV
Your power's strong, but I am free
Always to say what I believe

I am the voice on your TV
But I am one, and I am free

How can I go home
And not get blown away?

Ain't nobody gonna
Steal this heart away

Set on something
Hope this doesn't mean

Seem so much nearer now

Than I had to offer

That would swear devotion ?
I tried to promise dreams
I would make come true
But you said that love was
A game for children
Here I stand, a fool

Love is blind
Blinded by love

Love is blind

I told myself if there
Was a chance to show you
Just how good a love affair could be
But love was something that
You had never given
I just couldn't see

You never gave me

How you played around
And how well you showed me
How wounded love can be

Behind your untold truths
And so I sit and
Listen to your lonely words
Another reason for you
To be yourself

I can't be wrong for believing in you
'cause this ice is melting
And the waves are breaking through
I see a fire, it's burning
In your heart tonight
There's only one way
For me to forget

All for one, one for all
Strong in heart, body and soul
We were all for one, one for all
All for one, one for all
Nothing could stop us, we had it all
We were all for one, one for all

I always knew
You had dreams of your own
But I can't understand you
So many words, too much to say
And nothing to hold on to
And so another day must end
In this loneliness
Another season
Another time, I guess

All for one, strong in body and soul
All for one, and
Nothing's gonna stop us

Make my life sunny for a day
Road that leads to nowhere
Please stop your crying
I ain't fit for dying this way

Go steal another with your eye
Go try some other heartless lie

Land of hopeless speaking
Bringing back the moon
Don't play your silly games with me
Oh, war of wasted daydream
What is your need
I'm gonna bleed until you kill me

You've lost all sight of your direction
You're only looking for the next one
The next one to kill

Ashes of destruction
Spread out so far
Blackened others crying over me
See a one time city
Now just a scar
Tears of the flower man
Fill the sea

Give me a chance to fly away
There's nothing here for me today
Today

That this isn't the end

Messing up your mind

And I need you
Then it means I am yours
Yes, I belong to you

But I just can't be certain
That you love me too
Well, I've got to know
If I can believe in you
Please believe my heart is yours

In the court of kings I look around
My blood runs cold, I close my eyes
Out of my head a vision flows
I'll make the rules I need
For my survival, for my survival

I pull the strings, you take the glory
I load the gun, you shoot me down
I'm on the edge about to fall
Destructive power will make you
Lose your mind, use your mind

Trapped inside my nightmare
You are there
As I turn I feel your evil stare

We give our life, invest in time
To only fools who take control

Against the odds I fight
For my survival, for my survival

Into the ground

To turn it all around

Been travelling this road for so long
My eyes are tired but I carry on
The sun lays down it's golden threads
I need a place to rest my head
Although I am far from home now
My soul's with you

It's hard to be out here on my own
So far away, so far from home
I need to touch and feel your skin
To live this dream in sleep again
Although I am far from home now
My soul's with you

So dream on, dream on
Freedom comes with timeless sleep
Dream on, dream on
In the arms of night
Your silent shadow gently speaks
Dream on, dream on

This hotel room's a lonely place
It's a one night cell I must escape
So I drink away my loneliness
So I can sleep and dream again
Although I am far from home now
My soul's with you

And as I fall into
The darkness of the night
You come to rescue me to
Shield me in your light
I feel your touch
The softness of your skin
You hold me close before
The day breaks in
This dream's so true
My heart it beats, it beats
It beats for you, for you

Although I am far from home now
My soul's with you

So dream on, dream on
Freedom comes with timeless sleep
Dream on, dream on
In the arms of night

So dream on, dream on

You say her love has gone forever
And something has
Gone from your soul
It's left you so cold
Though you wish
You had the answer
The question is always untold
Always on hold
What's in the mirror
What do you see

It's a logical progression
When you think that
You lost all that time
It's all in your mind
What's in the mirror
What do you see

Lay down now and close your eyes
It's only just begun
'cause mind and body
Flow in perpetual motion
Set free all your memories
They're tearing you apart
'cause you know that
Love is the only direction

That reputation that you live by
Says something about what's inside
Nowhere to hide
There is no amount of heartache
That could ever
Wash over this burning
Forever learning
Look in the mirror
Will you do it all again

You got time on your side
You know you'll find
The truth within you
You got time on your side
As the seconds tick away
Love is waiting for you
You got time on your side

You say her love has gone forever
And the image has left you so cold
Still in your soul
There's no way
You're gonna turn back
You'll never wash over this burning
Forever learning
Look in the mirror
Will you do it all again

Lay down now and close your eyes

This is our world, our future
These are our times
I believe we have to see
In silence there's no mystery

The world is so busy talking
What do they know
They're missing out on being alive
Words are turning into lies

We're looking for love to guide us
What do we know
The truth is never to be told
It's waiting there inside your soul

The innocent join
In fighting so easily
In a world of pain and war
Who knows what they're fighting for

What they're fighting for
Oh, what they're fighting for
What they're fighting for

Many rivers running out to sea
One heart with a cry for love
Many dreamers in a moonlit sky
One sigh and they are gone

Love is the only direction
That leads to truth
Knowing in your heart what's right
You'll walk upon the sea of light

There's something
In love and silence
That you can find
Know yourself and all around
Listen to the only sound

She dances on the seven seas
Dances on the ocean
Sunlight on her golden hair
Shapes of pure emotion
Her voice is heard like
Crystal words across the sky
She moves just like an angel
She's the mistress of all time

Her sun pours down like liquid gold
To chase away the sorrows
Her clothes are like a million stars
Made of tears and rainbows
And all the while
Her senses smile into my life
She moves just like an angel
She's a mistress of all time

Just like the restless
To a mission bell
I must run to her
Meet her everywhere
As her music fills the universe

She leaves the dancing visions
Of her image on the water
And precious stones upon the shore
From every distant corner
Like diamonds in the light
They shine beyond the stars
She moves just like an angel
She's the mistress of all time

She dances on the seven seas
Dances on the ocean
Sunlight on her golden hair
Shapes of pure emotion

Her tears are like a rainbow

Uriah Heep,"Ain't it strange
That when you're lonely
And your friends they're not around
So you make your big decision
Get your feet back on the ground

When you're down
And no one wants you
And you wonder who you are
When your friends
They don't desert you
When you make it you're a star

But I'm gonna stay
Free and easy
I know just what I am
I'm gonna be free and easy

Well, I've been through
All the heartaches
And I've been through all the pain
But when you're up and riding high
Everybody stakes their claim

Uriah Heep,"Passing through the arms of Satan
Reaching for the hands of God
Robbing every mind for wisdom
Running so he won't get caught
He's outlawed by majority
Been branded all his life
Some say that he's a sinner man
As he rides from day to night

He's a bad man, so they say
Living for his love and living free
Riding swift and secretly
So he'll miss the hanging tree
Wounded spirit on the wind
Riding to his dream and destiny

He's laughing at the wanted posters
Calling for his friends to see
Laughing aloud as he rides away
Kicking up the dust with speed
Time hands him down a pathway
And freedom is a horse he rides
Glory is a dream he's after
And fortune is his heart's delight

Riding swift and secretly
So he'll miss the hanging tree
Wounded spirit on the wind
Riding to his dream and destiny",The Hanging Tree,1996
Uriah Heep,"I was born an only boy
Away from palm of water
Never heard of right or wrong
I was given words to use
But I knew I was different
They wanted me to play along

Locked away inside me
Will all these words
Disguise my pain
When all your scriptures fell
And leave us in the open
I will survive and try again

Here comes the holy roller
Here comes the book of life
Don't come knockin' round here

Make the move this time

Don't know where to turn
And it ain't easy
But you take the chance

Yes, to learn
That it ain't easy when you
Don't know where to turn
And it ain't easy, so you take a look
Another look at life, look at life

In the palm of your hand
And it's not what you'll get
From another man
That will last you

Lightning cracks the sky
Hear a lonely cry, eyes full of pain

Searchin' in the darkness
Eyes pierce the night
Calling for her young one
As she walks towards the light

It's the night of the wolf
Hear the cry of the wolf

Streets paved with gold
Night gives out a warning
There's thunder in her heart
And mother wolf is calling

Searchin' in the shadows
For the one she must save
She cries out a prayer
Like a song from beyond the grave

The bells will toll
No one will sleep tonight
While she alone will
Walk the streets tonight

Sun begins to rise
All the streets washed with rain
Still hear her cries
Eyes burnt with pain

Betrayed by the night
Screaming for her young one
As she walks towards the light",Night of the Wolf [#],1996
Uriah Heep,"I feel you trying
Though in my heart I know you're lying
And though your love for me is dying,
I see you crying

It's the pain of your secret heart
Bringing you to tears, filling you with fears
For your mind and for your soul.

I touch you softly now,
Born on by hope until the end, somehow.
I am a man and I must keep my vows,
I must go on.

But the wall of your secret heart
Keeps my distance clear, 
Helps my footsteps fall
Back in line inside my mind.

What's the use? You turned me loose
And left me here to cry.
Where's the love we talked about?
Where's my sunny sky?

Secret hearts and sorry tales
Will never help love grow,
Spread your wings my daunted soul,
The time has come to go.

I will not be hurried down
Or blackened by you lies,
I must go and find my dreams
And live in paradise.

Where's the love we talked about?
Where's my sunny sky?

What do you think I am? Do you think I'm dreaming?
Don't you know I know what it is you're scheming?
Who did you think gave you the right,
Hidden by the dead of night,
To take the world and turn it upside down,
When it should be round?

It seems I made it just in time
To use my reason and my rhyme
To save us from the evils of your mind.

I will cast the spell, be sure I cast it well.
I will light a fire, kindled with desire.

I'll fill you with fear so you'll know I'm here
And I won't be treated like a fool.
It's no good you pretending there'll be no happy ending,
I'm alive and darkness is my tool.

But when the night is over
And daytime steals your cover,
The goodness of the morning sun
Will warm away what you have done
And leave you cold.

I have no need for moonlight,
You're wrong to trust in sunlight.
For I exist not just in storms,
But in life itself, in so many forms
To leave you cold.

I will leave you now, but you won't defeat me.
You had best beware when you come to meet me.
Love and truth will follow me,
An army of reality,
Brought from every corner of the world.

You will never break the spell.
I summon all the fires of hell
And this is my advice for what it's worth

Let us not begin, this fight we cannot win.
Be sure you're watching me;
'Cause all through your life,
Every day and every night
You should know that I'll be watching you....",Paradise/The Spell,1996

We'll call it crime

Or a figment of
Someone's imagination

To live from day to day
To make each passing way

Uriah Heep,"Waiting by the window
Staring at my shadow
Not believing what I'd seen
Touching but not feeling
And wondering what I was dealing
And not knowing where I'd been

So I began walking
To myself I was talking
But didn't know which way to go
Then I found a direction
And now I needed some action
But I should have just said no
Should have said no

Why won't you help me
Or give me hand
'Cause I'm close to becoming
A suicidal man
What I need is someone
With a definite plan
For I've waited for just about
As long as I can

Suicidal man, suicidal 

So on my travels
Still with all my troubles
I found someone who cared
The answer was so easy
That all she did to please me
Was to say a problems smaller

Searching my land
For an enemy
Came across
Love's sweet cost
And in the face of beauty
Evil was lost

Sky full of eyes
Minds full of lies
Black from their cold hearts
Down to their graves
Murdered the dawn
Spreading their scorn
Cursing the sun
Of which love was born

And count the cost in sorrow

Among the sacred rocks and stones
Let me look in vain belief
Upon the beauty of each leaf

There is green in every blade
The tree tops lean providing shade
Maypoles spin in happy sound
All nature's strength around

And there's a horse that feels no pain
Its iron strength to take the strain
Children rock it to and fro
And gaily drink its colour-glow

Above, the sky, devoid of cloud
Thinks not to cast a thunder shroud
Upon this place so full of joy
A field of gold of loves employ

So, why my heavy heart? You say
When tears would stain
The sights so gay

Until he died at the hand
Of needless war",The Park,1998

Has been torn in half

I can feel your touch
Across the miles tonight

On the road again will it always be
That the dream has changed
On its way to reality
Oh but the thought of you
Strange how it pulls me through
Across the miles tonight

And I am sending you this message
Through the wires tonight
Just close your eyes and hold on tight
And here I am concentrating girl
With all my might
Now the sound of your laughter
Trails off through the midnight sky

As the miles go by cities come and go
When you close your eyes
And listen to the radio
Girl can you hear my song
The signal is clear and strong
Across the miles tonight

Amongst the saints and sinners
There are those that we can see
And those no longer with us
To take that walk again
With someone you were close to
On stage in the other world tonight
And there are many
Who will say it's speculation
We need to focus on
The sleeping generation
The healing vision
That extends beyond the pain
Will take you there and back again
I can remember
You were no stranger
As you came to me
Dreamers walking
And in that moment
Between two worlds
I saw the furthest star
Exploding all around you
And through the journey
You spoke in silence
And you made it clear
Walk in peace now
Then you touched me
Revealing all upon your way
Inside the burning fountain of timeOf time ...
A time so real as the one
We share each day
The same dimension
Just a heartbeat away
In every part of you
There's so much exploration
Out on the edge of space and time

The cards are in your favour
We don't need no magic ride
To take you far away

'cause everything in life
Will tell you something
Yeah everything in life can set you free

Can you remember a distant dream
That holds your real attention
You don't need a preacher's word
To know what's going on
The secret is all aboard
The wings of your perception

Stand up and fight your troubled mind
Wait no longer
See the power in your life

Lost in self importance

Can see this mystery
Jump into the twilight world
And gather your awareness

From what I said to you
I'm drinking my forgiveness

Showing me something
Deeper then deep in my soul

And it makes me feel like
I'm at the point of no return - feels like
I'm at the point
It makes me feel like
I'm at the point of no return - feels like
I'm at the point

I was drifting through the days
With nowhere else to turn
I finally discovered
How much I have to learn
I shouldn't be afraid
For you to bring my love
Taking me somewhere
Deeper than deep in my soul

This time my heart will lead the way
To win the game you'got to play

You love me like a lover
I see it in your face

No need to run the race

But you're driving me insane
Telling me something

Pushing down on me
Can't face the world
Can't change the things I see

Staring at the walls
Can nobody help me
To escape from it all

I hear voices in my head
They taunt me
Can't lock them out
Inside my thoughts
They breathe in me
I got my hands in my pockets
Screaming at the walls
Can nobody help me
To escape from it all

I've got to run to be free
Break the chains round my heart
Take away the pain and the joy
Release the man from the boy
Run to be free, run from the heart
Life will take you where it goes

You can offer me salvation
Feed me when I call
Don't talk to me of sanity
When I'm not quite here at all

I've touched the sun
I felt it's warmth in me
So you will never take away my dignity
Cause I've got my hands in my pockets
Fighting for my cause

To escape from it all

Break the chains round my heart
Life will take you where it goes
Run to be free
Run from the heart

Uriah Heep,"When our hearts were young
We put our hands into the flames
Felt the heat from our emotions
We had fire in our veins
All those night we'd spend
Alone in your room
Though my silent thoughts
I still remember

We would use the power of love
Free our souls in endless love
We would sacrifice
Our hopes and dreams
Because without love
Our world would surely die

When our hearts were young
We never thought that
Life would change
Now the seasons go on
Oh why do we shelter from the rain
And all those nights we'd spend
Alone in your room
Through my silent thoughts
I still remember

When our hearts were young
We had fire in our veins
And each time we touched
We'd melt in the flames
When our hearts were young
We knew pleasure, we knew plain
But each time we kissed
We'd burn in the flames
Feel the fire in our veins

When our hearts were young ...

They will see us ride
But if they cared to look
Then they would see
It's just our return to fantasy
Fantasy, fantasy ?

Travelling faster than lightening
Closer than ever before
We can go on for you
And take you nearer to
The legend of mystery
From the beginning of time
Dreaming... time ... dreaming
We can return to
The land of the good and the kind
Time... dreaming... time... dreaming
Why don't you come to our party
And open your minds

In another place
There's a newer face
Like an unfinished painting
Your creator is waiting
The brush and pen describe
What it is inside
That will set your mind thinking
While the others are sinking",Return to Fantasy [75],2004

And I chanced to meet him one night wandering.
He told me tales, and he drank my wine,

He had a cloak of gold and eyes of fire,
And as he spoke I felt a deep desire,
To free the world from it's fear and pain,
And help the people to feel free again.

'Cause then I know we'd find that we're not so far apart.
Everybody's got to be happy. Everyone should sing,
For we know the joy of life, the peace that love can bring.

Uriah Heep,"A masquerade of dancing shadows
Appear before me
Through my mystic window
And soon to be seen
I saw presented
Became a vision that
I saw resented
I stood and watched
Its image changing
The unseen hand was rearranging
And all the time I wondered
How did it wind

Slowly, surely it unfolded
Its simple lines just as
A pole wind told it
A temporary revolution
My problems rose and fell
With a lapse of illusion
My mind was telling me, don't fight it
It's just a hazard in the night
Don't do those
Who've lost their way
It's a masquerade

Masquerade, it's a masquerade ...

Uriah Heep,"I was waiting for somebody
This afternoon
Hope that she remembered
Our rendezvouz
And when she didn't show
Just like yesterday
I do the last, I'll find another way
One night I saw the stranger
Across the hall
I knew he was the reason
Why she didn't call
I wish I had imagined
Or dreamt the lot
But the heart didn't choose
The pain I've got
Now she' turning me inside out
Upside down
And me heart is all a roundabout
Spinnin' round
She's turnin' me inside out
Inside out
She's turnin' me inside out
Inside out
Now he's got all so melt
With a diamond ring
And she was thinking through
Almost anything
She's like a shadow going up
Seventh avenue
But so what, she's only going
Where she's didn't to
I just got one thing to say
Just before I go
Since he was the offender
I want her to know
Now my mind has got me the day
I'm watching to
I'll never raise a thought
Of what she'd done

That's when I heard
The little birds sing
The day I first met my love

Away with the day
Till the day became dawn

Laughed at the rain

As well the stars would sing

Before it starts, before I begin
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like

Where to, where do I go?
If you've never tried then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll stop before I can stop
Or before I see things the right way up

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground

Ideas that you'll never find
Or the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Or Japan and China, all lit up

The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it then you'll understand

Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent, ooh

Uroyan,"T Music. Tony. ¿Que paso? Uroyan. Esto es mi biografía. Esto es mi vida.

Desde chamaquito yo escribía letra bendecida

Poesía de la calle donde yo me amanecía
Mi viejita me decía que eran cosas mías
Que estudiara, y que lo agradecería

Pero los sueños son una inquietud que tienes que cumplir
Por eso yo con mi colega me sentaba a escribir
Y luego fuimos a grabar nosotros nuestro primer demo
Y allí nos encontramos con el primer truquero

Que teníamos que invertir. Nos quería producir
Que le diéramos 2, 000 pa' salir en un CD
Coño, pa' ese tiempo yo tenía 15 años
Pero algo me decía éste tipo te está engañando

Y así arranque. Pero los 2, 000 no los pague
Lo que el hacía yo observe y por mi cuenta lo imité
Bregando pa' mi mismo mejoré. A producir yo comencé
Luego me comienzo yo a mover

A través de todo ese tiempo yo hago mis conexiones,
Se les hacía difícil ver que hacíamos pistas y canciones.
Y a veces nos invitaban pa' cantar en partysones
Pero todavía no nos invitaban pa' producciones

Fuimos por la isla entera haciendo apariciones
Guisos que nos conseguían nuestros manejadores
Personas que aparecían pa' aprovecharse de dones
Cabrones, nos pagaban con felicitaciones

Comienzo mi demo, con pal' de canciones
Con mi colega pero este comete par de errores
Este se quiere gansear todas las conexiones
Después que lo consideraba mi brother

Pero eso es parte de, yo solo le quiero meter
A la fanaticada entretener
Mas que por dinero, yo lo hago por placer
Pero si doy un palo viene bien

Anyway, seguí adentrándome a el ambiente musical
Pues me enteré que hay una criatura por llegar
A mi familia todo se lo quiero dar
¿Pero como los voy a sustentar?

Sigo produciendo pa' mi, pa' los demás
Pero, subo los precios y todos se quitan
No es que me quiera lucrar
Si no que ahora hay mas bocas que alimentar

Nace mi bebo y los huevos se ponen a peseta
Todavía no he llegado a mi meta
Que sería de mi si no fuera por el Plan 8 o la Beca
Unos Cupones, Reforma o WIC que me resuelvan

Ahora si que las cosas se ponen feas
Pues con mi esposa, no paran las peleas
Nuestro estatus económico, más otros problemas
Hacen que nuestro amor se muera

Ahora ademas de que sufro, de una inmensa soledad
Tengo una pensión que pasar
Mi cheque éste mes, por poco y no me da
Son muchas las deudas las que tengo que pagar

Mi sueño sigue en pié. Siguen las esperanzas
Pero la pichaera ya me cansa
Te miran a los ojos y te prometen cosas falsas
Pa' mi que lo hacen con venganza

Juran que son humildes y a fuego
Pero si es así saca un minuto pa' escuchar mi demo
Sinceramente ya en ninguno creo
Para mi nadie le mete tan bueno

Mejor le meto yo.

Uroyan. Tony Music. T Music. Sonando Duro. Desde La Bóveda. El Mixtape. Uroyan

Esto es pa' to' los chamaquitos que, al igual que yo, están comenzando en esta pendejá.
Saben que tienen talento. Saben que le meten más que muchos de los que están.
Pero, por la pichaera, siguen cerrándote las puertas.
Cualquiera se desmotiva viviendo esta situación.
Pero con la perseverancia lograremos llegar adonde queremos estar.

Uroyan",Biografía,2007
Uroyan,"Llegó la hora
La que tu esperabas
El momento perfecto para llegar a mi cama
Tu sabes que estoy loco yo por ti
Yo quiero hacerte mía al fin
Saciar la pasión, saciar las ganas
De amanecer juntos en la mañana

Besándonos, acariciándonos
Tocándonos, quiero sentir tu cuerpo
Besándonos, acariciándonos
Tocándonos, mai, no tengas miedo, yo seré tu dueño

Recuerdo cuando yo te conocí en aquel lugar
Yo no podía pararte de mirar
Quería que fueras mía y de nadie mas
Tu notaste mi mirada y te pusiste mal
Yo a veces me pregunto porqué a mi me ha pasado
Porqué será que yo te quiero aquí a mi lado
A lo mejor fue un deseo carnal
Y te aseguro, de mi instinto me dejé llevar
Te toqué, te tenté te rocé
Y cuerpo a cuerpo nos pudimos envolver
En una noche de pasión desatamos
Fiera salvaje amándose lado a lado

Besándonos, acariciándonos
Tocándonos, quiero sentir tu cuerpo
Besándonos, acariciándonos
Tocándonos, mai, no tengas miedo, yo seré tu dueño
Yo seré tu dueño
(Yeah, yeah)

Tu mirada con la mía choco aquella vez
Recuerda, como los labios a ti te besé
En aquella noche fría, luego paso a ser todos los días
Que mis ojos contemplaban ver tu desnudez
Tu cuerpo con el mío provocaron un calor intenso
Esto fue iniciado por un sencillo beso
Nuestra energía descargábamos en sexo
Pasión prohibida, producida sin ningún receso

Nos sorprendieron los rayos del sol
Cuando amaneció. Cuando estábamos en plena acción
Nuestro deseo nunca se desvaneció
Mas bien se intensifico, con nuestra pasión

Besándonos, acariciándonos
Tocándonos, quiero sentir tu cuerpo
Besándonos, acariciándonos
Tocándonos, mai, no tengas miedo, yo seré tu dueño
Yo seré tu dueño (Yeah, yeah)

Y todavía no te puedo hacer na'
Cómo te puedo demostrar que tú eres especial
Las demás no tienen nada que buscar
Por eso te invito a que te sientas cómoda
Lo que aquí pase aquí mismo va a quedar
Sé que te han hecho daño en el pasado
Pero soy otra cosa eso está más que demostrado

Así que ven, acompáñame
Vamos para mi habitación

Mamita, eres tú la única que llena mis expectativas
Y estando a tu lado me siento lleno de vida
No digo estas palabras simplemente para ganar
Comprendería si me dices que hay que esperar
Pero va acaba, y es que yo te tengo muchas ganas
Quiero ya tenerte en mi cama, decídete
No esperemos más otro mañana
Que el deseo hoy es que nos llama, atrévete

Así que ven, acompáñame
Vamos para mi habitación
Hoy te invito a dar el paso
Y juntos hagamos el amor

Se ve de lejos. Brilla en esta oscuridad
Y solo falta el pacto de miradas pa’ poderla yo ganar
Y es que ella lo debe notar de que alguien la está mirando
Aunque para ella no debe ser algo raro
La belleza que tiene me tiene delirando
No debo ser el único que por esto está pasando

Como vivir ésta condena
Alejado de mi amor
Quiero sentir cerca su corazón
Y sus besos llenos de pasión

Que la distancia no nos va a separar
Que juntos vamos a estar

Paso largas horas en el día queriendo abrazarte
No sabes como me siento al no poder besarte
Me estoy volviendo loco al no poder mirarte

En mi corazón yo a ti te guardaré

Tenerte cerca es mi deseo

Amémonos, como los lobos le aúllan a la luna con pasión

Sintiendo calor. Desatando emoción
Tu quieres conmigo
Yo quiero contigo

Dime porque te quieres envolver
Tenía miedo que esto pasara
Que a mi cama te aferraras

Éste es el momento para hacer lo deshonesto en mi casa
Pues ella hoy llega tarde. Los niños están en clase
Hoy me voy hasta abajo pase lo que pase
Es nuestro único chance así que no te atrases

Espero que no te envuelvas. No llegues en esa fase
Sabes que estoy jugando fuera de base
Y como te hablo claro. Yo no ando con disfraces
Espero que no causes que mi relación se desenlace

Ella llegó a casa de Don Juan con ropa provocativa
Lista pa' trepársele encima
Perfume en su cuello. Desatando destellos
Pensando que alrededor de ella no hay nada más bello

El la recibe pero con poca labia
""No pierdas más tiempo y ve hacía la cama""
Allí sucedió lo que ella más esperaba
En presencia la fotos de sus hijos y su dama

Dime porque te quieres envolver
Tenía miedo que esto pasara
Que a mi cama te aferraras

Yo no puedo estar contigo
No puedo decir que soy tu amigo
Si no entiendes lo que digo
Esto solo fue un día de castigo

No me explico porqué sales con esto ahora
¿Porque lloras? ¿Porque dices que tu cuerpo me implora?
Rumores alcanzaron a mi señora
Ahora me arrepiento y tu presencia me incomoda

¿Tu no notas que ni cojo tus llamadas?
Te dije desde un principio que no te enamoraras
Yo no dejo a mi familia por nada
No quiero escucharte diciendo que tu me amas

Ahora Don Juan se colma de cargo de conciencia
Se culpa por su impaciencia
Admite que pa' las mujeres tiene poca resistencia
Y que su esposa se merece más decencia

Se aplica lo que su madre siempre le dijo
""No hagas mal si no es bien merecido""
Pudo haber perdido a su esposa y sus hijos
Todo por un acto sin sentido

Dime porque te quieres envolver
Tenía miedo que esto pasara
Que a mi cama te aferraras

Yo no puedo estar contigo
No puedo decir que soy tu amigo
Si no entiendes lo que digo
Esto solo fue un día de castigo

Baila que cuando mueves tu cintura


A mí tú me excitas
Tú a mí me motivas
A que no mire a otra chica

Baila que cuando mueves tu cintura
A mí tú me excitas
Tú a mí me motivas
A que no mire a otra chica bebe, tu eres mi mujer

Que cuando rosas tu cuerpo junto al mío me excito
Que me dirijo al motel luego que salga de la disco
Que tu cuerpo es mío y el mío es tuyo por el momento
Que después de esto no hablaremos por un buen tiempo

Presiento que seré mejor que el hombre de tus sueños
Que en la cama los dos estaremos envueltos
Yo dándote duro, tú recibiendo de mi muro
En tu casa o en mi casa con tu cuerpo yo me curo

Y este es el Uro, also known as ""El Ladies Man""
Pregúntale a las mujeres quien las pone a gozar y a perrear
En la disco se forma el bailoteo
El ambiente es perfecto

Tremendo mujer, me encanta tu cuerpo
Como tú te estás moviendo, la piel que tú estás exponiendo
La ropa que estás exhibiendo, hasta el trago que estás bebiendo
Y yo aquí deseando, tu cuerpo observando

Tu cuerpo yo rozando, me sigo yo pegando
Me sigues provocando, ya me está excitando
Vamos para otro lado, te llevo pa mi cuarto y
Te escucho gritando lo que quiero estar escuchando

Baila que cuando mueves tu cintura
A mí tú me excitas
Tú a mí me motivas
A que no mire a otra chica

Baila que cuando mueves tu cintura
A mí tú me excitas

A que no mire a otra chica bebe, tu eres mi mujer

Baila, no tengan miedo a lo que dicen
Que el party no se acaba hasta que lo avisen
Pues quiero seguir bailando toda la noche
Contigo mujer, contigo y con otras 14

Todas están bien buenas, ahora estoy indeciso
Después de esto vamos pal motel a darte bicho
Lo que a mí me seduce es el rojo de tu gistro
Dime si te lo quito o lo dejo pa' ya mismo

Como ella en la pista explota con mi flow
Ella si que tiene sazón
No hay ninguna como ella. Mira como mueve las caderas
Ella se calienta a la vez que se acelera
Se convierte en fiera si alguien se le pega
En el medio de la pista ella es la que se esmera

Uroyan,"Aquel día
En el que decidí sacarte por completo de mi vida
Me puse a pensar en lo que me decían
Que una chica como tú la pena no valdría
Pero no pensé, a ti me entregué
Nunca imagine como me pagarías
Y mi corazón ya no aguanta un perdón
Pero ya me cansé.

Yo pensaba que tú a mí me amabas
Sin condición yo todo te lo daba
Ya yo no quiero una explicación
Tienes la culpa de la conclusión
Te daba el cielo y tú me reprochabas
No había punto en donde te encontrara
Tu me rompiste es a mí el corazón
Dentro de mí no queda compasión

Pero ya yo adelante las manecillas del reloj
Lo que yo viví contigo atrás se quedó
Y ahora tú regresas como si no pasa nada
Ahora que supiste es que hay otra aquí en mi cama
Y es que contigo yo aprendí lo que es amor y lo que es sufrir por él
Con ella yo aprendí a creer en él y quise verlo crecer
Ahora que lo mencionas, no, no quiero volver
Lo que sentía por ti lo abandone el ayer

Tú no sabes que se siente cuando el corazón se rompe
Cuando amas a alguien y nadie te corresponde
No te mereces otra oportunidad
Con la misma piedra no me vuelvo a tropezar

Yo pensaba que tú a mí me amabas
Sin condición yo todo te lo daba
Ya yo no quiero una explicación
Tienes la culpa de la conclusión
Te daba el cielo y tú me reprochabas
No había punto en donde te encontrara
Tu me rompiste es a mí el corazón
Dentro de mí no queda compasión

Ya veo la luz, veo un nuevo amanecer
Contigo lo que veía eran ilusiones crecer
Dicen que el amor es ciego y ya yo me cansé
Tu mentiras yo las protagonicé
Pero sigo tranquilo, con mi frente en alto
El error que cometí no seguiré arrastrando
Ahora vivo mi vida, con esta bella dama
Que me sano del sufrimiento que por ti yo albergaba

Tú no sabes que se siente cuando el corazón se rompe
Cuando amas a alguien y nadie te corresponde
No te mereces otra oportunidad
Con la misma piedra no me vuelvo a tropezar

Aquel día
En el que decidí sacarte por completo de mi vida
Me puse a pensar en lo que me decían

No sé porque tú te niegas, tú sabes, quiero hacerte mi muñeca
Completamente, toda mía, hacerte 1000 piruetas
Pero como puedo ver, chica tú te vas
Pero como quiera conmigo tú te vas
Yo no me doy por vencido
Me acerco y te digo al oído cosas que en verdad no tienen ni sentido
Que tengo veinte carros que tengo cinco casas
Y tú te volteas y me dices: “¿que te pasa?”
Y es que yo quiero ganarte, no sabes cuánto quiero devorarte
Como un perro su comida cuando tiene hambre
Con lo poco que tengo mucho placer darte
Sé que voy a lograr enamorarte.

Ella va detrás del billete
Buscando un hombre que sea un alcahuete, ya tú sabes, para el cachete
Tiene un piquete y cree que todo se lo merece
El que más le pueda dar a ella prevalece
Cuando amanece ya no sabes más de ella
Y el único recuerdo que te deja son sus deudas
Cuida su reputación, ella se las inventa
Dicen que ella es bella pero el resto del bella no te lo cuentan
Mami no quiero incomodarte
No quiero molestarte
Sé que horita dije que quería enamorarte
Pero en realidad lo que quiero es esbaratarte.

Simplemente, estamos demostrando otra vez, que nosotros sí somos la diferencia",Dale Volumen,2011
Uroyan,"Hoy se cumplen tres años desde que ya no te veo con vida
Yo pensaba que esta situación tenía salida
Hice lo que podía, no esperaba lo que venía

La muerte llegó tu puerta y mi madre sufría

Yo no creía que esto, pasaría tan pronto
Dime cómo esta tristeza llevo al fondo
Pero no voy a llorar ni una lágrima más
Papá, ojalá descanse en paz

Tu alma está ascendiendo hacia el reino de los cielos
Donde no existe tristeza donde todo es eterno
Pero aquí en la tierra donde somos mortales yo no entiendo
Porque ha pasado tanto tiempo y síguete sufrimiento

La vida no es la misma, algo no está correcto
¿Con quien puedo hablar si me aborrezco?
Pa', tú sabías de esto mi existencia se ha hecho un proyecto
Quiero consejos tuyos no del resto.

Tan poco tiempo ha pasado
Y tantas cosas que han sucedido
Pero lo que todavía no he logrado entender
Porque aún no he aceptado que ya no sigues vivo

Cómo le digo adiós si en realidad no quiero
Cómo aceptar que nada es eterno
Tu recuerdo vive en mi, no lo puedo olvidar
No puedo aceptar la realidad

Son muchas las cosas que tú me enseñaste
Como a luchar y echar pa' lante
Que estudiara y que fuera cantante
Desde la tierra de orgullo voy a llenarte

Por mi cabeza han pasado pensamientos negativos
Pa' envolverme y salirme de mi camino, pero
Recuerdo lo que de ti he aprendido
Que hay que luchar pa' que lo obtengas sea merecido

Y hasta el sol de hoy esa siempre ha sido mi filosofía
Y con la frente en alta dando cara al día día
Los problemas siempre serán parte de tu vida
Pero hay que afrontarlos con coraje y valentía

Me he hecho un hombre a fuerza de los cantazos
Ya no tengo el maestro que vigilaba mis pasos
Aquella persona que me llevaba del brazo pero pa' lante
No permitiré los retrasos

Fue doloroso presenciar tu partida, pero
Sé que nos encontraremos algún día
Sabes que acá tienes alguien quien te admira
Te quiere, Uroyan y la familia

Todavía no he terminado mi labor en la tierra
Así que échame la bendición
Que el camino es largo.

No soy de los alicates

Tengo el talento pa barrer con el escombro de cantantes
Que no dan la talla, su disfraz le queda grande
Ha. Muchos son unos cobardes
Riman pal de cosas y duran que están bien alante

Pero este humilde hijo de Puerto Rico
Canta no porque quiere gastar saliva
Mientras muchos se enfocan en hacerse ricos
Yo canto porque en realidad estás mi vida

Yo he recorrido todas las vías, mi hermano
Si fuera carro ya hubiese borrado el marca millas
¿Qué te parece? En esto yo no llevo un pal de meses
Yo llevo años pero mi destino lo decide el de allá arriba

Me digo ser prepa porque en este mundo feca donde hay tantas chuletas
Creen que son doctores en la materia
Lo que ellos no saben es que con mis cualidades y con mis habilidades
A mi me sobra la beca

Ya lo que vivimos no se puede volver a repetir
Y todo fue por ti
Yo no dudaba que me amaras
Pero ya me enteré que sólo con mi corazón jugabas
Yo juraba que era amor, tan sólo era atracción
Estaba ajeno a la situación
Y todo se esfumó cuando me enteré de la verdad
El saber que aún solo hombre no puedes amar
Y me encantaban todos los momentos que pasé contigo
Pero con lo acontecido todo se fue al piso
Y a pesar de tu decisión no te paro de extrañar
Algún día entenderás que no me supiste valorizar

¿Porque tú me tuviste que engañar?
Miro hacia atrás y no puedo escapar de la realidad
Fuera de lo normal yo te ame, mujer
Todavía recuerdo el momento aquel, de su boca me enteré
¿Y no tienes nada que decir?
No lo puedo creer después que confía y yo en ti
Y, no tienes ni que disculparte

Se me ha hecho bien difícil olvidarte

No te tiraba porque eras como mi hermano

Ahora me doy cuenta que eres sólo un gusano
Tú vas lástima, por eso te han ayudado
Yo lo poco que he logrado es porque sólo he brillado

No he logrado nada comparado con lo que ha hecho tu
¿Pero verdad que he mejorado mucho más que tú?
Pa' que yo quiero tu medalla que es de bronce
Si la mía es de platino y viene coming soon

Todo el que me ayudado a quedado mal
O me ha querido regalar lo que me he querido ganar
Solito a la cima voy a llegar
No dependo de ningún charro que más apagao' no puede estar

Y mira, en verdad, contigo, socio no me la quería apuntar
Pero pediste cacao, ahora tienes que aguantar
Ni que tú fueras mujer mía para yo tener que explicar
Porque fue que contigo yo deje de trabajar

No es que yo sea un traidor, es que tú eras un truquero
¿No te acuerdas, cabron?
No le mientas al pueblo, tú no eres mi obsesión
No me faltes el respeto si me pides la bendición

Lo mío es hacer música, no hacer el aguaje
No sigas tratando. ¿Tú no ves que no te sale?
Tú fuiste el peor alumno de toda mi clase
Por más que trataba nunca caía en la base

Yo sí que soy calle, tú te crees que es chiste
Tu debut y despedida sí que está triste
Cuantas copias vendiste?
Este cohete te pasó por el lado y ni cuenta te diste

Yo sé que tú estás loco porque yo te paute
Tú sabes que yo soy el que reparte, y en la música te parte
Quieres un consejo a la mente
Arréglate el frenillo que mucho te ha de ayudarte

Tú me das lástima desde siempre
Siempre que me escuchas causó que tu culo cierre
No es que a mí me entretiene
Pero te estoy demostrando lo que esté negro tiene

Y eso a ti te hiere. ¿Dime quién está en depresión?
¿Dime quién carajo vive en la imaginación?
Tú eres el actor de ciencia-ficción
Ofreciendo una agresión sin tomar acción

No me dediques todas tus canciones
Porque escribiendo con sangre necesitarás de transfusiones
No me menciones
No tengo tiempo para ti estoy ocupado en otras cuestiones

Si sigues como vas te seguiré viendo mal
Si sigues como vas nadie te querrá adoptar
Cógelo suave, pa'
¿Como me ves potencial, ahora te va' reguindar?

Ya estoy astiao’ de las pichaeras
Productores, cantautores, también las disqueras
No pueden apreciar que uno si se esmera
Y se desvela haciendo música buena
No crean que lo que yo hago es un mamey
Pues llevo guerreando mucho mas allá del 96
Pero de to’as las puertas que toqué y números que marqué
De ellos no recibí ni un OK.
Hay muchos colegas rankeao’, lo admito, los he admirao’
Pero no tienen el valor de verme pasarle por el lao’
Que paso, cabrones?
Saben que Uroyan es de los mejores

Ya yo me cansé
De que me estén pichando, celulares llamando, ustedes ignorando
Me cansé
De que ustedes se crean que son la gran jodienda, los dueños de la tienda
Me cansé
Si lo que tienen es miedo de verme crecer, no lo pueden creer
Me cansé
Así que muévanse, sálganse del medio que ya llegué

Pichaera por aquí, pichaera por allá
Mira socio, lo único que quiero es cantar
Echar pa’ lante, le meto más cabrón que cualquiera de tus cantantes
¿Tu no entiendes? Ignorante
Productores como ustedes están alante
Pero no le dan la oportunidad a los nuevos cantantes
Chamaquitos con talento que le meten bien violento
Mira mi hermano, yo nací pa’ esto

Entiendo que tengan un monopolio
Pero están en mi territorio
Yo le meto solido, está probado mi repertorio
Los viejos me verán como algo simbólico
La música es mi pasión, no te lo voy a negar
De chamaquito le meto pa’ mejorar
Te he demostrado todo lo que puedo dar
Quieren pal’ de letras mas, aquí está
Ya es tiempo de que nos abran las puertas

Ella a mí me dejó loco
Te juro que la vi y me patina el coco
Quiero tenerla cerca
Y perrearla hasta que amanezca
Ella llega a la disco con un guille cabrón
De sus amigas un corrillo
No es muy buena, mera, su reputación
Pero esta noche termino guayándole el mahón

Mírala, como se maquilla
Se mira en el espejo a las millas.
Sabe que está buena, sabe que está fina
Y que ningún hombre la domina
Se hace dueña de la disco con su porte
No hay hombre que no la note
Desatando furia en su belleza
Utilizando a los hombres con su destreza

Ella antes de salir se preparó y se maquilló
Quería que la miraran y lo logró
De to' su combo, ella fue la que resaltó
No hay ni un hombre que no la miro
Las mujeres la miran, pero por envidia
Ella les pasa por el la’o y se las guilla
Su forma de bailar te llama la atención a las millas
Causándole que se le trepe el autoestima

Mírala, como se maquilla
Se mira en el espejo a las millas.
Sabe que está buena, sabe que está fina
Y que ningún hombre la domina
Se hace dueña de la disco con su porte
No hay hombre que no la note
Desatando furia en su belleza
Utilizando a los hombres con su destreza

En verda', en verda', no me importa tu reputación
Yo lo que busco es acción
Toda la noche con placer te daré satisfacción

Tranquila. Te vas a la segura
Y mira que este negro dura
Yo soy tu cura. No llames a la FURA
Que después viene la amargura

Y mi amor no respetaste
¿Por qué me abandonaste? 
Con otro hombre te largaste
No sé cuál fue la razón
De romperme el corazón
Déjame decirte, esto se acabó

Que simplemente no valían la pena

Que me fueron infieles
Que me fallaron

Tu roce me calienta
Y a ti te pone violenta

Suéltate entera, tu belleza me cautiva
Y me lleva a un estado mental de erotismo
Tu sensualidad causa hipnotismo y yo mismo admito
Que eres la belleza mas grande que yo he visto

Pero en la disco te me pierdes y es difícil encontrarte entre la gente
Ya que el antro está lleno porque hoy yo canto
Tu te alejas de los hombres que causan espanto
Pero yo siempre acierto en el blanco

Y te termino llevando pa' mi cuarto pa' estar dando
Porque esta noche me terminaras amando
Luego recordando lo que había pasado y tu llamando
Pa' que te esté propinando

Tu roce me excita, en la pista me motiva
A que te lleve a otro lado, en mi cama tienes cita
Asista a la disco pa' que te toque perrear con este man
O con el laides, como me quieras llamar

Así que suéltate en la pista (mami)
Suéltate en la disco (mami)
No te hagas la difícil que eso no pega contigo (mami)
Quieres que te azote y no pare de perrear, pues dale
Girla si te pegas te va a gustar

Se te marca el gistro (mami)
Dale suavecito (mami)
Perea tu conmigo, tu sabes que esto es lo mío (mami)
Si ya empezamos yo no voy a terminar hasta que tu me digas
Me tienes que propinar

Veo que tu cuerpo se mueve al compás de mi reggae
Y que tu cuerpo se moja al bailar
Todos con ella quieren perrear, pero no se va a dejar
Pues yo soy el que ella prefiere

Veo que tu cuerpo se mueve al compás de mi reggae
Y que tu cuerpo se moja al bailar
Todos con ella quieren perrear, pero no se va a dejar
Pues yo soy el que ella prefiere

Pues perrea mujer, conmigo
Yo a ti te domino
Te controlo
No te quites yal, que esto es lo mío

Tu cuerpo me provoca
A que ignore a las otras
Tu roce me calienta
Y a ti te pone violenta

Así que tumbe el Guille que no te quedó

De cacería en busca de aquel que a ella la rosa
Y la auspicie en sus cosas, ella sale costosa
Es hermosa, pero es mucho para tu liga
Ella discrimina solo busca gente fina
Que le den placeres y lo ofrezcan una buena vida
Ella te defalca y te rapta, es una pilla

Por más que trates de pincharle, ella te va a estremecer
No se postea en una esquina, ella se deja ver
Se destaca por la habilidad que tiene al mover
Y si le enseñas par de pesos te la vas a comer
Ella se encarga de sacarte toda la información
Y se asegura de antemano que tengas profesión
Si cualificas, ella te lleva a su habitación
Haciendo el amor, al ritmo del reggaetón

Superemos ya está fase
Sé que tienes base y fundamentos para estar en esta
Te estás rompiendo la cabeza
Dices que yo no valgo la pena pero
No recuerdas todas las cosas buenas, bueno
Está bien, me pongo en tu posición
Se te hace difícil tomar una decisión
Sé que no es una exageración
Y que me peleas con razón. (Busquemos una solución)

Improvisando cada acción.

Disfrutando cada momento a tu lado

Yo archivé tu amor
Dentro una caja de zapatos existen recuerdos vagos de lo que vivimos

Juntos tu y yo
Los otros días me topé con ellas
Y me senté a leerlas
Recordé aquellos tiempos de primavera
Pero de momento regresé al presente
Recordé lo difícil que se me hizo perderte
y decidí quemarlo todo porque para mi ya no tenían valor

Cartas de amor
Fotografías y artefactos que me acordaban a ti
Recuerdos que valían un millón
Ahora arden en fuego, dejando humo y un mal sabor
Cartas de amor
Fotografías y artefactos que me acordaban a ti
Recuerdos que valían un millón
Ahora arden en fuego, y todo ahí quedo

Documentos en prosa y verso escritos por un amateur
Invocando un amor de ""haute couture""
Mucho adjetivo adornaba su vocabulario vago
que en un momento llego a sorprenderme y por eso ahora me embriago
Y es que por mujeres como tu, hay hombres como yo
En una ocasión fueron engañados por un falso amor
Y hoy en día no pueden escapar de su miseria
Te alojaste en mi cuerpo, como una bacteria
Como un virus, del cual no tengo salida
Ya me diagnosticaron pocos días de vida
Y es que sin corazón se ha probado que no se puede vivir
Menos sin mente que no la tengo en mi, la tengo en ti
Pero ya me cansé de los recuerdos y de las memorias
Lo que tengo son cinco en gasolina, fósforos y voy a
Mirar el fuego como convierte todo en cenizas
Y acabar con todas tus letras postizas

Fuiste la única persona que alteraste mi futuro
Maldiciendo mi presente
ahora solo es un pasado
Y para ti es indiferente
Lo nuestro nunca debió haber pasado
Y ahora que hago
Si no tengo camino evidente
Ando sin saber nadar, en un lago de aguardiente

Tratando de disimular, montábamos un teatro
Haciéndoles pensar que era una linda amistad,

Quisiera tener la oportunidad de hacerte ver
Que lo que dimos por fallido alguna vez
Aun sigue vivo en nuestro ser, volvámoslo a renacer
Y nuestro amor podamos restablecer, porqué...

Urs Affolter,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray

Urs Affolter,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1997
Ursa Minor,"Fell into 
A sea of grass 
And disappeared among 
The shady blades... 
Children all 
Ran over me 
Screaming tag! 
You are the one!

He trips her as 
Her sandals fail 
She says stop! 
I'm a girl... 
Whose fingernails are made 
Of mother's pearl... 

Yellow buttercup 
Helicopters
Orange buttercat 
Chasing after 
The crazy bee 
Mad about somebody...

Me and my girlfriend 
Don't wear no shoes 
Her nose is painted pepper
Sunlight... 
She loves me 
I mean it's serious 
As serious can be...

She sings a song and 
I listen to what it says: 
If you want a friend
Feed any animal... 
There was so much space 
I cut me a piece 
With some fine wine 
It brought peace to my mind 
In the summertime... 
And it rolled 

Summer.... oh... 
Oh.... the summertime rolls

Ursula Rucker,"I the voyeur, peer, as she begins her, ritual 
Paying sexual ties for few and untrue 
Words of admiration, translation: 
Sucker ass, lines, of trash 
Spewing from First One's unskilled lips 
That beg for pussy tricks that make his dick go quickly limp 
She pimps her innocence as Second One demands entrance 
Through the back door 
""Bend over bitch, you know this is what you were born for; 
To dig those soft and lotioned knees into the floor 
And take it in, that sweetly spread ass like a real pro whore"" 
Her subsequent screams seemed to praise 
Sent messages of pleasure and pain to his fuck tainted brain 
But her screams masked laughs at his dumb ass 
As he quicker comes, then Third and Fourth One just as dumb 
Invite themselves to join in 
Third One wants to hit the skins old-fashioned style 
While Fourth One says, 
""Don't she got some DSL's, make a nigga joint just swell, 
To think? I want to sink my inches, into that bitch's, 
Berry-framed mouth"" 
So one goes North, the other South 
To sanctified places where in-house spirits 
Will later wash away all traces, of their ill-spoken words 
And complacent faces 
And then, like their Minutemen, predecessors 
Lude, aggrandized sexual endeavors, end up rough 
Cause neither one of them could keep that weak shit up 
Corrupt, Fifth One steps to her 
Hip-Hop clothed just to, think he gonna impress her 
""Hey Slim, I heard you was a spinna, sit on up 
Top this thing, black dick, and work it like a winner"" 
With the quickness he got his pseudo-thickness all up in her 
But suddenly he, stops mid thrust 

Seems she nameless to 'cause, got his stuff in a death cunt clutch 
He fast falls from the force of her tight pussy punch 
Just like the rest of that sorry ass bunch 
Now here comes Six ready to add his inactive shit to the mix 
Talkin' smack at that 
Saying, ""Girl, I'ma wax that ass, and stick that slit so hard, 
You gonna be calling me God"" 
So he proceeds to poke and prod 
With clumsy finger and wack sex slinger 
""Condoms make me last longer,"" wrong, cause her 
Motions of snatch, however detached from the situation 
Cause his pre pre PRE-ejaculation 
It seems she just wastin' 
Good pussy and time on dudes like Number Seven 
Who ain't learned their lesson 
He wants to enter the flesh divine 
By dropping a kind of semi-sweet line 
""Your honey hole so fine and mile deep; I'm gonna leap 
Into you like an ocean do you right and make your head spin"" 
So he jumped in and then, he drowned 
Got lost and found in her Tart Canal 
Slave to the waves, made him cum for days 
Eighth and Last One turn arise 
Plys her with familiar lies 
Even more familiar still, cause 
Him she used to love 
But he never could quite see above, her mound 
A pound of flesh is all she was, no name no face or even voice 
So poised, she rises, Phoenix from the flame 
Finally bored with their feeble fuck games 
She smooth reaches behind her and takes straight aim 
At eight shriveled up cocks with a fully loaded Glock 
Parts lips, not expressly made for milding dicks 
And then, she speaks: 

Your shrieks of horror bring me bliss, I must admit 
The thought that I could shred your tips with eight quick flips 
Excites me, see y'all fuck with the pussy 
But I fuck with your minds 
Lack of soul and respect is the crime

Blows to chest 
No breath 
Air gasps 
You ain't nothing but white trash, bitch! 
With each hit, each kick, each, broken rib 
Crack, crack! 
Bones are crying 
Mommy's crying and bleeding 
And pleading 
And then 
Daddy wants to fuck 
Dick hard, swelled with power rush 
And as if all that wasn't enough 
Mommy's seven months heavy with birth 
As, Daddy grunts and cursed drunk nothings in her bloodied ear 

First, lullaby 
First, son, will, ever, hear 
And never forget 

Mommy almost bled to death when she have him, finally 
She'd already lost, three 
Uterus-bruised, shredded, and weak 
From being daily beat 
And Friday nights were the worse and 
Daddy never came with flowers 
Instead he spent hours at some corner spot 
With some bar pop named Cookie 
Putting his thing down 
Soiling Mommy's sheets with
Sweet, talk shit, 
Cookie's cheap lipstick, 
Hair grease, sperm, and Jezebel juice 

To hell with the good news that
He was a father for the first time 
His thirst for wine and women 
Clouded his vision 
No warm welcome for mother and son 
Just 
The rank smell of ass-crack, funk, and cum 
But Mommy's prayerful strength-her best defense 
She, burned the dirty linens 
Made a fresh bed 
Laid sleeping First Son down 
And never made a sound 
As she purged her scourge 
With birth-blood and quiet tears 
Watching as her fears and love and sacrifice 
Lie there in his soft skin and new life 
Breathing, dreaming, fresh from God's eye 
Mommy's little survivor 
Like, her 

Mommy called crazy and scorned 
Cause she two more born 
One boy soon after 
The girl much later and 
Although they were both sung the same lullabies of hate 
Her, First Son, the first one 
Whose, womb-world was profaned 
Came of age playing street games 
With Stewie, Rezzie, and Little Brother 
'Till his heart start to wither 
In pain and shame 
Blamed Mom for the wrong she let Daddy do to her 
And him
Let, sins of the Father cause his innocence to wander 
Found out amongst thieves 
Chose to squander his dreams 
Stopped believing in himself 
Become prodigal with his life 
Make impossible shit right with
Gang-ties, crime, lies 
Erase wise, woeful words of Mother 
Replaced them with absurdities of others 
Who had also lost their way 

Played a different kind of street game now 
First Son plunged deep 
Speak street-family vows 
Espouse no causes but his own 
See, he couldn't protect Mommy's neck from Daddy's grasp 
Or, protect Mommy's ass from Daddy's wrath 
Couldn't shield her ears from
Daddy's foul-mouthed, liquor-breath jeers 
His only defense-served be confidence 
Brown bottles housed his swift descent 
Phones called cops on block frequent for his shenanigans 
Now, Daddy and him twins in addiction 
Driven to false-hearted heavens and friends 
By liquefied demons 
Had become what he despised from conception 'til end 
Destined for a demise 
Survived nine lives of staying high 
Conning, jewelry-pawning, arrests, theft 
Womanizing, only for money, never for sex 
Bullet in chest, baseball bat to the head 
Left for dead 
So, eyes wide and glassy 
Speech, slowed and slurred 
Lips twitched with caked-up codeine candy 
And mouth corners one December 24th 
Mr. Hide and False Friend 
Took final ride to suburban supplier 
Shots were fired by the gray man 
With shaky hand 
But not shaky enough to miss
Hit, Lost Boy in back 
So-called Friend runs for door 
Leaves First Son blood-born 
Lying alone in blood on cold floor 

Death was the cause of
Returning to Innocence Lost

Baby 'Sis awake for dawn on Christmas morn 
To Mommy's sobs and shakes 
Daddy's silhouettes of regret 
All past, omitted, and absolved by lost 
As they clung to each other

We is a beautiful thing 
You and me is a beautiful thing 

Even struggle is beautiful thing to rise above 
When your in love, inside love
His love, her love God loves self love 
A child's love, a peoples love 
Cause then the struggle isn't so empty 
For with life not just strife

And even if we don't evolve
Don't change 
The Universe still rearrange itself

Just natural plan it's a beautiful thing
It's a beautiful thing

Ursula Rucker,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water [Swayzak en LA Clusaz Mix],2006

Before I allow myself and soul
To wither away into, indistinctness

Urubamba,"I am just a poor boy, 
Though my story's seldom told, 
I have squandered my resistance 
For a pocketful of mumbles, 
Such are promises 
All lies and jest 
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear 
And disregards the rest. 
 
When I left my home 
And my family, 
I was no more than a boy 
in the company of strangers 
in the quiet of a railway station, 
Running scared. 
Laying low, 
Seeking out the poorer quarters 
Where the ragged people go, 
Looking for the places 
Only they would know. 
Lie-la-lie 
 
Asking only workman's wages 
I come looking for a job, 
But I get no offers. 
Just a come-on from the whores 
On Seventh Avenue 
I do declare, 
There were times when I was so lonesome 
I took some comfort there. 
Lie-la-lie 
 
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes 
And wishing I was gone, 
Going home 
Where the New York City winters 
Aren't bleeding me, 
Leading me, 
Going home. 
 
In the clearing stands a boxer, 
And a fighter by his trade 
And he carries the remainders 
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down 
And cut him till he cried out 
In his anger and his shame, 
""I am leaving, I am leaving"" 
But the fighter still remains

When tears are in your eyes, I will dry 
Them all,

I will lay me down. 
Like a bridge over troubled water 
I will lay me down. 

When you're down and out, 
When you're on the street, 
When evening falls so hard 
I will comfort you. 
I'll take your part. 
When darkness comes 
And pain is all around, 
Like a bridge over troubled water 
I will lay me down.

Sail on by. 
Your time has come to shine. 
All your dreams are on their way. 
See how they shine.

Us3,"Now and then I feel as though I wanna escape the real
And take a trip to the heavens to a world surreal
But I don't do drugs so the yea is out
Instead I use my mind power to move my spirits about
I might write my girl a poem showin' her how I love thee
Or just write myself a rhyme about why I'm so funky
This is how I escape the ignorance and hate being cooked up in this planet
About to disintegrate

I'm cruisin', cruisin' in the beat y'all
I'm cruisin', cruisin' in the beat y'all
I'm cruisin', cruisin' in the beat y'all
I'm cruisin', cruisin' in the beat y'all

I cover my head as the media shower
I glance at my watch to check the hour
And it's half past a moonbeam, gleamin' as I daydream
I'm feelin' for the beat to make my mood complete
And when I got it I'm gone, gone in the rhythm
Kickin' the slang with the knowledge and wisdom
I may speak a scribbly doodle but I keep on track
'cause if I didn't yo you wouldn't be sweatin' it

One to the two to the three to the four to the five
It's rardy-ardy-are and I'm kickin' it live
On an ever present journey through the depths of time
I skip from beat to beat in the form of a rhyme
My vocal techniques are unique to my band
I'm a butterfly MC, smooth with much style G
My tongue-like quivers when I deliver the funk flow
The verbs expand with a ghettolistic glow
It's like that y'all",Cruisin',1993
Us3,"Mi tek off mi land down now in Jamaica

With strictly fly gear 'cause my style's unique
I'm trespassin'. All the girls heads that I'm gassin'
Fill her up son you'll get tipped for a job well done
I'm havin' fun, smooth sounds caress your eardrum
Flow 'cause I know mad styles and then some
Went to military school just like that movie Tap
So tip toe tap to my rap

Aye aye, I go pop just for you
I stay true to my people, where you at, where you at?
Let me hear ya say ho!
Yo that was crazy fat, bap-de-do-bap
Jazzy with the freaky words 'cause I'm toked up on a spliff

I have to say it felt great when I stepped to the plate
And I hit that home run just like a hall of fame great
I cast a spell like Merlin the magician
Brainstorm to the morn so relax and listen
I'm from Brooklyn fool so get the funk outta my face
Place all your bets on me 'cause I'm winnin' this race
I'm on top yes indeedy I took first prize
Do I see green with envy written 'cross your eyes
I hope not, 'cause this dope track's a sure shot
Us3 got my back and I pack a fat block
Nineteen I burst on the scene right quick
I'm out to make records and mad flicks

I'm slip slip slidin', I'm dip dip divin'
'cause it's live in full effect and still it keeps climbin'
I'm a legend on the microphone, weak beat slayer
Bufferin' the talent all, I got you poppin' bayer
Step in to this boy you haven't got a prayer
I'm kickin' mad ballistics with the old school flavour
I love fly ladies and I love mad loot
They say love's gonna get ya but I don't give a hoot
'cause it's time to get mine as I bust a fat rhyme
And like my man Dion says, these nigga's call me prime time
Fly the friendly skies I rise higher than the sun
I say peace to Zeke Love, my man who's getting' the job done
I'm a b-boy who don't play, comin' straight from the head

Us3,"Hey yo check it out I got a hype rhyme for ya
That I'll rock from London England to the boondocks of Georgia
Intelligent, benevolent, super, all the qualities of H-I-see the alley-ooper
My main man and me we've been cool since day one
Scoopin' all the fly girls, havin' all the fun
Sport the dope threads and the hundred dollar kicks
Makin' power moves so get off my
Nah I won't say it, 'cause it's crystal, it's clear
I get the job done each and every year
Back in school I used to act the fool
But I rocked an A average so everything's cool
Tool, my pencil, the mic's my utensil
I wreck the mic check and you can write that in stencil
So you wonder why I made it and your shit is goin' wrong
Hey yo troop, I got it goin' on!

I'm like a mad man when I get the mic in my hand
I run loose at the mouth 'cause I really don't give a damn
I'm on a mission, chasin' a dream
When I hear the beats thump I shake like a fiend
And when the notes are blue I do the do with the Us3 crew
Right in the back log, Geoff and Melle Mel y'all
Chillin' on the track boy, mixin' up the schizmo, keepin' shit in fit form
They got it goin' on
Patterns in the poems get you open like a spliff
If you take a sniff you might end up like a stiff
'cause it's funky, a hip-hop junkie is what I am
Straight from Brooklyn with a gun in my hand
I'm just kiddin', or should I say fibbin' or bare faced lyin'
It doesn't matter, you know what I'm implyin'
And if you still don't know what's goin' on
Yo G I got it goin' on!

Zoom-ga-zoom zoom-ga-zoom-ga-zay
Sit back relax and I'll make your day
Radical concepts that's my choice
Freak it to the music and flow through my voice
So let's face it, it's time to get back to the basics
Sing a simple song that goes on and on and on
I'm climbin' to the top just like King Kong
And guess what? I got it goin' on!",I Got It Goin' On,1993
Us3,"Hey yo kid bust this, it's time to drop the flavour
I'm fly as can be, I'm rhymin' on my good behaviour
From New York City kickin' dope rhymes that you savour
Take it from the top, I cut MCs just like a razor
It's time to kick 'cause I always do the trick
The shit that you always poppin' all amount to a flick
Stick nigga's up with the hype rhyme filled with ammo
Blast from the past bullets passin' through your abdomen
Rin tin tin I troop in on the bins
My friends is down in the dumps 'cause I cashed in on the wins
Hens and chickens layin' low, sucker nigga's don't know
That I can kick the mad ballistics plus I'm wreckin' every show
Sew it up, ya got static?
'cause I'm better than the next chump so don't panic
'cause I'm a wet you with my skills, still chill, got the crispy bills
'cause it's like that the way it is, get off the dills
And it's like that

You've got to give me props I'm on the way to the top
Stop. I think I just heard a pin drop
'cause you're stunned by the way I came off my head Ted
Turn the packs to burner and I put heads to bed
Fed up but I'm still just too legit to quit
I sit in my girly's lap while I'm kissin' on her lips
Girls love to lick 'em up and up and down and all around
But only if their sexual history is sound
I'm a brown-skinned medallion, code name mic stallion
Takin' over brothers that are dillyin' and dallyin'
I'm rallyin' like Al Sharpton, militant youth
Booth built for the DJ, hooked up and sound proofed
Seein' is believin' yo believin' is my method
So believe me when I say that it's the party that I'm wreckin'
Sinbad the sailor couldn't take me out
And I hope your ass don't take that route
And it's like that

Steady as I flow I row row row your boat
I got a castle in Brackerlack with sharks in my moat
So use the drawbridge and pave way while I say
Hi-see and Rahsaan are down until the break of day
And like he man I have the power
I like my chicken from the china man but make it sweet and sour
Devour all other wack MCs
And when I windsurf nature gives me a breeze
'cause it's a new jack kickin' rhymes like Jackie Chan
I got a year round tan, 'cause I'm a brother man
I'm travellin' in style I gotta pass the first class
'cause it's time to give rappin' some pizzazz
So the b-boys from Brooklyn breakin' bones for the bucks
I never ever sell out but I still own a tux
Huh, I make short work of your crew
Hi-see the beast master kick the funky for you
And it's like that",It's Like That,1993
Us3,"My brother, take a rest from what you doin' sit back and listen
Listen to my song about some brothers on a mission
This one kid he never went to school
His teachers thought that he was crazy out acting the fool
But on a real, baby pa had nuff static
He had two little brothers and his mother was a crack addict
Papa bear was never there to give him hope
So one might ask himself how did this young man cope?
He started robbin' just to feed his peoples and that's a fact
Until one day he got caught in the act
Shacked up and jacked up and taken downtown
And to the judge he's just another brother on lockdown

Well this other nigga from the Fort was out to get his
Catchin' crazy wreck on the mic, that's word to Mizz
But until he struck the deal he had to sell the rock
Pack the glock doin' deeds at the end of the block
He had crazy fly robes and his daughter ate well
He never hit the blowpipe it was strictly the sell
These jealous brothers round the way wanted to rock his world
But instead they did the dirty shit and shot his girl
When he found out who did it he went awol
Stepped to the mall, he saw the punks and sprayed them all
But now he's doin' life for the suckers he shot down
And now he's just another brother on lockdown

Fresh outta school my man had it all
A dip crib, a fly girl, he was havin' a ball
But this other punk kid started to use him and abuse him
Slowly takin' all his loot and at the same time confuse him
When the smoke cleared my man lost his crib and his bank
May I ask a question, who'd he have to thank?
Well anyway, now he's on a mission to get his respect
He thinks the only way to get it is to catch his wreck
He saw the bastard in the Village, on Astor Place
My man balled up his fist and laid him to waste
Now he's getting' five years even though he got props now
But to you and me he's just another brother on lockdown",Just Another Brother,1993
Us3,"Monkey see monkey do follow this when I cue you
The mic is my wine it helps me cast my voodoo spell
Hell 'cause I'm f-you-n-k-why
Suckers try to flex I say why oh why
'cause I don't bother nobody, I chill and hardly party
Now and then I might go out, puff a blunt and sip bacardi
But if not I'm in my room pumpin' tunes
Waitin' for the payday, it's coming soon
Brooklyn is my home, better yet my war zone
Why did I say that? 'cause it's a mutherfuckin' fact
Kids around the way know what's up, they can't front
Kids are getting' smoked up like blunts
All over nonsense brothers die constant
I'm looking for an answer, I can't find it
I think we need a little help, word
Brothers gotta find knowledge of self

I got mad knowledge of self
You gotta get with knowledge of self

Righteous I live, give props to my mom
Pops raised me like a oner never settled for smaller
I am a prince in this land, not 'cause I have a grand
Got knowledge in my dome
In command of my life, never ever live trife
Thanks to my man fifty grand money Spike
Now I'm on my road to riches and bitches
The world of fake hugs and fake ass kisses
Girlies wanna get with me, is it for me or because I MC?
I don't give a damn anyway, hey, skins are skins I stick 'em any day
But anyway enough about that
I think it's about time for drip to rip the rap
Let me pause for the cause 'cause the chorus comes first
And with the quickness the verse will disperse, like that

I got mad knowledge of self
You gotta get with knowledge of self

Some brothers think they're it when they really ain't shit
Talkin' 'bout their new car and that their pockets are thick
But c'mon, you don't have a job, I know you're frontin' hard
Borrowed the ride from mom
What's the reason for the teasin', who the hell ya think ya pleasin'?
You lack self-esteem so you try to front and cream
But that ain't workin' 'cause I'm smirkin' thinkin' how you're such a fool
I keep a stern face as you're fakin' moves
""I'm this I'm that I'm hip I'm phat""
Know what you are? Wick wick wack!
A brother with no colour 'cause all I see is grey
If you knew who you were this road you would not play
Around the way I must stay with my people
Chill at some clubs, though that was lethal
Now I got my mental health, word
I got mad knowledge of self",Knowledge of Self,1993
Us3,"Makin' crazy tracks it's mellow with the music
Did you know that you have a mind so use it
Now this may sound confusin', yes yes indeed
You got what you want, well I got what I need
Walk down the block and say hi to the fellas
Lookin' at ya funny, maybe it's 'cause they're jealous
Don't let it hit the spot, 'cause they want what you got
To knock you out the box and fill ya empty slot
So hustle like a gigolo and go for what you know
If you need a lesson get tickets to my show
If you called the ho, yo there must be a reason
You caught some ill shit, now ya gotta stop the skeezin'
Get a job hooker, better yet pick up a book
Step in front the mirror and take a long look
This method of attack is opposite of wack
So if ya got the knack it's time to make tracks

Lookin' like the next man, is that who you are?
Copy cattin' nigga's won't take ya very far
So be your own man son, live your life grand
Be your own ruler of your own plot of land
Sellin' crystal meth aka the crack rock
Don't be too mad when ya find ya ass locked
Killin' off ya brothers, stringin' out ya mother
That may not be your case but it surely is for others
Doin' dirty deeds, and pullin' off the capers
Now you're lookin' gassed with ya picture in the papers
Far from being wack, yo if you're proud and black
You'll listen to the rap and then you'll make tracks

Bootleg tapes? Yo, what are you, crazy?
Knockin' niggas out, huh, that shit don't faze me
Don't let me catch you boy, I'll play you like a toy
Not tryin' to be a bully, but I'm quick to stop your ploy
There's better things to do, other ways of getting' paid
Illin', cold chillin', and layin' in the shade
Just look at Hi-see and Rahsaan for example
We're too legit to quit and our dough supply is ample
So if ya gotta brain or a head on your shoulders
Better use it quick 'cause you're only getting' older

Ain't nothin' but to do it
Manoeuvre to a sound that's makin' you wanna dance to it
Nod ya head, clap ya hands and shake that ass to it
Hit the floor, it's yours, assuming that's what ya came here for

As bad as I was, can't remember if ya spanked me

While babysittin' this nigga, you became a father figure
Mowed the lawn with ya whenever, bourbon was your liquor
Who'd figure the strongest man I knew could have a bad ticker
And the last time we'd see each other was Christmas '95

Without ever havin' a chance to say goodbye
You left the summer of '96, the 1st of July
Now reside in peace, released from all the pressure and pain
Your grandson proclaim the name, Nelson forever reigns

Grand Groove, king of my crew
Grand Groove, I dedicate this to you

You moved from Queens to Tennessee when in my mid-teens
Later Atlanta, adopted Eileen when she was umpteen
Provided cream for your fam for years, retired
Now I understand what it is to be a man upon this planet

Took for granted the times you'd trip to NY on vacation
Thinkin' you'd be around for ever, probably neglected you
Unconsciously, the thought of me MCing made ya bug
Vividly at times imaging our last hug is bugged

Don't seem to realize you ain't comin' back, a routine check
How, while getting' dressed, did stress give you a heart attack?
Now reside in peace, released from all the pressure and pain
Your grandson proclaim the name, Nelson forever reigns

Grand Groove, king of my crew
Grand Groove, I dedicate this to you

We laughed for hours when you fell from off that bicycle
'Til tears trickled down my face, memories never erased
Laced with wisdom reflect up on my upbringing
Remember, you never missed a day
My school had me singing ""Forever in my heart""

Never forget how much I love you
Thinkin' of you I miss the times together where it's better
You now reside in peace, released from all the pressure and pain
Your grandson proclaims the name, Nelson forever reigns

Composed from within enclosed now unfolds
Toes tap as a reaction, adapting to pattern of rhythm
Diggin' what the soul brother givin' 'em

Let your mind connect to the injection in your ears
The architects flex on his set skills of inner depth with no slack
Observe a brother's essence who in fact been in existence before rap

The soul brother for years officially instilling original
Fulfillin' rhythmical joints to listen to
Non individual abettor assisting whomsoever
Clever, wack this brother? Never

Bodies sway when he plays, since the days of way back
Still today he'll lay tracks that's fat when weighed in, chill
Soul brother on this number
Give 'em a taste, hit 'em and lace 'em with the rhythm

Soul brother, we combine a rocket for your mind
One time, a true mastermind

The soul brother, one of a kind, no other
Genuine, out of line, keepin' the rhythm on time

Soul brother, no other keeps you movin'
Groovin' to a tune there ain't a sound more soothin'
Oozin' over vibin' he's supplyin', find him chart climbing
Proving two men who ain't losin' the game

Instead sustain, endeavour, whenever we're together
Soul flows till tunes close sever
Recognize the steel as concealed thoughts unveil
Then reveal what you feel from within, peel

KCB is who this, new to this is ludicrous
I'm true to this game, insane
Who is the brother of soul, solely?
No, in reality many be being, though no one and only

Bodies sway when he plays, since the days of way back still
Today he'll lay tracks that's fat when weighed in, chill

Kept on your toes by what he has composed
Talent exposed, technics co-ordinated with precision
Catering to whatever flavor you're listenin' to

Today he'll lay tracks that's fat when weighed in, chill

Us3,"At age 13 turned fiend, dreamed nights M.C'ing
Reciting rapper's delight enticed by limelight
Ambitious visions of vinyl 12 inches
Since Yellowman was king Albino

Critiqued my form of speak on breakbeats
Cut on 2 Technics in a basement on 210th street
House jams, parks, block parties, halls and armories
Foremost behind the ropes, you only spoke if you was doped

Then formed crews, some rappers now retired
My desire required more than a quiet name on flyer's
Inspired, remain for delft, vowin' to see the day my records on the shelf
Sold out at HMV and Tower, just how I dreamed

Recall hearin' mom scream ""Wake up""
""Stay in school, take up classes, keep your grades up""
But straight up, since my mind's been made up to do this
KCB son, ain't new to this, I'm true to this

Stay true to the game
I'm out to get the fortune and fame
Stay true to the game
I'm out to get the fortune and fame

Time passed yet M.O. remains makin' demos
Though wished behind the windows of a limo
Sippin' champagne, producers kicked game, expected
Label exec's smirked at hard work, tapes rejected

Connected with Eli perfected Mikey D and I wrecked it
Resurrected, marked the return few expected
Picked up in '89, signed but slipped up, charted, bigged up
Come to find royalty time, ain't see a dime

For promo shows, though exposed felt cheap
Kicked out the crib to the streets of Medina, where I'd sleep
Starvin' regardless, persist beyond exist to do this
Sons is clueless done, ain't new to this I'm true to this

Stay true to the game
I'm out to get the fortune and fame
Stay true to the game
I'm out to get the fortune and fame

The script flips, '96 relationships consist of wisdoms
Wishin' I quit, insufficient funds, silver tongues strung on drums
A1 yet still unsung, adapt and overcome the aggravation of years waitin'
And heads fakin', Jax sayin' ""Is it worth the frustration?""

It ain't payin' considerably, lacking consistency
Absentee in an industry exceeding M.C's, yet keep strivin' to maintain
Too late in the game to change direction
Sustain flexin' dialect, tongue blessin' sessions

Progress in this profession, knowledge the lesson
Let it be known never forgettin', this ain't no dream
Although, it may seem like at times the mic's grabbed up on
Scenes true indeed, born to succeed, my mind is made up to do this
KCB son, ain't new to this, I'm true to this

Stay true to the game
I'm out to get the fortune and fame
Stay true to the game
I'm out to get the fortune and fame

I admit that I was wrong 
Maybe if you told me how to make

Twenty nights apart, that's what we are 
And I'm dyin' in my sleep 
Happy days, they seem so far away 
Can I come back home 

[Chorus:]
You told me you loved me, but now it's all history 
I'm bleedin' so badly, I just gotta let it go 
I thought that I was your friend, but now you're with someone else 
Let it go, let it go 

Now I'm lyin' my bed at night 
With your picture in my hand 
Reminiscin' back to when we were 
More than just good friends 

Does he make you feel the way I did 
Does he care the way I cared 
Precious love is just so hard to find 
Why are you not here? 

You told me you loved me, but now it's all history 
I'm blledin' so badly, I just gotta let it go 
I thought that I was your friend, but now 
You're with someone else 
Let it go, let it go

And I can't sleep at night

US5,"They passed me by,
All of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances

My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action

Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all
Never left at all

Cant you see our lives
Really aren't better now

Separated for all time

To be alone in misery

I sit and wonder
How did we just lose the key
To all that was so right
I don't wanna leave your side
Tonight

Were we right or justified
Or maybe we were blind
Not to see what we had
Was so hard to find
Now I wish that we
Could only just rewind the time
To the time we both had the chance
To make it work out right

And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more

Lovings such a beautiful thing
Oh you make my world.. a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

And the tears we had to pay (you hade to cry)

And I can't see your face lost in space nothing is left today 
I lost a friend no more late phone calls no more faith 
And I sit now and wonder what went wrong nothing is bright for me anymore 

Nothing is clear for me anymore 
And I can't see your face lost in space nothing is left today, 
Nothing is left nothing is left, 
And I ask myself where is my cup of lemonade",Lost in Space,1999
Useless ID,"We'll just keep on laughing 
At our broken dream
In our empty homes 
It's too late for some,
It's too late for me 
It's too late goodbye
Of course you waste your time here 
But it is your choice
I offer you to stay,
It's not too late for you 
It's not too late for them,
It's not too late goodbye!

Now you know everyone is alone 
And the longer you stay,
The more, the more you want to go
And I'll just keep on laughing 
At your broken dream,
In your empty home 
It's not too late for you,
Was not too late for me 
It's not too late goodbye!",Not Too Late,1999
Useless ID,"And now I've got a big question mark above my head
I am one step behind the big fall,
Before packing up and leaving 
I'm stuck in a junction with 24 ways,
How stupid of me to ignore the fact 
That I'm facing my weird life and future,
But still I've got a big smile on my face
I guess nothing will change 
Or turn off the switch in my head
Nothing will make me 
To become what you became,
Nothing is right and nothing is wrong,
You live your life 
Now let me live mine
And now I've got a big answer 
To all my friends,
Who didn't understand at all,
Who didn't get my way of living
This isn't something you learn at school
This is not a fucking pose
It is something that comes from inside
Yeah, something that I can call my life.",Questions and Answers,1999
Useless ID,"Return back home after 
Three months on the road
I know that it's time to piece 
My puzzled life into an ordinary frame
Life goes on but for me 
It seems to go the other way
Nothing worked out for a while 
Then it all just seemed to change

Looking hard for the easy way 
To get away from it
Another year has gone by 
And I feel that I've slept through it all
I'll be gone like the thief that's on the run
Who's got the world in his hands 
And is trying to get away 
From everyone he knows

Thinking back to a time 
When I was moving here
Leaving it all behind to start again
And it is all these lessons 
That I haven't learned
One day I will

Searching for you until you ripped 
My life into another piece
That meant nothing for a while, 
Back then I just thought that way
Some feeling changed 
But I'm better off this way 
When I'm without you
Just because I know whoever 
Is with you is going through the same

Thinking back to a time 
When I was moving here
Leaving it all behind to start again
And it is all these lessons 
That I haven't learned
One day I will so tell me

When will I find the path 
That is meant for me
I know that it's out there 
And it'll always be
For now I can just try to figure it out
What this situation is all about

Life goes on and one day it will 
Move on without us
But I'll have my faith, 
Someday I'll move on to something more",A Year to Forget [#],2000
Useless ID,"Phone calls , excitement in the air.
Fluency has grown,
All we have shared is in a stream heading somewhere,
Taking turns, back to nowhere.
Although there are a thousand more,
You are the one I have been looking for.
I have no clue if this is your game 
If so count me out and leave me in pain.
Already prepared for a final thought.
After only a few hours I got caught in your net,
Why did you let me fall?
It left me in a crumbling room staring at the walls.",Have a Nice Life,2000
