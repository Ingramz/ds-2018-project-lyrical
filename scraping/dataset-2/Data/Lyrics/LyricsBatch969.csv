Sade,"Mama been laid off
Papa been laid off
My brother's been laid off
For more than two years now
Ooh can't get a job
Billy can't get a job
Ooh they gotta listen to the blues

Help them to strive
Help them to move on
Help them to have some future
Help them to live long
Help them to live life
Help them to smile
Don't let them stay home and listen to the blues

Mama been laid off
Papa been laid off
Billy can't get a job
For too long, too long
Don't let them lose
We gotta give them a chance
It's gonna come back on everyone
If you don't make them dance
Don't let them stay home and listen to the blues

There's nothing sacred (why, why, why)
Breathing hatred
We have to face it (why, why, why)
No one can take it
And feel no pain

One day we're gonna wake up
And the ghetto's all around
All over my friend
Have you ever seen a man break down

Do you know how that feels
To walk the street with your head held high
Why, why, why
Oh Lord have mercy
Did you ever see a man break down

There's nothing sacred
Breathing hatred
We have to face it
No one can take it (how can they take that much)
And feel no pain

Oh, did you ever see a man break down",Feel No Pain,1993
Sade,"To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me

No, I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know, I'll never let you down, no way
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down, no way

Try to tell you that it's alright
Ooh, I'm not playing
Can't you see what I'm saying
You are my religion

Sade,"Heaven please send to all mankind,
Understanding and peace of mind.
But, if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love.

Show all the world how to get along,
Peace will enter when hate is gone.
But, if it's not asking too much,
Please send me someone to love.

I lay awake night and ponder world troubles.
My answer is always the same.
That unless men put an end to all of this,
Hate will put the world in a flame, (oh) what a shame.

Just because I'm in misery.
I'm not begging for no sympathy.
But if it's not asking too much,
Just send me someone to love.

Heaven please send to all mankind,
Understanding and peace of mind.
But if it's not asking too much,
Please send me someone to love.

Sade,"This may come, this may come as some surprise
But I miss you
I could see through all of your lies
But still I miss you

He takes her love, but it doesn't feel like mine
He tastes her kiss, her kisses are not wine, they're not mine
He takes, but surely she can't give what I'm feeling now
She takes, but surely she doesn't know how

Is it a crime
Is it a crime
That I still want you
And I want you to want me too

My love is wider, wider than Victoria Lake
My love is taller, taller than the Empire State
It dives, it jumps and it ripples like the deepest ocean
I can't give you more than that, surely you want me back

Sade,"Jezebel wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth
She probably had less than every one of us
But when she knew how to walk she knew
How to bring the house down
Can't blame her for her beauty
She wins with her hands down

Jezebel, what a belle
Looks like a princess in her new dress
How did you get that?
""Do you really want to know"", she said
It would seem she's on her way
It's more, more than just a dream
She put on her stockings and shoes
Had nothing to lose, she said it was worth it

Reach for the top
And the sun is gonna shine
""Every winter was a war"", she said
""I want to get what's mine""

Jezebel, Jezebel
Won't try to deny where she came from
You can see it in her pride
And the raven in her eyes
Try show her a better way
She'll say, ""You don't know what you've been missing""
By the time she blinks you know she won't be listening

""Reach for the top"", she said
""And the sun is gonna shine""
""Every winter was a war"", she said
""I want to get what's mine""",Jezebel [Version],1994

We'll never really learn the meanin' of it all

Sade,"There is a woman in Somalia
Scraping for pearls on the roadside
There's a force stronger than nature
Keeps her will alive
This is how she's dying
She's dying to survive
Don't know what she's made of
I would like to be that brave

She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives a life she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes

Hurts like brand-new shoes

There is a woman in Somalia
The sun gives her no mercy
The same sky we lay under
Burns her to the bone
Long as afternoon shadows
It's gonna take her to get home
Each grain carefully wrapped up
Pearls for her little girl

Hallelujah

Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right

You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it, and then it flows right to you

So we rely on the past
And special moments that last
Were they as tender
As we dare to remember
Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss

The thorns we forget

We never spend a minute on regret

Second time is not quite what it seemed
Natural as the way we came to be

Why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love.

Take time if you're down on luck

It's so easy to walk out on love.
Take your time if the going gets tough
It's so precious.

So
If you want it to get stronger
You'd better not let go.
You've gotta hold on longer if you want your love to grow.
You gotta stick together
Hand in glove

Hold on tight
Don't fight
Hang onto your love!

In heavens name
Why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love
Be brave when the journey is rough

It's not easy when you're in love.
Don't be ashamed when the going is tough

It's not easy
Don't give up.
If you want it to get stronger

You'd better not let go
In heaven's name
Why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love
So
If you want it to get stronger

You'd better not let go
In heaven's name
Why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love
When you find a love
Don't let it walk away!
When you find your love you've got to make it stay.
Hang on to your love
Don't let it walk away!",Hang on to Your Love [US Remix],2003

His white shirt and his cuffs a little frayed

Looks like a princess in her new dress

Still in love with you

Now that it's all over, boy
There's something I think you should know
Baby, baby, think it over
Just one more time before you go

Call on me baby
If there's anything I can do for you
Please call on me baby
Help me see it through

Sade,"I was the one
I who could, pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet, and I gave you my love

You are the one who got me started
You could have let me love anyone but I only wanted you
So why did he make me cry
Why didn't you come get me one last time

You'll always know
The reason why
We could've had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go

You let me down
Left me for alliance
A long long time ago

You left me there dying
But you'll never let me go

You'll always know
The reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go

You'll always know the reason, why
The song you heard, will stay on your mind
It ain't goin' let you go, no
Cause you have removed the light in the sky

You'll always know
The reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't goin' let you go

Ain't goin' let you go

You have the keys to car

You have every star

Everyone of them twinkling

Thinkin 'bout what you thinkin'

I gave you more than I could give

And you took my love

What I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last
Didn't I give you

You brightened every day

J'écris dans l'hémoglobine frelon ma banlieue saigne

J'f'rais rentrer tous mes soces si jamais les portes s'ouvrent
Paro, pour dormir j'attends que tout le monde se couche
Les murs ont des oreilles, j'f'rais en sorte qu'ils n'aient pas de bouches
Vaut mieux que tu bouges, là je vais défendre ma ruche
Vodka, Kalashnikov: c'est mon coté russe
On en veux toujours plus, on en fais toujours plus
Faut que je pète un 6.3, Inch'Allah que je prennent plus jamais le bus
Elles écoutent toutes mes 16, j'ai ce petit plus

J'ai pu ouvrir pas mal de portes avec une clé de sol
Si personne peut les test, appelle-moi personne
J'ai deux gardes du corps, ils s'appellent Smith & Wesson
Et j'tire le frein à main d'un douze tonnes
Ces putains d'lossback rouspètent, j'suis un sale vieux bâtard, comme ODB du Wu-Tang
J'baise tout j'me barre à Phuket rien à foutre du Fouquet's
J'claque un salaire en un week-end quand j'traîne avec Luijet
Tu veux m'testes, prend un ticket, j't'allume ta race au briquet
Armes de l'est automatiques, on r'ssort des embrouilles nickel
Pas d'recette pour la richesse, donc on braque, pendant qu'tu dragues
Taff au black, on vend du crack et on s'dégrade pour quelques grammes

Frelon j'te dis bye bye, faut que j'fasse d'la maille maille
On bicrave tout même des apparts' demande à Abou Saï Saï
Moi j'suis un samouraï-raï, avec un corps de sumo
Chaque fois qu'jbaise une prod, neuf mois plus tard j'ai des jumeaux
Et j'offre des pruneaux, au mc's du 3ème age
Même si c'est eux qui bavent, c'est nous qui avons la rage
J'me dirige vers le toit, sans badge ni laisser-passer
Sniper dans l'étui a guitare, j'trouve le mitard à chaque pensée

Te-fein d'carte bleu maintenant c'est elle qui paie le resto
Belehni toi tu baises tout ? Handek personne te teste
A force de fumer d'la caille t'es complètement à l'Ouest
Traîner avec toi bouche de vielle ? Non, hors de question
Tu préfères t'gaver tout seul, jusqu'à l'indigestion
93 que des bonhommes, on a qu'une seule parole
Tu roules en CLS mais tu laisses en hass ta daronne
Sème une carotte, on t'arrose, un jour tout se paye!
Johnny Niuum parle pas aux bouches de vielles

Viens pas m'parler 10 piges. Niuum, j'prefère rester bref
Joue pas avec la rue, un jour tout se paye!
Ramène notre oseille, espèce de bouche de vielle
Tu laisses tes potes en hass? T'es qu'une bouche de vielle!

Ce soir on pète le champagne, aucun te-trai à ma table

Ils parlent tellement dans mon dos que j'sens venir la scoliose
Si tu halim on t'allume y'a qu'les montagnes qui n'se croisent pas
Pas d'bouches de vielles dans l'93, y'a qu'les cadavres qui s'tapent pas
T'as jamais rien à bédave, rien qu'tu chines, rien qu'tu baves
Tu passes très vite aux aveux, et ça les vrais le savent
Tu mens aux meufs, leurs met des disquettes légendaires
Tu parles de mariage, de marmots, leur mets plein d'choses en tête
Si elles tombent en cloque tu prends la poudre d'escampette
T'es qu'une bouche de vielle tu brasses du vent, une vraie tempête

Dîtes aux p'tits d'la tess de plus serrer la main aux poucaves
On t'accorde pas un regard, non même pas une recave
On t'arrache dans la seconde si jamais on t'vois en bécane
Tu parles mal sur les forums, gangster virtuel
En face tu perds la parole ou tu chantes comme Patrick Bruel
Gros la rue c'est cruel, comme attraper une tumeur
Il suffit d'une bouche de vielle, pour propager une rumeur
Viens pas m'sucer la bite, si t'as bouches a des rides
Tu parles mal, mais quand l'buzz monte poto tu veux un feat
Le chargeur se vide, je t'allume pour de vrai

Les anciennes têtes de réseaux se reconvertissent dans les finances

La légende de Johny Niuuum se raconte même dans les saloons
Suce mon gun avant de mourir tu crèveras de manière canon
Quand tu rentres dans ma banlieue, mets tes couilles sur vibreur
J'traîne qu'avec des rebeus hétéros y'a pas d'Rachid Bieber

Que dieu soit loué, on est àl wesh
On porte une bannière Personne ne nous aura
Y'a plus de bouteille à la mer les grossistes viennent sur le littoral
Plein de barbus repentis dans des flingues qui retentissent
Beaucoup de valeurs retranscrites j'écris des paroles trop sensées

Laisse passer ma team de Blaugrana
Les petits de la tess t'écoutent pas parce que t'es bien trop hené
Yeah, faire la guerre tant que des flingues il y a, joints d'hia

On charbonne H24, Banlieue Nord on sent le souffre
Ouiiii c’est le zoo, 93’zoo, bien plus fou que tout ton crew
On t’le prouve, frappe ta meuf hardcore même quand on zouk
Zou! Personne ne bouge, louche, ça part en partouze
J’fumais des mc’s maintenant j’en bicrave des cartouches
Que des harbouches, karlouches, prêts pour un sale coup
Avant de tomber dans l’oubli comme les enfants du Darfour
Partout c’est la merde, oui c’est la hass
Lachés comme des pits sans laisse, laisse la concurrence en stress

Et j’cours après mes rêves depuis tellement d’temps
J’suis tellement dedans que même le ciel m’entend
J’ai jamais changé d’camp, j’ai tracé tellement d’vant
En contre-sens vers le succès j’ai perdu tellement d’temps
J’ai plus envie d’me prendre la tête, laisse-moi prendre moi temps
J’vais foutre une sacrée merde mais laisse-moi prendre moi temps
J’arrive en fond d’sixième mais laisse-moi prendre moi temps

Rest In Peace, reste en hass
Pisse partout maintient le diez
On retourne les prods poto, ils retournent leurs vestes
Les p’tits manient l’neuf millimètres : click click BOUM!
On change de terrain, joue au foot quand les vils-ci tournent
Vite vite cours! Petit miboun
Avant qu'on fasse cracher les douilles
Noie les poucaves dans la Marne, ou dans le zit zitoune
Ça s'gratte quand y'a plus d'chite, plus d'chiffre, ou plus d'chatte
Le Diable m'a fait du pied, j'aurais même pu finir cul-de-jatte
Entre coup d'shlass et coup d'chatte, poto écoute ça
Quand on monte sur Me-da c'est pas pour prendre du gouda, woulah
J'fais la diff, victoire maladive, devant ma click
Tu t'chies d'ssus, même sans laxatif
J'viens d'là où même le plus blanc des blancs connait la dakatine
Kicker comme moi c'est impossible, déconseillé aux asthmatiques

Et j’cours après mes rêves depuis tellement d’temps
J’suis tellement dedans que même le ciel m’entend

Mic check, Niuum mic check
A l'aise au mic, comme Mike avec une balle de basket cousin

Arrête tes salamalecs cousine t'es pas Salma Hayek
Rageux, parle à mes ieps, j'suis pas strass et paillettes
J'arrive jamais à perdre si tu kiffes pas bara neyek
On fait passer des mallettes, l'oseille donne mal a la tête
Mes gars soulèvent des meufs, les tiens soulèvent des palettes
J'suis une menace pour le game, de l'arsenic dans mon couscous
Si j'fais crier le V12, à coté t'as l'air d'un pousse-pousse
Rentre dans le club, juste le temps d'un puff puff
Récolter deux trois tasses et retour vers le dom-tom
Trop d'meufs se croient vicelardes, jouent les saintes sur Facebook
Veulent nous mettre des disquettes mais elles sautent sur les mêmes zboubs
Non, les concurrents j'les baise tous
Appelle la balistique quand j'ouvre la bouche tu retrouves 16 coups

On aime cadrer les R1, faire crier les RS4 Break
On s'allume sans GPS, nique sa mère si les balles s'perdent
La tête pleine de prières si jamais ça tourne au vinaigre
Prêts à s'encastrer dans le mur, le crâne contre l'appuie-tête
J'suis pas né dans les toilettes, pourtant j'mène une vie de merde
J'aimerais baiser la Terre entière, jusqu'à ce que j'ai plus d'sperme
J'graillerai jusqu'à l'ulcère, j'ai qu'une envie c'est d'partir
Moi j'ai confiance en personne, frelon même pas en Darty
Dans leur bureaux ça sent le pastis, dans mes poches un million d'astuces
Avec le mal on pactise, pour alléger nos factures
Si jamais j'passe en radio, c'est toute la France que j'fracture
On attendrit pas la rue, on embrasse pas un cactus
En face j'vois que des acteurs, demande au poto Farctus
Dans le 9.3zoo même les barbus roulent en Brabus
La violence est d'actu, y'a pas qu'Apple qu'est tactile
C'est le casse du siècle et j'braque ma chance à l'arme factice
Extrêmement réactif, toujours un temps d'avance
Car ici c'est la jungle et chacun surveille sa branche
La concurrence a 120 piges avec le zen dans la blanche
A chaque fois qu'ils montent sur scène ils risquent de se péter une hanche
Nous on survit dans les tranchées, loin des soirées branchées
J'garde ce que j'ai en tête même si l'avenir à la gorge tranchée
Fais monter le buzz
Monte dans la Benz, on vend le meilleur seum poto n'ai pas la haine

Dans le business y'a pas de partage

Sous un soleil de plomb, de temps en temps des pluies de magma
J'suis pas la pour te faire peur de ma ville
Y'a des jours je sors que la nuit
Sur les gros ter-ter de coke, des anges ont brutalement perdu la vie
Que Dieu nous protège qu'il nous écarte du Diable
Tous les jours tu vas péter un câble
Plus de mecs calme que des baisés du crâne
Si tu parles tu vas manger des balles
Tous à sec, boule à Z
Vendent la Cc' et tout s'achète
Tous HS on roule la zéb'
J'fume avant que tout s'achève
Ça pue la téss, c'est une prison sans barreau
C'est paro, comme un ami d'enfance avec une seringue et un garrot
Fusillade pour du marron, laisse tout le monde sur le carreau
La balistique ramasse plus de balles chez nous qu'à Roland Garros
Paro, j'crache avec mes tripes
J'mécorche vif, un avenir en porcelaine voilà pourquoi j'égorge le beat
C'est mon seul moyen de m'en sortir, amortir
Abandonner, jamais j'préfère plonger nu dans les orties
C'est l'hymne des martyrs, apparition tardive
Tous de passage mais laisse une trace avant de partir

Elle m'a dit ""Trouve un taf!"" elle m'a fait mal à la tête (C'est bon!)
Donc je m'arrache de la baraque, je vais traîner dans la tess'
Bouge pas, deux secondes, y'a ma meuf qui m’appelle (Attends attends)
Elle a trouvé un mail en fouillant dans mon Facebook (Sa mère!)
Si t'y croyais, que y'a que dans le rap que je baise tout
J'ai pas envie de blablater, je trouverai plus tard une excuse
Je ferme mon téléphone et je monte dans le 4x4 Lexus
Qu'on m'a prêté la veille pour 2-3 semaines
Un service contre un service
On se débrouille, on fait de l'oseille
Et je suis en train de monter sur les Champs
Je veux leur foutre le seum gentillement
J'ai cartonné, j'étais à 200
À part ça rien de bien méchant

Ma mère me prend la tête, c'est pas graaave
Ma meuf m'a cramé, c'est pas graaave
J'ai cartonné la caisse, c'est pas graaave
Mais si tu veux croquer mon grec, ça c'est graaave

A peine sorti de l’hôpital, on m’a dirigé au poste
Ils ont trouvé 2 kilogrammes de shit dans mon coffre (C’est pas moi)
Je bicrave plus, aussi innocent qu’une bonne sœur
Mais là je suis grillé, je suis cramé, je suis dans le toaster
Hors de question de poucave, j’assume et je ferme ma gueule
Même si ça me fout le seum, je dois assumer tout seul
Ils me foutent en cellule, kho j’ai perdu la parole
Et là je tombe nez à nez avec 3 mecs que j’ai carotte
Je leur ai mis dans le boule #JohnnyArnaqueur
Je les ai rasé de près et j’étais pas coiffeur
Sur la vie de ma mère, ils m’ont pas fait de fleur
Ils m’ont niqué à terre, je passais un sale quart d’heure
J’étais censé passer du bon temps
Ces sales bâtards m’ont fait sauter une dent
Ils m’ont laissé baigner dans mon sang
A part ça, rien de bien méchant

Ils ont pété le kamaz, c'est pas graaave
J'ai fini en gard'à v', c'est pas graaave
On m'a pété la gueule, c'est pas graaave
Mais si tu veux croquer mon grec, ça c'est graaave

J'arrive devant la juge, muet comme une carpe (Bonsoir Madame La Juge)
Je sens que ça va barder je joue mes dernières cartes
Si la poisse était une drogue j'en ferais une overdose
C'est bizarre mais son visage me dit quelque chose
(Ah ouais je l'ai déjà vu)
Ça y est je m'en rappelle, j'espère qu'elle se rappelle pas
J'ai martyrisé son fils il était en Segpa
Je l'ai mis à l'amende jusqu'à maintenant je l’effraie
Je l'ai tellement fait bugué jusqu'à maintenant il béguais
Et, je fais pas faire le mitho franchement je suis en panique
Elle s'est souvenue de moi en lisant mon nom de famille
(Nan, pas moi)
Dans ses yeux j'ai compris, aller simple la son-pri
Malheur sur malheur, en une journée ils m'ont tout pris
Gros j'ai la poisse depuis la naissance
Je vais rester coffré pour longtemps
Je vais sûrement tomber pour 10 ans
A part ça, rien de bien méchant
(Rien de bien méchant gros)

Convoqué chez la juge, c'est pas graaave
Elle a reconnu ma tête, c'est pas graaave
Je vais finir au placard, c'est pas graaave
Mais si tu veux croquer mon grec, ça c'est graaave",C'est Pas Grave,2013
Sadek,"Je viens d'une cité qu'on appelle les Cahouettes
À Neuilly-Plaisance dans le 93
Ma vie c'est le charbon mes vêtements sentent la braise
Je me présente en chantant, Enchanté c'est Sadek
Je suis tombé dans le rap par accident
A 11 ans je me suis fait renversé en bas de chez moi
J'ai frôlé la mort sur un bloc de ciment
J'étais pas censé survivre, ça m'a donné la foi
Cloué sur mon lit pendant plus de 12 mois
Immobilisé j'ai fait que prendre du poids
C'est dans mon malheur que j'ai trouvé ma voie
Des milliers de couleurs apparaissent sur ma toile
Pour passer le temps j'ai commencé à écrire
Des images et des mots que j'étais incapable de dire
On étouffe nos peines dans la colère et les rires
Je suis marié à mon art pour le meilleur et le pire
Ni-ni-niuuum!

C'est le mektoub, le mektoub
Tu ressens mon son, c'est qu'on vient des mêmes tours
Si on doit m'enterrer tu sais que c'est le mektoub
Si un jour je dois prier ça sera le mektoub
C'est le mektoub, mektoub
Je cours derrière mes rêves je deviendrais peut-être fou
Si on doit m'enterrer tu sais que c'est le mektoub
Si un jour je dois prier ça sera le mektoub

Des tâches d'encres, ont entaché mon vécu
J'écoutais du rap pour panser mes blessures
J'ai commencé les clashs, génération 8 mile
Je sais que devant le collège ils se rappellent de mes phases
A mon carnet de chasse, plus de 200 visages
Plus d'un millier de freestyles, c'est un besoin vital
Rapper pour oublier toutes ces putains d'images
Je veux plus jamais voir ma mère sur un lit d'hôpital
Sans pitié, je les élimine me toucher ils peuvent pas
Demande au Quai 54, il me suffit d'une seule phase
Avec Hamadoun je voulais devenir une resta
Mais il m'a répondu que le rap ne l'intéresse pas, n'est-ce pas?

C'est le mektoub, le mektoub
Tu ressens mon son, c'est qu'on vient des mêmes tours
Si on doit m'enterrer tu sais que c'est le mektoub
Si un jour je dois prier ça sera le mektoub
C'est le mektoub, mektoub
Je cours derrière mes rêves je deviendrais peut-être fou
Si on doit m'enterrer tu sais que c'est le mektoub
Si un jour je dois prier ça sera le mektoub

Doudoune en couverture j'ai montré que j'étais un guerrier
Que j'avais plus de ressources qu'il n'y avait de bulle dans le Perrier
Je l'ai harcelé, la dalle a parlé pour moi
Forcé d'aller tout droit ou de disparaître dans un trou noir
J'ai promis au quartier, que je ferai jamais de coup bas
Que d'ici 3 ans je serais même plus fort que Booba!
5 ans dans une cave à forger mon écriture
Bicrave par nécessité, rêvant de petites coupures
J'irais chercher ma place, j'irais chercher mon bif
Booska Pétrification, il m'a suffit d'une seule prise
On gâche pas les munitions, gros, je mets tout le monde d'accord
Avec 2 freestyles j'ai signé en Major,
""La légende de Johnny niuum"", sort en 2012
Mon son vient du cœur, il a tourné partout
Je vous ai raconter le début de mon parcours
Mon destin entre vos mains il appartient au mektoub!

C'est le mektoub, le mektoub
Tu ressens mon son, c'est qu'on vient des mêmes tours
Si on doit m'enterrer tu sais que c'est le mektoub
Si un jour je dois prier ça sera le mektoub
C'est le mektoub, mektoub

Pour se rapprocher des tiens, t'attends qu'ils cannent
Artiste engagé comme son pronostic vital
Le diable remplit mille Stade de France, les anges même pas la Cigale
On est tricard, viré du casting
Toujours locataire, je me sens prêt à partir
Révolution sans pare-balles je traîne pas à Bastille
Je squattais rue de la Paix, je m'éteindrai rue des Martyrs
Chien galeux, pestiféré, je fais la cour aux mirages
Entre la cour d'école la cour d'assises la cour des miracles
Droit au but, c'est comme ça que je guide mes pirates
Invincible en ligne droite je partirai dans un virage
La vie m'a trompé, je m'éloigne de l'essentiel
En doigtant des brésiliennes, des marocaines, des séquentiels
A des années-lumières du ciel, on sera pas de ceux qui s'en sortent
Je tue le temps, en attendant qu'il m'emporte

À vos Glocks, citoyens

Prisonniers de cette matrice

Et je passe mon temps à me détruire
M'évader d'ici c'est tout ce que je désire
On souffre seul quand les lumières s'éteignent on saigne
J'ai vu des armes se lever vers moi, j'étais venu en paix
Et pleurer ne changera rien
Je suis qu'au début du film, je sens déjà venir la fin
Des Zidane potentiels décollent pas du foot en salle
On cherche l'amour en passant de chatte en chatte
Construire des châteaux de sable
Ma génération, dans le vice elle est noyée
Ici l'hémoglobine se mêle à la peinture
Nos parents se serrent la ceinture pour payer le loyer
Mais le loyer ne vaut même pas le prix de nos ceintures
Pour des histoires, on enrichit la balistique
Nos anciennes légendes s'éteignent dans des statistiques
Très peu de réussite, beaucoup de tentatives
Ici pour prouver les jeunes gâchent leur vie en un *click*

Je suis prêt à perdre, tout ce que j'ai en misant
Quitte ou double, je sois je crève puceau, je sois je crève puissant
Je me suis instruit, j'ai ouvert les yeux en lisant
Derrière leur miroir, ils s'amusent en nous brisant
Depuis tout petit on me fait croire que je peux gagner qu'en trichant
Taches de sang sur le tricot, rien de très attendrissant
Je peux même pas te garantir que je serai là dans dix ans
Je partirai d'une rafale dans le dos, j'entends déjà le GP 800

Sadek,"J'attends que l'aube me libère
Mon insomnie m’emprisonne
Maintenu les yeux ouverts
Les deux rétines qui frissonnent
Des images glaciales viennent torturer mes poèmes
Capuche noire, j'attends l'enterrement du Soleil
J'observe ces âmes qui errent hors du Jardin d’Éden
Cette meuf violée par son frère quand j'étais au collège
Cet addict au poker, qui tape sa fille quand il perd
Finies les Totally Spies, elle deviendra croupière
Ce mec en Ferrari, il transpire le charisme
Il vend les bijoux de sa mère pour frimer sur Paris
C'est la loi du plus fort, les disciples de Darwin
Jungle urbaine, zoo de béton, ghetto safari
Les tarifs arrivent, la cocaïne atterrit dans les narines
Paris by night, ça mitraille et graille, rien à foutre des caries
Je sais que tu me localises. Les petits respectent que les calibres
Drive-by en Ducati, faut être calife à la place du calife
Être plus vicieux que les autres, mentir comme un politicien
Être ambitieux. Vision nocturne, j'ai pas besoin d'un opticien
Dans la misère, été comme hiver, je suis aux petits soins
Loup solitaire, ils feront jamais de moi un gentil petit chien
Je compte pas jeter l'éponge, plus confiance en mon ombre
Et je pense qu'à faire la fête, boire à oublier mon nom
Je fais que creuser des tombes, survivre dans les décombres
Ouais mes couilles ont des pecs, car mon fusil fait des pompes
Parfois je pense vraiment que l'humain n'a pas d'âme

Des médecins légistes font l'amour aux cadavres
Et je pense à tous ces squats où les camés s'entassent
Où ils partagent le DAS' mais pas une dose de crack
De la réalité pour rêveurs sous morphine
Assommés par des anti-douleurs pour nous maintenir en vie
Nos parents tous exploités, usés et vidés
Le cerveau rempli de conneries par leurs journaux télévisés
Peu d'exemples autour de nous, très peu de gens à citer
Ils veulent qu'on se tire dessus, qu'on fume du shit, qu'on ait pas d'idées
Que nos sœurs soient perdues, matérialistes et vénales
Qu'elles aient pas le goût de l'indépendance, mais celui du Panamera
Dans mon zoo c'est l'usine, c'est dur de rester lucide
J'ai vu des schlags taper de la cèç même avec une sinusite
J'attends l'Antéchrist dans cette crise écologique
Un bunker atomique pour la guerre bactériologique
Je cogite, je m'agite avant de devenir une machine
Je me mutile. Ça vient de Russie, ma kalash crache des classiques
Je suis cet être en argile, qui file droit vers l'asile
Et je cherche la branche de la réussite sur un arbre au million de racines
En tutoyant la mort, je me suis senti vivant
En faisant du mal, on se sent si puissants
Entre rêves et cauchemars si hallucinants

Tes rêves seront mes rêves. Je veux que t'écrives notre BO
T'es Trinity, je suis Neo. Ti amo, te quiero!
Mon cœur bat, y a qu'avec toi que je me sens en vie
Si je dois y rester tant pis mais je sais que tu ne m'as jamais menti
Tu m'attendrais des années entières si jamais derrière les barreaux je pourris
Avec les bracelets, je m'évaderais pour revoir ton sourire
À nous deux on est invincibles, on affronterait un astéroïde
T'es la seule dans ma catégorie
Quand t'es mal, je me sens ""sorry""
Sorry! Sans toi, je frôle la folie

Touche mon cœur, il s'emballe. Prends ma main, on s'envole
Les gens bavent, les gens parlent, mais, tu sais, moi je m'en cogne
Car moi je me battrai même quand notre couple est en sang
Si nos disputes prennent feu, t'inquiète on renaîtra de nos cendres
Et tout ne sera pas rose, je veux pas que la vie nous escroque
T'es mon million d’émeraudes caché dans le fond d'un puits de pétrole
Je suis pas le gendre idéal, je possède un passé trouble
Peu importe les épreuves, faut que ta mère nous approuve
Et je dis stop, faut aussi que ton père m'aime
Leur manquer de respect, tu sais, je pourrai jamais me permettre
Pour te déclarer ma flamme, pas besoin de la plume de Verlaine

C'est toi que j'ai choisi pour faire ma vie

À part Johnny rien d'légendaire
Nique les Illuminatis et la grand-mère à Lucifer
C'est clair, tu sors du shtar t'embrasses ta mère
Pour les préserver, ils ont rien dit à tes petits frères
Veulent-ils vraiment que tu t'réinsères ?
Avec leurs vieux salaires de manutentionnaires
Tu montes une puce, fuis la galère
Loup solitaire et ramasse toutes les chiennes de guerre
Les condés n'savent plus comment faire
Ford Mondeo très loin derrière l'GSXR
Eh, sors à droite à Porte d'Auber', accélère
T'sais quoi faire, si tu t'fais prendre tu vas prendre cher

Ah ouais c'est clair

Numéro un sur le terrain, oh ça c'est clair

Sadek,"J'ai trop de haine, autour de moi on m'a beaucoup déçu
J'suis toujours le même, même si ma daronne me reconnaît plus
Moi, je garde en tête que les temps changent
Et que Lucifer était un ange
Étrange, ils m'appellent que quand ça les arrange
L'amour sincère, lui, va dans les deux sens
Je vais les mettre en miettes, j'ai du pain sur la planche
Pour mes Manjaques de Casamance
Tousnis, Bambaras, Peuls et Berbères
Mon rap, un petit réverbère qui éclaire toute la France
J'vais les uèt, sur ma vie que personne ne m'arrête
Je traîne avec quelques analphabètes
Qui suivent mes instructions à la lettre
Rien à foutre, t'façons on a rien dans la tête
Y'a même des mecs qui ont fumé des mecs
Qui ont jamais posé leurs lèvres sur une cigarette
Et les drames s'accumulent
Pas de destin fabuleux
Tu vois le croque-mort, salue-le
Pas d'enterrement qui s'annule
On a besoin d'un bon baveux
Qui manie l'art de la ruse
Faut pas qu'il connaisse bien la loi
Mais faut qu'il connaisse bien la juge
J'accélère, j'accélère
Roule un joint de frappe pour mes partenaires
Belvedere dans la glacière
Tous les feux sont verts, donc accélère
Accélère, grave déter
Comme tous mes frères qu'ils incarcérèrent
Mes adversaires, c'est les Lumières
Voltaire, Jay Z, Jacques Prévert
Rien à foutre de vous offenser
Quand les portes de chez nous se font défoncer
À 6 heures du mat', pendant la prière
Le daron menotté, tête collée au plancher!
C'est tentant de vider le chargeur en tremblant
Si tu me vois sur le banc c'est que j'ai pris la place de Laurent Blanc
J'les traumatise en chantant, allez cacher les enfants
Il baise ta meuf quand t'es à l'entraînement
J'appelle ça un poto rentrant
J'veux du vécu, paranormal, habitué
Dépossédé de nos quelques écus, à découvert même à la Sécu'
Le mur, je sais pas comment l'éviter
Ça m'étonne plus que la daronne pleure
Même quand je paie deux-trois guetteurs
J'ai du mal à dormir en sécurité
Dès la naissance, déshérité
Les dés sont lancés, les jeux sont faits
Mes sentiments ils sont partagés
Là je me sens loin et je me sens prêt
Y'a ceux qui restent, qui roulent des zdah
Ceux qui se lèvent pour aller taffer
Dans les deux cas, ça ne change rien
Tout le monde finira bombardé
Y'a ceux qui se taisent et ceux qui bavardent
Ceux qui bavardent finiront canardés
Y'a ceux qui l'ont fait et ceux qui en parlent
Mais ceux qui l'ont fait n'ont plus envie d'en parler",La  chute,2015
Sadek,"Tu te réveilles avec le seum
T'endors avec la haine
L'impression que le monde ne tourne plus là où on traîne
Là où on traîne que des habitants horrifiés

Tout le monde veut sa part
Donc ça part pour un rien
Faire du mal pour les siens
C'est un mal pour un bien
Mais qu'est ce que tu croyais?
Que vous alliez nous nettoyer?
Baisser la délinquance? Commence par baisser le prix du loyer
Nos anciens broyaient, nos doyens croyaient qu'on allait grailler
Enfance entaillée
Citoyen moyen, destin mitraillé
Nos vies seraient plus remplies si on remplissait nos cahiers
La défonce est un sport, on est tous médaillés
Faut continuer de se battre
Envahir leur fac
Irrattrapable au prochain flash on change de plaque
On change la carte, faut changer l'énoncé
Je peux pas rentrer chez moi je suis trop défoncé

Je fume une taff, j'allume un oinj
Une bouteille cul sec à ta santé
Chaque gorgée te baffe et tape tes méninges
Mais la vie ça fait moins mal quand on est défoncé
Défoncé
Du matin au soir on est tous défoncé
Défoncé
J'ai plus l'esprit clair ma défonce est foncé

Si tu savais y'a des jours j'ai peur de moi
Ça m'emmène tellement loin que je crois que je ne reviendrais pas
Un train de vie épicé que personne n'arrêtera
Appelle un menuisier, j'ai encore la gueule de bois

De l'aube au crépuscule
Prisonnier dans cette bulle
Le soleil veut que j'roule un joint
Je l'ai vendu à la lune
Plus rien à défendre, on a le temps de s'éteindre
Sans amour on s'esquinte, cœur brisé sur la détente
Pour supporter tout ça il me faut un kilo de zeb
Faut que je remplisse mon cerveau de fumée pour me vider la tête
Je roule sur les champs défoncé dans un Clio de merde
Si je me fais contrôler je fais même vomir l'éthylotest
J'en ai marre de cette vie, où cela nous mène?
Ça fait 10 ans que j'ai l'impression on vit la même semaine
La même semaine, d'ailleurs quel jour on est ?
Je voudrais aller au paradis mais je suis trop défoncé

Je fume une taff, j'allume un oinj
Une bouteille cul sec à ta santé
Chaque gorgée te baffe et tape tes méninges
Mais la vie ça fait moins mal quand on est défoncé
Défoncé
Du matin au soir on est tous défoncé
Défoncé
J'ai plus l'esprit clair ma défonce est foncé

Je fume une taff, allume un oinj et bois cul sec à ta santé
Je me rends compte qu'au final la vie fait moins mal défoncé
Fume une taff, allume un oinj et bois cul sec à ma santé
Tu verras bien qu'au final la vie fait moins mal défoncé

Uncle Si, there's no reindeer named Brittany
But do you remember the most famous redneck of all?
Uncle Si, reindeer, not redneck
Let me show you how it goes jack.

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw it,
You would even say it glows.

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say:
""Rudolph with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee,
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history!

Spoiled by common wealth
In your race for fortune

Cannot see what caused your fall
Lying dormant, your seed of faith
Has grown into a nasty vine

Delaying natural death, for a fear of what's beyond
Afraid to take that final step, to the place where you belong

Victimized by the Id

Now you tell me you're leaving
I beg you to stay

We can make it happen if we try

A one in a million gift from above
Don't give up on love

The memories start flashing
And tears start to fall
'Cause deep down inside
I've been trying to hide
This smile on my face
Is just a disguise

I know what's on her mind, her mind, her mind
She thinks I don't know what she wants to do
But I know her kind

She's the kind of girl who hates to see two people sharing a love so right
She's a jealous girl who hates to see two people sharing a love so tight
She'll try to use temptation

Take your imagination someplace where it shouldn't be
But it's not infatuation, it's such a love frustration
She's trying to take your love from me

Love is on her mind, so she better find another
The love she wants is mine but I'll never share my lover
Love is on her mind but she's never gonna get it
The man she wants is mine, so she better just forget it

She tells me how lucky I am to have a boy like you, like you, like you
She said she would never steal from a friend
I know that it's not true

I thought you were the one to open up my eyes 
But now I see you were just neglecting me 
How can you do this to me 
Cause I did not abuse your love 
You took my heart and you tore it apart 
And I tried to explain my love to you 
But it seems your love wasn't true 

[Chorus] 
Wondering if this love we had is true 
And I'm wondering was it me or you 
Wondering where did it go wrong 
And I'm wondering how it lasted so long 

There was a time when I thought that you were mine 
Just a touch, your love was in my mind 
You took my heart and you tore my soul apart 
Why'd you use me from the start 
You used to lie to me 
Cause you said the truth would hurt me 
And your thoughts were always wrong 
But my love for you was so strong 

[Chorus: x2]

Girl you know what I needed 
I needed some of that good lovin' 
Yeah baby, the one that only you can give me 
Only you, but now you're gone 
And this love affair of ours is over 

My friends tell me that her love was never true 
But I always thought it would be something new 
But she kept my love suspended like a puppet on a string 
But tell me babe, did you really love me 
You know what I needed 
I needed your love

Are all his dreams merely fantasies
And would it all fall in on him some day

Amid all the things he worked so hard for
And wonders was his energy well spent
Whatever the price
He is where he wants to be
The end has justified the means and all

Will there be enough time for plenty of planned preparation

So a terminal wine he would treat.

Dashing past

Saga,"(lyrics by Michael Sadler)
Early morning instrusion
The accusations spelt conclusions
I'd been under suspicion
Now my fate was their decision
That's why they took me away
Midnight courtroom confusion
The sentence of guaranteed seclusion
(no more Ernie Bilko)
Next day found me in isolation
Working on my rehabilitation
I've been framed
Have you no shame?
Yes, but I've been framed ... again!
I've been framed
No, you're to blame
No!  I've been framed .. again!
I've been framed
You're taking the blame
Yes, but I've been framed ... again!
I've been framed
No, you're to blame
No!  I've been framed ... again!
Two weeks later I saw the daylight
No way of knowing who to credit
(for the education)
Confused and anxious, I started walking
Next time I'll watch just who I'm talking to
I'd been framed
Had you no shame?
Yes, but I'd been framed ... again!
I'd been framed
No, you're to blame
No!  I'd been framed .. again!
I'd been framed
You took the blame
Yes, but I'd been framed ... again!

Saga,"Good afternoon! May I introduce myself?
With a story to be told you may need help
I know you were a headline for some time
But now you're part of a motionless mime
Lights have dimmed and times have changed
And the world is watching a different stage
Don't you think it's time we had a younger face?
You can slip away with no disgrace
So tell me ...
How long should we wait around
Don't you understand, when you're down we're down?
The memory of a lasting fame
Is better fed on reruns, no shame
So tell me ...
There's one thing I must know
Tell me why you can't let go
There's one thing we must know
Tell me, why won't you let go?
How long do you think you'll last
Living with a continuous past
As you stare at us we say,
""You're looking less like me each day!""

Saga,"Far down below
He could see the scars
Left from the night before
Shadows of strength
That once stood firmly
Now laying in waste everywhere
An echo of planned
Resistant pounding
Still hanging thick in the air
A sudden arrival
No sound of warning
No time, no time
To prepare
As the clouds
Continued to open
Each vision was hard to believe
A horizon
Minimal motion
As far as the eye could see

So much promise
His today only misbelief

Salvaging all they could see

'Cause when the lights come up
I'll have my eye on you
Once you mistook me
For the menace, the menace
Oh, if you'd only known
And that last confrontation
Was just a warning, so that you'd know
What would happen
If you push me too far
You'd better stop the running 'round and listen
'Cause when the lights come up
I'll have my eye on you
I see a cloudless sky before me
I'm searching for the ones, I'm searching for the ones
Who'd like to leave this all far behind them
And when I find you all we'll fade away
Maybe I'll be back, maybe I'll be back
In some other way
You'd better stop the running 'round and listen
Stop the running 'round and listen
'Cause when the lights come up

Saga,"Sammy's sleep was short that night
He heard a sound turned on the light
He was all alone in there
All the noises had him scared
He made his way down the stairs
Then the sounds were everywhere
He grabbed his daddy's gun
Felt safe from everyone
It's dangerous
In no man's land
So dangerous
His hands were shakin' but he wouldn't dare
Look through the curtains cause he was so scared
People running from the shop
A fire burning down the block
He saw their faces, but they looked so mad
Whatever happened he knew it was bad
He was so alone in there
The sky was bright, smoke filled the air
No one gives a damn
Living in no man's land
No one understands
Living in a no man's land
Said they'd be home, but they weren't there
Where did they go, don't they care
To be a child alone that night

One little boy forced to hide
Became a man from what he saw that night
They reached into Sammy's eyes
And took away his smile",No Regrets,1982
Saga,"There was a man who thought
He could avoid all of the things
That stood up in his way
Friends would say that he should
Plan to spend more time
There's lots of trouble in a day
With just enough work
And a short line to a goal
He was so sure he could secure his place
He wanted a lot and was so
Quick to say how this small
World was unfair to its race
He'd spend his time, spends his time
Deciding routes with lines, routes with lines
There was no time, was no time
For corners in the lines, corners in lines
[Chorus]
Your pathway grows dark
Was clear at the start
You're not! You're not! You're not alone
Your pathway grows dark
Was clear at the start
You're not! You're not! You're not alone
Not listening to the people whe were close
There always seemed to be an easy way
The work was tiresome, a thing to avoid
Leaving lots of time so he could play
He'd spend his time, spend his time
Shortening lines, shortening lines

I want to touch you but if I touch you
All will change
I want to hold you but if I hold you
All will change
I've been here watching you all through the night
Why does it scare me so to look into your eyes
Where will you go, what will you do
Who will you meet, what will become of you?
Your mother won't see you she's far too afraid
And I don't have the money to keep you today
Maybe someday our paths will cross
It's better this way, good-bye and good luck
I want to touch you but if I touch you
All will change
I want to hold you but if I hold you
All will change

a) The Cross (Home #3)

The boy is here, he won't say much
I don't know why
One thing is clear, we know he's had a troubled life
You are not who I had in mind
I don't know where I belong, but I'm sure that it's not here
Is he just shy, what do you think he's got to hide
Maybe in time, we'll find out what's behind those eyes
I don't think that you understand
All I want is to find out who I am
Father, when will I get my cross?
When will I get my cross?
I don't know how,
I wonder what would make him smile
Look at him now, he stares at me like I'm on trial
I need to know is he still alive
And if so, is my mother still his wife?
He's just a child, he's got time to start again
Give him a while
The boy just needs a friend
Father, when will I get my cross?
When will I get my cross?

I can't seem to stop it
I just wish I had more time
I'm in a hurry can we wrap it up
Will you try to to scratch it
Don't mark it up
I've got a hunger for the things that sparkle
I've got a thirst for the things that shine
Everyone a winner
Everyone amazing
Everyone a shocker
Everyone to tantalize
Don't mark it up!
Everyone a sure thing
Everything's tempting
Everyone must tantalize
But don't mark it up!

Saga,"Listen to the tales and romanticize
How we'd follow the path of the hero
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun
How we rise to the height of our halo

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations
None of us have actually been there, not like you

Ignorant siblings in the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy, spare me
None of them can even hold a candle up to you
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see

But enough about the collective Judas
Who could deny you were the one
Who illuminated your little piece of the divine?

And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely
On your way your way home

Oh, what are they going to do when the lights go down
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they going to do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?

High is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground
You were the light and the way they'll only read about
I only pray, Heaven knows when to lift you out
10, 000 days in the fire is long enough, you're going home

You're the only one who can hold your head up high
Shake your fists at the gates saying, ""I've come home now
Fetch me the spirit, the son, and the father
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended, it's time now
My time now, give me my, give me my wings""

You are the light and way that they will only read about

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance
(With the)
Burden of proof tossed upon the believers
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence
Judith Marie, unconditional one

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this bold suggestion but
Should you see your Maker's face tonight
Look Him in the eye, look Him in the eye and tell Him
""I never lived a lie, never took a life but surely saved one
Hallelujah, it's time for You to bring me home""

Sage Francis,"(A healthy distrust)

(Will Oldham)
The force of my love was strong
The sea lion laying down on
The song in the air
Was fritting her care
With singer can be among song
(x2)

(Sage Francis)
Ma, ma look what I did ma
Look what I did to my hands
I broke 'em
You gave me the stone, gave me the chisel
Didn't say how to hold 'em
Didn't say give away every piece of the puzzle
Till I was left with nothin'
But I took it upon myself to crush it up and distribute the dust
Get in the bus, hop in the van
Jump in the water, crawl to the land
Build another castle out of the sand
Break it down and then I get into the saddle again
Gone city to city
I'm already lost to the boss
Who is new in town
I'ma ride this horse till it bucks me off
And I'm forced to shoot it down
I'ma take him out for some gasoline
I'ma trade this cow for some magic beans
Make mom proud of the deals that I've made
Cause I'm just a modern day Johnny Appleseed
But I'm glad that I never passed the gins
And I never put down the axe
Piano man got checkered dance floor
The grace and the painful look on his face
Cause the crowd is packed
And the louder they clapped
The less he is able to make the connection
Between what he sees when he hears certain notes
And the hurt that is shown in his facial expression
I don't need your 'go-ahead' to go ahead
y'all don't know if sales gon' be-easy
But sweet Jesus who wants to sleep with me
Way to many moves to learn
But not enough people to put 'em on
Look it mom
No hands
I built a suit of armor with wooden arms

Sage Francis,"I just sit there and let the thoughts flood
And I remind myself it's all right, it's all good, it's all love
It's not though 'cause there's a kink in the armor
A pothole I'm sinking in while I think of the drama

So I stand up, start to pace in my living room
Set my eye to the highway knowing that I'll play chicken soon
There's a vanity plate with my name on it
There's a Davey Crockett hat with a Masonic fat cat under it

A musket rifle spitting at my feet
They want me to dance in the middle of the street
And I respect my elders, so I do as I'm told
But I offset the bell curve when I do it with soul, losing control

Guilty feet do have rhythm, they just dance to
The wrong theme music to amuse the villain
Instead of killing, I'll spare the raccoon
And start filling sandbags as I stare at the moon
And let the thoughts flood

Blessed are those who are dammed when the levee broke
How many choked on the steps to a slow dance?
A staircase to a hug with no hands
Accountability hung out to dry on the line of command

We let the thoughts flood
We remind ourselves it's all right, it's all good, it's all love
It's not though 'cause there's a kink in the armor
A pothole I'm sinking in

Sharing a drink with my father
It's a family affair, the vanity we share
The waterline is rising, all we do is stand there

",Waterline,2007
Sage Francis,"It's been a long and lonely trip 
But I'm glad that I took it because it was well worth it.
I got to read a couple books 
And do some research before I reached my verdict.
Never thought that I was perfect.
Always thought that I had a purpose.
Used to wonder if I'd live to see my first kiss.

The most difficult thing I ever did was recite my own words at a service
Realizing the person I was addressing 
Probably wasn't looking down from heaven.
Or cooking up something in hell's kitchen trying to listen in 
Or eaves drop from some another dimension
It was self serving just like this is.

Conveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas.
The television went from being a babysitter to a mistress.
Technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance
Til we just stayed distant and never touched.
Now all we do is text too much.

I don't remember much from my youth. Maybe my memory is repressed.
Or I just spent too much time wondering if I'd live to have sex.
Fell in love for the first time in 4th grade 
But I didn't have the courage to talk to her.
In 8th grade I wrote her the note
But I slipped it in someone else's locker.

Considered killing myself 'cause of that.
It was a big deal. It was a blown cover.
It was over for me. My goose was cooked.
Stick a fork it me. The jig is up.
I blew my chances the rest is history
Our future was torn asunder.
It became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer.

At least I didn't include my name.
Thankfully I wrote the whole note in code
And it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open.
Plus it was set to self destruct.
Whoever read it probably died laughing.
I wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened.

A year later I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her.
I had someone else to obsess over.
I was older. I was very mature.
I forged my time signature 
While practicing my parents autograph 'cause I was failing math.
Disconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home.

I checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road.
Steamed open a couple envelopes like I was in private detective mode.
If you snoop around long enough 
For something in particular you're guaranteed to find it.
For better or worse that's how I learned 
That it's best to just keep some things private.
It was the best of times. It was the end of times.

It was the best of times. It was the end of times.
I was always on deck I was next in line.
An only child with a pen and pad writing a list of things that I could never have.
The walls in my house were paper thin.

Every squabble seemed to get deafening.
If my memory serves me correctly 
I made it a point to void and forget some things.
Probably to keep from being embarrassed.
Never meant to upset or give grief to my parents.

Kept my secrets hid my talents 
In my head never under the mattress

Therapy couldn't break me.
Never learned a word that would insure safety.
So I spoke softly and I tip toed often.
The door to my room was like a big old coffin.
The way that it creeked when I closed it shut.
Anxieties peaked when it opened up.
As if everything that I was thinking would be exposed.
I still sleep fully clothed.
It was the best of times. 
It was the end of times.

It was beautiful.
It was brutal.
It was cruel.
It was business as usual.

Heaven. 
It was hell.
Used to wonder if I'd live to see 12.

When I did I figured that I was immortal.
Loved to dance but couldn't make it to the formal.
Couldn't bear watching my imaginary girlfriend
Bust a move with any other dudes.

Tone Loc was talking bout a ""Wild Thang""
But I was still caught up in some child thangs.
Scared of a God who couldn't spare the rod.
It was clearly a brimstone and fire thang.

Pyromaniac. 
Kleptomaniac.
Couldn't explain my desire to steal that fire.
Now I add it to my rider.
Like ""Please oh please don't throw me in that patch of brier!""
It was the best of times. It was the end of times.

The school counselor was clueless 'cause I never skipped classes.
Perfect attendance. Imperfect accent.
Speech impediment they could never really fix
And I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses.

Considered doing something that would cripple me.
I wanted a wheelchair. I wanted the sympathy.
I wanted straight teeth so then came braces.
4 years of head gear helped me change faces.
It was the best of times. 
It was the end of times.

Now I wonder if I'll live to see marriage.
Wonder if I'll live long enough to have kids.
Wonder if I'll live to see my kids have kids.
If I do I'm gonna tell 'em how it is.

""Don't listen when they tell you that these are your best years.
Don't let anybody protect your ears.
It's best that you hear what they don't want you to hear.
It's better to have pressure from peers than not have peers.
Beer won't give you chest hair. Spicy food won't make it curl.
When you think you've got it all figured out and then your universe collapses 
Trust me kid it's not the end of the world",The Best of Times,2010
Sage Francis,"I'm a slow man looking for a slow woman who wants to slow dance. 
I'm a slow man in my slow man stance. 
Looking for a slow woman who don't care that I'm old lookin'.

Or got my soul tooken back where the fallen angels land.
I know Brooklyn like the back of a stranger's hand.
Can't recognize my own, I wing it though.
I bring it home. 
Familiarity's the first thing to go.
Next thing you know, there's a photo that you're staring at.
And you can't quite place the face that is staring back.
Someone erased the names and the facts, dates on the back.
Maybe they're just fading so fast
That you can't keep up with it. 
Can't recover it.
Lost in the shuffle of the Grand Prix hustlers.
If you can't keep up to speed with the mother ship
And can't take the heat then your man needs the oven mitts.
I can't be the judge of it. 
My hands bleed
'Cause they reached for some answers and got trampled by a stampede
Of know-it-all homogeneous types. 
The look-alikes.
The kids burn my music and the parents burn the books I write.
I think back to those lonely Brooklyn nights.
I was either soul searching or just looking for fights.
Each woman had her price. 
The dice didn't roll right.
All my jobs were odd ones, my problems had bold type.
Snow White didn't expect that I'd leave 'er.
The strobe light set off epileptic seizures.
I know right from wrong when I write these songs.
My goals in life ain't what I set my sights on.

Slow man. Gotta get up and go, man. 
I know, man. It's like I'm half of a whole man. 
Gotta get back on the program. So let's go, man.

I'm a slow man in my slow man stance.
Looking for a slow woman who wants to slow dance.
I'm a slow man in my slow man stance.
Looking for a slow woman who don't mind my home cookin'.

I'm no good when I'm a bad, bad man.
I'm gonna dance so slow that it appears to be my last stand.
But I'm a bad bad man.
I'm gonna dance so slow that it looks like a photo.

Truth be told. 
It takes more than having a picture taken for you to lose your soul.",Slow Man,2010
Sage Francis,"You gave me language as a gift, I turned it against you
I was stupid, I was young, I was hanged by my Judas tongue
You shouldn’t give weapons to kids that don’t know better
I can't possibly understand that there’s no such thing as forever
For every letter in the alphabet
You said connect ‘em to a happy word, no matter how bad things get
I did my best, but the pickings got slim
Once I arrived at “X” and I had to think of synonyms
Weight ‘em against the antonyms, I was hanging with all the mannequins
Who are on a constant search for a person’s amputated limbs
Almost offered up my own, trading in my arms and legs
You said learn to express yourself if you’re gonna stand for things
I stood up with that expression, stood up against everything including you
I was stupid, I was adolescent, but I had your lessons to cling on to
And I want you to know how much it helped
Considering everything that I’d gone through
It was a period without periods, run on sentences were like binges
I was a comma with no cause, a rebel with no clause
Anxiety is no excuse once there’s nothing left to separate
We could have connected, but didn’t
I was ignorant, passed out on the spacebar
The further we drifted apart the closer
I came to realizing just how amazing you are
Now that you’re gone I'mma say it to the stars
‘Till my words knock worlds off their axes and the universe collapses

Thank you for the matches, for the gift of fire
For the wood and the axe, for whooping my ass
For the wheel even if you didn’t invent it
For the impact that you had on me, it’s epic, thank you for the effort
For teaching me the ABC’s even if I never make my way to “Z”
Even if I never do for someone else exactly what you did for me
Thank you

I was a stupid son of a gun with initials carved into me
I was a stray, a runaway, afraid someday you’d shoot me
So I scratched off the letters with a pocket knife
It’s how I loss my way when I was tossed into the fray
This is not my life, who am I kidding, it's a thank you note
Disguised as a written apology for everything you taught to me
So awkwardly I approach the open microphone with everything that I wrote
Clear my throat, adjust the collar on my coat
As I rock crowds, microphones and boats and then I stroke
Whatever little ego I have left, I should have left it at the alter
But I didn’t cause I’m an idiot, self-deprecating author
With a paperback edition that isn’t worth a flip through
If I don’t give you the credit that you deserve
You edited the words from the grave and beyond
From the first sign of sun raise at dawn
Till the moonbeam set blaze to my lawn
The universe collapses on my front steps
So we get to share in that moment, for just one moment
And nobody’s upset, there’s no more anger, there’s no more sunsets
So I crawl back in the chamber, you can shoot me up
You might as well, we had great communication before the tower fell

Thank you for the matches, for the gift of fire
For the wood and the axe, for whooping my ass
For the wheel even if you didn’t invent it
For the impact that you had on me, it’s epic, thank you for the effort
For teaching me the ABC’s even if I never make my way to “Z”
Even if I never do for someone else exactly what you did for me
Thank you

I'mma do my best, while you rest in peace",Thank You,2014

Made haters believers, or beliebers, look at me sir

Eat your heart out used to take the BART out
To the city from my mom house, now I ball with my tongue out
Pull out my chain and think that the sun out

It should be already platinum before it come out

Hoes waitin' for a nigga on pluto
So why on earth would I be waitin' on you for
I got a bad girl like everyday
Nighttime, mouth look like a sunny day
I'm in a new whip switchin' every other lane
While you walkin down the street switchin every other way

But the pedal drive fast, you was raw
Talkin' 'bout 'How long did it last?'

Still 'tryna get a girl from the seventh grade
It's like 'Damn why you teasin' me?'
Nice shape, and her face is Alicia Keys, yikes!
But I ain't trippin', there's bigger fishes to reel in
Relationships, when does the 'real' come in?
Sleepin' on me like when does the pill kick in?
Pick a thug and it's over like Dave's shit, man

I been 'tryna make it better for your life
And you know I'm 'finna ask you, so you know how to deny
You lay back and enjoy it, don't you
But you know I got racks to put on it, don't you

You ready for us, 'cause its about to go down
Push 'em to the left, push 'em to the right
Load them choppers up, hit 'em on sight
Never turning back, I've done been in hell and back
Me running out of guns, nah never heard of that
I ain't never ran from a gunfight

Respiratory begging for relief, I don't let 'em breathe
Going hard I'm my own boss, many ain't believe it,
A feeling not an item, appearing up out of thin air
Conquer everything that's in front of me, now they under me
Rush to lead and respond, they strayed away how a tunnel be
Took a leap of faith bungee cord about to give out
Nowadays whatever you say you gotta live out
Altitude have a parachute failure we got a problem
Grow a set of wings or die when you hit the bottom
Never prayed to god, but never too late to try him
Shots fired, Allen Iverson in the league
They say I ball hog and I'm not a part of the team
Breadwinner with these winners, built the regime
Taliban weapon in hand, kill everything
Amphetamines alter the state of a better means
I'm beautiful but known for the dope like Medellin

Dressing all black like a funeral
Murder, homicide wanna ride get residuals
Living on fire for residuals
365 when I grind for residuals
45 magnum in the van with 'em
Ratta tatta tat I let the blam hit 'em
I scream  fuck the whole world and put a bomb in it
Finger on the trigger tryna put my whole arm in it
I just want revenge

Straight on that's the way we know what it takes

Everything was going so right till you came along
Just try to shake us down from the sky

I say it will pass you say this time it's never ending
You say it's elusive it's out of your reach
I say the solution might be closer than it seems

I know you got reasons for shutting me out
You say it's so bad that the bad is all you can depend on
It won't come easy and it won't come good
But I can be patient
I tell you next day is better ending

And I swore I could see right through your empty heart
I know you can't take it anymore
And I thought I could fill it but I'm back at the start
You know I can't help you anymore

You were offering more than I could ask for that night
You were holding me up when I was on my way down
As well as I knew I never realized

You look right through me
I'm sure you'd see

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love

When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

Spazzed out, grab a white bitch by her titties

Rock wallabies, this is Clarkology
You know copy Starky belong wit the triple technology
Quick wit the pistol, leave you cripple if you lyin', be
Tickle the butter soft nipples on the side of me

So muthafucka, let me slow that flow down
And bang an ol' mighty hammer like Joe Brown
Dust off rounds, surround sound, trey pound
Put a phat leather head to bed like night gowns

If ya'll wit me then build, shorty, brothers is real
We true dons, makin' glass on the cash is on
Get my head right and smash yours moms, kid
So chose me, the bitch greased my palms

I'm on the residence, so don't shit on me
Like cool G. rap I got the Ill Street Blues
You lose, you can rich them out of my shoes

Wit the sound, RZA will make it all right

The raspberry bikini on honey wit the black berry
Had my eyes bulgin', plus my pants bulgin'
Ready for indulgence, long stroke compulsions

I'm lookin' for devotion, slow motion

Sex on the ocean, nine inch explosions
Had me frozen like the icicle

Fout tout le reste dans le caniveau
Bousille pas ton cerveau car les ondes sont gravés
Et tu décale ta sono, abattez mes rivaux

Et t'as peur de rencontrer le reste do commando

Don't feel shame, don't feel love, 
More champagne for our game,
It's insane but it's aaah!
Do you wanna ruin my life? Say what!
You wanna tell my wife? Please stop!

Comme la muraille de Chine, on affronte le temps
Résiste au vent, conquérants, compacte est le team
Hardcore, d'accord, mais sonore est le crime
Une main droite vers le firmament
Pour faire briller les yeux, garder les nôtres ouverts
Donner du miel au corps lorsque la vie devient sévère
Faire que les frères vivent, avant que tout s'écroule
Et que les fachos flippent à chaque fois qu'on approche les foules
Parce que la rue a plus d'enfants que jamais
Et d'inconsience n'est plus, le pognon l'a violée
C'est une mission à vie pas un CDD
A l'heure ou tout ce qui serrait les coudes et ne possédait
L'aliment suprême, c'est vital pour les miens
Nos âmes s'engavent à chaque nouveau festin
Au creux de ses mains, l'esprit abaissé
On cherche pas le graal, tout ce qu'on veut c'est exister par là

Au nom du flow, des rimes et du sens aussi

On a le gros son dans le sang, (le silence est sciant?)
Le seum, on se sent bien hein, pourquoi changer de chaise?
Pour un peu de lumière en plus? Nah c'est pas la peine!
On porte ça dans les veines, depuis l'époque ou on partait jouer en bus
Qu'on partageait les 5 billets de 100 fancs après le live comme les crêpes
Une façon de vivre, parfois ils nous vident
Dans nos poches, c'est dire si les sommes résident
A nous voir dans le vrai, le temps passe comme les illusions
Les bras se sont ancrés de lois
Et nos pensées quand on rentrait le soir
On voulait changer le monde, le monde nous a changés, l'espoir
Les intentions roulées dans le blé
Et les petits chimpanzés on danse sur leurs falaises ancrées
Peut importe ce qu'il y a écrit dans les colonnes
Guerlain on l'emmerde on a grandi dans l'eau de cologne!
Dans notre univers, on ne sait même pas qui c'est
Je me sens comme Travolta qui va au 2001 Odyssey
On est des Tony Manero du rap
La passion, un large vécu
Y a les Bee Gees qui chantent quand on marche dans la rue
Tout ce qui compte, c'est la

Der Winter wird lang für die Vorratskammer
Beutetour mit dem Vorschlaghammer
Und sie sagen übertrieben wie die Typen da abgehen!
Rapper klauen Ideen, doch wir haben genügend zu erzählen
Toys schieben Krise dit' Ding läuft wie ne' Maschine
Hau alles aufn' Kopf, was ich heute verdiene
Deshalb komm mir nicht mit
Kann nicht mehr, bin schon zu blau

Veux-tu bien revenir, s'il te plaît, notre monde part en c
J'ai essayé de t'écrire mais tu ne réponds pas
Passe faire le hello, les mots ne comptent pas
Et si tu doutes encore que ça peut aider
Sache qu'un nombre infini de personnes ici continuent de t'aimer
Même, si bizarres sont les âmes
Et que des prétendants viennent te draguer avec des armes
Laisse tomber, Paix, ce n'est pas toi qu'ils veulent, c'est l'blé
Et ils désirent le récolter en paix
Si tu voyais par quoi les cœurs sont hantés
Tu saurais que la guerre n'est pas l'plan B
C'est le A et, bouches plombées
Peu importe, c'est en ton nom au final que des soldats sont tombés
Paix, on t'a cherché de partout, tu étais cachée
Dans l'endroit le plus secret, au fond de nous
On a tous dû balancer la clé dans le bol de la routine
Les mains se sont lavées, Paix
Reviens nous voir un de ces quatre
Car les mots et la raison de tes chemins s'écartent

Ne vois-tu pas qu'on prie presque toutes les nuits?
Pour ne pas que tu nous oublies
Tu nous laisse là, face à la folie (yeah)

Qu'il soit de nouveau vénéré, pour qu'il puisse enfin s'élancer
Et qu'on puisse l'enlacer sans fin et sans se faire menacer
Faut que tu repasses un de ces quatre, tu nous manques
C'est grave tout se dégrade, regarde, on clame ton nom du fond des tranchées
On espère ton retour assis à l'ombre des blindés
On s'étrangle on s'traite d'étrangers, l'amour au mur épinglé
Et l'avenir blessé se meurt à l'ombre des cinglés
Paix, étendras-tu ton voile sur les rêves de nos mômes
S'il te plaît dis-moi que si besoin est, tu leur feras l'aumône
Et préserves-les des fautes des grands, des conséquences
Dis-leur qu'en temps de guerre y'a que les cons qui dansent
Tes yeux nous disent qu'on t'a déçu, c'est devenu une habitude
Chaque fois que tu nous prends à l'essai, insensés, on te crache dessus
Mais c'est pas la majorité, ça non
On reste nombreux à espérer, qu'un beau matin tu débarques dans le salon
Le problème c'est qu'on est pas digne de ça
Chaque fois que tu baisse ta garde on sort les avions d'chasse
Et si, un jour le genre humain te fait haïr ce monde, s'il te plaît
Avant de le quitter ne crache pas sur nos tombes, Paix

Ne vois-tu pas qu'on prie presque toutes les nuits
Pour ne pas que tu nous oublies?

And I know that ill be rite here with the nation

We live in a place where babies are born addicted to base
If you get arrested you likely to get kicked in your face
A lot of bitches is sick with the ""H.""
If you dont want the ""I.V."" think before you put your dick in her waist
Its a disgrace theres only one particular race
That got fucked ever since we got shipped to the states
Like being trapped in a pit full of snakes
They callin the coke dandruff the ghetto been inflicted with flakes
I listen to rap but wouldnt let my kid listen to that
Cuz if my kid listen to that then its a wrap
Niggas replace wisdom with materialism
I use the rhythm to preach about imperialism
I get on it like martin luther king and do the damn thing

Only once every five years somebody get caught
How many lives must heroin cut short
How many us folk gotta grow up to smoke shoot sniff or snort
We no longer serving them dimes to manuever through turbulent times
Me and my niggas murdering rhymes
My life breathe like a verse in a song
So its in the quran word bond yah gonna worship the don
Convict since a young age face plastered on the front page
Picture me workin for minimum wage
I went in a rage packed the mack 10 and the gage
In the streets I seen more action that nicholas cage
Buck one for my niggas locked for using a gun
Buck two and them niggas that bucked Roo fuck you
Buck three for lucky
Buck four for all my dawgs up north lets get this jump off jumped off

My games here to party, just to cut up a rug
Don't make me want to cut up a thug

Four bitches guardin' me safely as we walk to the window
The cashier was scared, she asked for my info
The manager arrived with two guards, that's an insult
That's the cause, just because
We talkin' bout 5 million dollars here, this ain't Play-doh dough
And your horoscope read, you gon' slay those lows
We got scribbes, Anthony Acid, rockin' the show
Special guest: Starks / Mark Ronson
First five hundred bitches went crazy he let them on and in
All he did was plug me in, I got the chargin'
Got they bras and ran through they whole apartment (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)

Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)

When I step into the party, all the ladies want to know
I'm hangin' wit the ballers, yeah, or my nigga Ghost
I can tell you what they say haters, if you want to know
They say ooooooh wee
When I'm roll in my Mercedes, all the ladies want to roll
Be my Juliet and I can be your Romeo
If you actin' menace I can pick another hoe
Oooooooooh weee (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
In the middle of the summer, or even twenty below
I'm a bad muthafucka, I'm way to fuckin' cold
Let me tell you what they say, when I'm pullin' off my drawers
They say ooooooooooh weeeee

Aiyo, aiyo
My games here to party, just to cut up a rug
Don't make me want to cut up a thug
Now play something for D.J., 'cause there's nothin' but love
Hosted by the ladies who lookin' for somethin' to rub
When we roll out, we roll on dubs, rollin' up bud
The Theodore Unit, we controllin' the club
Mamies, shakin' they ass, they throwin' it up
Like a B.E.T. commercial, I'm ""wrappin' it up""

Put your hands up

Ladies and gentleman your now rockin' with the best
Just Blaze, 
Put your hands up Swizzy, 
Put your hands up Diddy
One two three here we go

Microphone check one two what is this?
The Yardfather coming to give niggas the business
It's so beyond rap, cock sucker we live this
So um, come on baby, come on, come on and witness
The next ten years of this shit, the slickness is deliberate
Lyrically it's as sick as it get
I been in the pen, been in the jects, been in the inter taps
I been in the Benz, been in the Lex, been in the M.S.X.
Yes, I run ringers around the fraudulent type
Come here and I'll show you that I spit on just more then a mic
I make it hard for niggas to breathe, please
These wicked emcees squeeze
Hammers like the Pampers used to squeeze, hit the D.T.
I Mike Tyson ya eye, put a permanent ring around it
Then go run in the booth and sing about it
Look, if I don't hurt the nigga that play with my wealth
I'm like me on Entourage god, I'm playing myself, let's go

[Chorus]
Hold up, the pump will make you jump up
Put ya body in the trunk 
(Don't you baby, don't you baby, don't ya baby)
Keep goin' now
New York, and all the way to Cali
And the South'll make ya jump 
(Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby)
Don't touch the boy, yup
Hold up, the pump will make ya jump up
Put ya body in the trunk 
(Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby)
I'll whip ya ass from
New York, and all the way to Cali
And the South'll make ya jump 
One two three we gone!

You ain't crazy, don't you play me, don't you know its Jay-Z 
When internet ask you who's the best, why wont you say me?
Don't you hate me, c'mon baby, was it all gravy 
I took my lumps comin' up just like a boxer baby 
My first style may be if I stutter, maybe 
But then I slowed it down brought it from the gutter baby 
Matterfact, I don't give a fuck what you rate me 
Record labels told me, guess what the fuck that make me 
Super rich, stupid bitches know I'm super viscous 
Like standin' over a wounded man with two biscuits 
Lets get it clear like eucalyptus if you conflicted 
My flow is like the Cuban missile crisis 
Nigga my hand missiles is priceless, 
I hide a couple rare jewels in a verse 
For my niggas that like to listen like this 
Gotta let it do what it do baby

[Chorus]

Four finger, three finger, two finger, one finger
Hum dinger, gun slinger, that's what I am
Trying to get some cash in my hand as fast as I can
So you should, come on baby, come on, come on and fuck wit' ya man
I got this rap shit down to a science
Alotta niggas shit is aight but they ain't fucking with Ryan
First there was some defiance, until I formed an alliance
With Justin, he plugged me in, now I'm as hot as a fucking iron
You lying, all the gunplay talk
Knowing behind closed doors you be practicing on ya runway walk
I been in the kill, been in the cap, been in the box and back
I been in the 'ville, tripping the gat, trimming a boxing match
And I still walk around this fucker with not a scratch
And that's way more then I can say for a lot of cats
My name's Saigon nigga
Break bread mu'fucka' 'fore I break ya fucking head lil' sucka'

Saigon,"[Chorus]
Monday they predict the storm
Tuesday they predict the bad
Wednesday they cover the grass
And I can see it's all about cash
And they got the nerve to hunt down my ass
And treat me like a criminal

[Black Thought]
Look, it is what it is
Because of what it was
I did what I did
Cause it does what it does
I don't put nothin' above
What I am, what I love
My family, my blood
My city and my hood
Hater for the greater good
I'm back from Hollywood
And I ain't changed a lick
Though, I know I probably should
But, what I'm doin' is not a good look
I never did it by the good book, as a lifetime crook
All the petty crime took a toll on me
I look around at my homies that's gettin' old on me
But still somethin' gotta hold on me
Maybe it's faith
If it's comin', yo I'm willing to wait
I'm not runnin', I done ran through the mud
I done scrambled and such
I done robbed an odd job and gambled enough
Till I'm put up in handcuffs
And pissin' in a cup
If there's a God,
I don't know if he listenin' or what

[Chorus]

[Truck North]
Yeah, it is what it is
And that's how it go
Get treated like a criminal
If crime is all you know
Get greeted like a nigga
If a nigga saw your show
A public enemy, to send a eye in the scope
My city like a island where you can't find a boat
Have you wishin' for a raft
And prayin' that hope flows
Some real f'ing things going down low so,
Who lookin' for a chair and some real strong rope
Just to end it all here
Screamin' ""fuck the mayor""
He see the faces at the bottom of the welfare
They act like I'm somethin' to fear
Trapped in urban warfare
And pullin' triggers at a college career
Can't ignore the call of the wild
That's drawin' 'em near
Try to make fast money last long some years
Try to laugh it off
Still couldn't lose the tears
To the rules, I will not adhere
Break the law, yeah

[Chorus]

[Saigon]
Who wanna challenge mine?
I'm sick of St. Valentine
I did the violent crimes
That's why I got this style of rhyme
Seek repentance to spittin' them sentences
To senseless experience is the difference
You can't convince this
In a crime sense, niggas is infants
I'm like a senior citizen
Still livin' but gettin' benefits
Put emphasis on hittin' my nemesis in high percentages
Crooked ass cops is the reason for my belligerence
And it gets deeper than that
Remember nights I used to sleep wit a gat
With a package of crack under my sneaker strap
D's sneak attack and raid me
It took a week for that
Beat the rat, but you're sayin' ""look, he think he the mack""
Fuck yall!
Niggas who thinkin' they might try us
Watch us inside riots
Blue cars and light fires
We already been knocked, scrutinized
Plus, cops rush to brutalize us
America's polluted by lust
Who could I trust?
If I can't trust you, then I might touch you
If I ain't got love for you
Then fuck you!

Is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, 
Lost city of New Orleans, we call him this

Now
This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef wit you know who
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sitting on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on
Boy them cops is killers in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some fok' that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard the explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965, I ain't too young to know this
That was President Johnson but now

Everybody crying but (Georgia)

I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the white house hating, trying to wash away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest, they saying you gotta have paper if you trying to come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tay cause he died in the storm, fuck president (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound

You wanna see the gun that will make more than just your jaw drop 
You wanna mess with the best,

Nigga if you really want to test 
I'll come and chop you in half 
My click is cucku for cocoa they'll pop you and laugh 
Wanna do gun play, Monday through Sunday 
All 52 weeks of the year 
Am I speaking clear? 
You feel my flow 
Even though I'm so political 
Ain't another MC as gangsta as me 
Shit I should be signed to Death Row

AK nine six at yo 5-0 
Mind blow to your spinal 
You're only a thug on vinyl 
You soft, I know 
And yo so is your rhyme flow 
I'm the only rapper to ever shoot up the club

I pop up in a hot car 
You hop up in the cop car 
Then start telling the cops who's selling the rocks 
And who the niggas on the block are

I know they like the way my shit sounds 
Banging from the hood out to the hick towns 
Everything I spit is hit bound

Trying to take my from me 
What kind of crazy shit is you on? 
Let a kid act funny I'll lace him like when my kicks is on 
We in the zone 
We don't go to war with no sticks and stones 
Wanna play Gin Rummy then shuffle the cards and deal 'em out 
But if you get picked up then we trust that you not going to sqeal us out 
I'm in the cut with a chick with a bigga but than Trina 
And a better face than Jigga's slut 
Nigga I'm Saigon you understand that? 
I'm draped in firearms, you wanna wear that? 
If you was now you not 
You done fucked with the wrong one now you shot

I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I ask her can I see you again

She said, 'Yes'
'N I said wow
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
'N I asked if she believed in fate
And she said, 'Yes'

Nothin' else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
And loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Oh, then it happened one night lookin' into her eyes
And when I popped the question much to my surprise

She said, 'Yes'
'N I said wow
I said how about right now

Know you'll make it, some day

They'll say I'm a killer
I feel I'm as high as I can be
And now they gon' die as high as me
I can't be no realer
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down 
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down 
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down 
I can't be no realer, y'all ain't gon' bring me down

You know the feelin' when your back is up against in the wall
People say that they love you but you ain't convinced at all
Tell 'em they full of shit and they'll tell you you're insecure
Calling you immature, does that make sense to y'all?
You ever feel like it's you against the whole world?
Like everybody is schemin' even your own girl
Your homeboy seem to be countin' your money
Tell 'em you ain't got it and he lookin' at you funny
I'm feeling like I probably need to either leave the game alone
Or either be the G to bang the chrome to get his name known
How does the Saigon story end? How?
Know what they're sayin' for now?

[Chorus]

When Mad Child step on stage, I cause hysteria
Now they won't let my crazy ass back in America
Eagle labeled me as an illegal evil immigrant
I'm far beyond the magic of a wand inside a wizard's fist
Sharper than the hand of Edward Scissors, I'm a wiz at this
Hotter than the desert but I'm colder than a blizzard kid
Harder than a prison bid, with God I'm never hesitant
My business it isn't as amazin' as it's ever been
As long as God allows me to be clever it will never end
Sharpen up my axe and I am back, I'm here to sever heads
Compulsive obsessive, I'm also aggressive
My mouth is the message, my life is a lesson, my pulse is a blessing

[Chorus]

If there's hell below we're all gonna go, yo Curtis Mayfield
God and the devil still tryin' to level the playin' field
Some people sayin' that this life is all about free will
I'd rather have free rent, and never pay these bills
That's why I'm thankful every day that I'm blessed with these skills
And Mad is still alive after swallowin' all those pills
I ride for Saigon, New York to the Hollywood Hills
(The greatest story never told) is now yours to reveal
I feel like helium balloons are stuck up on the ceiling
Trying to make that breakthrough before I catch deflated feelings
Dying with a heart full of regrets is not amazing either
I'll just see the gatekeeper, or you meet the Grim Reaper

You know you'll make it someday 

You know the feeling when your back is up against the wall 
People say they love you but you ain't convinced at all 
Tell them they full of shittin' they'll tell ya you insecure 
Callin' ya immature does that make sense to y'all? 
You ever feel like it's you against the whole world? 
Like everybody is scheming even your own girl 
Your home boys seem to be counting your money 
Tell 'em you ain't got it 'n' he lookin' at you funny 
I'm feeling like I probably need ta either leave the game alone 
Or either be the cheater bang the chrome 'n' get his name known

But if I tell ya 
Then I gotta kill ya 
The greatest story is me and I'm kinda scared
It's ill like a vet that's still wet behind the ear 
Some niggas look hard 
But I don't feel a threat behind the stares
I'm looking for Vics 
And they could be volunteers
How dare somebody jump out the window to try an' stop me 
I wait for niggas then shoot 'em like I was a paparazzi

I jump out the back and turn ya block into Nagasaki 
I shouldn't have always make a issue with the pistol

Do away with the judge and the mug shots
Like we do away with the day when the sun drops
Clap your hands if you're tired of hearing gunshots
Or hear news about who got popped
By another black man or knocking a white cop
If I ain't there when they start the fight stop like ah
Slow your roller or be cold as a ice pop ya
We gotta start helping each other quit hurting each other
Money you will have a nigger thinking 'bout merking his mother
How does it feel being slaves to a dollar bill?
Givin' ya something y'all can feel, are ya for real
Do away with all the Chinese restaurants
Do away with all the fakes Gloria Estefans
Clap your hands if you gettin' in some real estate
Buy the crib ma' the Benz with the wheels can wait
I remember I used to instigate
Now I'm the one breaking up the fight
Making sure that detentions straight
Let a nigga get the heart to push me
I'll snuff the biggest nigga with him
Show em that his partner pussy

That's where the knuckle came from

Saigon,"There's only two ways, out, of, here,
If your too late you'll be trapped here, forever.
There's only two ways..out, of, here,
Ones through the door, the others through Me

Sometimes livin' in a word like this,
It's pretty hard not to go insane,
Not pretty if you don’t comply,
Pretty easy if you don’t complain,
Stand there like you don’t feel pain,
No tears in the face of defeat,
Pretend to the end that you don’t feel change,
Don’t admit it that your faith is weak,
Don’t say that you feel like dying,
Life’s hard that it feels like diamonds,
Go home, shit's far too gone,
Much too late to even feel like trying,
Can't understand what I’m saying,
Can't figure out what I’m implying,
If you feel you don’t want to be alive,
You feel just how I am

I’m on the dark side,
And you can't come find me,
How? when its light all around you,
Yeah but it's dark on the inside,
No win when it's me against me,
One of us ain't gonna survive,
My heart been broke for a while,

Yours has been the one keeping me alive

[Chorus]

This world's such a fucked up place,
My mind's in such a fucked up shape
Everything down here sucks,
Maybe what's up there is great,
We all gotta go one day,
I just wanna cut to the chase,
I wanna stop these nightmares,
I just wanna touch your face,
All you see is all my feats,
All I see is all my flaws,
All I can hear is all my demons,
Even through your applause,
All you see is all my flights,
All I see is all my falls,
All you see is all my rights,
All I see is all my wrongs,
Go on keep telling me to fight,
?
Tellin me to put a bullet inside my head,
Damn put it up right next to my jaw,
Don't keep tellin me to find a reason,
Anything to keep me from squeezing...

Saigon,"I rap about politicians, how money's their acquisition
To get it they gotta keep us without a pot to piss in
Strugglin' to survive, 9-to-5, ain't making it
Turn on the TV, all I see is celebs taking it
Feeling like they got all the bread but they ain't breaking it
I'm taking it as soon as I find the oven where they baking it

We was brought here to pick the cotton
Now we picking the music for massa to listen to
The clothes in which he rockin'
We don't drive a hard bargain
All we want back is crack, some more gats
And some more of that bullshit rap
The crime rhyme is still black on black
We need a leader like me to get us back on track
When y'all make them dis records do you know what you're doing to black community?
Market and promote the fact that we lack unity
Them white people look at you and laugh
You look like a porch monkey boy dancing for cash
Wanna get on a record and talk trash
See him at the awards and don't do shit but walk past

If I bust a gun in the hood I get Attica or the Cat
I bang a gat in Iraq I get a pat on the back
Best believe I know better than that
This a lesson for all my listeners ' shit ain't just regular rap

They probably swarm in without a warning pointin glocks at us
Get down...but this is gettin us paid
So at a very tender age we learned the tricks of the trade
Copping coke to cooking it to chipping it with the blade
To baggin and pitchin to gettin rid of it in a raid
Most of us would never get to stage, when its lawyers and bail
Hell we're happy to get stiffed in the cage
And it's crazy we be out here days upon days

He curses his teachers out tellin them they can kiss his ass
Soon as he didn't pass his mama whoppin his ass
His pops is not around the boy is blocked down
(Blocked down) Not even 12 months later
He suckin on 40oz and pissin in elevators
Idolizin the guys with big rides that gettin quick paper
And now he despises the shit-taker
He 13 goin on 26 and a half
His only dream is to have bricks and a stash
Poppin the clutch and hittin the gas, so he start dabblin
In the coke game pitchin for halves

And keep eyes out for the cops

You just trying to keep your kids off the street
You gotta believe it (Best believe it's a dream)
Oh, you better believe it (You too can achieve)

I often wonder if it's gonna change

I came home, my wife got my daughter in shitty diapers (Damn)
The rice is still raw and the meat is still frozen in the freezer
I hate that I'm to close to her to leave her
Either I hit the street to do some pitching, knowing these dudes is snitching
Or die trying to make it as a musician

The rap figures throwing money in the air like it's pizza dough
People in the hood ain't eating though (Though)
I tried to help the labels see the vision
But they lowered me to a subdivision, you gotta be fucking kidding
They'd rather me pretend to be something I'm not
I'm the new Public Enemy, I'm different than Yung Joc
And nah, I ain't dissing, this nigga's up in the Forbes
Shit, I ain't made a dollar trying to rap for the cause
But in these next four bars, I'll tell you about Maleverly Laws
They enforcing on North American shores
Dog, if they can have rifles on their farms
Then I don't see why they knocked T.I. for trying to bear arms

[Chorus]

Tell them wave at the artist, I feel like I'll make it regardless
Don't forget I'm the ex-con that made it the farthest (Yup)
Until the day that I lay with the martyrs
Or until the day I'm parlaying, playing with my sons and my daughters
I'mma remain the smartest, hardest working nigga in the business
Just Blaze, can I get a witness (Yessir)
See that they probably get it if I come out flop

Saigon, just blaze
Just out here in the field man
Tryin' to make these ends meet, you know?
Every time you look around it's some shit goin' down
Man we tryin' to make a better way
Saigon, talk to 'em man
Tell 'em how we tryin' to do this man!

Check, my heart is hurtin' and my soul's searchin' for a better way
I was born in Mooseknuckle where the kid was led astray
Then I moved to B.K., where I fell in love with guns
Fast forward six years later I'm a felon on the run with one
Renegade Run was my alias
And even when I was whylin the 'gon was a Don like Cornelius
Them hoes used to chase me around
None of my niggaz surprised, I got models givin' face to me now
That I roll with a super producer plus keep the booth in a stupor
That's your dog? Call him, or we're meetin' is [?]
I try to put all of my trouble-makin' days behind me
But it seem like them fuckers always find some way to find me
I never thought that Just Blaze would sign me (why?)
Cause he know that I fight a lot and he know my Nation is rangin grimy (yeah)
That's how I know that nigga for real
Took a chance on givin a trill nigga a deal

Although we thuggin' and we be buggin' we do be tryin' to find a better way

And I'd be lyin' if I said that we wasn't tryin' to keep our pockets paid

I never thought rhymin' would help me climb the ladder of success
Niggaz thought by now that I woulda took the magnum to the chest
Or have the staggerin' arrest record for dabblin' in this
I knew I shouldn'ta been in since I'm fresh up out the pen
But N-O spell 'no' sucka, I kill 'em with the flow fucka
You could compare me to no other
I'm so scared of my temper, what if somebody try me?
What if I gotta prove that I still use the shotty?
Atlantic Records would dropped me, police is gon' knock me
Them bitches is gon' laugh at me, the haters is gon' party
And I'll be back in the yard
With old timers callin' me a GODDAMN FOOL for clappin' ratchets at y'all
I'm tellin you this, so you know I'm fully aware
And very mindful, that I will throw away my career
And let one of you little bitch niggaz step in my square
And I'll show you I keep the weapon right here, aiyyo Belly come here!

[Chorus]

Check it, look
I'm hardly never low-key so it's hard to get to know me
Got enemies in the street that's still targetin' to smoke me
It must make 'em sick to see me as godly [?] in the movie
Wait 'til they start spendin' money to market and promote me
Why would y'all wanna stop me?
I changed my life around, put the rifle down, niggaz still plottin' to Big and 'Pac me
But on the contrilly I'm packin' the mac-milly
And clappin at the first lil' faggot that act silly
It was my destiny to be here
I killed the mixtapes for three years, all original beats so be clear
And as fuckin' fate would have it
I got connected with the best producer in the world so we can go in and make a classic
So when will you learn? I get deep without the Biblical terms
We livin' in hell with no physical burn
That's why a nigga tryin to find a better way
And sayin' hi to tomorrow, goodbye to yesterday

I've been here for too long
Tired of reminding myself there's no right way to do wrong
I've been here for too long

'Cause I've been here for too long, come on!

It's now or never
Can't stay in the same situation forever
Pfft, gotta get it together

My cousin gone from the slum, father was a bum (a bum)
He had a mother but he never felt she loved-ed him (loved-ed him)
People used to speculate was it because of them
That he grew up chewing more than just bubble gum
He used to like to bite his nails, even fight the gal
I used to tell him they gon' send yo ass right to jail
Pitching it hard, I never thought he'd listen to the God
When I would tell him not to be an addition to the yard
To my surprise, this nigga went to get a job
Now I be hearing him bragging 'bout his benefits and all
And I applaud whoever can climb out the hood
I hope and pray to Allah y'all can climb out for good
The hood is where the hate is at, I make it back
Just to bring some paper back, turn around, (rrrt!) make tracks
I got a kid, I'm a need a crib with the lawn
You can say what you want, nigga, I've been here for too

[Chorus]

Uh, check it out
Yo, I'm too black and too strong and been here for too long
Never did it right 'cause all I knew was how to do wrong
My people telling me to cut it out like a coupon
And act like a new man instead of like a newborn
Sometimes what I grow on, is difficult to chew on
And everything your crew on, is different than what you on
I'm through with bullshitting with my trivial pursuit on
And sitting at a stop sign, time to get a move on, 'cause
Criminal minds with minimal time
On the meter, got to be on they continual grind
Trying to find hidden treasure like subliminal signs
And escape mental prison or a chemical bind
And I'm a stone, but a stone can't do it alone
'Cause the truth can set you down like two in the dome
And make it all fall apart like the ruins of Rome
Yo, I'm a changed man headed for home

I know this crackhead who says she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring your customers a measuring pot
Her family members used to beg her to stop, couldn't explain
How to cook cocaine had her head in a lock
You hear the beat with this repetitive knock, that's the same way
They used to tell her she was at the edge of the dot
One night she woke up butt-naked in a crack house
Not knowing what happened, the bitch must've blacked out
Nobody to ask about what had taken place
Now she on the Internet with dog nut up on her face
And she caught another case trying to break in her mother place
Everything going wrong, she know it's 'cause of the base
Said it was just a pipe dream to get her life clean
Even thought it might seem like the right thing
Basically I just told her that red means stop
Yellow means slow, then you can go when the light's green
(I dropped jewels on her) That was her last night on the glass pipe
(Right) After thirteen years, that's right
She said, recommend a rehab and I'm gone

(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Let me run
(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Let me run
(Gotta let me run, gotta let me run) Hey
Momma I'm growin up, you gotta let me run

I don't know but I gotta go, gotta go slow, but I gotta go cause I gotta grow
The flow got a nigga fall but I gotta show that I got a lot mo' to go
I gotta blow
I won't take no, I don't think so
Hold on strong and no I won't let go
I'm almost there, I know I won't take long
I look in the rear and it's a long way home
Don't let me be, just another one
Momma I'm growin up, run that to your younger son
I'm the one when it's all said and done
Let it run to get a gun, the one that'll blow one
The one with the cold stare, niggas wanna go there
And oh yeah I don't fear no one
Right now Twista-like style
Quick to pipe down when usually I fight back
Now I'm lookin' like wow
I came to learn that my main concern's gripping the mic down
Wow, album number two, how comfortable, last one was for you
This one is for you and for frontin' niggas too
Comin' for you, now what you gonna do?

[Chorus]

Run away with the moonlight
Third eye too bright for me to lose sight
And I'm only fuckin' with niggas that move right
Can't rock with a man pants too tight
You belong in the blue light district
This prick take ""ho nigga"" to new height
You in the strip club you might
See a nigga throwing bread, no food fight, right
Got a style like Ike
The beat is my bitch, I'm wild for the night
Soup's upside your head when I spit it
Another DV tell the Feds I did it
Get on TV with a Red Sox fitted
Bet I won't go near Bed-Stuy with it
You know I'm just kiddin, Earth is our turf
I'm the person to say that first in my verse
Don't let me be, just another one
Just a statistic when I'm havin so much fun
I'm in the boom-boom room with a poon-poon
Lips smellin like perfume, wanna resume soon
Put your money where your mouth is
Bet you find your honey where my house is

[Chorus]

I don't know what I'm runnin' from
I don't know where I'm runnin' to
Seems your dreams are not comin' true
What the fuck are you gonna do?
Stop it now? How dumb are you?
How many lumps you want, one or two?
Your future's right there in front of you
Whatever you do with it is up to you
Not for nothin' but who the fuck are you?
Lot of other people are fucked up too
You ain't the only one who luck's up, boo
Life's a bitch, but you could fuck her too
Like I said mami, it's up to you
We don't do L's. W's
I'm not comfortable with number two
But it's up to you, it's up to you

Reminiscing my rapping with BIG, the man with the don
Niggas did it big, but not like them

I may not be the king of wit

Saigon Kick,"Said she was a sentimental girl from France
Mother was the victim of a failed romance
When she went to call upon the boy next door
She was really horrified at what she saw

Said he was a continental man from Greece
Wasn't really sure what that meant but at least
Promised her the life of dreams and a king?
Wasn't too long before bells were to ring

Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around
And around and around

So they lived their life upon a great big hill
Wasn't too long before blood was to spill
Hit him in the back with a tool from the shed
Now she's upset because she thinks he is dead

When she turned he rose above the hardwood floor
[Unverified]
He was right behind her and swinging a bat
Landed on her head with a soft wet smack

Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around
And around and around

Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around
And around and around and around and around

Hit her on the head with a bat
Hit her on the head with a bat
Hit her on the head with a bat

Saigon Kick,"Sgt. Steve could barely read
He would take the children down
Throw them all around the ground
And make 'em bleed

Then Sgt. Steve
Would sing a song of victory
Wipe some snot off on his sleeve
And say goodbye to the clown

He would pray twice every day
He would not tolerate the gay
Oh, oh, oh
I'm alright, I feel that I'm coming around

Sgt. Steve, with all his needs
He would weed out the impure
He would guard our sacred shores
From the red, from the blue ones

Though we beat them once before
He had a feelin', not very sure
That they were back
Boys for attack

So we slit his throat for fear
We heard their footsteps very near
And oh, oh, oh
I'm alright, I feel that I'm coming around

They're beginning to dance for all to see.
Wanting for something that they can't find,
So they shift their hips and they get in a little grind,
Singing oh oh oh oh, singing a la la la

Steal the bread from the baker man,
And you make a fist with an outstretched hand,
And you feed 'em something that they don't own,
And you burn down the teacher's home,
Singing oh oh oh oh, singing a la la la

Singing oh oh oh oh, singing a la la la

Chorus:
You and I are heading for the end of time and there's no rhyme.
All we know is crashing down; the absence of the heart is now.
Can you run a little faster; won't you try?
We must beat ourselves to Eden or we'll die.

Trying to act like we just don't care,
So we jump around like it just ain't fair.
Throw your neighbors to the ground
And you take your stuff and you head downtown,
Singing oh oh oh oh, singing a la la la

Chorus

Knock the one that you need the most,
And you kiss the ass of the holy ghost.
Trick your friends so they think you're cool,
And you get up on the floor of your school,
Singing oh, singing a la la la

Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.

Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.

All dressed up
Now who could have wished for more.
Yes
We wined anc! dined and all was fine
Knowing that she was game
But' then I went and really spoiled it all
By filling up my glass again.
(For) one drink too many took the smile right off of her face
One lousy drink too many took the girl right out of my place
Well
I tried to talk her out of going home
But instead I fell flat on the floor
And all I remember ist a great big bang
I guess she must have slammed the door.
Well a couple of days and a hangover later
She gave me one more chance.
But only if I took her to ""CHEZ MAXIM""
For a fancy dinner and dance.
So we came to seek
Cheek to cheek
That moment we'd known before.
But then I went and did it all again
By filling up my glass once more.
(For) one drink too many took the smile right off of her face.
One lousy drink too many took the girl right out of that place.

With the red ruby lips
Whatever happened to the burning flames
With the swing on the hips
She makes you turn when she passes you by
With a cool kind of look in her eye
She's like a flash from a movie show
Playing up to ""Marlowe"".
Stiletto heels clicking on the sidewalk
Tight skirts and ruby red lips
Stiletto heels are bound to make the boys talk
About her legs and her wiggeling hips
She doesn't need to speak a word at all
For her figure kind of says it all.
They talk about her in the neighbourhood
For good looks get around
She's always dropping into HolIywood
With the gents of the town
She likes to flirt with the right kind of man
But she can turn them into clay in her hand
And with the sound of her tiny feet
She'll turn heads on main street.

I've got blue skies up ahead of me
And a real thirst to see the world
I've got time off to go and spend my money
Now all I need is a girl
For a girl with a gentle like sensuous touch
Is a girl
Who would leave me out of wanting for much
Now with a girl in my arms to dance the whole night through
Like lover do
Yeah
I've got moonlight on a starry sky
Just the right kind for pretty curls
I've got two seats for the late night theatre

It's a kite-flying kind of day
Above the trees
Together we'll be making memories

We hang on to what we've found
A treasure we both need
I will go that extra mile
To give you back that certain smile
That you've given me
I'll answer every time and anywhere

Sailor Moon,"Got up this morning
On the right side of my bed
With all these crazy thoughts
Screaming through my head
I can't wait to see
What this world holds for me.
Oh, it's a new day
Oh, it's a new day
And when I see you
Any time or any place
You are the reason
For the smile on my face
Cause you make me feel
All my dreams can be real
Oh, it's a new day
Oh, it's a new day
It feels so good to be alive
Even if a little rain should fall
Cause every moment
Brings a new surprise to us all

Sailor Moon,"There comes a time,
When you face the toughest of fights,
Searching for a sign,
Lost in the darkest of nights,
The wind blows so cold,
You're standing alone,
Before the battle's begun,
But deep in your soul, 
The future unfolds,
As bright as the rays of the sun.

You've got to believe,
In the power of love,
You've got to believe,
In the power of love,
The power of love.

Blazing emotion,
There's a light that glows from your heart,
It's a chain reaction,
And nothing will keep us apart,
Stand by my side,
There's nothing to hide,
Together we'll fight till the end,
Take hold of my hand,
And you'll understand,
What it truly means to be friends.

You've got to believe,
(you've got to believe)
In the power of love
You've got to believe,
(you've got to believe)
In the power of love,
It gives meaning to each moment,
It's what our hearts are all made of,

Saint Asonia,"Get away from me
Hide your shame from me
Get away somehow
You drag me down
Deny its over
Just wait and see
I don't owe you anything
And you don't own me

I will not forget
Don't burden me with all of your problems
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel

Everyday's the same,
Driving me insane
Just take one step back
I'm getting my life on track
Realizing now, how you bring me down
I'm in such a better place
Without you around

I will not forget
Don't burden me with all of your problems
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel

The pain that I feel
The pain that I feel

To tear apart
Tear apart, the pain that I feel

I will not forget

Don't burden me with all of your problems
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears
Cutting you out of my life forever

The meaning of my life will never be found
I’m playing life’s little games

Saint Claire,"Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Grab my window, shed my shadows, excavate my pain

If I could read the world my notebook and these thoughts in it
Would they judge me or love me for what I've written?
Tryna get closer to spirt that enters the body
It's the vessel like I'm not in it
In fifty-something years, I won't be here
There'll be a kid with some headphones covering his ears
Walking 'round a hallway, dreaming of ideas
Find himself in the sound 'cause music is a mirror
What you looking for? What you headed towards?
What's your name worth when they mention yours?
When you leave here, are you stepping forward?
Can you remember your intention when they question yours?
They're gonna question yours, they're gonna question yours
I've been at rock bottom and I'm headed North
If you don't love yourself, what's the respect for?
If you don't love life, the check won't correct yours
Excavate

Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Grab my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain
And I found peace, and I found peace
And I found peace

I had this vision of my death
Surrounded by people I love and respect
And a baby blue Cadillac hearse
Pulling me 'round the block that I rep
The greatest fear that I've ever kept is dying with regrets
Like was I just alive for success
Or did I leave a better life for the rest?
My greatest achievement isn't the dollars
My greatest achievement isn't the followers
My greatest achievement isn't the accolades
My greatest achievement is my daughter
Waking up in the morning, being a father
Watching the light kiss her eyelids
Hearing her sing along to Chance
And being like, yeah, that's my kid
The light started to glow
And the saxophone up on Coltrane train started to blow
Tender laying in the snow, turn on my headphones
Couple miles to go before I run out of road
Excavate

Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Grab my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain
And I found peace, and I found peace
And I found peace, and I found peace
(And I found peace)

Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
I'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read
Just flesh and bone, I'm headed home
But this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobody's watching me?
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
I'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read

I'll raise my pimp cup
I'll drink it all down, and then we'll blaze one up

I've got a legacy of love and some stories to tell
Oh well
I knew this day would come
When I would have to say goodbye to all my loved ones

Your my only living seed I'm gunna miss you to death

You the truest of the true
Can't nobody ever take the place of you

Allthogh lives still unbreakable
Its unmistakeable and ansered in time
That means forever like their moms and mine
Hustle agaisnt the wall, we walk dow the line
Tell my family, fans and all my good freinds
When this life ends the next one begins

What's gunna happen when you time runs out
Whacha gunna do where are you gunna go now
Who are you gunna see when you time runs out
Who is it gunna be and why is it gunna happen
Will you be ready when your time goes out
Time runs out time runs out
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao

yo 
I really don't like to think
About when the sands of time will run outa mine
Nobody shouldn't be thinking about death and their prime
Shit, we should still be hearing biggie and pac rhyme
But if I do die
I hope you don't cry
I hope you celebrate, I lived a great life
Know I am alive and know I'll be around
I'll never be gone 
I'll always be in P-town
Up and down the streets
And on the avenues
When you drive you can catch me in your rear veiw
Laughing having fun and smileing
Kicking it with bass getting crazy straight ryling
For my family, know that I loved ya
All you gotta do is look up
I'm always above ya
Looking out for ya and watching ya back 
I'll be your gardian angel on your side and that's a fact

See in your hour glass........
Time falls fast.......
When it drops past......
I'll sit back and laugh.....

I guess it's my time for me to say goodbye
And I don't wanan see anybody start to cry
There's a time where everybody gots to go
A sad story but it needs to be told
I'ts been a bless yes so much fun
I can't believe its here, never thought it would come
I've always been afraid to know I'm gunna die
To face the facts in this thing called life
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao free my soul
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao until we meet again
For my family and freinds, I can't thank you enough
For all the memories, I know it's gunna be tough
And my special one
The love of my life

Forever we be

The weather in Chayco is sparkling and clear
The girl lies in bed, the boy sits in the yard
He wants to talk sleep but he has to keep guard

She stirs from her sleep and she calls for a beer
He knows there are none and pretends not to hear
She hears his breath like she's heard it before
She cuddles her sheets as he slips out the door

That could take her away from sadness and pain
He acts like a saint but the strain really shows

He sees all of the girls

I wake up every morning, and there before my eyes.
I find my little darling, sighing good looking sighs.
I kiss his nice face, good morning sir !
He smiles and pulls me closer, says it's me he's living for.

Chorus;
La la la la, la la la, la la la.
I feel his arms wrapped around me.
La la la la, la la la, la la la.
He gives me love, la la la.

He comes every evening, for sure work gets him down.
But right there in the doorway, you know he ain't got no frown.
My heart begins to bump, I open the door.
He takes me in his arms, hey !, how could ask for anything more ?

Weighs a tonne and it ain't stereo

Sail away 

So take your red gown
And go down to the dam
To do as you please
On the streets of your town

The whistling kind
Shake it out of your mind
It could be the day
When you finally say
Sail away
Sail away

Sail away
Sail away
Sail away

Sailing on 
On and on 
On and on 

On and on
On and on
On and on

On and on
Up the riverbank, land that dried up
The causeway full of nice cars
The sound of a distant train

Across the eastern riverbank
Cross the riverbank, don't look back

To sail away
And on and on
To sail away
And on and on

Go find a room, door's open wide

Is closing it's doors now

Saint Etienne,"Took a trip down Anita Way
Had to go on the 1st of May
Didn't have much to celebrate
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Doot do do, doot do do

Get yer kicks all around the world
Give a tip to a geisha girl
Fit your bit with a piece of pearl
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Doot do do, doot do do

Sold the ground to a PLC
Moved the club out to Newbury
Sod the fans and their families
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi

Picture-house built in '23
It's a place out of history
Pulled it down for your cash money
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Doot do do, doot do do

Gets so hot in there, even in November
Heated words from slicked back hair
It's too small a world for some people to share

Now Gary stares at an empty chair
Told her ""five, or ten, and he'd join her out there""
Not again, she's not going in
She just sighs...

There's time
Time for drinking
And still

More time

She's in

Maybe she'll board up her door
He sinks
Two pints
And that's how it goes

It's guaranteed he's a funny man
You can bet your life that he'll bring the house down
Always plays such a winning hand
He just cools it down
They should knight him for it

But outside, his former wife
Starts a solo drive
She's so tired of waiting
When he crawls in
Will she give him a surprise?

Could they help me get you back for good?
Such a striking combination, gone away
Could I say that if I knocked on wood

Lose my dream and let it slip away
Will my destiny remain a secret?
Well that's okay...

Everyone should have a reason to believe
So I still believe
That lightning could strike twice for me, yeah-yeah-yeah
Every time I find the feeling's gone in me
Suddenly I see
That lightning could strike twice for me, yeah-yeah-yeah

Sitting down to read the stars again
Maybe they can tell me what's in store
Now I'm mixing up a magic potion
That's gonna get you banging on my door

Did I have a chance and fail to keep it?
Lose my dream and let it slip away
Will my destiny remain a secret?
Well that's okay...

Scans the paper, takes a pill

I've always seen as home
At certain times of the evening
It's like a no-go zone

Got cash in my pocket to last the weekend (ba ba ba ba)
And I've got features I quite like and don't mind keeping

But still I walk the side streets home
Even when I'm on my own
If I let myself believe all the bad press and horror stories
I wouldn't set a foot outside

You say I live in a bubble
I find a bubble's best
At a faint whiff of trouble
Just turn and head due west

Quite light on my feet if I ever need be (ba ba ba ba)

That's why I walk the side streets home
Even when I'm on my own

Saint Etienne,"Slow down at the castle
Things to straighten in her head
And she knows it's not a castle
But that's what they've always said

Shaded by the tower
As she clambers to her seat
With the ash of last night's party
Clinging grimly to her feet

Not for the first time
She's made her bed
Now she leaves that all behind and turns her mind
To playful things instead

Days spent making stories
For the faces that pass by
From the lonely tea shop owner
To the misbehaving wife

Now they're growing ever wilder
As the people start to go
Now she dreams that there's assassins
Hiding in the woods below

Not for the first time
She's made her bed

To playful things instead

And she knows this must end

Pedal bin, washing up rack, Santex
She goes to the bakers to buy a loaf
Ah, she keeps forgetting it's changed into the Tropicana Tanning Salon

And in the charity shop
Mrs Brown sits at the counter pricing down some old stock
The Moon's A Balloon, two copies of Every Loser Wins, Noel's Blobbyland Deluxe Edition
There's not much left on the doorstep recently
""Something to do with eBay"", Johnny reckons
He's bidding on it now for a Subbuteo catalog '81-'82
He'll win it, put it in a draw, and forget he ever bought it

He tells them what he thinks
Manages to keep it clean
Buys another round

It's like I don't know you
Now we never talk
We never walk outside
It's the city outside

I look out the window
And see the streets below
Cars and the people
Lonely church steeple surrounded by gray
We need to move away

Here we go over and over and over
You're talking about it again
Let's move out, relocate
This place is in a state
Let's buy a pig or a hen

We need some open space
We need a change of pace

So life here in town girl
Is getting you down
And you long for a change
But won't it seem strange with fields all around?
We won't hear a sound

The grass may be greener
The air may be cleaner
But I love the city
I know it's not pretty
But at least there is life
You call this life?

Here we go over and over and over
You're talking about it again
Let's move out, relocate
This place is in a state
Let's buy a pig or a hen

We need some open space
We need a change of pace

Stars shine bright
In the country
Life feels right
Won't you trust me?

Hand me the remote
I'm not sure that we'd cope
In the middle of nowhere
Surrounded by fresh air
I'd miss my mates
This place is a state

You'd do your work from home
Online or on the phone
I could grow vegetables
Sounds like a load of balls
Let's relocate
I said, I'd miss my mates

Here we go over and over and over
You're talking about it again
