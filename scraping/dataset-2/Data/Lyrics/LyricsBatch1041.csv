Stars,"Why did you do me
Why did you get done
And all the misery
You were an easy one
We fell into the night time
We fell into the road way
We fell into a bedroom
And then we couldn’t get away
We couldn’t get away

How did we get here
We took the slow way
Do you love me
What am I supposed to say
And every time I touch you
And every we take it off
It feels like a concert
And that it’s worth it at the cost

Tell me how I sleep
Tell me how I wake up
Tell me how I dream

Tell me how I sleep
Tell me how I wake up
Tell me how I dream

I had a secret
Yeah but I knew it love
And we were children
We danced it hand in glove

And every time we fought
And every time we walked away
And every single silence
Was like a debt we had to pay
It was a debt we had to pay

Tell me how I sleep
Tell me how I wake up
Tell me how I dream

Tell me how I sleep
Tell me how I wake up
Tell me how I dream

Tell me how I sleep
Tell me how I wake up
Tell me how I dream

Tell me how I sleep (You can fuck them when you doubt me)
Tell me how I wake up (You can smoke a cigarette)
Tell me how I dream (You can lie in soiled sheets
Covered in your sweat)

Tell me how I sleep (You can take me)
Tell me how I wake up (And you can have me)
Tell me how I dream (But you can’t make me happy)

Tell me how I sleep (You can fuck them when you doubt me)
Tell me how I wake up (You can smoke a cigarette)
Tell me how I dream (You can lie in soiled sheets
Covered in your sweat)

Tell me how I wake up (And you can have me)
Tell me how I dream (But you can’t make me happy)",Walls,2012
Stars,"You came to me 
Last night in a dream 
Through the dark 
Hand to heart

You touched my face, electric scar 
I ask you why, but there's no voice
Just a look in your eye

Then the sun breaks through
I'm awake without you
How cruel this mind
To say goodbye twice

Leave me alone,why come to me 
Just to leave, a cage no key 
I crave the dark, I close the blinds 
And force my mind

How I will wait
Oh how I will wait
For this bitter sleep to come
So this dream will care

Last night I had a dream that I woke up screaming
Only to realize that I was still dreaming
Nothing good comes to those who wait
Nothing ever comes 'til it comes too late

Last night I had a dream that I woke up screaming
Only to realize that I was still dreaming
Nothing good comes to those who wait
Nothing ever comes 'til it comes too late

There's no cage in the world
That can come between us
We don't need a kid 
We've got a musical genius

Nothing good comes to those who wait
And nothing ever comes til it comes to late
Lost in impossible gospel
Playing solitaire with my own apostle

This is the cost of exhausted options
And colossal obstacles, constantly boxed in
I'm in mourning this morning in black pajamas
A life's sentence with question marks and lots of commas

Too much baggage, my heart's sluggish
This dream is meant to carry on
Hand luggage

Wide awake so I wrote these bars
I close my eyes and I hear stars",Nothing Good Comes to Those Who Wait,2013
Stars,"I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up
The strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope they'll still be there
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In another place
The only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.

The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,

And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2001

My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know

Through wars of worlds - invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh - you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly

That she'd be discovered some day
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly

Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are

Where the camera fell in love with her face

The groupies were crawling all over the place
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt

That small time town was hers

That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't
And where she is now

She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you got something they ain't got

Stars on 45,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1983

And get on back to school.

And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band

Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Part of the game is this
They marksmen homes, they don't miss
Cops come, they don't snitch
No witnesses at the crime scene
Just your body leaking at Yao Ming
When the lights go off pimp, the sharks come out
Thangs bang out, bust till ya brains hang out
Come to your house, sitting on your porch where ya live
Waiting till ya come back to the crib
I'm trying to tell ya how
This ain't bout no rap song, it's real life
Can't nobody tell ya what gettin killed, feel like
The trill is trill, the fake is fake
And they don't make bulletproof vests for ya face, YEAH!

Stat Quo,"If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools
Who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I been down that road, and now I'm back
Sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up,
Where I started from

I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hoe
You should know between us we was like mates
Nothing could intervene us especially no hoes
You was more so the shalon type I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights
I suppose that's how it goes,
With time spent emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you re-call I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelery off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'd even knew that, who would of even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them god-damned darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's to hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dudes car parked
And reach up under your seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you haul and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing almost haunting
That taunting ring

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

(Yeah right bitch, Spend time with my dick)
In most cases Stats attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public
We suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'm gonna trick off rip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix dyin' to commit
Feed you the best of me I should have fed you piss
We started off closer than close,
But who could have predicted to know your triflin' ways
Would of stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself do I love these hos? Nope!
Em introduced us
Fifty this is Tanya, Tanya this is fifty
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you had very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like a opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Says she's an inspiring actress she do videos for practice
Yeah, Yeah, now how many times I heard that shit

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Stat Quo,"Niggas didn't kill me
Now a niggas gon' get
Peel my cap back
I'm never at home
I'm somewhere
With my shaft restin' on a ho's tongue
Sippin' Don Perignon
While she's sippin' up them newborns
Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on a brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman
A dude's virgin
Verses lettin' a perilous nigga
With no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a bitch
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed
But don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga
Not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford
And yup it's probably easy when a nigga is on board

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now

Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin'
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin'
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin'
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin'
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin'
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin' when he said you gon' be fine nigga

Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull tools you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, and hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed deranged and more famous
Than clappin' down bangers meant, for entertainment, geah

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin' like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?

On occasion let me come through
And tap that hole
Make it lose control
All the girls know
That I hit it right at night
I'm a pro
I only come round to get sexual
And she flexible
And I'm sexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that murk that work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine

Reflects the light to her

Burn one trip back

Out like light

Head so slow my hat don't fit right
We cruise in the car
Or we could take flight

I'm a trip, I hate hoes on one hand
The other hand I want me a wife
Cop the jag then lace her with ice
Leave the mall with bags, yeah right! 
Skeet on that freak then dip the same night
Fly a kite bitch, booty colder than a ice pick
Fuck you and your best friend, I'm quite sick
Plus it's my third leg make 'em throw fits
I don't trust 'em nor love her - that's some bullshit! 
Ol' girl pregnant, now she's headed
To the delivery room to have yo' baby
Dawg, that's your lady - muh'fucker you crazy! 
Fuck that broad, she's shady

How is latex lazy, that pussy had my vision hazy

Over fame just watch the change, change
Muh'fuckers so quick to blame
All the beef fly like planes, make it sayin' the same
Look what ca$h money did to b. G., juvenile and wayne
The root of evil with much disdain
Of course they go against the grain
To maintain, tryin' to obtain big thangs
Jealousy and hunger make the tec go
Now you on the flo', blood leakin' out your brain
Mannn, that's the way it is
That's how it be, that's how we live
Watch your back, 'cause these kids

Stat Quo,"Shady, we're back!

Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that ""Renegade"" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radi—
O, and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big—ba—big—big bay—ba—baby

So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin' the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

Shady (Stat Quo!) we're back!

This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed
My kids would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him ""suck my dick""
Take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin', where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the ""Detox"" LP
Feet don't fail me
Niggas got me bent like cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?
A towns own, Aftermath, Shady!

Shady!(Bobby Creek!) we're back!

Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't write yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'til I show I
Go out on a limb with Em 'cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin' through the track nigga

Shady! (Ca$his!)

I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the Shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in the Midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Prozac, D's and E-Pills, it's a wrap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack

Hard like Timbos, blowing on indo

I was chopping crack when Dre was banging my demo
And all you old niggas is washed up like N.O
Don't take it the wrong way, I got love for my kinfolk
Can I get a moment of silence Will bang the instrumental
I spit for my niggas in the line-up

Cause we Ruthless, like Will before the Black Eyed Peas
Fuck all rappers, look at all the hate I see
I'm sick, you can't get rid of me, I'm HIV
Nigga get another job, hip-hop is not hiring
I'm the reason Dre feel comfortable retiring
I just might put out ""Detox"" myself
Smoke so much, I check in detox myself
One man army, took out Reeboks myself
45. in my khakis gotta watch my health
I'm so hard nigga, Glock 17 quick draw nigga

All black khaki suit, all black Converse

Peel my cap back
I'm never at home
I'm somewhere
With my shaft restin' on a ho's tongue
Sippin' Don Perignon
While she's sippin' up them newborns
Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on a brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman
A dude's virgin
Verses lettin' a perilous nigga
With no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a bitch
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed
But don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga
Not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford
And yup it's probably easy when a nigga is on board

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now

Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin'
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin'
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin'
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin'
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin'
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin' when he said you gon' be fine nigga

Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull tools you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, and hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed deranged and more famous
Than clappin' down bangers meant, for entertainment, geah

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin' like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy

The quicker a nigga who drops, pops of the glocks

With Jodeci or the basement sound, around
I don't want to see, handin', my crew is deep and you know that we be bangin'

Yo (yo), yo, ay yo
Timabaland's flow infamous
Allow me to assemble this flow with limitless style
For all man, woman and innocent child

I have no perimeter
Break all barriers in various areas
My sound is mimicked
Track prime minister, some say sinister

None stoppin the groove until when it's
The climax, some niggas is bitin my hot hats
And followed my drum pattern, but I done that
It's time to change, get more deranged

Feels more strange (doooodooooo)
Follow me through gravel and shallow trees
From mountains to flat plain, to thunder and black rain
Through the dream state of utopia

Woke up to the sounds of that man Timbaland
Five Mexican bitches scopin us
Belly dancin, sayin ""hell, he's handsome"" in Spanish
We was fine until the subtitles vanished

Then and open fire, totin opium
Higher than I ever been in my life
Heard cries throughout the night like

[Chorus: Static]
Let's get 'em started
While they dance on, Indian Carpet
see'mon, uh
Niggas act retarded
While they dance on, Indian Carpet
see'mon, uh
Let's get 'em started
While they dance on, Indian Carpet

[Timbaland]
Ay yo, I woke up to a bowl of rice like the Golden Child
T.V. playin like the Poltergeist, must been on overnight
I saw a strong beam of light, decided to walk to it
Could it be the son of Christ, I decided to talk to it

In the halls I heard music shoutin beautiful calls
And I swore I heard a voice say:
It's yours my, gift to you, to do what you choose
But I suggest you do what you do to make the spirits move

I hear ya dude, and me bein a barrel of fruit
But your ears heavenly, when I sit in this chair and produce
Then my hallway darkened
I felt a power surge rush throughout my apartment
And the glance callin like

[Chorus]

[Magoo]
Mag spit with a sense of purpose on purpose
When you was eatin collard greens I was eatin these dreams
I stepped in dog shit and bit Skid Row twice
Only ice I had put it in my orange Slice

What you know about livin in a jail when it ain't no bars
Handcuffed with no key, world denyin your plea
A third-degree charge when it ain't no crime
Twenty-six years old and I got more time

Phone overdue, baby on the way, low pay
Low rent for your mom, gotta get away
Smoke, hate now, then you want to talk about the ghetto
I'm tenth generation of that, came out the womb with a hat

Polo on and Nikes with a gold tooth
I'm Superman, I can spit from any phone booth
You and your cold ass crew do what you do
Just remember Mag never feel good, I am the flu

People like myself, only hang with self cause that's the way to go
I can't go outside without findin some new kinfolks
People on my left, people on my right, all in my earhole
Make be like whoa and find me somewhere else to go

[Magoo]
It's Mag from your TV screen, buzzin off the Jim Beam
But the Mag why'all think why'all know ain't what I seem
I'm a low-down freak from Seapeak(?)
See them high school mates, I see 'em and don't speak

All why'all want to talk like we used to hang
'Cause I'm doin my thang, now you want to bask in my fame
That's why I stay out the club, be in the crib
Smokin a dub, countin my cash, over the phone

And I'm sellin cell phones, all with chips
My nine to bloods, my glock to crips, who want war?
You and your boys can bring the noise
But I'm a bring hand grenades, now you're laid!

Pull out my dick, piss on your bitch-ass
Sit on your face, now you gotta kiss ass
Who fiend for fame life belong to your fans
And haters and thugs that want to end your lifespan

[Chorus]

[Timbaland]
Uhh, uhh, uhh - since I got bigger (bigger)
I'm over here and why'all recite Tim's my nigga (nigga)
Like I just figure (figure)
And my tracks didn't help niggaz

So for rememdy I pound niggaz
Like I keep 'em in DJ's for that new Jigga
Like them forty-two Girbauds
I pocket every demo, like Timbaland - he's that next nigga

Confirmed by people that she can blow
Convinced Booker T she's the next to go
Now I'm checkin every joint and every unit I sold
Once I'm deep in the dough, I'm deep with a crew

In the 80's why'all screamed like the movie is through
Why'all screamin this is ""Nutty Professor: Part II""
To ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to whoever I choose
I can appreciate a Kidman to a, Tom Cruise

To a, fast food, I'm strictly drive-through
The money I gave dudes I basically raised fools

[Chorus]

[Magoo]
Even the phone spit it, God know what I'm thinkin
I'm drinkin and smokin and stressin, go to church for confession
Down on my knees, beggin to God, show me the path
My label is jerkin me workin me so the devil can lurk in me

Sick of niggaz bitchin, wishin I'd fail
Tell 'em Mag be the rap effin Kenan and Kel
I'm spittin the version of verses curses over the churches
Rappin mo' iller than thriller Manila and give you salmonella

[Timbaland]
Stop, the press!
Bitch, you can't afford that dress, you can't afford that hairdo
I don't want your sex, here take your fast food
""Tim you're dead wrong, Tim you're dead rude!""

Hey girl, I don't even know you

You like, ""Fuck these niggas"", rather keep it to yourself

Now you can't trust nobody
You said, ""Do anything, but just don't lie to me""

Way before The Firm, like back in the day
Nas was the first New York **** rappin' with Dre
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face
The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away

But we still get together like every several years
To sprinkle, a little bit of Heaven for your ears
Relax sippin' Calico in Rio, stupid ****
Low-key, know G's, but it's still Gucci luggage

I love Cape Cod, and watchin' fly **** with gray eyes
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? 'Cause I can vision
Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate

So every breath I take, is all about the rules
It's hard for you to breathe like you at high altitude
So crack the Patrón, it's on heathens, The God's back
Hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin'

1995, eleven years from the day
I'm in the record shop with choices to make
'Illmati' on the top shelf, 'The Chronic' on the left homie
Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me

So **** it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub sack
Ripped the package off 'Illmatic' and bumped that
For my **** it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton **** with a 'New York State of Mind'

Inside the dope house bottlin' up sherm, bangin' The Firm
Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm makin' 'em burn
Ended my peers careers, hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned

So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga
I stopped beefin' with ****, 'cause I'm 'Ether' to ****
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left
'If I Ruled the World' I summons all you weak rap **** to death

Come off the dice game with a fortune walkin', you a walkin' coffin'

You're sideways talkin', so I lay often

I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'

Pluck ashes of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time

And if I'm sane that 'Soul Plane' movie's the bomb

You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm bustin'

I ain't mean to be late, it was my night to watch my little girl.
It's chilly out here.
What happened, you crying?
Y'all got into it again, huh?
See you gotta let em know, from the jump, I don't care who they are, or who they with.
Yeah, I know they know we talking.
Why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us can love each other.
Come on, stop cryin' now.
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you, I heard they watching you, yeah they watching you.
They watching me too.
But there ain't no reason to get low, I'm proud, I'm here.
You know, I'ma stand up for you, no matter what; and I know you'll stand up for me.
I don't have no doubt about you being true to me.

Embrace the world of reality we're faced to learn 
Coke connection drug bust graveyards where thugs rest 
I keep my mug blessed the evil is illegal substance sold 
Roll mob deep guns in the black Jeep 
Mac 11's and legends cracks in the streets 
Patroller gold money folder gun happy soldiers 
Never sober takin' over my blood is colder 
Niggaz respect violence so I become it 
I'm from it, I even done it blunted so run it

Brain full of schemes, my crew's rollin' fresh out the greens 
Give you what you never seen, the ips on the Mac-10 
It's 2:10 in the A.M. in the streets of Queens 
Try hard and die hard 
Chances of survivin' the game is like tryin' to feed Allah lard 
A walk a piece with a deadly shadow 
They want to blow me with the double barrel, found no sorrow 
I brawl with Blanka, caught Bison in a thinker 
Don't make hell your new home, with the blue chrome 
Mistakes want me, suave fellow but raunchy 
The soul of a cold body haunts me, I flee the country 
But only to shed tears for years 
Too wild for my own self, hopin' help is near 
Street fightin' was cool but in school I brought a new tool 
Toolin with the devil, a rebel, a fool

I hear Jake walkie-talkies in my sleep 
Marked money I keep, play the bitches all week 
I visualize Coups, alligators in suits 
Elevators in my mansion that rises to the roof 
Sippin' eighty proof, watchin' Juice, but hold up 
I see some brothers tryin to roll up, wishin' I could fold up 
It's hard to see their faces in they hoodies, I better boogie 
Too late, I tried to swing when they jigged me, I'm out

Yeah yeah kid, don't front, 360 degrees, knowhatI'msayin?

Who's more legendary than me...that's what I thought 
And if somebody wanna test mine, yo, watch this

Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic

Diversified all my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit coeptis

That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria

The ending of yours, the endin' of his,
Like Flavor Flav's clock, I'm back to handle my biz,

Back when proof was in the booth and I recited his lines,
And I still think about my nigga from time to time,

All the pent up anger in a while, and tell me straight up
Do you love me? Then what's the next step?
It's either 'yes' or 'no' before you take your next breath
Remember the days you held me on your chest?
I listened to your heart, gentle kisses on your breast
You said I was your king, or was it just a show?

Yeah
Yo

I free my mind, want to travel in time
To a place where the world moves slowly, I'm feeling lonely
No one to hold me, no one to console me
My drug use out of control, I hit the road
Leaving behind all the memories of yore
Not of drinking, but it had me sipping Hennessey for sure
My daily thoughts are 'what's the penalty for raw?'
When I should be making money singing records on a tour
But I'm stuck in a room, living with mommy
Telling bitches not to scream so loud, serving salami
I won't stop until I'm laying in Ferrari
Long removed from the days of playing Sega and Atari

Searching for daylight, I promise that I'll change
Before I see the grave, never that, fingers crossed

Hallucinations, bugging, digging up the floorboards

Smelled your scent from the door
Answer the door in a red velour
I only get head on tour
Cause they can’t have what’s yours
Shorty Greek, with an African physique
She tasted like a peach and her eyes were green
I’m headed to the beach take this ride with me
And don't babysit the weed bitch get high with me
Jagged Edge played her legs spread
She said she needed me inside of her
She held me tighter, told her, “Pass the weed
Pull your panties to your feet
Just don’t ruin my seats, you little freak""
Now it’s been years of creeping
And I’ve been thinking about forever lately
Your body feel like heaven baby
Come and save me
Cause at the end of the day
It’s me, it’s me baby

I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)

Man, how you gonna leave me like that?
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon’ get right back
At least I thought so
I guess your negative energy and your insecurities
Drew me to drawing a blank
I got a new thing, and everything is straight
Wait, you wasn’t even the only one in the first place
Couldn’t even say if you knew better, you'd do better
Cause you knew better, and you still acting like a bitch
Texts all day but don’t say shit
It’s okay boo, I don’t blame you
I know that this backwards society raised you
Taught you to play on your phone and watch cable
So while I play on your mind like I’m a Jedi
I’m probably eating a ribeye, finna hop on a red eye
Rolling up the green that shit that give you them red eyes
You is a bad bitch, it’s just time to say goodbye

Statik Selektah,"Life is resigned
Feel that shit baby
You drive me so crazy

Sometimes I just wanna be alone
Wanna talk to myself
When I'm at home

Just had to pay like 60 stacks in taxes
All this money I make, no thanks to federal bastards
Tell me why they take a piece of my assets?
Does Bill Gates have these same fees? I need the answers
Cause I think somebody taking advantage behind the camera
Watching, hoping I end up like Hammer in the slammer
Tiny flaws in my grammar, using anything to slander me
Looking at the Canada, can't wait to put and end to me
Bury my entities, hating only wastes your energy
Fuck negativity, I got love for all my enemies
Most are mini-me's, what they mean to me, minimal
My closet like a mini-mall and I'm expecting many more
The new millenials and the Inidgo's survive
So it's about time 'fore it changes into tide
Let's put the drum aside and read between the lines
I'm in America screaming ""Who will survive""
If only you could see through my eyes and perception
What it means to have is complexion
What it means to have these connections, to the most high
How it feels to have your two brothers in the skies
Sometimes I wanna cry, sometimes I wonder why
Sometimes I question God, can you blame me?
The sun ain't been shining here lately
And I swear it ain't the same cause

Everyday I think about you
Before I got to sleep, I pray I dream about you
Everyday I think about you
Before I got to sleep, I pray I dream about you
Sometimes I just wanna be alone, be alone

My creator had a master plan
Back when I was just an average man
Life is a snowball and avalanche
I heard a inner voice say i still had a chance
So i found my self trapped in no mans land
I felt a little tight, smoked the whole damn gram
I took that to the face, now I'm on my way
So insightful, been [?] on my mind all day
Step up the plate when it's a fork in the road
Each spoonful of knowledge is a fortunate load
That's food for thought, a little salt in the cone
On the pineal, life is bitter sweet, that's so perennial
We gotta move on from the ignorance, if I'm resilient
Moving coherent, changing appearance from the villain
Penicillin whenever this pen is spilling
They can't see what's really written, but they can feel my brilliance
They don't feel me though, they don't feel me
I swear they gon' kno

Everyday I think about you
Before I got to sleep, I pray I dream about you

Around the world since I been out

And daddy need new gold spokes on the 'Lac
Ah- I still posing for flicks holding my dick head
At the table ripping bread with my day ones
Ain't shit change dawg I got the same number
Just a little bit of money and some fame, huh
The hunger stronger than ever
I can taste blood on my taste buds
Holler back at me in eight months
Glowed up like a rave in the forest
In all white eating orange
A beautiful life

It's a beautiful life

The high top Air Force One all canvas
Took those off, hit the stage wearing sandals
Four X white t-shirt, that's standard
And1 shorts, '96 on the camera
Baby got me stiffer than L.A. Looks
So I hit her with that New York dick
Number 3, John Starks on the jersey
Bitch I've been doing this for thirty
The hair on my face says I'm a dominant man with no regards
Catch ya boy on Queens Boulevard
Sunk in the seat of something classic
Sittin' on the floor like a gypsy in a basket
Damn I'm a bastard

It's a beautiful life

The lemon grass in the bally shack
Hit up Chuck, what up I'm on my Cali swag
Cadillac dreams, transactions in between
The man and his cream, every thought brought the penny back
Ballin' off that, yo thanks for the alley act
Probably paint the cut, all black like an alley cat
Middle fingers up
You fuck boys, fucked up
Ya dismissed, had one shot but time's up
Make the block boys go crazy
Take a whiff
Ain't worried about another life
We tryin' to change shift
My reality, life from my ankle ain't actually
All you perceive these eyes can deceive
Holdin' back but I'm never holdin' out
So I doubt what ya lil trap mouth chat 'bout
Know they strapped like the back of the couch
We the era, black out on any rat in the house
Smash ya spouse until the cat tap out
Asses out until she passes out
No doubt we gettin' cash now
Use to be class clown
Don't worry about beef

If I'm a lion I run the jungle
I'm lying I run the streets
This nine I fire wild
I never had to sneak diss
Dismember contenders with every word I speak
With any word that's wrote, the King James I preach
The insane I see, clear view my peak
Mountain top, no sweat like Keith Cool collect
You gotta prove me wrong
You can't prove these set traps
Like boobie setbacks
My uzi det dat
Loosie puff up, coughing lungs up
I'm from NY, we pop Chris like Tucker
This brick got locked up
Duct tape tucked up
This traffic fucked up
But nothing get me nervous when I'm trafficking weight, wait
The time and the place
You bring me static, your death come
I select the date
I hate the hate, I hate the love
I hate the fake
I don't need to flex like Gray, what his name?

If you fucking on the plane for the first time, Fly Virgin
I put ice on the finger roll, what am I, a Spur like Gervin?
I made a living off rap, on purpose
Should I chase the money like JPMorgan?
Pay me portions, nah ah, I need that fortune
Like no sorcerer, I need sources
Check for the wire taps on cordless
Gorgeous thug, I don't need a course to put a hole in one
If they tryna cap a 10, they could hold the sun
Black boy with the golden tongue
Spit carrots, blow purp like puns
Heartburn, no tums

Man let's fuck around a little bit
Let me get my phone, let me get my phone
See what I got over here
Do shit like this

Population where I be is zero
If there's a prison out there that can fit me
I could stay, I'd copulate with her if she a C.O
Long as she don't gossip, I get her saved by the bell
You know that sloppy face, that's a crooked occupation
I'm wearing a crooked Ferragamo belt
I'm looking for Tatyana Ali, to get my jockey straight
Man I'm glad I got sober, I was out here 'bout to marry all the bitches
Plus the doctor said, I nearly almost did it
Five-nine is underrated, that's such an understatement
Fuck, man I might as well bury all the critics
Instead of buying chains, I'd rather buy a chain of WingStops
Don't compare me to these lames, please stop
I shoot up their venue, with a metaphor about myself
The marque say the name, the name make the marque pop
Blocka-blocka player listen here, I ain't here to play no games with you
Outting your career, like a meniscus tear
I'm the same nickel, tryna change little
All I did was stop drinking, that's when I found out I was rich in spirit
I don't got too many memories of this industry, just bits and pieces
Of beef and me driving my whip impaired, like (Skurr!)
Decisions, decisions, being made by the best ever
Respect the lyrics of the BMW stretch 7, the choice is yours
We just formed a new brotherhood called the, ""Cut you off for nothing"" crew
And yes we open the road with less brethren
When Statik Selektah decided he gon' let you have it
Call me for a verse, you'll have to call to payphone the church
And when it ring, I'll probably let the reverend grab it
Like ""Aye, tell him last time, Black Thought killed me man""

Real niggas doing real shit this year
Ain't shit change but the different spaceships to steer
It ain't a real bitch alive who can resist this here
Even fakes could see this real here, crystal clear

Yeah, real niggas doing real shit this year
Pop off, it don't mean that you won the fight
It just mean that you in the fight, probably don't even wanna fight
You swinging at the fire, last nigga violating got invited to a bottle bash with us
You in the bitter denial, thinking we won't link with you
I tint the window on the Lincoln too, do the linking to all you ""link in the bio"" ass niggas
And I may even hire hitters, trade your last tweeting for your last beating
Get them bad people to smoke everything living in the name of your fire ass Twitter
The wolves got my back right, and we glad y'all shining
Let me repeat, we glad y'all shining
But this year, we got the softest group of artists in the history of Blues, R&B, Soul
For y'all to be so willing to be so blast off honest
We're Black pride, I'm astonished, I'm a full contact guy in the flag
Ball climbing, it ain't a nigga from this era as resilient as me
I made a whole career off survival for millions to see
A nigga with a bottle, some will and some brilliance
Some beats for fulfillment, some children for peace
I spent at least ten years drunk, tryna do the impossible
Which is try to walk on water and not sink
And that's when I experienced the deep, that's something that I won't forget
Now I can lead millions to see while I'm soaking wet
God made y'all in image of SpongeBob so I gotta ask y'all, did it soak in yet?
I'm the top dog and without the SZA I split up the spitters
I feel like I'm Kendrick, we need the control cause I'm heartless
My soul beside ain't all the way took over
I'm searching for artists to destroy to fill the void in my hollow trophy chest
But that's fam, not associates, I'm so focused that
Last night, swear to God I had a dream that I told Beyoncé ""no""
Yes, no BS, tryna go to war with me is like messing with the Soviets
The lesson here is loud and clear
You wrestle with the stove while the stove is lit
You'll hug your way to hell but you ain't holding shit

From just watching, observing things over the years
A secret that I don't think that I'm supposed to share
But I don't care cause if they kill me, I was never here
You see, the truths been hidden under your nose for a long time
The only real power is the one over your mind
So once you seek control of every little thing you do
Start to unlock the potential that's inside of you
Don't you get got or cell blocked
Thinking the world's dark and hell's hot
My only hell is being enslaved 'til I'm in the box
And to my brother's treating life like it's another bitch
I encourage you to find yourself another chick
And treat her with respect, cause the moment you neglect
Start to fade and pick away pieces of your flesh
So be smart cause it's never too late for change
Never met a man who gained without feeling despair

Oh, the poem you need to listen in
And you can find my love

The sky ain't the limit, although that's what we're told amongst other things
Like you can't be successful with out a flooded, embezzled, diamond chain
Well damn, what about feeding families? giving your all to manage
Don't sacrifice your canvas to paint a picture of some bullshit
Be weary of the path that talk of private jets in the pool pit
Got to be real, through your heart, to your core
Don't give up on god, when there's so much more in store
Now I don't mean to be preaching, some might say I'm reaching
But lord knows, somebody gotta teach it
I'm hoping that you listen

Stranger don't speak
Too many rhymes, too many geeks
I love hip-hop but this bitch don't love me
Hanging with humps and chumps, through bumps and downs
Haven't check her once, I'll call you a
See you next Tuesday, Thursday is her day
Fuck what a herb say
Truth, I speak beyond wordplay

Got to be, got to be be sucker free, sucker free
Got to be, sucker free, sucker free
Got to be, sucker free, free, free

What up humans?
This is not Hannibal Barbarus
This is destroy
Special Ed students call me D-Story
We here, hijacking this Lucky 7 album
Now we gonna play a special joint

Up in the early rise and shine off my behind
Woke up like it's breakfast tea time
Shawty made omelettes, bacon bomb shit
I was late so I raced out of her mom's crib
Omelette dripping, orange juice sipping
In school, now my stomach starts tripping
Bubbling, it was all troubling
Girl I had a croissant so now that she's coming in
Fuck, damn, but she's don't know what I'm facing
I cut school and hit the train station
Lucky that the train came
Fuck I'm trying to maintain
Sweating in my clothes
Insane in the membrane
My best shot stayed at the next stop
I could find the best spot and just drop
Drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
It's all clear so I'm finding myself a spot
Did by the garbage, pants unbuckling
Didn't realize I was going on another man
Damn, he had the right to spaz
Homeless man chased as I wiped my ass

I got to, I got to, I got to go
Hey, you just don't know man, you just don't know

Before the club we grubbed on some waffles
After the club with a car full of falafel
Out the city on the center of the bridge
I swear I felt the bricks straight pressing on my ribs
Traffic's bad, backseat dash
Dropped my pants, held on a plastic bag
My boy driving, he straight gagged and gagged
People in traffic would just pass and laugh

I had to poop in there
Smelling mad funky, I'ma do this here
He's like ""Yo, you stupid weird""
I'm tired of the bag, here's a souvenir
Yeah, I had to poop in there
Smelling mad funky, I'ma do this here
He's like ""Yo, you stupid weird""
I'm tired of the bag, here's a souvenir

I got to, I got to, I got to go
Hey, you just don't know man, you just don't know

I never did it in my school cause the bathroom's busted
Walk around a fool without a toilet to be trusted
I think that girl that walked by crop dusted
See, that's some fool that I just can't fuck with
Once upon a time I hooked up on a new date
We at our crib eating chocolate souffle
Out of nowhere she argue with her roommate
She tell me to leave like it's getting to late
What? It had me all curious
I just got there, why so furious?
She said that this bastard bitch played a prank and shit
And mixed it with laxative

I got to, I got to, I got to go
Something ain't right with this whole night
Go, Go, Go, Go, Go, Go
And I did behind a tree
I'm bout to go off the balcony",Sucker Free,2015
Statik Selektah,"I'm top ten, you tone up-top from the top tier
Tat his iPhone, the animal Ock I box bears
Got those quotes to Glock pop folks
Two times in the head and laugh, that's the knock-knock joke
Shots flying, I nail ya
Shots fly I nail ya, one eye open scopin I’m Popeye da Sailor
Used to get hungry off of the stress plate
Used to get money off a cassette tape
The best ain't made great
The godfather large armour logical, I'm on point chronological
I don't rock boots with spikes, nigga
Don't watch roots with white niggas
Bullets [?] when the eight's spitting
Blow this shit out of proportion, the race in racism
A degree for my declaration
When saying Sean P say da P with exclamation
Motherfucker

Let me tell you 'bout this story of a young'n
Raised in a ghetto that he was brung in
Round the drinkin' and druggin'
Had to box it out in backyards
So I put my Nike Airs on
And dug in the dirt and I started sluggin'
I lost some, I won some, but I fought them all
Trying not to be another name upon the wall
Lots of murals that's been painted in memory of
But I'm still here so before I'm gone gimme the love
Imma take my flowers now when I can still smell 'em
Then roll up the strongest trees and inhale em
The world is getting worse everyday I try to tell em
As long as you keep buying the lies then they gon' sell 'em
Y'all niggas is mad and they tired, ready to act out
You can't keep killing them and not expect them to black out
You locked the front doors on 'em and they take the backround
All your shit will leave your face with the shit smacked out

I’m fraying but I’m saying that I’m spraying cause I am if I have to
Salute the niggas laying on the land like a statue
If I say I’m staying where I stand I'ma vanish
If I say I'm out, I'm playing with the menace
That's like beef or vendetta
You wouldn't understand the goals without a mask on your face
Shoulda really feel somthing, when they blast in your face
If you playing in the jungle feel the wrath of those apes
But I'm positive and negative, ignorant and conscience too
Listen to the angels, but watch what the monsters do
You addicted niggas sponsor you
Tell you have another one, watch that shit conquer you
Even the wise do foolish shit
Even the cop kill a kid that go to school and shit
Believe it or not, stand still and you can move with it
Open your eyes and I ain't even got to prove this shit

Oh my god
How I humble myself
As I bow to your throne
I pray for love, peace and happiness
To be present in my home
Yes, I do
And let your heart",Top Tier,2015
Statik Selektah,"I'm on my Stan Phil, little stubborn to say the least
Know I stand still, no budgin' and no crease
Know the plan still, it's turn 1 into 5
You literally see the double start to comin' alive
Come alive like heart rates, followed by a car chase
Chris Rock selfies with a top 5 arms race
Moncler skullies pulled over like cover ups
On the up and up, all the bottoms all Balmain
So even a robbery is expensive
Fly guy etiquette, my niggas get extensive
Abide by peddle, a homage from off the benches
And find mine buried in solemnly by the trenches
Bed-Stuy's version of Nas, no mirage
Freeze y'all on speed dials, the murder squads
From where the arms echo like they hear the falsetto
While I'm in here with a Mimi, forreal'll hold a rod
That's like 3 lines in one couplet
So that's 312 like I'm callin' Cabrini
Or 23 on the Ouija, predicted the rings
And bein' fitted for rings is the only thing we in touch with
Shit I'm just tryna fill a trophy room
I'm just tryna fill a trophy room
Until it's no mothafuckin' room left
Shit I'm just tryna fill a trophy room

Everything just feels so perfect
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world
On top of the world

Closet full of kicks, the lot is full of whips
Sippin' nothin' but the finest bottles of the Myx
Tryna see it all 'fore I lie up in a ditch
No takin' it with me, fuck depositing my chips
They bite a nigga's dick
Cause when I get bored I take a model for a trip
But go dine up in the Ritz
Why would I hide it if I'm rich? I'ma show off
Forreal, why you think Statik signed me to the clique?
Fuck you, pay me, least I said it to 'em nicely
Hate me, I reflect 'em, sendin' miss precisely
We put them grands in Jacksons to the safe
Cause of Washingtons, we spendin' them with wifey
Remember that? Thought you seen the end of that
But we carry tradition, what would be the sense in that?
Take though from Ea$y, might as well send it back
Got goons everywhere, where you gon' spend it at?
I'm done with the scramblin', pack handlin'
Shook the Ds like big titty bitch dancin'
If I get my chance in, I'm advancin'
For the clique, kill shit like Charles and get my mans in
You heard? But I'm just tryna fill the trophy room
Said I'm just tryna fill the trophy room
'Til I can't step foot up in that bitch, forreal
I'm just tryna fill the trophy room

Everything just feels so perfect
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world
On top of the world

This is beautiful, ain't it?
All these feelings of nostalgia ain't new to you, ain't it?
I did this shit already, my niggas, viewing is tainted
But watch I still kill it all through whatever arrangements
Got a shot, long range, Danny Ainge 'em
I can't blame 'em, I transport the message like Jason Statham
Sleep is minimal, perspiration, elevated
Rippin' shit easy like perforation
Soon they gon' hold for investigation
More soul than your grandma cookin'
I wonder, got 'em hooked like I know what you did
Last summer, it's a bummer tryna step to me
Bein' black right now, stressin' me
I'll shoot the sheriff and the deputy
Smokin' mad weed so this shit do not get the best of me
Stirrin' up your mental currents, word, I got the recipe
Herbs, you just speakin', man, I'm more show and prove
No jewelry, stack my gold in my trophy room

On top of the world
It's funny how things change
When you came from nothin'
Now the world knows your name
It feels so good to be livin' this life
Cause we worked so hard for what we want, right

Everything just feels so perfect

Statik Selektah,"We made so many moves
I believe we drank them all

I was stressed, moms kicked me out my rest
My bitch left me and I was depressed
But tell me how I was most consistent when my life was a mess
I guess that's when I perform best, yes
I had my back against the wall
Sing it, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh
Had my back against the wall
One, two, check it out, yo

There were times life felt so easy, I make it harder on myself
Sabotaged the pursuit of rap wealth, cause cash is dumb whack
I dug myself a hole, just to make a come back
Was writing daily 'til that honey dripper's drum cracked
To the point that when I came out, they thought I was someone else
Ain't planned it like that, but it helps
Remember recoding every week, just to get my tops up
And fools acting like I just popped out (what)
Before I ever made a project, I would go to projects out there getting busy
The fuck was suckas talking 'bout ""who is he""
Son they been tryna tell you but you didn't listen, walking contradictions
I made it pop without y'all, I was on a mission
Now herbs come around acting like they made us
They in a state of envy like Vegas, Nevada
Fronting like they true with me, with no soul in the Prada
I been through real shit , man this shit is nada

Yo, on this road to getting money, I'm just sliding through
Got two whips, two kids, two baby mommas too
Every day a different city I be flying through
This stress gives you gray hairs, I just found a few
Found me a little bad bitch and she 'bout it too
Grinding hard, making sure this bank account is full
Had my back against the wall, fought my way through
Watched a couple cats profit off my wave too
Still running with the same crew, cause I stay true
Term and Statik established 1982
This must be heaven, being a dad plus a legend
I got a seven figure dream, that's a lucky seven
I hit the dutch, exhale, then sip this cup
Tryna take away the pain so I'm liquored up
Listen up, every day you wake is a blessing
That's another twenty-four to grind for this cheddar

Now listen to the lightning

Where you and I could be alone

Need for nothing [?]
