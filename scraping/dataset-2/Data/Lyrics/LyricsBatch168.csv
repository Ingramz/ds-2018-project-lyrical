"Donnie ""Dobro"" Scott","Your hand, my hand
We can make it to the promise land
I know we can show what it is to be truly american
Your race, my race
Come together and have a taste of the new day for the remix
Eventually the race dilemma we'll fix and

Everything it will be alright
Everything it will be just fine
Everything it will be

My hand, your hand
Maybe we can come to understand
Nine-eleven-o-one happened just to get our attention
Need just to fast and pray, light an incense and meditate on a
New day for the remix
Eventually the race dilemma we'll fix and

And everything it will be alright
Everything it will be just fine
Everything it will be

Your voice, my voice 
Our world, our choice
Your land, my land
Our goals, our plans
My child, your child
Our future, our lives
Power to the people be forever more
Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light
Oh say can you see that

Everything it will be alright
Everything it will be just fine
Everything it will be

"Donnie ""Dobro"" Scott","We live from the head down and not the feet up
And I'm adorned with the crown that's making this up
And I'm fine under cloud 9

Yes I wear the lamb's wool, the feet of burned brass
And the wool defies gravity like the nature of a gas
And I'm fine under cloud 9

Twist my cloud and it rain
And when it rains it pours
And the energy will absorb
Power for the metaphysical one

Happy to be nappy, I'm black and I'm proud
That I have been chosen to wear the conscious cloud
And I'm fine under cloud 9

I be a chameleon and wear it bone straight
But it's so much stronger when it's in its natural state
And I'm fine under cloud 9

Twist my cloud and let it rain
And when it rains it pours
And the energy will absorb
Power for the metaphysical one

Twist my cloud and let it rain
And when it rains it pours
And the energy will absorb
Power for the metaphysical one

"Donnie ""Dobro"" Scott","Head shoulders knees and toes
Lips, my eyes, my mouth, my nose
They all go against what society calls beautiful
I'm left handed in my right mind
I'm pleasantly plump a phat dime
Black as night and a bright night
As you can see I am beautiful me

I was born by the river the day after the tenth
And its hard to deliver, Scorpio energy's so intense
Makes me wanna hollar, now I know what Marvin meant
The industry's so cold, give me the things to my ancestors you owe, so

Said American music was built upon my back
R&B, soul, your rock and roll, your blues, your ragtime and your jazz
Yes I herald the gospel, funk, hip-hop techno
And I'll sing forever in the name of the American Negro 

I'm not a nigga I'm a negro, 
When I become a nigga I'll let you know

"Donnie ""Dobro"" Scott","Mama's little baby is nothing but a consumer
Never making a profit
Rendering empty pockets
Mama's little baby is trendy on the rumor
Buying, never investing 
While they're busy in market testing

On your town look around it's the first of the month
US economy will get its usual jump
We're creatures of habit, modern slaves
Guaranteed to spend it all in just one place

Mama's little baby is a dancer and a crooner
Making dough for the man
Whipping that big black buck again

Oh and every time we buy into this criminal society
We whip that big black buck again and bring him down to his knees
They're waiting 'round the auction block, they jack so hard to see
The consistency of my sperm, breeding a monopoly yes they did
Breeding a monopoly

Mama's little babies are pawns protecting the bishop
Taking fish, never learning, that they're keeping this whole thing turning
If Mama's little baby didn't buy or sell on the sabbath
Don't you know what would happen, some economy backbone snappin'
Can't you see illuminating waging quiet war
Put the blood upon the lentil and the post of your door
We're waiting for new world order to come 
Baby can't you see its here and almost gone

Mama's little baby is the backbone of that order
And no not kinda sorta making dough for the man
Whipping that big black buck again

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it

'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns

It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone
And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back
And be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Keep on crying baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby

Sometime's up
Sometime's down
My life's so uncertain
With you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Keeps me crying baby for you
Keep on, keep on crying baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me (Come see about me)

And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You persuaded me to love you,
And I did, 
But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead,
Into your arms I fell, 
So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there.
Spoken:  You closed the door of your heart and turned the key,
locked your love away from me.
 
Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You made me love you, 
And oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You said loving you would make life beautiful 
with each passing day,
But as soon as love came into my heart, 
you turned and you walked just one way.
Spoken:  You stripped me of my dreams, 
you gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now.
 
Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep.
Spoken:  My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there

And royal flushes beat aces
And everyones playing to keep

She keeps a head full of hope
And a heart that's so full of wonder

Becomes part of the machine.

Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.

Sure plays a mean pinball!

Got such a supple wrist.

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all

Sure plays a mean pinball.

I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

And so many different churches
And if God really loves me
Then why does life keep hurting me?
Have you ever asked any of these questions?
Well my friend I've got the answer just listen

You have the power
To make the seasons change
The river flows for you
The wind whispers Your name
For me you left Your throne
And traded crown for thorns instead
I'm safe within not by Your skin
But because Your blood was red

Some say You're black, you're white
They question if you're real
We treat you like we treat ourselves
I wonder how you feel
To see your children fight in spite
of the tears for us you've shed
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

We may be different but
The God we serve's the same
Yet every Sunday we separate
And bring the Father pain
Your name is higher than any other
Yet You took my place instead
And now my sins are washed away
Because Your blood was red

For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross

Where my savior died
Down where for cleansing
From sin I cried,
There to my heart
Was the blood applied

Saved from my sin,
Jesus so sweetly
Abides within;
There at the cross
Where he took me in

Singin
Glory to his name

Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,
I am so glad I have entered in;
There jesus saves me and keeps me clean;

Ups and downs I've had plenty

But I found nothing to fill my empty spaces

I looked for mother she wasn't there
No father around to care
Sisters and brothers were not around
And my friends no where to be found

He was right there
To hear my cry
And answer my prayer
The lord is so faithful
He's been better to me
Then I been to myself

Twas nothing he could do
He shook his head
And he left the room

Then I remembered
Your words I read
In the holy scriptures
Where it said

That you were wounded for my transgressions
You were bruised for my iniquities
By your stripes I'm already healed
So right then I dropped to my knees

And I called Jesus
He was right there
He heard my cry
He answered my prayer
He is faithful
He's been better to me

Donnie McClurkin,"I told somebody I was looking for a miracle and then they go
And try to conjure up a resolution for my hang-ups
But it cannot be done
I told them what I need was a supernatural act from God
Then they looked at me like I was so crazy
Like it was too hard

I’ve learned to lean not unto man
Because I know that he cannot
Take the pain away or make rain dissipate
Or wash my tears away

I want to pray like they did in the upper room
I will not leave because I need to hear from you God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough
I want to walk in Your will and be favored
No matter how long I must put in my labor God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough.

I told somebody I was sick in my body and they they read
Me a list of all the doctors in this pamphlet but not if they’re human
What I have it doesn’t require a vaccine or anything
What I need is the healing virtue of the Father not a doctor

I’ve learned to lean not unto man
Because I know that he cannot
Take the pain away or make rain dissipate
Or wash my tears away

I want to pray like they did in the upper room
I will not leave because I need to hear from you God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough
I want to walk in Your will and be favored
No matter how long I must put in my labor God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough.

Some people try to help me out others try to pull me through
But they cannot figure out what they can’t get it right
Sorry but it’s not your fault- I’m in need of a breakthrough
Everybody’s praying for me putting in petitions for me
Trying to keep the faith as wait for a breakthrough
Wrestle with the angels until we get a breakthrough

I’ve learned to lean not unto man
Because I know that he cannot
Take the pain away or make rain dissipate
Or wash my tears away

Donnie Munro,"Once upon a time in a far off land
Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand
Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night
Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light
They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child could wash these tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles
So once again we all can be children for awhile

Everyday is heard a precious little sound
And every mother kind and every father proud
Looks down in awe to find another chance allowed",Nothing But a Child,2000

Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place

You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
And his praise is daily basis so I gotta try it

Donnie Trumpet,"I don't wanna be you, I just wanna be me
I don't wanna be cool, I just wanna be me
You don't wanna be cool, you just wanna be me
I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be cool
I don't wanna be cool, I don't like being cool
I ain't trying to be cool, what's it like being cool?
I just can't stay cool, I don't wanna be cool
I don't want you to be me, you should just be you
You just wanna be me!

Okay, I grew up without a chauffeur
Man, I'm talking straight out the dirt and sulfur
Only birds in my city is vultures
I mean back before I could afford a faux fur
I was off of that debt, me and my mama
Hand-me-downs was the only time I got designer man
Only class I'm passing is English and Math
I don't know, maybe because they both got commas
Maybe because my older bro was on the honor roll
And the other one was always up in front of the honor
So I'm in the middle like the line in the divide signs
Spending all my money on girls and Sean John
Way before anybody called me Sean Don
I was dropping fifties man to look like 50
Rocking pink Polo's, shit ain't even fit me
Looking for the inspiration that's already in me
All the confidence I was trying to buy myself
If you don't like me, fuck it, I'll be by myself
Spend all this time for you to say I'm fine
I really should have spent it trying to find myself

It's cool with just me
I'm cool being me
I don't wanna be cool
I ain't trying to be cool
I just can't stay cool
Whats it like being cool?
I don't wanna be cool
I don't wanna be cool
I don't want you to be me
You just should be you

Is being cool that cool? (Really?)
Is being a tool that big of a tool? (Is it?)
It doesn't matter if a nigga is wearing Supreme
If a cool guy shits his shit's still gonna stink
If a cool guy's cool in the middle of the forest
Man nobody fucking cares
So why don't you just be the you that you know you are
You know, when nobody else is there?
You'll be aware, it's easy, and it's so important
Being cool shouldn't cost a fortune
Baby got her jeans from Goodwill
But I bet that ass look good still
Okay let's remember that shopping at Payless
It just means that you pay less, it don't make you bae-less
If you don't get re-tweets, it don't mean you say less, okay?
So I'm gonna post that shitty ass selfie on IG
And I don't care if anybody likes it or likes me, it's cool

I don't wanna be cool
I ain't trying to be cool
I just can't stay cool
Whats it like being cool?

Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.
 
I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.
 
I read your letters when you're not near me, 
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me 
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.
 
I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better, 
So let's get together.

I've given you everything with kiss to seal it,
You had to get your kicks out of trying to steal it.

Now, I'm standing here,
Strange, strange voices in my ears,
I feel the tears,
But, all I can hear are those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through, ahh.

To brighten up even your darkest night

They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

Baby, you're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I've got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby, what good am I?

I never had much goin'
But at least I had you
How can you walk out knowin'
I ain't got nothin' left if you do?

Baby, you're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I've got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby, what good am I, oh what good am I?

Baby, I can't make it withoutcha.
And I'm, I'm tellin' ya, honey-you're my
reason for laughin', for cryin', for livin', and for dyin'.

Baby, I can't make it without you
Please, I'm begging you baby
If you go it will kill me
I swear it, Dear, my love can't bear it

You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I've got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby, what good am I, what good am I?

Donny Osmond,"I used to dream and make believe
Everything so real
Holding future life
That's when we began
You help me understand
There's a life I don't know
And mine I can't let go
I couldn't if I tried-so I'm

Living through vicarious eyes
For times I wanted to know
You're a mirror of a life
That only heaven knows
Only heaven knows

I close my eyes to see behind
So many things so gray
I can't wait to relive the past
Of all the times in my life 
That came close to your life
But not quite the same-till then I'm

Living through vicarious eyes
For times I wanted to know
You're a mirror of a life
That only heaven knows
Only heaven knows

Feel the strength within you soul
I gave you all that you need
So when you leave me, don't forget me
Cause someday you'll need these eyes

When there's times of unknown
Cause there's another side of me
That you'll want to know
And when you see that other side
When we're together again
We'll both learn through the eyes
That only heaven knows",Only Heaven Knows,1989

Tell me I'm not the only one

It's our choice, if we choose it. 
Let's hold on to what we have. 

So before it's too late to turn back, 
Oh, let's find a way. 
Before it's too late to turn back, 
Oh, it's time to make a change. 

There's so much we left behind, 
But looking back is a waste of time. 
You can blame the stars above, 
But in the end, we're the only ones 
Who can change what we're doing.

Take some time, before we lose it. 
Before it all just comes undone.

Brothers
But what makes us mad
Are the things that Joseph tells us of the
Dream's he often had

I dreamed that in the fields one day,
The corn gave me sign
Your eleven sheaves of corn
All turned and bowed to mine
My sheaf was was quite a sight to see
A golden sheaf and tall
Yours were green and second-rate
And really rather small

This is not the kind of thing
We brothers like to hear
It seems to us that Joseph and his
Dreams should disappear

I dreamed I saw eleven stars,
The sun the moon and sky
Bowing down before my star,
It made me wonder why
Could it be that I was born
For higher thing than you?
A post in someone's government,
A ministry or two

The dreams of our dear brother are
The decade's biggest yawn
His talk of stars and golden sheaves
Is just a load of corn
Not only is he tactless but
He's also rather dim
For there's eleven of us and
There's only one of him
The dreams of course will not come true
That is, we think they won't come true
That is, we hope they won't come true
What if he's right all along?

Means that Joseph some day soon
Will rise above us all

I sat upon your knee. 
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies. 
Well, I'm all grown up now, 
But still need help somehow. 
I'm not a Chile but my heart still can dream. 

So here's my lifelong wish, 
My grown-up Christmas list, 
Not for myself, but for a world in need: 

No more lives torn apart, 
And wars would never start, 
And time would heal all hearts. 
Ev'ry one would have a friend, 
That right would always win, 
And love would never end: 
This is my grown-up Christmas list

As children we believed 
The grandest sight to see 
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree. 
Well, heaven surely knows 
That packages and bows 
Can never heal a hurting human soul. 

No more lives torn apart, 
And wars would never start, 
And time would heal all hearts. 
Ev'ry one would have a friend, 
That right would always win, 
And love would never end: 
This is my grown-up Christmas list

What is this illusion called the innocence of youth? 
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth! 

There'd be,
No more lives torn apart, 
And wars would never start, 
And time would heal all hearts.

That right would always win,

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night/Divine,1998
Donny Osmond,"No one seemed to notice
The man beside the road
He was just a ragged soldier
Out there in the cold
But he seemed to have a purpose
Only known to him
As he walked along the streets that night
Through the town of Bethlehem

In his head he held a memory
Of all the wars he'd known
In his hand he clutched a medal
For the bravery he'd shown
And the weight of every battle
He carried in his heart
But his eyes were clear and searching
For a manger in the dark

[Chorus]
Some are born to greatness
Some are born to fall
Some are bound to be forgotten
Like they never lived at all
But we're all born to know Him
And stand before His light
Like the soldier who found his king tonight

He had marched for politicians
Served under their command
And he fought for all the causes
That he did not understand
But it was something deep inside him now
That led him on his way
With a single star to guide him
To were the baby lay

[Chorus]

He stood before the Son of God
Come to pay our debt
He smiled up at the soldier
That the world would soon forget
So he held out his medal
And said this for you I bring
There he swore allegiance 
To the newborn baby king

Donny Osmond,"This is the moment; this is the day 
When I send all my doubts and demons on their way. 
Every endeavor I have made ever 
Is coming into play, is here and now today.

This is the moment, this is the time 
When the momentum and the moment are in rhyme 
Give me this moment, this momentous moment;
I'll gather up my past, and make some sense at last. 

This is the moment, when all I've done 
All of the dreaming, scheming and screaming become one. 
This is the day, just see it shine
When all I've lived for becomes mine. 

This is the moment, this is the hour
When I can open tomorrow like a flower.
And with my hand to, everything I've planned to
Fulfill my grand design; see all my stars align;

This is the moment, my final test; 
Destiny beckoned, I never reckoned second best. 
I won't look down, I must not fall; 
This is the moment, the sweetest moment of them all. 

This is the moment, forget all the odds 
This day or never I'll sit forever with the gods. 
When I look back I will recall, moment for moment
This was the moment,
The greatest moment of them all.","This Is the Moment [From ""Jekyll and Hyde""]",2001

We were young and we knew, and our eyes were alive

Wonderful and new

The dawn was breaking
And the world was waking

A crash of drums
A flash of light

Flew out of sight
The colors faded into darkness

Many languages but just one voice
And the wish for peace, the only choice

Raining down as cold as ice

Crying in the night, the night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes I see a memory
I never realized how happy you made me, oh, Mandy

You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh, Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh, Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my mind and nothing is rhyming, oh, Mandy

You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh, Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh, Mandy

Yesterday's a dream I face the morning
Crying on the breeze, the pain is calling, oh, Mandy

But I sent you away, oh, Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking

I'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you on what you say or do?

And sometimes when we touch, the honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die, till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance and all its strategy leaves me battling with my pride
But through the insecurity some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prizefighter still trapped within my youth

[Chorus]

At times I'd like to break you and drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through and hold you endlessly

At times I understand you and I know how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you; I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister, but then the passion flares again

You spoke without saying a word
And I gave you nothing
A kiss short of loving
Why did I turn away?
That's what I meant to say

Baby, help me I'm falling so deep I can't breathe
There's no reason to live anymore
Without you here with me

I want you, I need you
I long to be near you
For now and forever more
So break all this silence
And tell me what I need to do
What I need to prove

Cause baby, I love you

Two can make that dream so real
One can talk about bein' in love
Two can say how it really feels
One can wish upon a star
Two can make that wish come true, yeah
One can stand alone in the dark
Two can make the light shine through

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you, just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two

One can have a broken heart, livin' in misery
Two can really ease the pain like a perfect remedy
One can be alone in a car, on a night like these all alone
Two can make just any place seem just like bein' at home

[Chorus]

Just takes two, just takes two

One can go out to a movie, lookin' for a special treat
Two can make that single movie somethin' really kinda sweet

But two walkin' hand-in-hand is like addin' just a pinch of spice",One of These Days,2008

She could be perfect to love, simply divine
Could she be mine, ooh

I know her silhouette so well that I could trace
Every curve & line
Seems a crazy way, to pass my time away
Listing clothes that she would wear to work that day
How she looks so fine, wishing she was mine

She could be Bardot & Monroe, Sophia Loren
She could be reincarnated as Hepburn again
She could be perfect to love, simply divine

She would ever choose me instead of anyone else
Could it be that our fate, is inter twined
Could she be mine

I asked my best friend, if he thought she could be mine
He just laughed, I didn't take it as a positive sign

She's the sun, and the moon, she is shining, for me""

As breezes chased along the winter lane.
I had a dream as dreams alone I dreamt
Has every man his chain,
Has every man his chain ?
A negro hid beneath a face of blood
And is there really anyone to blame ?
I marveled at the beauty of children's minds.
Has every man his chain,
Has every man his chain ?
I saw a beach of sand beside the sea
And there before me I saw every grain
And I wondered, well, it was best this way

That have shone in the eyes of a prince of the breeze.
Bright cascading crystals, they danced in the sand dunes
On the beach of no footprints to harpsichord tunes.

A throne of white ivory, a gown of white lace
Lies still in the magic of a timeless place.
One hundred small children, they laugh at the white doves
That rest on their hands with the touch of love.

On a hillside of velvet the children they lay down
And make fun of the grown-ups with their silly frown.
And the sound of their laughter is the sound of the green sea
As it washed around the foot of the seashell tree.

The doves circle over and land in the trees
Where parrots are talking their words with such ease.
Thus spoke three wizards to the young ones that day:
""There's sadness in the kingdom, make it go far away.""

If you follow the sunbeams through the valley of flowers
To the palace of the White Queen with its white jade towers.
The youngest, she sighed then the clouds drew away
And a hundred small fingers scratched their heads in dismay.

>From out of the sun a giant gull came flying
And the children got ready to sit on its wings.
They waved to the raindrops as they soared over the trees
The wind tossed their hair high, flashing gold on the sea.

They came to the castle and there they did fall,
And they saw all the sadness, through the crystal wall.
A princess lay a-sleeping so gentle and kind
Whilst her prince took to battle with his confused mind.

The clash of bright metal brought the children fear,
But their cloaks of blue satin dried up all of these tears.
Thus children held hands and they spelled out their name
All the golden children became a golden chain.

It lies on a white throne in a magic place
With a tunic of velvet and a gown of white lace.

Living in the deep blue sea
Crawl to me I have proposition to make thee
Would you walk the north sea floor
To Belgium from England
Bring me word of a banjo man
With a tattoo on his hand.

Spoke as spokesman should
""If'n you met our fee then
Certainly we would,
If you cast a looking-glass
Upon the scallopped sand
You'll have word o' this banjo man
With a tattoo on his hand.""

""Come ye starry starfish
I know your ways are caped
Maybe its because your astrologically shaped,
Converse with the herring shoals
As I know you can
Bring me word o' the banjo man
With a tattoo on his hand.""

Spoke, after a sigh,
""Youthfull as you are young man
You have a 'Wisdom Eye';
Surely you must know a looking-glass
Is made from sand?
These youngfish are fooling you
About this banjo man.""



""Come then aged starfish
Riddle me no more,
For news I am weary
And my heart is sore;
All on the silent seashore,
Help me if you can,
Tell to me if you know
Of this banjo man.""

""All through the seven oceans
I am a star, most famed,
Many 'leggys' have I lost
And many have I gained,
Strange to say quite recently
I've been to FlemiSH Land
And if you are courteous
I'll tell you all I can.""

""You have my full attention""
I answered him with glee,
His brother stars were twinkling
In the sky above the sea
So I sat there with rapt
Attention, on the sand,
Very anxious for to hear
Of the banjo man.

""I have seen this tattooed hand
Through a ship port-hole,
Steaming on the watery main
Through the waves so cold,
Heard his tinkling banjo and
His voice so grand
But you must come to Belgium
To shake his tattooed hand.""

""Gladly would I come oh
Gladly would I go,
Had I not my work to do
And my face to show,
I rejoice to know he's well
But I must go inland,
Thank you for the words you brought
Of the banjo man.""

I walked along the evening sand
As charcoal clouds did shift
Revealing the moon shining
On the pebble drift
Contemplating every other word
The starfish said
Whistly winds they filled my dreams
In my dreaming bed.

How neat the cut peat
Laid so long
Felt like a seed on your land

One blue sky above us
One ocean lapping all our shore
One earth so green and round
Who could ask for more
And because I love you
I'll give it one more try
To show my rainbow race
It's too soon to die.

Some folks want to be like an ostrich,
Bury their heads in the sand.
Some hope that plastic dreams
Can unclench all those greedy hands.
Some hope to take the easy way:
Poisons, bombs. They think we need 'em.
Don't you know you can't kill all the unbelievers?
There's no shortcut to freedom.

Go tell, go tell all the little children.
Tell all the mothers and fathers too.

What's been given to me and you.

I'm not proud to say I am merry here.
I've found a girl and I love her so,
Groovy, groovy woman and she set me free.
Hark awhile and listen to this love song.
Give me for sometimes I wanted to
Take her to the woods and show her what to do.
She could see the stars if she's looking up,
Drink the sweet juice from a loving cup,
Show her what it is to make a love song.
Hey, have you ever seen the lonely ones
Putting down the lovers for having fun ?
The very same thing that would set them free,
They should catch an evening with my lover and me,

Anchored in the bay of innocence
Is left a lonely man
Lonely through and through

When man began to fly,
Out of earthly regions,
To planets in the sky.

We watched the heros land,
As ceremoniously
They disturbed the cosmic sand.

In awe with admiration,
We listened to the talk.
Such pride felt they,
Such joy to be
Upon the moon to walk.

When it was explained to me,
Spacemen wear old diapers
In which they shit and pee.

Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
Will get you from here to there.
Relieve you and believe me,
Without a worry or care.
If shitting is your problem,
When you're out there in the stars,
Oh, the intergalactic laxative
Will get you from here to Mars.

They don't partake like you and I,
Of beefy burger mush.
Their food is specially prepared
To dissolve into slush.
Absorbed by multi-fibers
In the super diaper suit,
Otherwise the slush would trickle
Down inside the boot.

Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
Will get you from here to there.
Relieve you and believe me,
Without a worry or care.
If shitting is your problem
When you're out there in the stars,
Oh, the intergalactic laxative
Will get you from here to Mars.

You may well ask now what becomes
Of liquid they consume.
A pipe is led from penis head
To a unit in the room.
The water is recirculated,
Filtered for re-use.
In case of anti-gravity -
Pee gets on the loose.

Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
Will get you from here to there.
Relieve you and believe me,
Without a worry or care.
If shitting is your problem
When you're out there in the stars,
Oh, the intergalactic laxative
Will get you from here to Mars.

Wherever man has conquered,
On the quest for frontiers new,
(Da da da da)
I'm glad that he's always had to do
The number one and two.
It makes it all so ordinary,
Just like you and me,
To know the greatest heroes,
They had to shit and pee.

The intergalactic laxative
Will get you from here to there,
For cosmic constipation
There's none that can compare.
If shitting is your problem
When you're out there in the stars,
Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
The intergalactic laxative,
The intergalactic laxative,
Will get you from here to Mars.

And can't seem to raise your head
You sit staring in the teacup
At the egg upon your bread
And the life that you are living
Doesn't seem to be quite real
You have only what the lonely call the blues

When you're feeling tired and weary
With your eyes cast to the floor
For a loved one who has left you
On a bleak and distant shore
You may think you're being picked on
But you are not the first
To have only what the lonely call the blues

- There are no rules to follow
No advice to take
You're the only one
Who can give yourself a shake
Someone will appear
To dispel all your fear
In a funny unexpected way -

Then you'll wake up in the morning
With a smile upon your face
And you'll look out on the world
And see it is a happy place
With no memory of misery
You will soon forget
You had only what the lonely call the blues

We stood in the windy city,
The gypsy boy and I.
We slept on the breeze in the midnight
With the raindrop and tears in our eyes.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young,
For I'm going to try for the sun.
We huddled in a derelict building
And when he thought I was asleep
He laid his poor coat round my shoulder,
And shivered there beside me in a heap.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young,
For I'm going to try for the sun.
We sang and cracked the sky with laughter,
Our breath turned to mist in the cold.
Our years put together count to thirty,
But our eyes told the dawn we were old.
And who's going to be the one
To say it was no good what we done ?
I dare a man to say I'm too young,
For I'm going to try for the sun.
Mirror, mirror, hanging in the sky,
Won't you look down what's happening here below?
I stand here singing to the flowers,
So very few people really know.
And who's going to be the one

There is an ocean of vast proportion
And she flows within ourselves.
To take dips daily we dive in gaily,
He knows who goes within himself.

The abode of Angels, the mystical Promised Land,
The one and only Heaven, the God of man
Is but the closing of an eyelid away.

There is a silence of pure excellence
And she flows within ourselves.
To appreciate, we deactivate,
He knows who goes within himself.

The domain of Devils, the Fearful Land,
The only and only Hades, the Satan of man
Is but the closing of an eyelid away.

All is as it was and ever more shall be,
Though they try to tell us it's not so.
Over all the earth there's nothing new to see,
Excepting every seed will newly grow.
Innocence of childhood false men misconstrue
To be years of darkness spent in shade,
Denying childhood's vision of the God of Love,
So that Truth be turned about and untruth made,
And untruth made.

There is a reason for every season
Of change within ourselves.
To navigate, re-appreciate
And know the flow within ourselves.

The deliverance from Deluge, the good dry land,
The one and only Haven, the rock of Man
Is but the closing of an eyelid away.

There is a silence, ooh,
There is a reason, ooh.

It was up some laughing river where I'd gone to spend the day.
I had such fantastic visions I could hardly stand to stay.
And I stood within myself and suddenly felt free,
And I stood above the burdens that puzzle you and me.
I became awareness that was shared with all around,
With the trees, the sky, the flowers, and the wind, the sun, the ground.
I heard the birds were singing and I found them same as me,
And I understood our sorrows and why they should not be.
I saw this plane of living, it was nothing more than faith,
A skin that covered glory, far beyond our love or hate,
A living crystal fairyland where loving is our grace,
A pyromanic garden that knows no time nor space.
I saw what we've been doing to it, saw it as insane,
Still a marching like good Christians with our wars, the sword, the flame,
To crush all those damned infidels, defend what should be shame.
And again I shared our sorrows and knew we all must bear the blame.
I see it all as part of us to know and share alike
With a universal willingness to know and do what's right,
To understand our brotherness and stop this awful race,
Let our children grow in peace, know their life shall not be waste.
First there is a mountain, then it seems the mountain's gone,
But then, if you take another look, why, it's been there all along.
We can be just like that river as it laughs along its way,
Or stand beneath the shadows that take the sun away.

Consumes you with its need.
Take a rest from the race
Why chase it ?

Who rests when he can,
Let old man time's sand
Slip through his hand.
And happy is the gal
Who calls peace her pal.
If you want to be free,
You shall, you shall.
Slow down world,
Take a break for God's sake.

Your money-mad climb up to the top,
Don't you just glance at the chance,
Why waste it ?
Don't chase it,

Let old man time's sand
Slip through his hand.

As the chains of the flesh left me
As the moans and the groans

As my earth form I shed
That the image of death had been
A thought in my head
And the truth was a spirit am I
I sussed ... that my life had been a lesson
Chosed by me
For to purify my Soul that I may be
Worthy to shine forth the Light

A Great Light there came
More feeling than seeing
And it filled me with Shame
Like a Bright Shining mirror reflecting my being

That shone forth the Light
With love vibes they met me
A cast off my fright
Those great souls of Ages long passed
I praised the Great Souls of the Ages
Who care for our needs
Who lovingly nurture
Wisdom's bright seed
Showing the way to the Light

I ached ... for the womb and the Earth
And another time around
Seking circumstances
The best that can be found
To give me the lessons to learn

And through teens I fought fiercely
For my vision of the Light

But leave our children with their toys of peppermint and candy.
For seagull I don't want your wings,
I don't want your freedom in a lie.

I read your faces like a poem, kaleidoscope of hate words.
For seagull I don't want your wings,
I don't want your freedom in a lie.
On the quilted battlefields of soldiers dazzling made of toy tin
The big bomb like a child's hand could sweep them dead just so to win.
For seagull I don't want your wings,
I don't want your freedom in a lie.
As you fill your glasses with the wine of murdered negroes
Thinking not of beauty that spreads like morning sun-glow.
Seagull I don't want your wings,
I don't want your freedom in a lie.
I pray your dreams of vivid screams of children dying slowly
And as you polish up your guns your real self be reflecting.
For seagull I don't want your wings,

Ah, but all my love I was savin'.
Oh, the winds blew high and the trees did sway,
Not much from life was I askin'.
Till I met someone to give all my love,
All my love, so long an' lasting.
Oh, good were the parts we played in our game
And a long ways off was tomorrow.
But my love was a rambler and restless as the sea,
And in the tide came sorrow.
Oh, a child of the night is goin' to be born,
I can't explain my confusion.
Is my love thinkin' to marry me at all
Or of the freedom he thinks he'll be losin'?
I sit with my friends in the gay crowded room,
My friends they're smokin' and a-talkin'.
But it all seems so empty, my love is not there,
So I'll go into the streets a-walkin'.
My baby is a-growin' as a-growin' it must,
If I were to lose it, it would grieve me.
My love is so helpless and I'm wonderin' what to do.
Oh, how I yearn to help him.
Oh, we could go to the land of your choice
Where the false shame won't come knockin' at our door.

To the shores of Trist la Cal,

But the seagulls they have gone,

I searched the sand for sound,
My eyes forced to the ground.
The wind it laughed wild and shrill,
My heart it tried to spill
Its crazy tears.
There is nothing left for me now
For the seagulls, they have gone,

I stand both young and old
But the winds of time blow cold.
This much you must believe:
It pains to see you grieve.

To climb to the stars
Balanced just on one knee.

The yellow corn lies in your hand.
And with the night comes sorrow
As the tide of dawn sleeps on the land.
The long breezes are blowing
All down the sky into my face.

Like my time has come and gone to waste.

As she lies here on my breast.

In the day I get no rest.

And I gave it to the river deep.

Where you lay, so long in sleep.

Once in a town in the black forest a little white toy-shop stood.
And the little tin soldier with only one leg lived in a castle of wood.
And across the room on another shelf stood a little glass case,
And a tiny ballerina lived in there all in her dress of lace.
And from where the little tin soldier stood they could see each other so clear
And the little tin soldier watched over her with a love that was so dear.
Then one day sadness came: the tiny ballerina was sold.
The little tin soldier was thrown away and into the gutter he rolled.
The water carried him to the sea and many far-off lands.
He made many children happy as he passed through their tiny hands.
And then one day they met again in a house in the land of Eire
And when the clocks on the wall struck the midnight hour
They jumped into a fire
And in that fire they shall stay
Forever and a day
For the fire, Lord, is the fire of love,
Just like the peaceful dove.

Cat's a-sleeping in the sun,
Eyes take heed the colours call.
Sunlight patterns touch the wall,
Red kerchiefs sail and fall,
Cat's a sleeping in the sun.
Dragon kite in the sky,
Wheel and turns, spin and fly,
Attacked by rooks and never fail
To cry the sound of fairy tales.
The cat is walkin' in the sun.
All the pebbles I have seen,
Precious stones for Colleen.
Every minute I pass through
With the grooves spent with you.
The cat is yawning in the sun.
Jewelled castles I have built
With freak feelings of guilt.
And the words stab to the hilt,
Pick the flower and it will wilt,
Cat's a-shifting in the sun.
Marionette dangles death
Insensitivity is fed.
By the TV wizard's wand
Once in the spell you're conned,

Bobbed in an eating scene.

Smearing their eyes on the crazy Kali goddess
Listenin' to sounds of Mingus mellow fantastic.

In dull house rooms with coloured lights swingin'
Strange music boxes sadly tinklin'
Drink in the sun shining all around you.

Donovan,"On a lone and windy hilltop beneath a roof of tin
In a little wallpapered bedroom I done my growin'
'Twas there I dreamt my dreams, I hung my jeans
And wandered through my puberty as all do

My mother was a tight nut bound up with false guilt
Strapped up in her fearing wall she had built
The independent girl in a dark and cruel world
She'd lost the way to say, ""OK, now lay back""

We disagreed on most things, I shouted peace and love
The family is mankind, the symbol of the dove
She only saw the surface of things before her face
But I was young and argued on for hours

My father he liked poetry, a scholar he might have made
Had nothing, born a poor boy barefoot and underpaid
So the man worked with his hands up and down the land
His dreams forgot he thought that I must follow

With his marks as worker's wisdom he'd read a thing or two
He once had been a Mason but he never followed through
Always kind and thoughtful, smelling of mushy oil
And he read me poetry of visionaries

I flunk my way to college, a looser kind of school
But we bobbed and played time arty, feeling cool
Just to live an artists diggin' the ravin' scene
Reading Kerouac and Ginsberg well deuced

I was not academic, Art and English neat
The history of mankind I liked that a bit
And what was I to do? The choices they were few
I done right disgrace to the working classes

I done right disgrace to the working classes
I done right disgrace to the working classes

From my window to the street I cast my weary eye.
Everything is quiet in the lonesome dusky night.
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
I remember the days when the sun was warm with love
Softening as the day grew old in dazzling streaks of gold.
Now my days are bleek, the sunset's the cruellest time
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
I feel I want to ramble to the shores of the mighty sea
Pounding in my ears the wind so wild and free
To stumble in the high grass, the sand a-glowin' white
My eyes they fill, they break and spill the darkness of my night.
My sorrow is confusing, my love will never know
My empty hands they lie down by my sides so low
I walk this sleeping town and the highway in-between bright
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
Riding feathered wings to make like I'm a dove
Oft I've heard the world as it cries out for some love
Cries out for some warmth, a little compassion and light
They're feeling so alone in the darkness of their night.

An' my belly is craving, I got shakin' in my head

For I'll reel and I'll fall and rise on codine
An' it's real, an' it's real, one more time

Wild whiskey, confronted I often did swear
My mother and father said whiskey is a curse
But the fate of their baby is many times worse
An' it's real, an' it's real, one more time
You'll forget your woman, you'll forget about man
Try it just once, an' you'll try it again
It's sometimes you wonder and it's sometimes you think
That I'm a-living my life with abandon to drink
An' it's real, an' it's real, one more time
Stay away from the cities, stay away from the towns
Stay away from the men pushin' the codine around
Stay away from the stores where the remedy is found
I will live a few days as a slave to codine
An' it's real, an' it's real, one more time
An' my belly is craving, I've got a shakin' in my head
An' I've started heating whether my body said
Steady yourself with the grains of cocaine
An' you'll end dead or you'll end up insane

We'll leave the rain behind and walk away.
We walk along the lonesome shoreline listening to the sea,
Talking to you and me about the sky
And we know even as we walk that way before the dawn
Our footsteps will be gone far away.

Lies by me and holds on tight

To let you down to the earth's deep core
You'll be back in time fot tea
With a diamond to show me

Come run jump skip a long sam
A very happy man I am
To know you are well and you're doing fine
Kind-of puts at rest my mind

How's your brush and your lady fair
Not to mention your stained glass stair
Flower pot on window sill
On top of honeycomb hill



",Skip-A-Long Sam,2001
Donovan,"
Sun, the earth is turning
It's turning round
And love is the access
But they chop the tree down
All the proud trees are standing
As green as the sky
As green as the greenstone
That makes seabirds fly

ovens area baking
And the rivers run dry
As dry as the ocean
On wings of a fly
Go if you're able
And come if you can
Life's very unstable
It's built upon sand

marianne set the table
An old friend I see
Marianne fetch the papers
There's two for tea



",Sun,2001
Donovan,"There was a time I thought of mine only
Could it be occurred to me while lonely
I was noble personage
Born to beautify the page
If I used time to set it down

There was a time I thought of mine only
Could it be occurred to me while lonely
I was of high lineage
Cast up in a dreadful age
Born to be the hermit of my line

On a windy Saturday
St. Alban's market day
Little did I know
The work I was to do
Or the love I had to show



",There Was a Time,2001
Donovan,"Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me
And tune his merry note
Unto the sweet bird's
Come hither come hither come hither
Here shall he see no enemy
But winter and rough weather

Who doth ambition shun
And love to live in the sun
Seeking the food he eats
And pleased with what he gets
Come hither come hither come hither
Here shall he see no enemy
But winter and rough weather

and if it do come to pass
That any man turn ass
Leaving his wealth and ease
A stubborn will to please
Ducdame ducdame ducdame
There shall he see gross fools as he
And if will come to me



",Under the Greenwood Tree,2001
Donovan,"One day a funny kind of man
Came walking down this street
He wore a shoe upon his head
And hats upon his feet,

He raised the shoe and smiled at me
His manners were polite
But never had I seen before
Such a funny sounding sight

He said : Â«Â Allow me to present
Your highness with a roseÂ Â»
An taking out a current bun
He held it ti his nose

Staggered back against the wall
And the I answered : Â«Â well,
I never saw a rose with such
A funny looking smellÂ Â».

He the began to sing a song
Mmmmmm.........................
And sat down on the ground
You never heard in all yollur life
Such a funny feeling sound

Â«Â My friend, why do you wear
2 hats upon your feet?Â Â» I said
He turned the other way about
And hopped on his head.

Striking a holy pose
Trying to hide their nakedness
With mediaval clothes

Slipping her royalty
The essence of noncommitalness
In the grand democracy.

We hope for better things from Charles.

There is an ocean of vast proportion
And she flows within ourselves.
To take dips daily we dive in gaily,
He knows who goes within himself.

The abode of Angels, the mystical Promised Land,
The one and only Heaven, the God of man
Is but the closing of an eyelid away.

There is a silence of pure excellence
And she flows within ourselves.
To appreciate, we deactivate,
He knows who goes within himself.

The domain of Devils, the Fearful Land,
The only and only Hades, the Satan of man
Is but the closing of an eyelid away.

All is as it was and ever more shall be,
Though they try to tell us it's not so.
Over all the earth there's nothing new to see,
Excepting every seed will newly grow.
Innocence of childhood false men misconstrue
To be years of darkness spent in shade,
Denying childhood's vision of the God of Love,
So that Truth be turned about and untruth made,
And untruth made.

There is a reason for every season
Of change within ourselves.
To navigate, re-appreciate
And know the flow within ourselves.

The deliverance from Deluge, the good dry land,
The one and only Haven, the rock of Man

Daddy missed my game and I made a touchdown
I won the talent show but you weren't around
If a girl breaks my heart what do I do with this pain (and one more thing daddy)
Can you tell me my name?

[Chorus:]
It takes a whole nation
To help me raise this generation (I need my daddy)
When you look out of your window
Tell me what do you see
If it's a world without a father
Then you're looking at me (Yay)
It takes a whole nation (It's a million of us)
To help me raise this generation (Oh... uh... Oh Lord)
My respect to the mother's that be holdin' it down
But it'd sure be nice to have my daddy around.(Everybody that didn't have a father in your life... I want you to stand up and sing this part right here)(Hey)
Tell em!

Ain't nothing gonna break me down (Yes sir)
Can't let nobody take me down
Can't let nobody break me down
Me down (Sing it)

Ain't nothing gonna break me down
Can't let nobody take me down
Can't let nobody break me down... Me down (Take me down no)

Ain't nothing gonna break me down (Hey)
Can't let nobody take me down (Nobody taught me)
Can't let nobody break me down... Me down (Break me down)
(I had to figure this thing out by myself)

(Heaven can you hear me?)

Ain't nothing gonna break me down
Can't let nobody take me down (can't you here we're lonely?)(Come on)
Can't let nobody break me down... Me down (I'll be their father... I'll be their man! Come on)
(Yay)

[Chorus:]

It takes a whole nation
(Ain't nothing gonna break me down)
To help me raise this generation(If you feel me say yeah

(I hear you people)
When you look out of your window
(Can't let nobody break me down... me down)(If you feel me say yeah)
Tell me what do you see
If it's a world without a father (Oh)
Then you're looking at me
It takes a whole nation (I know)
(Please Lord)(You can't take my joy devil)
(Ain't nothing gonna break me down)
To help me raise this generation
(Can't let nobody take me down)(Daddy could be there) (Sing it boy!)

Beat 'em off the block, now cock-wrap they bop

I got Harmony and Thug tendencies all in my Bones
No need to be flashy, for heads to recognize me
Hi-Tek throw them joints that magnetize me

They tested but questioned weapons rest in my foes
Blessed in my flows and obsessed with my scrolls
Midas Touch as it's told, writin nuttin less than gold

Suspicious goals distort good intentions

If he was close to the edge, then I'll give him a push
And do this whole world a favor, hey there howdy neighbor
Shit, I'm sorry I took so long to save you

She asked me my sign, I told her bitch Aires

I paint the white house black, and start renting it out

In this underground game, I'm rolling with S.L.A.B

Got a itching trigga finger, when I'm holding my strap

Steady riding my dick, like bitches do

But now my glock is fully loaded, and ready to aim

Everybody better clear the lot, when the lights off
I set it off, when I luger ride for the cause
And fuck the law, I'ma mash till I'm finished and done
And when it's all said and done, I'ma be number one

To tell the truth I done had it, this game is really fin to get tragic

And chills the blood in his veins,

Let's give it time, and work it out
Every time you think you've got it made, you stand
Last, don't you think that I can't stand this pain
Forever again well oh no...
I've crossed the line, so I just can't lose it
I'm tied and bound and I can't abuse it
And all the things we've been fighting for
We'll break it loose, I can take some more
Don t go giving me all your reasons
I can see them, but they'll hurt me I know
Cause if the time should come that you'll be leaving
Will I have the strength to let you go!
Please stop bringing me all your reasons
False pretenses only make me feel sad ,
Cause if the time should come that you'll be leaving
Only hope that I will understand!",Let Sleeping Dogs Lie,2012

Smell of anarchy

Hold 'em tight till the end 
Better now you know we'll never 
Wait till tomorrow 
Lights out, lights out in London 
Hold 'em tight till the end

Heaven help those who help themselves 
That's the way it goes 
The frightening thoughts of what's been taught 
And now it shows

You keep coming, there's no running

Under your feet grass is growing

To the coldness of sun

No one, no one at all
Moves on and on etc.
Look behind the window winter's come?

Blood on the streets, when the black skies shout
And then people cry no more
Dreams just fade away, realities soar

Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish

In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules

Good luck",Gazzillion Ear,2009
DOOM,"Ladies

Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through

Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, perplexin' like Acapulco Gold

If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like

Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight, lettin' everybody hit it

I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her

I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though

Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinner
If caught I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds

Little young thing, she likes to do the tongue thing
At times, she would play hard to get, grunting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling

Met her at Central Park this one time
Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin' sunshine
She said, you need to stop messin' wit that white girl
She fuckin' wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl

We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the Dutch price OT
Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish

And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' pulled back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy

Sugar mommy laced me with the butter Navy Avi
Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on

Got smooth beats and verses
Rappers mad 'cause I show them hearses
It's not my purpose, they just worthless
It ain't worth this time, rehearse them lines
Me, I never had to practice, I just wrote and shined
A walking diamond yet they treat me like feldspar (what?)
I'm not as common as you think, you better dwell hard
On the past, the present and the future too
Were you part of the few who knew Nehru before he blew?
No challenger, my mission can't fail
'Cause I'm lookin' at my vision and this shit is gettin' real
I'm hoping to get some meals, no hobo
I'm hoping I don't grow old before I show the whole globe
What I know and what I see
Plus who I plan to be, that's a man of peace
Got Gandhi in his genes so you gotta get the theme
Others parking while I speed, am I targeted to lead?

Just put your mind to it, you'll go mad far
Like the plasma in reactors when you're headed to the stars
Let it be tomorrow, it starts on the inside
Use intuition and conscience as a guide, glide
Choose a target, however immaculate
Focus till it manifest pin-point accurate
That's a sure bet, and Villain's no gambler
Freeze-frame a thought like it's caught on camera
Advice is free of charge, just pay attention
A donation as they say in this dimension
A game-winning strategy, support your favorite charity
Playing with polarity could drain a whole battery
Beware of apathy and procrastination
And put the plan in full effect for instant activation
Just a few jewels that's hidden in plain sight
Ain't nothing else to it but to do it, but do it right
Aight?

Great things
Great things
One, seven, nine, six, yeah

I'm seeing great things in my vision, started with an intention
And then moved farther when I parted with my soul extensions
Erased all the tension that my mind was inventin'
And used it for useful venting, Nehru, you do it different
I'm missing mental misery that's usually in-built in me
And building the empire higher, acquire light
And he's growing to be enlightened, a frightening sight
Like Michael Myers when he strikes with the knife
Better grab your reds it's about to get epic
So shoot it in high res while they aligning with the message
Nehruvians wild blessing, we straight from the Gods
In the heavens, perfection, we live walking talking seven
Been striving for these goals since eleven, now they hear me
Get ready and prepared for what may appear eerie
Directing my own theories, they finally see 'em clearly
I'mma make change severely 'cause I can't force dearly
Sincerely

I'mma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision

Back in black, it's your local superhero from the hood
Ironman Stark's got the good
Not that good good like Snoop
I bulletproofed the Coop'
Polished up the suit and gathered the troops
Got a brand new ray gun
Me and DOOM heading down to the range
To shoot in the matrix
Catch bullets with my hands and teeth, I break faces
Wild car chases, don of all ages
I saved the world that's fucking history pages
My Wu crescent signs in the sky at night
Watch how my eagle on my wrist take off into flight
All my might, white glass teeth that write
Ain't a bird or a plane it's a ghost on the mic
Two hammers and a diamond blade sword
Thicker than the Ford F1-50
Niggas couldn't lift me

Gab for the shift, overwork, overtime
Jerk you been warned, go for mine

Off to rip this one for the Gipper, get gypped

World has been shattered. Crippled. All we have left is
Fragments of doors. Though we once had but never had.
We've all been fooled. Confusion. My senses are dying my
Soul is crying. Let me out. Let me out. I'm screaming.

Malgré une daronne aux épaules de déménageurs
C'est vrai que mes livres sont restés sur les étagères
Frôler les paros ou la tombe, plus rien ne me fait peur
Donc, laisse moi faire mes petits pas chaloupés
Laisse moi me vider la tête, me mettre au beurre d'karité
Caresser mes plus belles années, à défaut de les aimer
Avancer avec mes amis, le teint basané

Égaré sur un beat salsa, avoue que c'est sale ça

J'ai compté sur la plupart du coup j'ai sauté dans le vide

Entre l'amour et l'amitié l'incertitude fera son poids
T'auras beau connaître tout un tas de meufs mais une fois dans les bois
Si tu dois cher-ca un corps, dis-moi quel serait trop choix
Une boule en plein milieu du thorax qui flirte avec le foie
L'amitié c'est juste un masque qui che-ca une tête de mort
Certains limite schizophrène au niveau du comportement
Pour tous nos soldats de l'ombre qu'on a pu juger par leurs actes
Les vrais de vrais, coupe moi cinq doigts t'auras le chiffre exact
J'tiens pas à faire de nouvelles connaissances traite moi d'incandescent
Me connaissant, chaque déception me rend méconnaissable
Moi je t'aime pour ce que tu es, toi t'aimes ce que tu veux que je sois
J'en veux pas, juste mes gavas avec qui je peux être moi

Tu n'auras plus jamais d'amis comme moi
On pourrait se dire, je le sais, t'as changé comme moi

Speeding through lands as yet unknown, our steeds break their backs 
The bridles bleed and the saddles burn, but so goes the game

Time is the only pain we know and we know it well 
Possessed to ride forever more across this barren hell 

Our legend stretches 'cross many lands and tells of fools thought brave 
We chased them down on seas of sand, we chased them to their graves 
Black horse screams with black tongue as he runs you down

'Cause if I hit this dank, I'ma shoot me a bitch
Fuck it, *puff*, bang bang,
Five minutes later, the cops came
I'm settin up shop for the black market

Told you that I'd come but I came insane
Born braincell killas, scramblin niggas brains
If you gotta go you gotta go I like the six-fo
I'm pullin GTA's, it ain't yo's no mo'

You can tell that I'm evil
By the arch in my eye bra
But I ain't got no pitchfork

Hit the floor, duck behind your couch

Pillage your village
Slaughter your children
And rape your women

Bustin through that door like dun da dun da
Bitches hit the floor on the double
Bust off a couple
Rounds and let it bubble
In your belly
Bullets dipped in formaldehyde
So when they hit you
You embalmed and ready
To get carried
Buried up in your grave
Trust me, I'm that deadly
Just test me if you brave

Kill a bitch nigga quick
And run a train on his bitch nigga

I wish these niggaz would try to rough me for the chips
I got metal muscle with silent tips
And pistol grips give violent trips
First I'm cool with you
Then I'm not

Gun up on me it's all official

I'm comin to your house nigga
What's for breakfast
Kickin in your door

Hell's angel, some niggaz call me spawn

Shit I'm off that ??? again
Ready to load the pump again
Soon as I put somethin in
See i'ma aim it at your chin
Blame it on your friend
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
I can make niggaz follow me like the pod piper can

Doom to put 'em in the pan
Heat 'em and eat 'em as fast as I can
Stretch your neck like elastic like plastic

Tephlon bullets they crash and land

Load up all my extra clips

Trouble is what we lookin fo
Kick in that fuckin door

Slit that niggaz throat
Light up the door

Trouble (repeat 8 times)

[Verse 4]
I keeps it real that's the deal
Headbuttin motherfuckers like Evander Holyfield
I makes a full course dinner 
Out of roadkill
Pops some pills
Smoke some sherms
Drunk as fuck
Rollin up a blunt
When I get through smokin it
I'm comin to your house nigga
What's for breakfast
Kickin in your door 
At 3:47 in the morning
I got my ?? yawnin
Time to wake up, so I can do your bitch ass wrong
Hear comes trouble
Hell's angel, some niggaz call me spawn

[Verse 5]
Shit I'm off that ??? again
Ready to load the pump again
Soon as I put somethin in
See i'ma aim it at your chin
Blame it on your friend
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
I can make niggaz follow me like the pod piper can
Arachnophobia, I'm the sniper man
Doom to put 'em in the pan
Heat 'em and eat 'em as fast as I can
Stretch your neck like elastic like plastic
Man I'm first, you last to land
Tephlon bullets they crash and land
Nigga I'm double time
You in trouble time
I'm a bubble mine

[Verse 6]
I'm titani and scandalous
I do random hits
Load up all my extra clips
And lets go handle this shit
Trouble is what we lookin fo
Kick in that fuckin door
Put a gag up on that hoe
Slit that niggaz throat
Light up the door
Smoke until we choke
I wish you motherfuckers would try to locc 
And get his neck broke
Kick in the door
Shotgun up the asshole
Brains blown
Eyes closed
Nothin but trouble

Think of me babe whenever
Some sweet talking guy comes along singing his song
Don't mess around, 
You got to be strong 
Just Stop, 'cause I really love You
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together

You, you belong to me now
Ain't gonna set you free now
When those guys start hanging around talking me down
Hear with your heart and you won't hear a sound
Just stop, 'cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together 

Whatever young and beautiful 
Someday your looks will be gone
When the others turn you off 
Who'll be turning you on

I will, I will, I will, I will 
Be there to share forever
Love will keep us together
Said it before and I'll say it again while others pretend
I'll need you now and I'll need you then

Made some mistakes I'm not too proud

I'm getting higher every day
I'm growing stronger in a way
I'm living life with no glance
But I'm not finished yet
I'm not finished yet
So I'm just gonna keep on climbing
Until I find my silver lining
There's nothing in this world to stop this
Had that in mind
So I keep on climbing
And I'm just gonna keep on climbing

The road is gonna be tough but I will reach the sky
I will keep on climbing

Keep on

What the world has got for me

I will keep on climbing

I will see the light through the darkness
I will get where I need to be
As long as I know where my heart is
I'm pushing higher and higher and higher and higher
And higher and higher and higher

Doorslammer,"Frankie died just the other night 
Some say it was suicide 
But we know 
How the story goes 

With his six string knife 
And his street wise pride 
The boy was a man before his time 
And she knew 
All their dreams would come true 

But ya see Frankie was fast 
Too fast to know 
He wouldn't go slow 
Until his lethal dose 
And she knows 
He'll finally come too close

She always knew 
This day would come soon

With a switchblade knife

Took Frankie's life

I got rhymes by the buckets make you niggas wanna suck it
But you loveless, I’m the epitome of god-gifted
When I busted my first rap the whole planet shifted
Lifted you mind to the next stress hemisphere
The next level shift so you best to just step in here
Check my gear, I got flavour mad hip hop
I could run in the roughest neighbourhood and not get shot
I black out when niggas start hating shit
Run over your crew like the New England Patriots
The craziest but I’m also the laziest
Never turn on the TV so I don’t know who Jay-Z is

Where nigga getting worse and I’m only getting better

Hardcore hip hop, we laugh at your idols
Fuck your advice, I walk the path of the psychos
I kill MCs regardless of which rhyme I drop
On top of the corpses we climb to the top
So who’s next to flop cause he thought he was heavy?
The last one retired when I tore through his belly
The cyborgs are ready to reboot the system
People go missing and that seemed to have vanished
They ask me what happened? Why do I act funny?
I stay braindead like I got bitten by a rat monkey

The same old song, you just don’t progress
You won’t confess, that you all fame obsessed
I seen it all and I’m far from impressed
I get a lot of criticism, you can be my guest
This hip hop shit just got repossessed
Peeps don’t wanna see us have any success
It’s time for these rookies to go hit the benchpress
You’re not the guy I used to know, it’s all about the rate of flows
Even got a Golden Globe, what a way to go
