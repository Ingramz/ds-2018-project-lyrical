Louis Armstrong,"I don't want you
But I hate to lose you
You've got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea

I forgive you
'Cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea

I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come knockin' at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more

I should hate you
But, mama, I guess instead I love you
You've got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea",Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,1988
Louis Armstrong,"Don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
You can't lose a broken heart

If you ever break up
Then try to make up
It's tough to make a brand new start

Take a walk
Think it over
While strolling neath the moon
Don't say things in December
You'll regret in June

Ware your remarks
Before you speak
Or you may be sorry soon
Don't be erratic
Be diplomatic
To keep your heart's in tune

Cruel harsh words
Often spoken
Will upset your apple cart
So don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
'Cause, you can't lose a broken heart

Don't lose your head
Then lose your girl
You can't lose a broken heart

If you ever break up
Then try to make up
It's tough to make a brand new start

Take a walk
And think it over
While strolling neath the moon
Don't say things in December
Baby you'll regret in June

Ware your remarks
Before you speak
Or you may be sorry soon, baby
Don't be erratic
Be diplomatic
To keep your heart's in tune

Cruel harsh words
Often spoken
Will upset your apple cart, baby
So don't lose your head
Then lose your girl
'Cause, you can't lose a broken heart

No, you can't, can't lose a broken heart",You Can't Lose a Broken Heart,1988
Louis Armstrong,"In a quaint caravan
There's a lady they call the Gypsy
She can look in the future
And drive away all your fears

Everything will go right
If you only believe the Gypsy
She could tell at a glance
That my heart was so full of tears

She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true
Then all at once I knew, dear
Somebody else was kissing you

But I'll go there again
'Cause I want to believe the Gypsy
That my lover is true
And will come back to me someday

She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true
Then all at once I knew, dear
Somebody else was kissing you

But I'll go there again
'Cause I got to believe the Gypsy
That my lover is true
And will come back to me someday
That my lover is true
And will come back to me someday",The Gypsy,1989
Louis Armstrong,"Many a tear has to fall, but it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game that we know as love
You have words with him and your future's looking dim
But these things your hearts can rise above

Once in a while he won't call, but it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side with a sweet bouquet
And he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away

(Soon he'll be there at your side) with a sweet bouquet
Then he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away",It's All in the Game,1989

Louis Armstrong,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
",Rose Room,1989
Louis Armstrong,"I know you've tried to say, that

It's the last time
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel it when I'm holding you
And you're as cold as ice.

It's the last time
I can taste it in your kiss,
I can hear it in the silence
And we both know what it is,
It's the last time

There's nothing I can say
I haven't said before
If I've made mistakes along the way
I can't have loved you more
There's no side of me I'm hiding
No new way to make you care
I've tried everything I can and still
The feeling isn't there... and

It's the last time
And I can't belive it's true
If I had a chance with anyone
I swear my chance was you.

It's the last time
And I'm angry and I'm scared
And I don't know what I'll do
When I wake up and you're not there,
It's the last time

It's the last time
I just can't believe that you don't need me
The last time
I juts can't belive that you would leave me
The last time
I'll be such a lonely man, belive me
The last time

The last time
Now I'll have to spend my nights without you
The last time
Now I'll have to fight my dreams about you
The last time
I would change your mind if I knew how to
But it's the last time...
",The Last Time,1989
Louis Armstrong,"Let him put you down, if he dares
I'll pick you up by myself just as soon
I don't care, you never rest on the shelf

I've been looking for a girl like you so long
A girl so nice and gentle with a love that's strong
I'll make life for you, one grand sweet song
Oh, give me a break, sweet mama and you can't go wrong

I for you, you for me
That's the only way two loving hearts should be
So just be glad when he puts you down
I'll pick you up all myself

",Put 'Em Down Blues,1989
Louis Armstrong,"I really can't stay
Mama it's cold outside
I've got to go away
I said it's cold outside
I wish I knew how
Tickled to death that you'd drop in
To break this spell
You'd better break that spell, oh God

My mother will start to worry
Mama, what's your hurry?
Father will be pacing the floor
And he's gotta go, he's gotta go
Really I'd better hurry
Please don't hurry

Take some 'Swiss Kriss' while I pour

Mama, it's bad out there
Hey pops, (what's that?) what's in this drink?
Ain't no fun to be had out there, you know
This evenin' has been
It aint' even started yet
So nice and fine
Take another drink-a-wine
And maybe you'll change your mind
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
You don't have to call me sir
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
Give it up, give it up, give it up
I really can't stay
And, don't hold out
Ahh, but it's cold outside

Look-a there honey, look at that window there
You can't go out there in all that bad weather 
Not gonna let you go out there, it's stupid of me to do that
You at the wrong window anyway, that's a bay window there
See the one that's in the middle there, yeah the one that's boarded
See that out house there, ain't no use in you goin' out there
In all that bad weather, gettin' them two little skis all frost bitten
But pops, I didn't tell mama and papa where I was goin'
You didn't what
In fact, I sneaked outta the house
Oh, Velma, don't never do that to your mama and papa
You stay here three more days then you go back home to your people there
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
What about my sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied

I really can't stay
An-bol-eh-do-as
Ahh but it's cold outside

Hey pops, I'd really like to stick around
I wish you would

Over in the aristocratic part, way over, really
Where would that be honey
Over on Jackson Street
She ain't been in town two hours and she done found out what Jackson street is
She left on a plane owing me two dollars too 
Yes indeed folks this is the place

Only five thousand per

Says, ""You'll pay six to her""

Frankie was loyal to Johnny

Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was making love to Nellie Bligh

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

Now Frankie's dad was a policeman
She stole his old forty-four gun
Then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run

After her man
Who was doing her wrong

Now Frankie peaked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
She whipped out that old forty-four
And her rootie-toot-boom, that gal did shoot
Right through that hardwood swinging door

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

So bring on your crepe and your flowers
Bring on your rubber-tired hack

When the lights are down low
Grab your baby, then go

Do the Hucklebuck
Do the Hucklebuck
If you don't know how to do it
Boy, you're out of luck
Push your partner out
Then you hunch your back
Start a little movement in your sacroiliac
Wiggle like a snake, waddle like a duck
That's the way you do it when you do the Hucklebuck

Everybody's looking for a-somethin' new
It could be cars, it could be clothes
Or just a stylish shoe
But if you like your dancin'
Better take my tip
Get set, warn the band, and let 'er rip

You go a little to the left
A little to the right
Get hold of your partner
Tell him, ""No need to fight""
Push your partner 'round
And then you hunch your back
Start your movement in your sacroiliac

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?
And so, all else above,
I'm waiting for the man I love.",The Man I Love [#],1992

I commission you, find a riff that's new

A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes

A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We two should be like clams in a dish of chowder
But we just fizz like parts of seidlitz powder

Yes, a fine romance, with no glitches
A fine romance, with no beaches
Just as hard to land as the Isle de France
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion

A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance

Yes, a fine romance, my dear judges
Two old fogies who need crutches
True love should have the thrills
That a healthy crime has
Oh we don't have the thrills
That the march of time has

A fine romance, my good woman
My strong aged in the wood, woman
You never give the orchids I sent a glance
No you like cactus plants
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my dear duchess
Two old fogies who need crutches
True love should have the thrills
That a healthy crime has
You know Louie we don't have half the thrills
That the march of time has

Fine romance, my very good woman
My strong aged in the wood woman
You never give the orchids I sent a glance
No I prefer cactus plants

'Twas for charity?

We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see
A scene that's dear to me

I dream of old [unverified] in June

When the twilight brings the evening breeze,

Splashing the night away,
Hear those banjos ringin', the folks are all a-singin',
They dance till break of day.

He knows things are wrong, and he's right

From Natchez to mobile
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
I been in some big towns
And heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know
A man's a two-face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night
Yes, the lonely, lonely blues in the night",Blues in the Night,1994
Louis Armstrong,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you, dear, only
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending?
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Louis Armstrong,"Ev'ning marks the close of day,
Skies of blue begin to grey,
Crimson hues are fading in the West;
Ev'ning ever brings to me
Dreams of days that used to be,
Memories of those I love the best.
 
When shadows fall 
And trees whisper day is ending,
My thoughts are ever wending Home.
When the crickets call,
My heart is forever yearning,
Once more to be returning Home.
When the hills conceal the setting sun,
Stars begin a peeping one by one.
Night covers all 
And, though fortune may forsake me,
Sweet dreams will ever take me Home.

That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed,

But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine.

To see if reindeer really know how to fly

That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while.
Hospitality, they were good to me.
I couldn't spend a dime, and had the grandest time.
I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear,
They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed, all the band folks played Real harmony.
I never will forget the tune that Handy called the Memphis Blues.
Oh yes, them Blues.

They've got a fiddler there that always slickens his hair
And folks he sure do pull some bow.
And when the big Bassoon seconds to the Trombones croon.
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day, on Revival Day.

Oh that melody sure appealed to me.
Just like a mountain stream rippling on it seemed.
Then it slowly died, with a gentle sigh
Soft as the breeze that whines high in the summer pines.
Hear me people, hear me people, hear I pray,
I'm going to take a million lesson's 'til I learn how to play
Because I seem to hear it yet, simply can't forget
That blue refrain.

There's nothing like the Handy Band that played the Memphis Blues so grand.
Oh play them Blues.

Is like a sweet old sorrow song.
Here comes the very part that wraps a spell around my heart.
It sets me wild to hear that loving tune a gain, the Memphis Blues.",Memphis Blues,1997

One night perfect for romancing,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
He wanted thrills, she wanted love,
Oh but his sighs were tender

As he begged her to surrender,

And she believed that it was love.
How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing,
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying.

I never did fit in too well with folks you knew

I couldn't stand the way she did me.
Couldn't take her low down ways.
Before I'll stay with a cheatin' woman,
I'll go and live with the bears in Miller's Cave.

Caught her out, Sunday morning,
With some guy they call big Dave.
The meanest man in Waycross, Georgia,
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave.

I said: ""You'll pay both you and Davey,
""I'm gonna see you in your grave.""
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em,
I took their cheating, scheming bones to Miller's Cave.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I&'m in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
(Come on and) Dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
That (Those) charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...

Louis Armstrong,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends,2005
Louis Armstrong,"I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.",Foggy Day in London Town,2005

Ramblin' and scramblin' and a-headin' for town
Hoppin' and boppin' and a-buzzin' around
Happily awaitin' at the station
I look at that train number 709
Hoppin' and boppin' and arrivin' on time
Who do you think is about to arrive?
The band they call the Dixieland Five

They're gonna play that muskrat ramble tune
Like the way you never heard it played

She can look this wide world over
She'll never find a sweet man like me

Louis Armstrong,"I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dreams came true

The wind in the willow played love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made were never to be
Though we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

Each afternoon we'll go
(On Blueberry Hill)
Higher than the moon we'll go
(And lingered until)
Then, to a weddin' in June we'll go
(My dreams came true)

The wind in the willow played
(Do you really love me)
Love's sweet melody
(As I love you?)

But all of those vows we made

Were never to be

For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill",Blueberry Hill [Live],2005
Louis Armstrong,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon
The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone",The Song Is Ended (Melody Lingers On),2005
Louis Armstrong,"Don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
You can't lose a broken heart

If you ever break up
Then try to make up
It's tough to make a brand new start

Think it over
While strolling beneath the moon
Don't say things in December
You'll regret in June

Ware your remark
Before you speak
Or you may be sorry soon,
Don't be erratic 
Be diplomatic
To keep your heart's in tune

Often spoken
Will upset your applecart

And I think to myself what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by

Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Till it was worn
Into a blue note
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues [DVD],2006

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Yes, she done told me, ""Don't you wear no black.

Go to Saint Louis, you can win him back."" 
Help me to Cairo, make Saint Louis by maself, 
Git to Cairo, find ma old friend Jeff, 
Gwine to pin maself close to his side;
If ah flag his train, I sho' can ride.

You ought to see dat stovepipe brown of mine, 
Lak he owns de Dimon' Joseph line, 
He'd make a cross-eyed o'man go stone blin'.
Blacker than midnight, teeth lak flags of truce, 
Blackest man in de whole of Saint Louis, 
Blacker de berry, sweeter am de juice.
About a crap game, he knows a pow'ful lot, 
But when worktime comes, he's on de dot.
Gwine to ask him for a cold ten-spot, 
What it takes to git it, he's cert'nly got.

Locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care
Down in the hen house, somethin' stirred
When he shouted, ""Who's there?""
This is what he heard

“There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So calm yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble, hobble hobble hobble with your chin”

You're kickin' up an awful dust

And hobble, hobble hobble hobble, it's a sin”

“Tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do, We got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of settin', gettin' chicks to hatch”

“Ohh, there ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
Kindly point that gun the other way
And hobble, hobble hobble of and hit the hay”

Louis Armstrong,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous; he answers twice
It's really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, you can't confess
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

She sits alone 'most every night

He says he's busy, but she says, ""Is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her""

He says, ""Now, Judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge right into jail""

Without her I can't go on

Paradise to live

On a show or two

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [From Stardust Memories (1980)],2010

Waiting for the plane to leave
And the captain says, ""There'll be a short delay
Bear with me, please""

""You can't take those guitars on board""
But the boys in the band just smiled
Heard it all before

And as they're starting to serve champagne
To the folks at the front of the plane
I can hear the engines roaring

I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day.

And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk.

Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
