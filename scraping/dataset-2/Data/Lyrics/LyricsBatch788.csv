On the mantle
I'm not sad

All I have grown

Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
And not seen
At the seams

I'm a lender
I'm a planter
I put something
In the garden

In the handle
On the mantle

I'm a god

But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun

I think I'm dumb
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
My heart is broke
But I have some glue
Help me inhale
And mend it with you
We'll float around
And hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
And have a hangover, have a hangover

Skin the sun
Fall asleep
Wish away
The soul is cheap
Lesson learned
Wish me luck
Soothe the burn
Wake me up

I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun

That legendary divorce is such a bore

As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad

L’échec, on connaît pas, on connaît qu’le liquide
C’est qui qu’a fait couler le sang sur nos terres d’origine?
Ce succès de merde j’en ai rêvé
J’ai mouillé l’maillot, j’suis arrivé
Dorénavant aucun rival
Tous ces rappeurs sont mes produits dérivés
Le père de mon père était jnouné
Un vieux du village l’a évangélisé
Mon arrière grand-mère s’est fait tourner
À travers mon teint t’aperçois qu’je suis colonisé
Terroriser, j’vais les terroriser
Sans faire de choix, j’vais pas favoriser
Tu vois ce jour faudra l’mémoriser
J’vais vous donner une leçon qu’faudra réviser
J’te laisse par terre
OG Kush dans la bouche, j’viens du hood
Négro t’as un flingue, j’en ai douze, j’ai le blues
Eh, prends rendez-vous chez l’ostéopathe
J’vais reprendre c’que me doit César
Après minuit à l’hôtel j’me fais Cléopâtre

The gadget turned the pre-dawned sky as bright as the sun
As the first atomic mushroom cloud rose above the horizon.

We knew the world would not be the same...
A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.
I remembered the lines from the hindu scripture, the bhagavad gita
Vishnu was trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty
And to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says,
""now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.""
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.

Nitin Sawhney,"Today at 15.45 hours
India conducted 3 underground nuclear tests
In the bogram range

Hope falls softly from your hands
Dreams burn deap beneath the land
Time casts shadows overall
Sweating fever, rain or river
Brushing winds beneath your call

Broken skin, distant fear
Shattered worlds of endless tears
Hidden fires, distant lies
Burried hopes beneath the cries
Broken skin, distant fears
Silent lips, so far, so near

Silence, it is every hope apart
Two flames burn deep beneath one heart
Teardrops flow faster with the tide
Raging over calmer waters
As the timeless land divides

Broken skin, distant fear
Shattered worlds of endless tears
Hidden fires, distant lies
Burried hopes beneath the cries
Broken skin, distant fears
Silent lips, so far, so near

Broken, distant, shattered
Hidden, distant, burried
Broken, distant, silent

Cold games repeat on eastern shores
Strong winds blow over colder wars
Proud lips stay silent in the rain
There are half a million voices in the song without a name

Broken, distant, shattered
Hidden, distant, burried
Broken, distant, silent

Shattered
Hidden, distant, burried
Broken, distant, silent

That they are encouraging for people to come down and work
And then we went to the embassy and they showed us
Kew garden pictures and pictures of the various parts of england
That it is all that beautiful and everything is just right
And that's why we just applied for the voucher.

You burn my flame within your hands
You know when my destiny falls
This time has insecurity
I feel, makes me restless inside
Will you take me there
To a distant place I've never been before
I could leave this world
I could follow you like oceans to the shore
You could take me there
Make the rivers of my mind flow to my dreams

You hold your secrets from my eyes

Will you take me there
To a distant place I've never been before
I could leave this world
I could follow you like oceans to the shore
You could take me there
Make the rivers of my mind flow to my dreams

And I dream of places far from here
And I call your name to the wind
And I wish the night would take me to another world
Where no one knows a face or has a name
Will you take me there
To a distant place I've never been before
I could leave this world
I could follow you like oceans to the shore
You could take me there

One day perhaps we will come back to this country and bring our children to show them you know
And what we had to sacrifice to be in that country you know.
But I think in the initial state that we had a lot of struggle
But with god's grace and his kindness we are okay now and our children are okay as well

Nitin Sawhney,"Woke up in the morning in a temple
Kinda lucky on my feet for it was central
So I walk across the village
Saw a group of kids pillage
And I thought to myself I might be meant to
You see

Pilgrims in the town
All seem to hold a frown
Say all they want to be is diggy down
You know Speck thought he'd ask
But figured it's just a mask

This guy's on something else that's profound
I'm not the stool or the fool or the leader here to rule
Not the lover or the fighter who came here to duel
But I thought I looked into, but I walked into

So I can understand all the rules, cool?
Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties, meet my pal compromise

And the kid you want to be you can be that
Who's ever watched the world that's my motto
Don't ever want to play the head honcho dig but huh
If you try to push I won't beat around the bush
Straight up you're getting dissed on the pronto

Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties, meet my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be, you can be that
If I could, I'd solve the problems of the world that exist
If I could always chill, I would without resist

If you weren't so literal, brother you might get it
Pack my bags, tambourines, and jeans so don't sweat it

Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties, meet my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be, you can be that
Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties meet, my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be, you can be that
Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet

As the journey continues I gain current instincts
I feel I know what they must be thinking, for instance
When they speak in riddles I'm left with the question
But won't stop arguments to kill attention
They all got a sixth sense to be one another
So pilgrims seek refuge undercover
Where it's fly like birds to live a lot is absurd
Try telling that to this kid named Unver

Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties meet my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be you can be that
Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties meet, my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be you, can be that

I met him on tour a week on for twenty four
He was born in the village, but left in ninety four
Now he's still got probs he doesn't know how to solve
I said, ""Unver, I've been there before""
In the light of understanding I forgot it
Sometimes the boat shakes when you rock it
I told him we are like family, a part of humanity
Don't overdo, and don't toss it

Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties meet, my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be, you can be that
Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties meet, my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be you, can be that

He dug and moved on with his life
'Cause he digs it gets real dark at night
Don't want a collar that's blue or a reflection of you
Just wants us to get his plight

Myself I'd like the years just to take me away
It might leave a part of this world in dismay
But the village calls the pilgriming negroes
After all I'm just one needle in the hay

Now what I'm speaking in is symbolics
But you can call it what you want to call it
See all that I do is throw words, and I hope that you caught it
Only got one arrow but I aim for two targets

Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties meet my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be you can be that

I mean you walk through the Vany Avenue, you know you go through Korean neighborhoods, 
Old Jewish neighborhoods, Arabic neighborhoods, uh, Pakistani-Indian neighborhoods. 
It's incredible. The intensity... I think yeah, development has pushed us away from other people. 
You know a lot of times people are rude because they want like immediate access or immediate information. 
You know some things in life can't be immediate, sometimes you gotta wait and let things happen... 
People are like, are increasingly rude. Like I'll say somebody will get in a cab, we'll say ""I'll get em there in 5 minutes."" 
And they'll say, ""Well, It should only take 3."" Now who gives a shit if it takes 5 minutes or 3 minutes, who cares? 
At the end of your life nobody's gonna put at your tomb stone ""shit I got in a cab in five, in seven minutes instead of three"". 
You know, It doesn't matter, and technology has made us slaves to time. 
Naw, a lot of people that are really have technical jobs, they're slaves to time. 
And time is the essence of life it seems like. And they're basically like losing it 
They're losing the essence of their life because, you know, their life is like just going away and, 
They're not enjoying it because their so engrossed in efficiency and productivity and shit like that. 
That it's almost sad. They all come here from somewhere else like seeking their fame and fortune or, 
The top jobs and they're and career-you know, in their, in their industries. 
They get very engrossed, and they into these you know these cell phones and computers and...

Nitin Sawhney,"I have lived life until now to the height of enjoyment
My physical body accompanied by a conscious mind
Endless desires swirl outside of me
HE is also taking me along his cosmic path giving me experience of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling and feeling
I feel content while sleeping, crying, laughing, eating and drinking
Day and night I think that there must be some purpose to this life
I have come to understand joy and sorrow due to lust, anger, greed, attachment and ego
I have started to think about what is the characteristic won't of life and about what is the uncharacteristic won't of life,
About what is benevolent use of mind and words and what is harmful use of mind and words
And about what is sin and what is virtue
Thus no more desire or expectation for past, present or future remains with me
My mind has gone beyond past, present and future and beyond the rational intellect of imagination
I see that I am beyond birth and death and am enjoying mind in a state of samadhi

My friend doesn't speak very good English so I've had to piece this together quite a bit. I'm sure it's more eloquent in its' original form and if anyone can help with a truer translation then please feel free!

we're only feathers in the wind falling from the sky without wings and
Though the world may fall I know, I see sunlight through the rain over me.

Nitin Sawhney,"Lately, lately I've seen you in your dream
Lost in a clouded mind
Held down by all the things that seem so real
The world you can't leave behind

You've made all of the money you could spens
You're begging for something more
Behind the prison tou call your home my friends
The light in the endless dark

Lately, you've followed your fears under the bed
And fell for a hundred years
Into the arms of a wounded melody
The promise that love's still here

You held a cynical world like God's bruised fruit
Chopped from a sacred tree
It's us, the enemy we fought all these years
The stories of you and me

So we hurry, go faster and faster to find that we've ran our whole life
Forgoing the sweetest view
There's a buzz like a lightbulb up to our ears
Promise that love's still here

Retrace the steps in the snow to find your friend
'Cause the child had melt so fast
Big dreams, the future you taste on summer's time
Having it just won't last

Right here, we've all got the answer in our heart
If we could just let that go
Lifetimes of beautiful Sunday church bell girls
The junkies upon the floor

So we hurry, go faster and faster to find that we've ran our whole life
Forgoing the sweetest view
We could argue forever and ever, be clear
Promise that love's still here

If forever and ever and ever we find that we've ran our whole life
Forgoing the sacred view
There's a buzz like a lightbuld up to our ears
Promise that love's still here
The promise that love's still here
The promise that love's still here
The promise that love's still here

O, stay and hear your true loves coming

What comes now has gone tomorrow
Present smiles are full of sorrow
But I see you in my mind
From the shadows of my memory
I can feel you walking near me
And I'm waiting for the rain to fall

Dust from your eyes, angels are falling
From distant fears, your cold hearts beating
I can see you in the dark
Or the flicker of a daydream
From the edge of silent tears
I remember and I smile

What is love? Tis not hereafter
Present mirth hath present laughter
What's to come is still unsure
In delay there lies no plenty
Then come kiss me sweet and twenty

Everyone forced together
Spilling out through the doors

Gives way to autumn's dusky bloom

Beneath the half light of forgotten sunsets
Searching for my home

I came over with my clique 
Don't try to change it now 
See you gotta bounce 
When two seconds ago 
You said you just got in the house 
It's hard to believe that you 
Are at home, by yourself 
When I just heard the voice 
Heard the voice of someone else 
Just this question why 
Do you feel you gotta lie 
Gettin' caught up in your game 
When you can not say my name 

I know you say that I am assuming things 
Something's going down that's the way it seems 
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange 
If nobody's holding you back from me 
Cause I know how you usually do 
When you say everything to me times two 
Why can't you just tell the truth 
If somebody's there then tell me who 

Say my name, say my name

È necessario, la musica vuole un mandate o un sicario 
Io so che da fuori sembra straordinario,
Ma è tutto il contrario specie se il sipario va giù!

Don't worry, dove corri?

Se paghi per il sangue poi non lamentarti quando ti sporchi

You don't know and if you don't know, now you kmow
You don't know and if you don't know, now you know

Oh my god, so che mo' fai il boss
Però non c'hai il flow, neanche con le Air Force
Scrivo all night long, mica con l'iPhone
Ne faranno ancora come noi? Ormai (ah) no!
E la mia squad è sempre pronta per il payback
Il culo su una Ford, ma la mente sopra una Maybach
Penso a te, solo paranoie e playback
Per me sei solo una troia testimone del tuo fake rap!
Restiamo in pochi, no doubt
Ma sul ring ci salirà chi suona knock you out
È tempo che finisci coi tuoi giochi da clown
Se partorisci dischi vuoti: what you talking about?
Ciò che ho dentro è più complesso di un android
Resta impresso in ogni testo attraverso una polaroid
Non mi copro d'alloro, fatti loro e dei tabloid
Ma io sputo per lavoro e non ingoio come voi!

Ed ogni scelta sbagliata la rifarei
Non avrei mai trovato nessuno meglio di lei, invece
Non mi avresti dato un euro al primo play
Ora sono sempre in giro e canto sui tuoi piagnistei, va bene?

You don't know how many sacrifices my music 
But you still keep on talking shit
You don't know quanta passione io c'ho speso per sta merda
Ma non è ancora finito il film!

Perchè me il nostro odio è l'orgoglio dell'uomo
Poi tanto al posto mio

Ho fatto un salto troppo in alto come un Hollie tra due mondi
A casa mia Clark Kent, torna a calci in culo a Smallville
Il gap che non colmi, poker di re (all in)
Il tuo arrivista fa sempre dei bei discorsi
Nell'acquario del dentista siamo tutti pesci grossi
Tre dita come a bowling e do' vita a questi fogli 
In mezzo a zombie senza sogni ma vestiti da Abercrombie
La tua indifferenza non mi interessa
Ma chi fa quello che dice, se quello che dice pensa
Gli infami già li escludo e queste tipe non le scopo
Siete tutti bravi in studio, tutte fighe in foto e viceversa
La differenza non la gradirete
Questa musica che amate, voi la fate o la vivete?
Quando vi vedo online che fate tutti i capi in rete 
Io mi chiedo sempre quando capirete, penso mai

Nitro,"Ehi, guardami, mi vedi? 
È straordinario quello che puoi fare 
Quando non devi più guardarti allo specchio, mai più

Vivere male per scrivere bene
Dire di amare per fingere insieme
Un gene che viene da un unico seme quello dell'odio 
La mano sul foglio in delirium tremens
Chi c'è di più solo dell'uomo che teme

Spicca il volo solo se il suolo cede applica il fuoco però Dio non lo vede 
Invidia lo stolto perché non se lo chiede 
Ammira lo stronzo perché tace e procede 
Rovina il suo corpo e il sogno prosegue 
Si inchina al rimorso e beve

In quanto a me mi troverai tra le spine 
Sono quello che vorresti dire ma non vuoi sentire mai 
Io non cerco un lieto fine ma se vivere è morire 
Allora è meglio benedire i guai

E andare via da qui 
Fare passi da giganti sopra gli elefanti di Dalì
Sciolgo il tempo come vinavil
E raccolgo ciò che ho perso in una vita in tilt 
Che mi porto appresso porto un rododendro 
Ma io scrivo mezzo morto sotto a un cipresso 
Lei mi beve alla goccia ma io non commento 
A cosa serve una doccia se hai lo sporco dentro

E vai giù 
Dove il buio è affascinate 
E il lato oscuro ti sembra più interessante 
Imprigionati per sempre dentro un istante
In cui il dolore lancinante è ormai distante
Mi chiedo se mi vedi 
Ma quando ho chiesto tu dov'eri 
Al buoi presto scrivo un testo volentieri 
Se mi credi
Come ieri tu cerchi chi eri ma non c'è un richiamo 
Immerso tra i sentieri dei pensieri più sinceri
Ti amo 

E dopo il vuoto fuoco dalle sentinelle 
Dalle mani di chi pensi non ti mentirebbe 
Sto in una città senza stelle
Sarà per questo che tutti si credono artisti o modelle 
Il vero ribelle è stato incatenato 
Nello scantinato tra le fiamme e il pathos
Rimpiazzato da un fighetto platinato
Che sta bene sopra a un giornaletto patinato
E grazie a dio non mi sono mai accontentato 
Meglio un uomo tormentato che addormentato 
Quando ho cercato del rispetto a buon mercato avevo il petto già accoltellato 
Fogli e intelletto scopano a letto nel mio cervelletto 
E i suoni assordanti dei loro orgasmi sono le parti integranti di ogni mio versetto 

Dimmi che non sto perdendo tempo 
Dimmi che questo dolore almeno ha un senso
Ci siamo persi tra I riflessi di noi stessi e adesso

Ci siamo persi tra amplessi complessi ed eccessi 
Compressi nei teschi ed espressi nei testi
Avessi gli stessi interessi dei fessi avresti già impressi I miei versi inespressi 
Pensi che dentro gli specchi vengano messi tutti i miei errori commessi
Ma che diresti se io ti dicessi che parlo con i miei riflessi 
Scendi quaggiù 

Dove il buio è affascinante
E il lato oscuro è sicuro e più interessante 
Imprigionati per sempre dentro un istante in cui dolore è lancinante è una costante 
Io so che non mi vedi
Ma quando ho chiesto tu dov'eri al buio
Presto scrivo un testo volentieri 
Non mi credi 
Se mi segui poi cerchi chi eri in un auto scorsoio 
Penso a mali passeggeri e non c'ho più rimedi

E ti fa strano a volte la certezza può mancare

Conta la presenza scenica
A metà tra carne e pixel, l'opera più triste della genetica

Vede se stesso in modo complesso, compresso in due gigabyte
Chiede l'amplesso ma solo online
Vede il riflesso di ciò che fai
Vede un universo finto attraverso un filtro di Afterlight

Non hai proseliti in un cosmo che si compra sopra Ebay
Siamo ancora rei ma nella storia che vorrei
Vivo in eterno in uno schermo: sono il nuovo Dorian Gray
Ed immagina un specchio nel quale puoi modificarti
Dove puoi assottigliare i tuoi tratti al fine di assomigliare agli altri
Hai una fotocamera interna ma un giorno se la ribalti
Scoprirai una vita persa e il mondo che avevi davanti
E vissero infelici ed empi

Passo e chiudo quanto sudo
Mangio idioti come noodles
Ti nutro di attenzioni che non trovi grazie a Google
Sei un tele-dipendente uno che vede e dice niente
Perché innamorato di ogni superficie riflettente
Un corpo nudo ma privo di mente come Kate Moss

Ma quando è raffinato ci mangiano solo loro
Io non ti ho mai mentito e non mi sono unito al coro

Sai che tengo tutto dentro e non mi sfogo
E pure dentro te io mi sento fuori luogo, e poi 

Tu non sai cosa vuol dire nascere pieni di vuoto
Già vedendo la tuo fine con lo sguardo nell'ignoto
Poi morire per riviver come in un videogioco
Per sentire la vertigine per quanto duri poco
E scrivere, che vuol dire svenire tra le tue braccia 
Mentre scopo con un'altra e penso ancora alla tua faccia
Ridico le ragioni per le quali mi rintraccia
Per i nostri anni migliori e i regali che mi rinfaccia
È incredibile, sai che vuol dire cambiare posto
Per convivere col mostro solo a suon di rime e inchiostro
Poi convincere sé stessi che anche oggi è tutto apposto
Sopravvivere agli eccessi per pagarne il frutto e il costo

È un altro compleanno del cazzo 
E cristo dio quanto rimpiango di non esser nato a marzo
Coi fiori che ora sbocciano e s'intonano col quarzo
Invece del freddo riflesso dentro i miei occhi di ghiaccio
E al mio fianco dormire in posti piccoli e abbracciarsi
Per convincere i tuoi sogni ed i miei incubi a mischiarsi
E baciarsi fino quasi a strozzarsi appiccicati
Nella morte nella quale siam rinati per catarsi
Ma non ho fiori da darti io ho soltanto resti e scarti
E la mia casa invasa, abrasa dai miei mille testi sparsi
Una saga di vita odiata, colmata da teschi marci
Per l'incontro di una fata che è in data da destinarsi

Pagine da un calice dalle sorsate amare
Non fanno piangere quanto le lacrime di un padre
Che mi saprà ascoltare nonostante ciò che sono
Anche se un grande cantante non sempre resta un grande uomo
Ed è importante, quando crolla la colonna portante
Esulta la folla per la colpa di una donna arrogante
Si stupisce del mio sguardo sempre spento vuoto e assente
Se capisse che anche quando scopo sento poco e niente
Cazzo! Quanto aspetto il giorno in cui ritorni 
Immerso in ogni mio complesso, compresso da buchi enormi
Non ti è chiaro il concetto allora lascia che ti informi
Odio scrivere sul letto sapendo che adesso dormi
È uno di quei giorni in cui ricamo teli neri
Levitiamo trai pensieri ed evitiamo I più sinceri
Forse ci meritiamo di sembrare più leggeri
Ma quando ti ho detto ""Ti amo"" tu dov'eri? Eh?

Con crisi di panico

Ho un trauma cranico ma mi ha detto un dottore 
Che un uomo col mio dolore, sta meglio solo se muore 
Ho bestemmiato il Signore fin quando ho visto la Madonna 
Che un amico mi ha tradito insieme alla mia donna 
Ora soffro d’insonnia e negli incubi lui ritorna 
Ma un giornalista col cazzo glielo attacco sulla porta 
Ho la mente contorta, a volte non ragiona 
Sprigiona l’odio dai pori come i tori di Pamplona 
Io cado in paranoia se non tira l’aria buona 
E lancio a terra saponette dalla cella di co 
C’è una festa all’inferno cazzo c’è e non mi inviti 
Giro ubriaco ho la puzza di Becks nei vestiti 
Non sono mica un altro dei tuoi ex pervertiti 
Che per scoparti guardano anche Sex and The City 
Quattro falliti che parlano tanto di hip hop 
Se ne stessero zitti avrebbero il doppio del flow 
Vado in fissa se mi dai dell’incapace 
Perché so che ti si drizza quando clicchi non mi piace 
Vado in manicomio, lì mi sento più al sicuro

Che mi atteggi per talenti che non ho mai chiesto 
È bene e bravo non c’è nessuno peggio di noi 
E il degrado che hai represso ma che adesso rivuoi 
La merda che hai aiutato ma al momento ti ingoi 
Perchè resti ipnotizzato dall’argento dei vassoi

E che se non rappassi forse adesso sarei vergine 
Mia madre non capisce il mio rapporto con le femmine 
Ancora definisce me un aborto a lungo termine 
Soffro, sparite come le foglie 
Soffro per le ferite ma sotto mentite spoglie 
L’orgoglio di un marito che sconfitto dalla moglie 
Ho scritto più sulle donne che il giornalismo sul delitto di Cogne 
Sembro pazzo ok, non posso dirti niente 
Ma non darmi del ragazzo colto, apposto, colto  
Mi sono rotto il cazzo e sono stronzo e diffidente 
Più non mostro differenze con il mostro di Firenze 
Lei mi richiama ma fa la brava puttana 
Sorry, mamma fai la dama ciarlatana e brama fama 
Quale m’ama o non m’ama ti plana in faccia Jin Kazama 
Lei mi infama spero le esploda la tana come Osama 
Rientro col macete tu stronzo con la catana 
Ti sventro sulla parete o ti sgozzo come all’Havana 
Son venuto dal futuro ma sopra un siluro Nasa 
Per lasciare il tuo numero uno con il culo a casa

Leggi i testi e mi detesti pensi che sia il peggio 
Che mi atteggi per talenti che non ho mai chiesto 
È bene e bravo non c’è nessuno peggio di noi 
E il degrado che hai represso ma che adesso rivuoi 
La merda che hai aiutato ma al momento ti ingoi 
Perchè resti ipnotizzato dall’argento dei vassoi

Il giorno dopo questa storia di Orthopedic 
Io giravo sempre solo in paranoia, un morto in piedi 
Quell’inganno mi è costato l’imbarazzo coi colleghi 
Ma è passato più di un anno quindi cosa cazzo chiedi 
Ho visto amici tramutarsi in vipere 
Puttane viziate passare dal domandare all’esigere 
Un infame figlio di un cane strisciare come in Splinter Cell 
Ma chi ha fame può sbranare per due briciole 
Non sono mai arrivato al dunque, anche se ho suonato ovunque 
Ho grattato troppo il fondo 
E non c’ho neanche più le unghie 
Nei dischi di altri artisti ho spaccato in due chiunque 
Pure ancora mi comporto come uno stronzo qualunque 
Ho amato troie assurde che hanno odiato le mie turbe 
Finché non mi hanno trovato impiccato con due prolunghe 
Io scrivo di costoro confinato dentro un bunker 
Ma se faccio il disco d’oro mi odieranno su Rapburger

Ecchecazzo!",Rotten,2015
Nitro,"Vorrei che mi guardassi dentro come ti vedo da fuori
Fondendo ogni mio lineamento con i miei valori
Sentendo le paure, le pressioni e i miei dolori
Perché senza sfumature a cosa servono i colori? Hey
Stai nelle tenebre e aspetti giorni migliori
Finché non saremo cenere dei nostri mozziconi
E se ho potuto crescere è solo grazie agli errori
Ho dovuto solo vendere i miei incubi peggiori

Hey, sarai un profeta ma solo dopo che muori
No fame, no money, the same old story
Voglio musica concreta non rifatti e riflettori
My face got bloody, the same old story
Sai che vince la moneta ed ogni gioco è dei tre attori
No game, no money, the same old story
Boy, is the same old story 
Boy, is the same old story

Ricordo me nella mia stanza, stessa faccia, stesso dramma
La condanna di chi inganna sé stesso e fa un'altra canna
E anche se ho sempre odiato le frasi di circostanza
Alla domanda ""Come va?"" a chi mi parla dico ""Abbastanza""
Ho assegnato all'ignoranza dei giorni di vigilanza
Cercando speranza negli occhi di chi si fidanza
Ho messo in testi insani l'infamia e la mia rivalsa
Non dicevo ""Senza mani"", ""Guarda mamma, senza l'ansia""
E so che dovrei sembrare forte 
Ma l'unica variabile costante per me è il forse
Ho dato il cuore a stronze e ho preso le loro borse
Le ho messe sotto gli occhi e con le gocce ho fatto un cocktail
E anche se fosse il mio umore ancora corre 
Tra altalenanti alti e bassi come un roller coaster 
Ho creduto più ai poster che a un prete o al Pater Noster
Ma so che siamo attratti dalla morte come mosche
E le batoste che detesto mi han messo tra i vincitori
Perché dopo il sangue in bocca ho apprezzato di più i sapori
E giocare con le emozioni e coi miei demoni interiori
Perché l'arte fa volare pur sentendosi inferiori
Ma iniettare delusioni nel cuore ai miei genitori
Ricamare sensazioni tra neuroni testimoni
Fare ciò che voglio in mezzo a imprenditori e intenditori
Siamo solo pescatori in mezzo a un mare di illusioni, hey

Sarai un profeta ma solo dopo che muori
No fame, no money, the same old story
Voglio musica concreta non rifatti e riflettori
My face got bloody, the same old story
Sai che vince la moneta ed ogni gioco è dei tre attori
No game, no money, the same old story
Boy, is the same old story 
Boy, is the same old story

I never feel better, surrender, there's no heaven
I never feel better, surrender, there's no heaven

Un segreto lo mantieni? Me lo giuri?
Noi artisti siamo un branco di infedeli ed insicuri
Alcuni dicono ""Fuck the police"" per sentirsi duri, please
È inutile come scrivere ACAB sopra i muri
Mi sfanculi e provi gusto nel dire che mi han cambiato
Perché adesso non sembro più quello brutto ed impacciato
Non ho chiamato Houston perché era sempre occupato
Io sono il talento giusto nato nel posto sbagliato
Dimmi quanto risoluto sembri
Quando ti metti a nudo come i vermi
E ti rivesti nei tuoi testi
E tu mi accuseresti, ma di cosa?
Duri un giorno, Mariposa
Se non senti la poesia dai, vai di Prozac
E allora sarà faida nel fight club
Chi inizia morirà con la stessa penna che sguaina
Stan tutti sopra il carro dei vincenti per la line-up
Ma se non scendi chi cazzo lo traina, eh?

Perché se lo fai sarai un profeta ma solo dopo che muori

Il mio sogno si è distrutto dopo un metro
Infatti ho il volto di chi ha perso tutto e vuole tutto indietro
Avessi messo nel mio credo un po' di meno del mio ego
Forse avrei il cuore in cemento e non di vetro
Se guardo indietro temo di vedere lei
Perchè mi sento meglio se scappo in tempo da ciò che sei
E se potessi sparirei
Odio metà di quella che chiami la mia città e l'altrà metà l'ammazzerei
E se potessi farei più di così
Scriverei testi per sti fessi in catalessi per il musical bis
Farei gli stessi compromessi del tuo stupido chi?
Invece annego nei complessi di una beautiful bitch
Lo diresti eh?
Non dirmi ""Sì, va beh""
Sai che c'è? Prima di sti concerti abbi il cachet
Io che mi imparavo pure I testi di De Andrè
Ora vedo anche i fighetti con le Beats by Dre

Scusa, non mi scuso
La musica è l'unica musa di cui abuso
Perchè non mi usa e non mi ha mai illuso
La tua carne nuda invece mi rifiuta come intruso
Mi delude, mi deruba, di ogni scusa pronta all'uso
Ho chiuso!
Per ciò rifiuto il tuo perdono
Piango al buio e parlo al muro deluso da ciò che sono
Paradosso, più la prendi in culo e più ti rendi uomo
Più diventi qualcuno in futuro e più ti senti solo
Qui dicono che sono un montato e pure un coglione
Quando sono sempre stato un complessato in depressione
Che odia ogni sua canzone, la prossima anche peggiore
Perchè il frutto del malessere è il malessere maggiore
Se non hai niente da perdere puoi perdere la ragione
Lì non conta più il malessere, ma l'essere il migliore, giusto?
Essere il migliore giusto, è autonconvizione giusto?

Alla gente piace innalzarti se può toccarti
Per far vedere agli altri che se vuole può tirarti su
Ma quando stai troppo in alto e non può toccarti
Ti tirano anche i sassi per il gusto di buttarti giù
Col cazzo che mi batti tu
Che dici ""Nitro non mi piaci più""
Per me sei in schiavitù, soltanto perchè vai in tv
Fanculo tu e i tuoi mille inviti sui siti
Sono i miei fogli sporchi, contro i vostri vestiti puliti

Sputo sulla reclame
Il tuo clan è più confuso ed ottuso di ogni tuo fan
Quale capo, i miei coglioni, non sei Kendrick Lamar
Se siete tutti kings, i troni son sgabelli da bar
Vorresti la star, da Festivalbar
Ma la realtà ti schiaccia in faccia e ti surclassa: Nitro è Kevin Durant
Magari muoio sulla tratta come il rally a Dakar
Ma la mia faccia è sulla mappa e non la levi da qua
Come si sta quando si appanna la magia
E il talento allo stesso tempo è la condanna e l'amnistia
Mentre nei tuoi occhi torna la malinconia
Ma stavolta brutta stronza, ricorda: una botta e via
Venissi a casa mia ""Ciao compare, com'è?""
L'unica donna che ho amato non vuole stare con me
Mi ha definito un pervertito che è impazzito col rap
E ha preferito un fallito di una cover rock band
Perchè?
Stronza, mi devi dire perchè!
Non c'entrano le rime, voglio capire perchè!
Non uccidi chi si è ucciso da se
Che vuoi decidere se hanno sempre deciso per te?
Eh, di certo che non ti comporti come me
Non hai coglioni però provi ad esporti come me
Non passi notti insonni e giorni ai ferri corti come me
Meglio far musica per soldi che per sordi come te
Sono gli stolti come te che fanno gossip su di me
Perchè si sono accorti che non sono forti come me
Non hai ricordi colmi di troppi rimorsi come me
Ma tanto in fin dei conti siete tutti morti, come me

Hi, my name is Asshole
Come chi ha preso il cazzo fino a ieri 
E ora per moda fa la lesbo 
O come i finanzieri che al momento del sequestro 
Chiamano i carabinieri già ridendo del tuo arresto 
Hi, my name is Asshole 
Come questo stato che è fondato sul regresso 
Dove il raccomandato è avvantaggiato sul depresso 
E chi è emigrato è un avvocato strapagato 
Mentre è qua che fa il commesso
Hi, my name is Asshole 
Come chi prega cristo genuflesso 
E ha ucciso il figlio per possesso 
Chi non ha mai fatto un disco 
Ma ha promesso che esce presto 
E lei che dice ""Io non mi prostituisco
Faccio l'escort""
Hi, il mio nome resta questo 
Perché porto il mio successo 
E a differenza tua io me lo sono scelto 
Tu aspetti che una major ti convinca che mi svendo

Di chi non c'ha ragione ma la vuole ad ogni costo
Stronzo! What? per te c'è un buono sconto 
Un abbraccio e un vaffanculo 
E tante grazie del supporto 
Questa è la canzone sul coglione che vuoi morto
Che spesso sei te stesso 
E non te ne sei reso conto 
Stronzo! What? sono un maestro di self-control
Mi guardo allo specchio 
E non riesco a non sputarmi addosso 
Stronzo!

Mmh, Nitro, Nitro Wilson 
Sì ho sentito molto parlare di te
Tu giovane ragazzino irriverente 
Che pensi di insegnare 
Come vivere a tutti quanti noi
Con quei capelli lunghi 
E tutti quei concetti frivoli 
Che metti nelle canzoni 
Che tanto di vanti di cantare 
In giro ai tuoi concerti 
Pff, cantare 
Non dirmi che ti reputi pure un cantante
Lo so che stai tramando 
Per sabotare tutti i miei piani 
Per dominare il mondo 
Per chi lavori? Avanti! 
Per i libanesi? Per i francesi? 
Per gli illuminati? 
Per la chiesa? Per chi?
Tu, tu e la tua crew siete la cosa peggiore 
Che può capitare alla musica 
Dopo Amici di Maria De Filippi
E tu, tu Nitro, Wilson, Phil the Pain

Non parlo mai come Silent Bob nel film Clerks
Ma se mi incazzo passo da bulldog a t-rex
Cantanti italiani froci e infami come t-bag 
Piscio sul disco dei Dear Jack, can you hear that?
Quel topo di fogna ci prova con la mia donna
Se la sogna mentre piange 
E scopa un uomo con la gonna
Vergogna, teste basse e con le chiappe sulle sedie
C'ho una donna di classe, tu anche, delle medie
Ah, fai lo zarro in lambo bianco sul pavé
Io scatarro sul parquet 
Tipo un bardo allo chalet
Più piaccio a gente sudicia 
Più aumenta il tuo cachet
Non parlo della tua musica si commenta da sé
Tu sembri Jack Sparrow ma quando chiede il parlé 
Mi senti se parli impressiono più di Manet
Ti fermi nel fango con musica cabaret 
Ma luccica anche una merda se coperta di paillette

Che risposta, modelle pelle e ossa
Alla riscossa di chi posta 
Fare gli alternativi quanto costa?
L'altra faccia che schifi della medaglia 
E poi è uguale a quella opposta
Quale sommossa sui social parli di casta 
E c'hai la vita bassa 
Non per forza la realtà intasca
E più che una lotta è una malefatta
Una frase fatta di Kafka sotto un selfie 
Con la faccia da vacca
Basta
Tutti famosi al Geordie shore 
Più rosiconi nell'hip-hop 
Che smanettoni al Comicon
Una massa di boriosi con i Fubu
Troie con la scogliosi 
Ma che fanno posi in beauty Honey Boo Boo
Non mi dire ""minchia c'è crisi""

Se non mi capisci comprati un vocabolario
Sono ricercato mica Best Buy
Come ciò che fumo è raro ma lo pago caro
Se ne faccio un'altra vado in stand-by
Capirai che è successo chiama CSI
Il mio flow è uno schianto, test drive
Ok è vero sono famoso ma in senso lato
Nel senso non è che mi passano il pezzo in radio
Ho soltanto più di qualche fan affezionato
Che mi segue perché sulla base sono il surplus
Perché quando batto sulla base tu puff eh
Le tue rime buffe
Rime con le cuffie
Mi son ricordato di dove stai
Solo a casa a piangere su FaceTime
Il mio rap è perfetto culo di Panema
Il tuo disco lo prendo perché mi fai pena
Lava bene la bocca scemo ce l'hai piena
Prima ingoia la merda e rancore colazione e cena
Ho fatto fuori i soldi in alcool e in altro
Che tanto i veri soldi li fanno i teen idol
Rimango nel mio campo
Non cambio binario
Finché mi attacco a un cappio di nylon
Vogliono fottere con M, credici
Fanno bocca a bocca con un M16

Per me non ne vale più la pena
Per me non ne vale più la pena
Quindi cosa cazzo me ne frega
Scemo io non esco mai di scena

C'ho le teste dei rapper in sala da pranzo
Fra sono un taxidermista
Zio, ho una valchiria di scorta 
La Jennifer Hudson che succhia cazzi d'artista
Devo incassare
Ho dei sogni che costano sangue sudore e sperma
E qua finisce sempre male 
Ed anche dream è l'anagramma di merda
Vivo come avessi il naso in un chilo
Il destro fa un tiro il sinistro un respiro
Zero tranquilo perché se il pilota 
Fa un figlio fra poi perde un decimo al giro
Questi rapper non sono una bomba frate
Sono bombolo Franco Lechner
Dammi una S una U una C A 
E dopo mettimi in fila ste quattro lettere
Vivo veloce, fra, e muoio per ultimo
In mezzo ai numeri primi, fra, io sono un multiplo
E doppie palle di tutti, frate
Sono un flipper col trucco del multi ball
Io c'ho un clippa banana cocca
Poi c'ho il rap nella vita, non nei podcast
In testa ho la vodka, non la fotta
Ed ho sempre una figa, sulla bocca zio
Quante volte ho sentito poeta
Ma siete solo carne finta, siete seitan
Jake un vero MC dalla A alla Z
L'unto della pietra sulla schiena
Io faccio soldi io divento ricco
Io non bevo e basta, bevo tutto e mischio
Non faccio coccole frate, io vinco
Non mi faccio male, io mi finisco zio",Glock Party,2016
Nitro,"Io ti amo solo quando bevo 
Quando mi butto giù, butto giù veleno 
Io ti amo solo quando bevo 
Da sobrio rischio di capire ciò che vedo 
Per questo ti amo quando bevo 
E certe cose è meglio se non me le chiedo (no, no) 
Io ti amo solo quando bevo 
Ognuno ha la sua forma di sollievo 
Io non ne vado fiero ma devo, ma devo

E quante volte dico no però poi cedo (dai) 
Quante menzogne mi dirò ma poi ci credo
Vorrei pensare meglio non so se mi spiego 
I’m talking to the devil, talking to the devil

Le facce stanche del pomeriggio 
Nelle panche o in un ufficio 
Scarpe bianche, umore grigio 
Dopo tutto il sangue visto 
Il mondo in fiamme per l’estremismo 
Questi fanno del moralismo, sì ogni tanto mi anestetizzo ma
Voglio solo essere libero di farmi male e sanguinare 
Voglio solo essere libero di farmi male 
Quindi facci entrare brother che c’è da brindare 
Mia madre dice “Mi raccomando” 
Ma sto barcollando tanto 
Che confondo un bar con l’altro 
Sto con chi si sposta il baricentro 
Poi si prostra al pavimento 
E dice “Ok, ok, ok, domani smetto” ma ora

Ho-ho detto mi faccio un drink 
E adesso sono già al quarto Spritz e ad un Gin Lemon 
Come dicevi prego, so che è deleterio 
Ma se parli non ricevo il mio cervello è in “Uso Aereo” 
Io sono un uomo di parola ma ogni scusa è buona 
Se vinco festeggio, se perdo chi mi consola 
Per quello che voglio fare non basta una vita sola 
Ma stanotte vaffanculo anche a Nicola 
Ti presento il mio alter-ego 
Che sa ancora essere libero d’immaginare, d’immaginare 
E sa che il male che ho dentro si potrà rimarginare 
Solo con tequila e sale 
Non sono un alcolista né tanto meno anonimo 
Se quando mi vede il barista sa che mi fa il solito 
È come quando non vuoi più soffrire a stare assieme 
A volte è meglio non capire, è meglio non sapere bere quindi

Bevo quando mi butto giù, butto giù veleno 
Io ti amo solo quando bevo 
Da sobrio rischio di capire ciò che vedo 
Per questo ti amo quando bevo 
E voglio solo essere libero
Di farmi male, e sanguinare
Ti amo solo quando bevo

Mentre stiamo deperiti
Senza soldi ne periti
Più rimorsi dei pentiti
Si alza l’ansia dei feriti
E batte cassa dei partiti
Soldi in nero come i miei vestiti
Accetti cretini, accetti lecchini

Mi ricordo ancore notti in bianco 
E il suono odioso della sveglia
Quando lavoravo in nero per meno di una miseria
Ora le notti in bianco sono throw back
La mia gente regna ovunque come gli All Black
Nessuno qua dentro gioco scherza con Jack
La tua gente può posare le sue labbra 
Dritte sopra questo ballsack

Chiedo aiuto al mio machete che apre le file
Queste bestie son mansuete, sono ignoranti
Sono nero perché vivo in un mondo di bianchi
Izi esplode, dentro smisi di volermi bene
Clicco cose, glicolisi, cherosene
Perché dopo ho fatto luce ed ho preso il distacco
Viaggio lungo gli anni luce come il Delta-IV
Tutto questo steso a terra, crisi epilettiche
Se i nodi vengono al pettine, io sono il pettine
Se odi è perché il rancore vede solo nero
Sei nodi perché il fattone vede solo l'ero
Questi mi chiedono ""ma tu chi sei?""
Senza nemmeno chiedersi loro chi sono
Non ho mai chiesto agli altri
Perché non avevo nulla da ridare indietro come dono
Io vesto nero come molti altri
Ma vedo nero e non son come loro
Io vedo nero come i bastardi
Perché la razza è soltanto un decoro

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

Nitty,"I started out with
No dough, no clothes, no shows, and no hoes
And ended up with 
Mo hoes, mo shows, mo clothes, and mo dough

I used to be the ideal nigga 
Preppy like Hilfiger
Pretty vill nigga 
But wanted to make my dollar bill bigger
Turned into a field nigga
Not pickin' cotton 
But pickin' up mics and rockin'
Recoppin' so I can feel richer
So I started drinkin' real liquor
Send me a groupie
And I will stick her real quick 
The dilsnick it will hit her ex pills
I can feel nigga best deals 
You can get the steal
If you ill I'm concealed with a
Technina millameter by my side
God used to guide me Lucifer beside me
Evil was lively trippin' with wifey
Never was treatin' her nicely
What this music got me into 
This is the message Imma send to
God the evil shit I've been through
Lettin' me really know what sin do
Listen 'cause the hurt cut me deep like a ginsu

[Chorus: x2]
This life 
Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever
Burn in the flame 
This life 
I live in the rain
I'm an angel but the devil's
Possessing my brain 

This life 
Full of money bitches weed and riches
Kansas City niggas grind it
Cook it up in the kitchen 
Pay attention to the corner nigga
Roguish and rugged 
Nigga fuck it it's a must
I conceal it and tuck it 
This life
Can make a nigga murder for nothin'
This life 
For the money have you fakin' and frontin'
This life
Can make a nigga take a deal with the devil 
This life 
Got me rippin' up shit in my kennel 
Ya see I live in the rain 
Laugh at the storm
And mastered the pawn 
Bringin' war at the crack of the dawn 
Tottin' the bomb 
A nigga with a third eye vision 
Like a malachi blowin' smoke in the sky
See the world through the eyes of a real nigga
Look into my eyes
You can tell I'm a rider 
More shows more clothes 
More hoes more dough 
And no foes yo 

[Chorus: x2]

Some times I wonder
How did I survive 
With all this drama in front of me 
Poppa went out like a bitch 
For runnin' from me 
Though momma never lied
She cried 
Seen me sittin' in prison
Servin' a sentence 
With bad intentions 
Still no repentance
I'm heart broken while chokin'
On a joint dipped in water 
And high hopin' the future's wide open
For my daughter my eyes are open
To all animosity constantly
Falling quickly the devil calls it
A blessing to cross Nitty 
Lessons are taught quickly
Hell my pride will die with me
Then to repeat back 
To the penitentiary visit me 
Hell bound coffin dwellin'
Before a life in the cell yelllin'
Now free me 
I'm in desperate need immediately
Truthfully speakin'
My life from night to day
24 hours I fight 
Despite this hell to pay
Can't wait to see the day 
When my adventures begin
With this here life of sin 
I'm all in 

[Chorus: x2]

Is it heaven or hell
I really can't tell
It half cupid half relic
My life is anghellic
So I dance with the devils
And I fly with the angel 
And I stand on a level
Where mind is so tangled",This Life,2000

Nitty Gritty,"""Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me....
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see.


T'was Grace that taught...
My heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear...
The hour I first believed.


Through many dangers, toils and snares...
We have already come.
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far...
And Grace will lead us home.


The Lord has promised good to me...
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be...
As long as life endures.


When we've been here a thousand years...
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise...
Then when we've first begun.

Was blind, but now, I see.

He's a family man, his wife laments
Never broken any of the Ten Commandments

Or rubbing out, rubbing out, rubbing them out

He'll stuff it in his stash, leaving by the back door

But just think of the cash
And the friends you can smash

If they're crossing your path
You'll get the last laugh
As you're driving away
Yes, it's been a good day
To die as you try to get by

Buy to get high and he'll lend so that you spend
Your life will depend on your money made friend

Best keep out of his sight

Even when you're dropping your goo
And you think, ""Well, if the judge only knew""
But then, do you really think that he hasn't been there too?

And a dolly bird sitting on his lap
Her fingertips trips across him like on a road map
Leading down to his old chap

Round up all the little locs, high as the sky
Smash and mash your body, just another day
Real high until your pistols reach the sky
Quarter pound of bomb, quarter pound of bud

So fuck where you from
Semi-automatic shotgun blast a herb, when I trip then unload the clip
Not giving a fuck is the motto
Bitches gobble and swallow, we bust hallows(nigga)
And I'm first to launch off the hallow heads nigga
Hit the liquor store for sure
Right after I unload the forty-four (four, four)

I've seen evil reign over perfection
Blood heat over tension
And I know oh oh oh

You say you love the way the storms blow
But when it comes you close your window
You hate the fighting in the world
So you bring the battle home and fight until it's yours
Fight until I'm gone
And there's holes on the walls
Written in the sand
Deception on my lips and there's blood on your hands
And I'm tired of keepin' lies (tired of keepin' lies)

Call it up, then fire come dance with passion
Call it up, then we come bleed

And if we make it then we'll be just fine
Maybe you'll be yours and I'll be mine

There's always mischief
Oh, you know the devil's always prying
Now being good to you is all that's on my mind
Down

Yes, your mind gets like a villain, make you splinter
Sing your heart off walking through some long Russian winter
Crying at the sad stories in the paper and on the news
Then I gather up the scattered blessings to bring them back to you

And if we make it then we'll be just fine
Be the first I've known in a long, long time
Told my sad story to anyone who'd listen
Now I'm in your heart, talking like Ian Dury, I'll be blissin'

Praise be the hands that brought this to work now
Turn it on, switch me on
You took my hand, yes, that came first
Turn it on, switch it on

I'm full of song, unrehearsed
Go on and turn it up, turn it on, turn it over

Praise be the hands that brought this to work now
Turn it on, switch it on

Just to reach you I've been
Building bridges too large

And fills up my cup

Trying just to seek out your name, darling

",Fine Story,2004
Nizlopi,"Call me up and that's all I need
Bring your loving, smiling face over
I feel like, getting it right
Overnight, start over

I thought playing that loving game
Would never be simple again
But you're staying overnight
So maybe I'm doing something right

You can feel it in the trees
I feel it by degrees
Feel it fresh and new
I'm getting myself in love with you

The sun will rise up and you'll be in freedom
So much freer than you were before
It's in the seed now, it's in the season
I'm so excited it's knocking down your door

And they say, it's such a funny story
After a winter of getting dull and blue like a Tory
In getting all feared up, as the bond that ties
Cries, lies, incites the tears to your eyes

And the job will know I'm insane
To go running from love again
Into a lover's arms
Like a burglar running out on an alarm

It's a fucking swarm of bees
Or some waitress, it's a tease
Or some song was full of light
Coming 'round to you late at night

The sun will rise up, and you'll be in freedom
So much freer than you were before
It's in the seed now, it's in the season
I'm so excited it's knocking down your door

The sun will rise up and I will wise up
So much freer than we were before

It's in your CD, it's fucking teaming
Saw it around you taking you on a tour
And now, now, call the fuzz, it's such a buzz

From the start
You press the memory
You press the memory to your heart

What you waiting for?
A fallen love is an idea for sure
What you waiting for?
Like there was any law
She's like a sonnet, she's so on it

From the start
You press the memory
You press the memory to your heart

What you waiting for?
Fallen love's an idea for sure
What you waiting for?
Like there was any law

The sun will rise up, you'll be in freedom
So much freer than you were before
It's in the seed now, it's in the season
So excited it's knocking down your door

You'll bring that blessing
We'll sing the rest in
Freedom, to prisoner, to freedom

They go being and never disappear
If you rub yourself along now
You'll get down to their kind of emotion

Straight to your heart
Sweet doll

Gotta love and forgive
Or you can't breathe
Gotta search and be with
Or you can't breathe

I got something to give
Before I leave
I can never run back

I'm smothered in, memories of you are too
What is given back, we can't unglue
All this sticks to me, some days sweet like honey
Some days tart like Marmite

But he's been good fun and bubbling and joking away

Singing Amen, singing Bethlehem
Singing a song in the rain

Singing together again

Sing around it, now you've found it
Overcrowded, back to your love again
People doubt it, still they rouse it
Kissing their baby and getting insane

And far off in this howling English channel
I hear you in the cold shantying away
For his lover, she's an orange fire
And he praises her like it was Sunday

Sing around it, time to hound it

Instantly walking the line
Instantly giving the sign
Instantly putting to rhyme
Instantly reform the crime

Instantly brought back to life
Loving your trouble and strife
Instantly loving again
Instantly together again

Baby you pull me, now I'm shattered into pieces
And every piece glows for love
And I offer up everything, dream songs, a spatula
Only this can save me, only this can be me

Mental flip, got a thousand tracks thought on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
You split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer, with extra compression
When sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalizes the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryin to think you can match this
The portrait's too graphic
Panaramic view for you, stamp Wu 
The feature gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We wrote block-tic checkpoints on your next joint
And who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed, for killin cascades
Throwin bullets in the air to test wind
And which way the cyclone spins
Counter on clockwise, still civilized
Kill spies on the wall, that still flies all dies

Give no extension on the lynchin
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt, that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show, see the promoted for the dough
I'm takin, breakin his wax
Throw my shit on to perform my selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in revines and ditches
Underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reeds
The enemy walks above, Clan remain subterranean mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shatterin bulletproof helmets with scrap nail fragments
Of cell, inhale these venomous thoughs that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer at the hand
Of the Chief's command, volts is in
At 3 minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadenin the power from electrical fences
Defences are down, shake a nigga up, bounce him off the sound

Sleepin on silk pillows, blood on they robes
Disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes

Like magic wands, castin spells, sendin niggaz to Hell
Trappin they souls in realms, baptize em with holy water
Springin on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters
Silent nights over the dividers, a 1000 muslim bibles
For the cobler, hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'ma show you how thugs get down
Shoot outs, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files, describe them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dyin saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Dissolve it with your 100 proof liqour

Raw from Africa and golden ropes and sandles
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who man-handled us with leather whips and burnin candles
And rambled through our castle, leavin niggaz shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
With to the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow

You listening to a young father who don't got it all figured out
My feeling was killing my spirit it's time for me to get out this house
And go make something of myself maybe one day I'll make ya'll proud
But I mean for now I'm in these streets running around with my dick in my hand
Couldn't even stick to the plan cause I'm gettin distracted again
Now I got a baby on the way even though that wasn't in the plan
But I need some unconditional love to help me become a better man

Anyways I'm focused
Smokin like fuck yo catchy hook and a slogan
It ain't no middle ground
To Vegas if I ain't a legend then I'm the closest
And I just wanna be real with yall
Maybe share my creative ideas with yall and build with yall
But yall just gon downplay the boy like you don't hear it
Can't be cautious creative thinkers must be fearless
That's some good advice but when you presented yo big idea how they gon feel it
I say we go make my million dollars look like 10 million

But I just wanna sleep in a cali king and have safe sex on it
Travel the world doin what I love so I can get a paycheck for it
Put my city on and I got respect for it when [?] then I'm less for it
When you need someone to believe in I'm the best for it
Better check for it, attack everyday like its my last
Thinking for so long write it in short for your simple minded Ass
Lighting the joint like fuck all my problems waiting for time to pass
We got it now but will it last

Will it last
We got it now
We can't go back
Will it last
We got it now
Can't go back
Can't go back

Constantly reminding myself that we all look at things differently
Built this so yall can feel this as I spread this positive energy
Realistically what's important
Cuz half of the time half of these niggas don't even know what they're supporting
If you want the life then I'm warning ya
These fans could say that they love you and turn into babies without they're formula
Crying to get attention homie yo expectations hella low
What happened to being yourself yall see me and act like yall met a ghost
How you gon handle the lifestyle knowing damn well you ain't got no self control

One of my Brodie bros conversing with my trying to put me on game
Still I remain with the world on my shoulders but yall not feelin my pain
These rappers work a lifetime for a hit and still be livin the same
So I'm doing everything in my power to make this last
I made mistakes in the past but today I hope my branches grow
The more money I receive the more the more my people gon learn what I'm standing for
Focus on how my brand should grow they demanding more
Haters hate but they standards low
I'm just trying to balance out what I'm rappin about

Too much at a time the next you know they tappin out
I was spazzing out, homie said put down them blacks and smoke this half an ounce
And before you bounce make sure they fuck with your meaning
You too understandable these rappers can't fuck with your English
Started thinking maybe I should spaz less switched up my address
Coming in peace I'm here to inform educate and provide some access
Will it last until my last breath, maybe past death
If you hear my voice just know that I'm never gon half step, but ask yourself

Lost more than a mil on a gambling bet
So here's the Chuck wagon for the dog in you,
Here's the kennel ration and the Alpo too

Blow the horn like little Jack Horner

The fast cars they call 'em kittens
They've been known to amaze
But they can't pull one over me

Fall for the trimmed trap.

But you made me sweat when you played hard to get
One kiss from your lips though and I forget

There's so many gone

She's ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Oh, she's heartburn

Yeah it's kinda strange
I've been here before
Know it's bad but I still come back for more
Guess I'm a fool
'Cause I'm stuck on you
And I don't care 'cause I just want what you got
Oh, oh

She hit me with, it with it
And she lets me get it get it
How could something good like this
Make me feel so sick?
Tell me why oh why
She had to set my heart
Oh she's heartburn
And every time I see her
She makes my heart burn
I'm all messed up for real
I'm telling you she's hot
The way she moves her body
I'm telling you she's
The way she shakes her body
She's ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Oh she's heartburn

Oh she's a heartburn
And every time I see her (and every time)
She makes my heart burn (she breaks my heart)
I'm all messed up for real
I'm telling you she's hot
The way she moves her body
The way she shakes her body
(She's hot, she's hot, she's hot)
She's ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Oh she's heartburn

She's burning' my heart
And I can't take no more for real",Heartburn,2007

But I'm always a believer
It's my time to shine
Here we go!

[Chorus]
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
C'mon, let's roll
Everybody, yea, here we go (here we go)
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
Right here and now
Everybody, it's going down

I've been waiting for this moment
It's time to throw down
I've been dreaming this dream forever
Now I know the time is now (It's on)
Better make some room for me (It's on)
Now I know it's time to be
Better than I ever was
I don't do it for the money
I do it for the love

[Chorus]

I've got the answer
It's beating in my heart
I'm gonna make it happen
There's no way
I won't tear this apart
I'm gonna show 'em what I got 
I'm gonna give it everything
This is no joke I wrote
This is my destiny

One shot
One shot, you got
And if you don't take it then 
You're always not, no!

So let's go
(It's on)
Here we go

One chance
One chance to rise
You go get yours
And I'll go get mine
It's on, it's on

[Chorus]

Show 'em what you're worth
It's been on since your date of birth
Why you here
Why you on this earth
If you can't live your dream 
Man, it's gotta hurt

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

It's going down
It's going down
It's going down
Trust me from the depths of my soul (it's going dow)

NLT,"Don't know where to start 'cause something ain't going right
Feel it in my soul 'cause I've tried, oh baby
Tried to keep you satisfied, please don't cry
I just think we both need time

I just feel that we are in the same room
But live in two worlds apart
And it's causing too much pain

She said, ""Baby can you please just stay?
It ain't too late to work this thing out""
I said, ""Girl, this ain't easy for me
At least the truth is coming out""

She said, ""Why can't we make up like the last time?
I'm just afraid to hear you say ?go??
I said, ""Baby I'm sorry
I think it's time we let go""

""Baby don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
Tell me you'll stay and you'll stay and you'll stay""
""I gotta leave, gotta leave, gotta leave
'Cause I think it's time we let go""

See those teardrops falling from your eyes
That don't change my mind, oh baby
Please don't make things more difficult than they gotta be
I can't take no more, this is killing me

And every time I look at you
I see more reason for me to leave you
And it's causing me too much pain, yeah

She said, ""Baby can you please just stay?
It ain't too late to work this thing out?
I said, ""Girl, this ain't easy for me

Tell me you'll stay and you'll stay and you'll stay""

""Baby don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
Tell me you'll stay and you'll stay and you'll stay""

It?s time that we let go!

It's a shame
You see that I'm hurtin'
And you don't know what you did
You probably don't even care to know what it is
You promised that you'd be down
That you were my best friend
Was it all for nothin'

How could you go
Right when I needed you
You never showed
The love that I'm always showin' to you
Now you know that I'm gonna leave you
You're tellin' me no
'Cause it's gonna hurt you
Feelin' so cold

I wanted to know you
But karma's a trip now
You probably shouldn't have let me standin' alone
I wanted to love you
But karma's a trip now
You probably should turn around
And take yourself home

Karma, karma
It's just karma, karma
It's just karma, karma
It's just karma's a trip

You're the flame
I keep runnin' back to you (back to you)
Feel the pain
I keep runnin' to you
Thinkin' something's gonna change
But now that the story is over
I'm turnin' the page
Baby your history

How could you go

You never showed

Me and you
Me and you (and you)
The tables have turned around
And now
I'm lettin' you go
