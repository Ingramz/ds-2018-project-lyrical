Primal Fear,"Hiding the truth, everlasting youth
Runnin' the thin line till dawn
The impossible waits, the kiss of death
Silence, the secret will hurt
No more time to fulfill
Enter darkness and thrills

I need more time to understand
Till we're reaching the end

Nine lives, you'll never forget
A shadow in white, we hold the night
Will you forgive me

These cat eyes can cure, I know that for sure
The king of the jungle bewares
As I hit the trace, a love's changing face
I'm searching for you everywhere
I will take care, naturally
One more chance, faithfully

I need more time to understand
Till we're reaching the end

Nine lives, you'll never forget
A shadow in white, we hold the night
Will you forgive me

Nine lives, you'll never forget
A shadow in white, we hold the night
Will you forgive me

Nine lives, you'll never forget
A shadow in white, we hold the night
Will you forgive me",Nine Lives,1998
Primal Fear,"In time of greed and jealousy
When clouds fulfill the sky
The rain will fall
It's hiding the tears from my eyes

A trip right into fantasy
The colors of my soul
Will take me there
Where confident spirits will flow

Where I can find peace of mind

Take me back where I belong
Give me back my pride
Building castles in the sand
In a place called the promised land

A place of pride and dignity
Where you can find no hate
So stay with me
And join me before it's too late

Come with me in the fantasy
I'll be your guiding light
Just trust your fate
And everything will be alright

Where I can find peace of mind

Take me back where I belong
Give me back my pride
Building castles in the sand
In a place called the promised land

Take me back where I belong
Give me back my pride
Building castles in the sand
In a place called the promised

Take me back where I belong
Give me back my pride
Building castles in the sand
In a place called the promised
Place called the promised
Place called the promised land",Promised Land,1998
Primal Fear,"I'm on my way in a foreign land
The crime rate's up to 25 percent
Dissident people everywhere
And I can't find no comfort here

All alone, no one's there to help me
No control, there's no one I can trust

Cause they were running in the dust, running
Cause they were running in the dust, running

I'm walking through the streets with a stranger's look
Their eyes staring at me as the darkness cooks
They ask me for a dollar a gun behind their back
Their faces switch from friendly to attack

All alone, no one's there to help me
No control, there's no one I can trust

Cause they were running in the dust, running
Cause they were running in the dust, running

I miss my country, my friends, my family
I will struggle to go home
I'm settled for peace now step out of insanity
But my dream has ended in a blast

Standing here alone in this bloodstained land
As I realized danger's close at hand
A gunshot kills the sound of silence
An angel's life has ended up by violence

Cause they were running in the dust, running
Cause they were running in the dust, running
Cause they were running in the dust
Running in the dust

Dust",Running in the Dust,1998
Primal Fear,"Ticking like a time bomb, I knew the time was right
Dead place of destruction and no paradise in sight
Burning down the seven wonders, trapped in anarchy
And there is no turning back at what we left

Where do we go, destination unknown
Where can we stay, the world's shakin' away

For silver and gold, we're searching for souls
We are the light and we're kissing the day
Silver and gold, your future is sold
The dead zone in flames in the eye of the storm

Like a nuclear reactor your nightmare's getting real
Tanled in a web of darkness time is standing still
Comin' as invaders, sailed the seven seas
Burned and marked forever now, but where

Where do we go, destination unknown
Where can we stay, the world's shakin' away

For silver and gold, we're searching for souls
We are the light and we're kissing the day
Silver and gold, your future is sold
The dead zone in flames in the eye of the storm

For silver and gold, we're searching for souls
We are the light and we're kissing the day
Silver and gold, your future is sold
The dead zone in flames in the eye of the storm

We are the light and we're kissing the day

The dead zone in flames in the eye of the storm

Primal Fear,"Out here alone, I will wear a thousand faces
I'm still waiting, the master of disguise
Can't you hear me calling in my deepest desperation

I talked to the angles, cause I'd broken every rule
And if you hurt me, there's a way back to you
I found a reason out in this mystery

A touch of heaven
I opened up my soul
Don't leave me waiting
Until my heart is gone

It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again
Tears of rage

Into the real world we said our last goodbye
Betrayed ourselves only for our selfish pride
I'm disillusioned, threw my heart into the flame

A touch of heaven
I opened up my soul
Don't leave me waiting
Until my heart is gone

It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again
Tears of rage

Five in the morning, I'd lied to myself
Time to surrender as I see your face
I just want to hold you
I could make you mine again

A touch of heaven
I opened up my soul
Don't leave me waiting
Until my heart is gone

It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again

It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again
Tears of rage
Tears of rage",Tears of Rage,1998
Primal Fear,"I've seen their faces, at different places
They mingle with the crowds or hide away

Two slimy creatures, suspicious features
In camouflage they're waiting to attack
They start their mission in sound and vision
And drag their victims to the hill of fear

Don't tell me I'm insane
I've seen this human slaughter
And there will come the day
We'll have to leave our vale

Hear our cry
Is there someone who can help us
Why tell me why
Do they bring us to a place called
Thunderdome, Thunderdome 

In disaffection we watch the action
We take for granted what we're living for
But unexpected and not accepted
Their power is increasing more and more

Don't tell me I'm insane
I've seen this human slaughter
And there will come the day
We'll have to leave our vale

Hear our cry
Is there someone who can help us
Why tell me why
Do they bring us to a place called

Thunderdome, Thunderdome 
Thunderdome, Thunderdome 

I smell the rotten bodies
No one's left, everything's so muddy
Give me hope to survive my future
Is this place diseased by creatures

Hear our cry

Why tell me why
Do they bring us to a place called",Thunderdome,1998

Tryin' to get you down

If you were adead man
He'd take ya from your grave
He will not mourn for you or me
Happines he cannot feel
And love to him is so unreal

Primal Fear,"From the valley of the darkness
The Elder says nobody has returned
It's always been a challenge for me
To find adventure, to face the fear

I made my mind up to go
I'll give my life just to know

Save a prayer
Beyond imagination
So many signs just tell me to stop
I feel a certain energy
That leads me to the jungle of the dark

Oh my visions getting clear
What is behind eternal fears

Save a prayer

Forgotten land, I'm reaching the end, it's fading to
Black, save me
I made my own great escape
And if you miss me it's too late

Save a prayer
Forgotten land, I'm reaching the end, it's fading to
Black, save me",Save a Prayer [#],1999
Primal Fear,"Steel and fire
Spreading the holy word
Dirty liars
The truth has never been heard
Are you the own who think free
Or do you share this mad insanity
To use a religion, increasing the terror
Is much more that just a human error

What are they fighting for
They call it holy war
So many innocent have died

No democracy in the church of blood
There's no democracy
Welcome to the church of blood

Pray salvation
The promised paradise
Violent nations
Who kill and terrorize
Sowing the seeds of discord
Ready to kill in the name
Of our lord
Suicide victims setting their signs
Burning the books and the tales

There's no democracy
Welcome to the church of blood

Coming over you
Don't act like a stranger
Don't live like a fool
Corruption - destruction
It's always the same
Illusion - confusion
The world lives in pain

Hideous & hateful, it cuts like a knife

In the heart of darkness
Fight to survive - sedition will rise

From the field of the fight
They collected parts of death
A dimension unknown
I heard screams 'till the dawn
What's the sense behind this mess

I'm feeling so lonely
I'm desperate in the cold
I'm feeling defenseless
Wait for the call, ready to fall
What is this my final moment
Is it real or fantasy
Can't ignore my soul is burning
Wait for the final embrace

In the name of our god
Killed emotions, every pride
I will fight my own fight
I will break through their lines
Take the last chance to survive

I'm waiting 'till midnight

For me there's no limit to see
Harder and harder I push to succeed

Too many years I have wasted
To live in the past
I've started to move and I'm doing fast
I'm riding into the future
I'm out of hiding again ready to fly

Breaking through boundaries
Destroy what confines

Her gypsy heart just beats in pain

I'm standing here, she's standing there
Uh I can't get her out a my mind
I call her name, she's acting strange
This could be the last time

When the night comes
It's so unreal
When the night comes
It's just dream

We fight against our deep desires
Her energy can set a heart on fire
What comes around just comes around
She looked into the palm of my hand

She would no tell, this hidden spell
But I can't get her out a my mind

I know, it was the last time

Primal Fear,"He himself said, that hell 
Was originally prepared for the devil and his angels.
In hell, you will be ruled over 
And will be inferior by darkness and the forces of evil. 
Your new home will be made up of demons, 
Fallen angels, wickedness and even the lord of
Darkness himself
You will be at the bottom of the guest list.

The sphere of hell is a hollowed-out place in the earth's core.
Scientists proved that the earth's
Outer crust is less than twenty miles thick 
And that beyond that point, there are rivers and
Lakes of flaming blood of the earth, called the ""lake of fire"". Long
Before the final judgment, of the thousand suns 
You will find the gates to hell in burning ruins of
The new city.

When the sinner closes his eyes for the second death 
And darkness takes his soul, you will see
And feel movements in the air. 
The saviors are open you 
And there will be no triumph without loss, no freedom
For your soul without sacrifice. 
There's only specific kind of creature, who ever
Came back from the eternal.

This very moment, your eternal soul may be less 
Than twenty miles from the burning fires of hell!

Swift on the steel and prepare to rip mics
It's the Prime Minister, the Minister Pete Nice
I'm soul flexin', never had the specs in

Ain't going out like a 40-deuce peeper
Thumbs get picked if you say you're plumb pickin'

Never got sidetracked, the others got punched black
Many fell victim, and fell into the booty shack
Make 'em disapper like the Brooklyn Dodger
Swinging on my thing, I swing 'em just like Roger

You said he couldn't, but he said ""I got wood""
I think I can, I think I can, no I could
Yell timber, cause your wood is slimmer
Yet another victim serviced by the Goldfinger
Cuts stimulate, chop on the flavor hit the Ave.
On the wax and vibrate like a ninja
Mr. Daddy Rich to you, used to call him 
Run and you're stumbling over stumps, so watch him fall

I got a suicide squeeze on the trigger
Hit you like a swig of 100 proof hard liquor
The Minister gotta fade ya like a record, I'ma play ya
Like suede Pumas, clides, fat laces on a mayor
Deliver like a mailman, slide into your crib-o
Rather have a limo than your bullshit demo
Things are risin' up like a 40 inch vertical
Heard you pull wreck, but I run you in a circle
Flowin' out my voice like a dummy and ventriloquist
Hookin' up lingo, study like a linguist
Stickin' rhymes, yeah, I'm movin' like a drifter
Your rhymes are worn like an old man's slippers
Used to have a seizure still edgin' up my gold teeth
Headin' down you to go with Rich and get some protein
I'm giving bones so you're chokin'
I get biz every time I blow smoke and

{Biz Markie}
(Can you feel it)
Blowin' smoke, bee

{L.L. Cool J}
(Woof, now you're cut loose)

Rip off the hand, open up your ears, listen
Got a fat joint, just peep it while you're sippin'
Bringin' on beats, keep you movin' till your neck snaps
Got the greenbacks like skins with the big racks
On a hit streak like Joe, Joe Di Maggio
Take you to the limit every time that I gas a hoe
Say what you want to, say the minister's oblivious
Dropped dead weight, yo, now it's time to get with this
Rip the micro, torch ya like a pyro
Toss ya in the trash like a horse meat gyro
I won't front, let you know that I'm packin'
Check up on the wall the gold records that we stackin'
You're kinda young like a tight suede jacket
Ain't a crooked thief but I mess with the racket
Breakin' down on a break Daddy Rich broke
The wax spins round, I blow smoke

Chorus
Blow smoke up your ass like a manager
Hotel bar butter smooth while I'm havin' ya
Soundin' kinda crisp like a portable DAT, y'all
Heads swell settin' up for the big fall
Hittin up heads like a barber with the clipper
Hip-house hip, yo, but I got somethin' hipper
Swingin' like McGillah, fill a pocket full of currency
To be or not to be, that is Shakespeare tragedy
Handle like ??? shootin' like a pistol
Pack it like a heavey by the name of Travis Bickle
Blowin' like the Bad Wolf, send you to the cheap seats
DJ Daddy Rich, he got the mad beats
Keep it in the gutter, so you can't be mad at me
Listenin' to 45s of Cannonball Adderley
Ain't the dancin' fool, I don't jest, I don't joke
I just grip on a steel and blow smoke

Picasso the easel crusty crusty weasel
I shiggedy-shot, I shiggedy-shot the needle for the measels

Pump the loot illzno, till you bust a big nut
Flex if you want to, want to flex
If you think you got the wrecks, yo
We be bustin necks, so
Daddy, Daddy Rich, Pete, Pete Nice the master
Father knows best, he knows best, you little bastard
Will he, will he plug ya and play ya like a fiddle
Or meddle just a little like the monkey in the middle?
It's time to fill the donut, but yo, I won't seduce ya
Word, I whip your ass from the Bronx to Tuscalusa
The big, big, big beat catcher need a big rat
Riggedy-rat bastard, can I get a soul clap?
A-clap, clap on, yo, a-clap, clap off one
Step to the rear if your material's the soft one
Yo, you got the drama class
Yo, you hit the drama fast
I vic your stash, your flag is wavin half-mast
Pete Nice, Daddy Rich, the agony defeat
(Slammed the child on the hard concrete)

(To the ladies screamin aw
The brothers yellin ho)   (Repeat 8x)

The riggy-riggin slippin, not Scottie Pippen
The drippin jheri curls like Steve Miller slippin
To the future, a moocher named Minnie vicked my ducats
Schmock as a schmock, I got your girl in a bucket
The primo, the celo, the 125th street
Beating up the herbs with the Nikes on my two feet
My head's up, I'm feds up, I'm fillin you with the diesel
If it ain't the legal, the scenario's illegal
So hey, Mr. Kincaid, when are we gonna get paid?
Punch you in the ass, sip the forties in the shade
You see, I'm real like the butts that ain't the silly-silicony
Homie don't play with the booty if it's bony
I push the rhymes like the fiendish Dick Dastardly
What's my fee? 10 g's cash, please
Hit the pawn shop with the rings, and you're hikin it
A tree grew in Brooklyn, and Dad Richie chopped it
If you got beef, get the grill and the charcoal
Hold it, now hit it now, cause yo, I know you got no (soul)

(To the ladies screamin aw
The brothers yellin ho)   (Repeat 8x)

Puffin, swigin, friggin-friggin A-1
Top of the heap, king of the hill, steppin it up to get some
Now what I know because I freak, I freak the flow
Hit you with the potent if you want to, want to throw
I'm Peety Weety Wheatstraw, the X watching Hee-Haw
I see-saw the open sesame is on a trap door
Peter Piper, picture pocket full of presidents
New York, New York, a hell of a town, yo, I'm a resident
If you want to get me, I'm afraid you better shoot me
I'll do ya my way - bababui
Minister the Prime one, a butter like the parkay
Hey, hey, the Constipated Monkeys on a parlay
Switchin up the picture like the Doctor Gooden packin heat
Sweet Daddy Cream it ain't the _Krush Groove_ or _Beat Street_
Rock, rock the body rock, the truer to the hip-hop
Drop, drop a jewel, and never singin for the pop

Wisdom fatter than Buddha, ain't a heroin
Shooter or a storefront looter
Truer than a polygraph, walk with the big staff
But yo I got tricks up my sleeve you never thought I had
Do you like Muhammed Ali doing Liston
Take you to the cleaners like the pants that you pissed in
It's in poor taste why you're so busted
I got loot like a frank got mustard
Yeah, you run games but you ain't got equipment
All you got is kneepads for the sipping
I'm flipping you like Marv Albert on a slow-mo
The Prime Minister kicks the Willie Bobo

Kick the bo bo bo, I kick the bobo
I kick the bobo, I'm thinking of kicking the bobo (Repeat 4x)

Swift on the steel and prepare to rip mics
It's the Prime Minister, the Minister Pete Nice
I'm soul flexin', never had the specs in
20/20 vision, bust rhymes like erections
Wrecks in sleeper, never had a beeper
Ain't going out like a 40-deuce peeper
Thumbs get picked if you say you're plumb pickin'
No prejudice, black, white, or Puerto Rican
Moist moist plumbs, kinda swollen yup swollen
Kick the bobo then it's plumb's that you're holding
Domes get filled, 3 minus 1 equals 2
Daddy Rich knows what's true (Indeed)
What's that I hear? Are you broke, I'll make you broker
Lifespan dwindles like a candlestick smoker
Get a little taste of the Minister of Mojo
Quick on the solo, kicking all the bobo

Kick the bo bo bo, I kick the bobo
I kick the bobo, I'm thinking of kicking the bobo (Repeat 4x)

Back to the point, I bring you back to the point and
Hard to keep it true when the others are exploiting
Never got sidetracked, the others got punched black
Many fell victim, and fell into the booty shack
Make 'em disapper like the Brooklyn Dodger
Swinging on my thing, I swing 'em just like Roger
Don't sweat Madonna, Madonna got a bony ass
If you gotta pass gas, better leave the room fast
Bobo kicked like the bo that you be licking
What came first, yo, the pigeon or the chicken?
Do with the suspense, y'all, but I ain't hip
Cock going on tour a couple times around the block
Daddy Rich and Pete Nice never steer you wrong, be	
Fatter than the fat kid in PM Dawn
Long time coming like skins to Quasimodo
So let's all kick the Willie Bobo

Kick the bo bo bo, I kick the bobo
I kick the bobo, I'm thinking of kicking the bobo (Repeat 4x)

Erasing all the lies that I thought were true
The pain I have inside was just for me
The day I tried to live I could not breathe

And I feel that I'm about to lose this game again
Could this be the end?

I want to be inside this mystery
Deleted by the files of sympathy
The dream I have inside can't be for real
The dream I have inside is so surreal

And I feel like I'm about to lose this game again
To the enemy in me, my evil friend
And I feel that I'm about to lose this game again
So could this be the end?

Respect the tank, nigga stick my chest out
And this how we do it in the dirty south

And so y'all don't worry 'bout the corners, we smokin' till the morning
Y'all just keep the bitches, now we on the way
Hold on man, I think Snoop got somethin' to say

Think fast when you dunk, 'cause I won't front
And when it's time to dunk I won't be no punk
I'll just pick the heater up and bust a shot
I'm the last nigga up to rock the spot

I'm represent a nigga to the fullest cause
And if y'all wanna trip, we tear this club up

What you doin nigga?

Man I ain't doin nothin  just chillin. 

Layin back in this bitch. 

In this cold heartless ass world. 

[Mr. Serv On] 

Nigga pass the weed to a nigga baby. 



Chorus 

This world got me heartless 

That's why I hit the weed 

leave my middle finger up, I give a fuck (2X) 



Dear God tell me, how many times 

During the course of a day for ????? 

my life I gotta say a prayer for myself 

Or tell me, how many nights 

My mama gotta lay awake cryin 

starin at my picture on the shelf 

But if you ask me 

Some of you niggas instead of hating 

You need to be anticipating 

and find the bullet that's waitin for ya 

Do I feel for ya, I'm heartless 

I feel for people like my girl Cheryl 

who lost her brother Travis to these streets 

Can you imagine, having to identify 

your little brother that's laying beneath some sheets 

I don't think so 

Or what about this hoe 

That tried to tell me about a nigga 

that I came up with since diapers 

Serv watch yourself he don't like ya 

Or what about these niggas on my block 

that know I made it out 

All this dope you niggas done sold in the hood 

you still ain't bought 

your mama a house 

But believe me niggas I love you till my dying day 

But if you try to take me from my family 

I'm a bang you in a fuckin heartless way 



Chorus (4X) 



[New 9] 

I just got out last night so it's like a cycle 

Even though I know shit always don't go they way you want it to go 

I proceed to be a nigga I need, it's only real 

It's money making plans to demand at center field 

And shit's real and right now everything is tight 

I got to pack a gun but if I get caught it's my third strike 

I'm strapped up, my tennis too tight, that's how I'm living 

A nigga on a mission, anything in my way, I'm killing 

That's my mentality right, me and my niggas be quick to fight 

Type of niggas you don't want to cross if you kinda value your life 

Whether wrong or right, I got a pocket full of rocks and I'm on a block 

Smokin weed with my niggas, last thing I want to see is a cop 

On patrol, some dicksuckers roll, the heck is up 

I'm heartless so I point my middle finger cause I don't give a fuck 

I'm strapped up and on parole, I gotta fight to stay out of the penn 

The same shit happened last year, here I go again

Chorus 4X 



[Uzi] 

Mercy mercy me, Lord forgive me for the wrong I've done 

Ghetto child with a crooked smile I had a rough one 

This life full of plenty hurt, so soft and pain 

Consequences of the game but I had to maintain 

Step on toes, I'm ready to ride or roll over 

I'm a kill for a meal, lay back and smoke some doja 

But I know what go around come around good 

Knock on wood and it's understood 

I'm stayin young at twenty one life full of regret 

Ten commandments say don't kill but I done left some folks wet 

I got the blood of a dead man on my hand 

We goin clash again in soldier land 

Mm hmm 



[Glock] 

Now am I wrong when I want to bust your motherfuckin dome 

Got that blues song stuck, scratch on you ain't coming home 

I let it ride cause I know he be fake 

But fuck that he cross my family, this nigga's done took the cake 

Stop the record just start it up you can find him in the lake 

Have your people fucked up sayin I just saw him yesterday 

See that's real and I know you motherfuckers can relate 

It's written down in ghetto law and taught by this ghetto church 

That's why my hollow keeps me strapped, cause it be too late 

Cause in a minute all this shit bout to be in one way

Good and bad  right and wrong lurking the land 
You choose your fate gracefully 
Save your soul if you can 
Life is shorter everyday my nigga make the right moves 
Choose your hustle spots wisely police give you the blues 
Lock you up put a strike by your name you on paper 
See the white boy be on every money and your paper 
Put the weed down now cause we face incarceration 
Stipulations of probation strike two is what you're facin 
In the mandatory joes, now you ain't gon bounce 
Short timin round them lifers hopin that you touch down 
If I see the free world again, I'm a ball 
Put my back up on the wall hopin blessins from the lord 
3rd strike twenty to life nigga I choose death 
Leave a coppers scar wet I ain't aimin for the chest

[Mystikal] 
I'm sweatin cause it's hot and humid outside 
The spot where we lay it down 
I amplify the city streets and terrorize the underground 
Nigga respect gangsta and run in the streets they walk on 
FBI might finish listenin to the car phone I talk on 
Waitin on me, wantin me to mess up, put my hands in some dirt 
But I'm a legitimate businessman, I sell light green t-shirts 
Go on officer leave me alone, I ain't be got no weapon 
I don't even know what you talkin bout, I be makin records 
Hits size I'm too busy for this bull and kicks 
Was it tinted when you pulled this six 
Over to the side of the road 
Got my hand on my heater cause I'm tired of you hoes 
Let the dog sniff my vehicle and my clothes 
But I bet I make it home cause you gotta let me go 
I'm too cold for an iron box 
I need city lights, the projects, and the boondocks 

[Chorus] 

[Prime Suspect #2] 
I'm lookin for that wall 
So I can put my back up against it 
Cause it ain't no love from the beginnin to the endin 
They got me pledgin the flag that want to see me doin 10 in 
See it's vicious out chea on these 3rd world streets 
Them people tryin to stop the hustle 
But yet they survivor just like me 
Makin liquidate runnin in them hater streets 
So I tell my brother get the cake for me if need be 

[Prime Suspect #3] 
Look let me run into ya'll cause the pilots burnin over 
I've been doin the same thing since lil 
But now I'm called a soldier 
And I'm older and watch fake soldiers transform cause they own 
See them same soldiers upstate and they ain't bout no home 
Why it's already a livin hell for the average thick soldiers 
Survival of the fittest watch yourself 
Is what poppa always told me 
Why we already misled, bustin hot metals 
I just need to step back and take a look 
Cause they liquidatin the ghetto

Kept me thinkin' that gang a nigga named Jackers was gonna play me 
See my baby, would amaze me, when she hit the block 
Her dycker names are grams, pizza, and rye 
What she got ain't no need for another bitch 
But its so hard, I don't seen brothers kill brothers quick 
Mothers done lie sick, from ,meeting up with my girl 
She done make my pockets fat from Corruptin' world 
But see don't let hr high tonight 
Cause she'll make you end your life tonight

I made a lot of riches

And Quarter Key is what they call her 
She's a Chi town baller, checking cheese from new orleans 
Then she ship it down to her folks uptown in Harlem 
When my chips get low, that's what my old lady for 
Can you hear me dog nigga, do you feel me dog

Getting honey for the money, then cut like O.J.

A down bitch, down to make me rich, she hot, she makes me keep some heat 
Some say I switch cause I left my boy for that girl 
But they tripping, she's true 2 me, they tryin' blues so let that bitch run 
My world she understanding never demanding 
And never overweight, when I go to jail she post bail 
And when I'm hungry she fixes a plate she's playa hated 
By these sucker, and homie they wanted the beef 
She kept my homies paid I know they like her 
Because they nicknamed her ""D"" 
 
My old lady snow jumped off the poacher 
Native four expensive hoe she balls cutthroat 
With gangstas cross if you here to one time 
Ain't no flossing, but if you pimp the bitch and stack the grits 
She make em good money they hoe hype stand on the block all day 
Long police mad, can't stand my bitch game plan 
Slick with her should I love money making bitch 
She got that fire, got all that junk and boy 6 

My old lady be the thug hoe 
You niggas want to love, my old lady tattoo slug bouncin' 
That ass in the club my old lady got the tweakers ,tweakers 
And she love when I beat her with that b-12, and watch it swell 
Making my paper on the streets, ugh and since I 
Pimp her so sweeter it comes back to me 
A boss bitch, every nigga want to please 
But they better get the fuck from around me, soul survivors, up in it 
Pimp that hoe for me from that LAP, to the LBC now pimp that hoe for me

For that undertaker let me get before I get mad

Open the bag and let me get mine
Some of that Mexican Mudd, before I buzz
Pass my straw so I can get high

I don't know the reason why 
I feel like I can never ever die
That cocaine powder be havin me bailin
Cause ain't no white dope, no white coke 
Gon be better than that inhailin

And have buckin like I'm gon nuts

Bout to come down with that gangsta sickness
Fuck dis I'm bout to get my swerve on 
Swerve on bout a G and get that dope so I can calm my nerves
He was chillin on the phizone

Would you die for the cause? (fuckin right!)
How many niggas would ride and die for you? (we riders!)

My name manifest pain to my enemies 
Holler see-Murder and bring bitches to their knees
Violent killers ready for blood marches 
Convicted murderers with open drug charges
Strapped with semi autos and po-po's
And nickle plated slug nose and we left the Calli cause
We made niggas, raised in ghetto's and slums
Totin chips and A-K's, money round drugs (ha)
Shoot first, and leave them standing in their shoes
We TRU niggas, bounded by blood and tatooes
Infiltrating my click, fool it ain't gonna happen
Us niggas been gettin paid before we started rapping
Situation getting sticky, cause the ???? the phone
Here comes the brigade, aiming straight for your home

We come in your set flip your dope and get rich
Take over your block and your spot with number one hits
Money and power, ha, give me the world
Cause after dollars no cents, only time will tell
Ha, I'm goin through somethangs, fool, so stop hatin
You live for weed and money, I live for greens and bacon
And I ain't takin no shorts with my ghetto d

Signed me a contract and got me a Camaro

Survival of the fittest, you better not run up

I remember back in 89 a nigga used to steal
And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

Started in this game at the age of thirteen
Getting paid making money serving crack to the fiends
Hoes couldn't take me, niggaz gave me jealous looks
To the world I was a man, to the feds I was a crook
Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise
Shooting niggaz til we die, Gambino's on the rise
My nigga Fiend up by my side, my enemy bound to die
Got no mercy in my eyes label Gotti one of the realest

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

You want to sex me, but don't want to pay my bills,

Now you keep on callin' my cellular phone,

Tell me why you actin' funny?
With all your money?

(Kangol Slim)
Tell me why you actin' bad?
With your kitty kat?

First Verse (Kangol Slim):
Tell me Baby girl why you actin' funny?
Everytime you come around you gotta ask me for money,
Not really trickin' off, ain't my style,
But I might give you somethin' if it's worth my while,
I don't know, the games that you play,
But we don't play that, around my way,
The only money that I really plan to spend,
Is on me and you scorin' on La Quinta inn
Now Baby girl I can see on you face,
You really want to hop up in the Z-28,
You know one thing, you ain't bout to get no money,
Round here stuntin' for your friends, tell me why you actin' funny?
You actin' bad with your kitty-kitty kat,
Knowin' that a brotha done already hit that,
You'z a want to-be hot girl,
But you'z a cold girl,
In a Hot Girl's World

[Chorus]

Second Verse (Ms. Tee):
Ooh, say boy why you actin' funny?
You never want to give me no lovin' or money,
You want some ass, don't want to give up the cash,
You want to sex me, then tell your boys and laugh,
Thought I would forgot about the things that we do?
Keep runnin' your mouth and ain't no love for you,
You want to sex me, but don't want to pay my bills,
And in the 9-8, you gonna have to hustle and heal,
Now you upsettin' me,
want to cry when they give you ten years in the pen,
But it wasn't like that, when you was home,
Now you keep on callin' my cellular phone,
And now I see,
You ain't no man,
You supposed to support me every way that you can,
Boy you want it, about my body,
And now I see, you ain't got no love for me

Primitive Radio Gods,"Jan lays down and wrestles in her sleep
Moonlight spills on comic books
And superstars in magazines
An old friend calls and tells us where to meet
Her plane takes off from Baltimore
And touches down on Bourbon Street

We sit outside and argue all night long
About a god we've never seen
But never fails to side with me
Sunday comes and all the papers say
Ma Teresa's joined the mob
And happy with her full time job

Do do do do do do

Am I alive or thoughts that drift away?
Does summer come for everyone?
Can humans do as prophets say?
And if I die before I learn to speak
Can money pay for all the days I lived awake
But half asleep?

Do do do do do do

A life is time, they teach us growing up
The seconds ticking killed us all
A million years before the fall
You ride the waves and don't ask where they go
You swim like lions through the crest
And bathe yourself on zebra flesh

I sink below the waves
Is this what I've been looking for ?
It seems
I've found someone to die for
Someone to lie for...

I've drunk my fill of misery

Restless and forgiving

Leave the future behind
Here...my will has been spent
Let us depart

Can leaving this mortal coil be seen as a new
Departure?, or a return to a permanent dream state ?

Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place
And that was O'Malley's Alley

Primus,"In 1986, the University of California Davis, sought two of the
All-time brightest stars,
Dr. Alphonze Mephesto, and Dr. Arny Abe Sacrabin,
Dr. Mephesto worked hard toward his thesis,
His goal was to genetically duplicate the DNA structure of asparagus,
So that all asparagus would grow to the same girth and length,
Giving asparagus a much more pleasant presentation in the world's
Supermarket vegetable business.

Dr. Abe Sacrabin's goal was to genetically create the greatest musical
Entertainer the world had ever seen,
Dr. Abe Sacrabin knew that if he could assemble the right elements he
Could theoretically build a DNA structure,
That would ensure his creation of talent far surpassing the average individual.
At the time, one subject of urban myth was the story that Michael
Jackson, in a effort to
Retain his youthful look and feminine vocal characteristics had his
Testicles surgically removed,
Thereby making him a modern day Castrato,
If such a rumor were true,
Michael Jackson more than likely would have some of his semen preserved
Before the surgery to insure the future of his name and lineage.

Word came back to Dr. Abe Sacrabin,
Of a secret cold storage locker
Deep within the bowels of a used UCLA research center,
That not only contained four containers of frozen semen,
But also held a pair of testicles each was labeled with the name, Jack Michaelson.

I once heard a noise, In the night the most sentuaint voice,
The song of love from an angelic boy, stuck in my head,
And this is what he said

""I am gopher boy, pondering reality,
I am gopher boy, Who will buy my raspberries?""

This had to be the seed of the king of pop,
Dr. Abe Sacrabin was able to use his charm and chiseled great features
To woo a young lab technician by the name of Jennifer,
Who of course just happened to have the proper access needed to obtain a
Small vile of the precious semen.

The search for the egg was a short one,
Dr. Mephesto simply ran an ad in the classified section of an LA Music
Magazine. The ad read,
""Wanted, unfertilized human eggs for genetic experiment.
Donors must have musical background.""

With a plethora of young eager wannabe musical stardoms, 
Willing to sell their eggs,
The two doctors, after rigorous auditioning, picked and purchased.
Dr. Abe Sacrabin felt that it would be far less complicated legally,
If the fetus was brought to term in the womb of a non human.
He had long since secured the services of the University Volleyball
Mascot,
A llama by the name of Missy.
When the baby was ready,
The child was removed via cesarean.
It was a healthy baby boy, and he was named Kevin.

I once heard a noise, In the night the most sentuaint voice,
The song of love from an angelic boy, stuck in my head,
And this is what he said,

""I am gopher boy, pondering reality,
I am gopher boy, Who will buy my raspberries?""

Kevin was a beautiful child,
Dr. Abe Sacrabin sought to it that Kevin was trained by the best in all
Aspects of performing, his voice was golden 
And had a sweetness to it that most males lacked.
He moved with grace and was able to moonwalk by the time he was three.
As Kevin grew with talent, Dr. Abe Sacrabin started noticing odd
Developments in his physical state.

When Kevin lost his baby teeth, his secondaries came in with a vengeance,
They were at least twice the size as a normal adult's and the two in
Front stuck nearly straight out, also as Kevin reached the 8th year,
He was the same height as he was when he was 4.
To top it off, he was growing hair all over and his penis was enormous,
Even by adult standards.

It also dawned on the doctor 
That even through all the years of hearing Kevin's singing,
He rarely spoke, often chosing 
To communicate through various grunts and gurgles

I once heard a voice, In the night the most sentuaint voice,
The song of love from an angelic boy, stuck in my head,
And this is what he said,

""I am gopher boy, pondering reality,
I am Gopher Boy, who will buy my raspberries?""

Other's were noticing the changes in Kevin,
The children began to tease him, and call him ""Gopher Boy"".
One Day, a bully by the name of Big Roy, started throwing bananas at him,
Soon a crowd of kids were all throwing bananas.
Suddenly, in a fury, Kevin rushed at Big Roy and bit 3 fingers off on his left hand.
Kevin was taken away and placed in the custody of the state,
Dr. Abe Sacrabin actions were found out,
But because there was no legislation concerning the genetic construction
Of another human being,
No criminal charges were brought forth.
The medical association's board of ethics stripped him of all his
Credentials and his reputation was ruined,
In fact, his name became so synonymous with failure,
That for years to come, med students around the world were known to say
In time of mishap,

""Damn, I feel just like Abe Sacrabin.""

Dr. Mephesto immediately began proceeds to adopt little Kevin.
Being a noted scientist and the creator of the cloned asparagus,
It wasn't long before the two were legally united as father and son.

They moved to Colorado, where they live in relative obscurity.
Kevin is still a boy, of few spoken words, sticking mainly to his grunts and gurgles,
But on occasion, if you listen closely, you can hear his sweet golden
Singing voice, ring out into the night, over the small town, of South Park.

Seventeen mountains stood so high

He said the sea would one day overflow with all your tears

Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear 
I guess he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again
But sometimes, sometimes life ain't always the way

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain
He used to say so strong, oh unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad

Just what you mean to me

From the first moment I saw you
Oh, I knew you where the one
That night I had to call you
I was rapping till the sun came up
Telling you just how fine you look
In a word, you were sex

My body was next

Was you afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?

Heavenly angels crying up above
Tears of joy pouring down on us

They know you are my fix
I know, that you know that I ain't cheating baby
They know this is serious
I ain't funking just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, crucial baby

You could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride, well maybe not the ride
But I got to have your face

A hundred percent Italian silk imported Egyptian lace
But nothing baby, I said nothing baby could compare
To your lovely face

I'm just trying to say
I'm just trying to say

More than your brother

Prince,"Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips

Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff
In a violent room
Fighting with lovers past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast

Well, I ordered, ""Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't to hungry""
Dorothy laughed
She said ""Sounds like a real man to me""
""You're kinda cute, you want to take a bath?
(Do you want to, do you want to, bath)

Awh I said ""Cool, but I'm leaving my pants on"" (she say)
""'Cause I'm kind of going with someone""
She said ""Sounds like a real man to me""
""Mind if I turn on the radio?""
""Oh, my favorite song"" she said
And it was Joni singing ""Help me I think I'm falling""

Brrring the phone rang and she said
""Whoever's calling can't be as cute as you""
Right then I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)

My pants where wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie
'Cause she hadn't read the book first

Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back 
To the violent room (tell us what you did)
Let me tell you what I did

I took another bubble bath with my pants on

Said the table to the chair 
You can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat
And from chilblains on my feet
If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk
Pray let us take the air
Said the table to the chair (can't nobody)

Said the chair to the table
Now you know we are not able (fuck with us)
How foolishly you talk
When you know we cannot walk (can't nobody)
Said the table with a sigh 
It can do no harm to try (fuck with us)
I've as many legs as you
Why can't we walk on two (say, can't nobody) 

So they both went slowly down (fuck with us)
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound (can't nobody)
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened to their side (fuck with us)
See the table and the chair 
Have come to take the air (y'all, say it y'all)

But in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
Till, to see them safely back
They paid a ducky-quack
And a beetle and a mouse
Who took them to their house.

When they whispered to each other
Oh delightful little brother (can't nobody fuck with us)
What a lovely walk we've taken
Let us dine on beans and bacon
So the ducky and the little browny (say it, y'all)
Mousey and the beetle dined,
And danced upon the heads
Till they toddled to their beds (can't nobody fuck with us)

Her favorite number was twenty and every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast

With different color socks

Place it like that to open up the door

He's looking for a savior in a city full of fools
Maybe he just needs a good talker to give him a good talking to.
Can we talk baby? Strip down, strip down. 
I think I'm gonna fall in love tonight.

Elephants and flowers, hot sweaty light paints a picture red and gold
On a crowd of naked bodies stripped down to their very souls

Prince,"He like to frequent this club down up on 36th
Pimps and things like to hang outside and cuss for kicks

Talking to no one in particular, they say ""the baddest I am tonight""
Four letter words are seldom heard with such dignity and bite.
All the poets and the part time singers always hang inside
Live music from a band plays a song called ""Soul Psychodelicide"".
The song's a year long and had been playing for months when he
Walked into the place.
No one seemed to care, an introverted this-is-it look on most of their faces.
Up on the mic repeating two words, over and over again
Was this woman he had never noticed before he lost himself in the
Articulated manner in which she said them.
These two words, a little bit behind the beat.
I mean just enough o-turn you on.
For every time she said the words another one of his doubts were gone.

Should he try to rap with her? Should he stand and stare?
No one else was watching her, she didn't seem to care.
So over and over, she said the words til he could take no more, (no more)
He dragged her from the stage and together they ran through the back door
In the alley over by the curb he said tell me what's your name
She only said the words again and it started to rain (rain, rain, rain)
Two words falling between the drops and the moans of his condition
Holding someone is truly believing there's joy in repetition.
There's joy in repetition. [Repeat: x4]
She said love me, love me, what she say?
She say love me, love me.
Joy, why don't you love me baby, joy, why can't you love me baby
Joy, come on and love me baby, joy in repetition
Alright, joy in repetition, [Repeat: x3]
Alright, joy, all my wishes add up to one
Love me, joy, Love me, joy, Love me, joy
Love me, Love me, joy, joy, joy in repetition
Joy, joy in repetition,
Joy, joy (love me) in repetition,
Love me, love, joy, joy, joy in repetition
Joy, and I'm gonna say it again, joy, joy, and I'm gonna say it again,
Joy, I'd like to go way up high and say, Love me, joy
I'll say Love me, joy

There's something else
The after world

A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby 

'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor

Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy

Tony, you were excellent
What you need is a manager
For what(I can make you) moneyminders are like parasites
They pose as wheelers and dealers for your rights
And most companies say that you need 'em 
(Not me) but I kick back, observed, and watched them bleed 'em 
(I'm honest) artists young and old
I can bring you to the top (where'd this unwritten law come from anyway?)
That years after the contract u should still be gettin' paid?
Boy, I'd go broke and hit the skids
Before I take care of a rich sucker's kids
My contract (hell, a contract ain't no pension plan)
My contract (years after this, my kids are still gonna make the grands)
Tony, you  (and you laughed at my brother, Little Richard) when he says u ain't gave him nothin'
Let's leave him out of this (hell, that ain't no joke)
His songs are still sellin', that man could die broke 
So fellow artists, push for yours

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
I did not come to funk around
'Til I get your daughter I won't leave this town

In the beginning God made the sea
But on the 7th day he made me
He was tryin' to rest y'all
When He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar, cold gettin' down

I tried to bust a high note
But I bust a string
My God was worried
'Til he heard me sing

When it come to funk I am a junky
I know from righteous, I know from sin
I got two sides and they're both friends

Don't try to clock 'em, they're much too fast
If you try to stop 'em they kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When you hear my music you'll be havin' fun

That's when I gottcha
That's when you mine
To tell the truth
Tell me what's my line?

My name is Prince, I don't wanna be king
'Cause I've seen the top and it's just a dream
Big cars and women and fancy clothes
Will save your face but it won't save your soul

I'm here to tell you that there's a better way
Would our Lord be happy if He came today?
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than you
But if you want to play with me, you better learn the rules

Watch it deacon, your track is leakin'
What is this you're seekin'?
The syncopated rhymes are at their peak

When you jumped on my D I see K
That's the one thing that I don't play
The jock strap was too big for you anyway
You're just a simpleton, I'll bust you like a pimple, son
My star is too bright
Boy, I'll sink you like the ship, Poseidon Adventure

You're bumpin' dentures to be cocksure
There must be more coming from your mouth than manure
So with a flow and a spray, I say
""Hey, you must become a prince before you're king anyway""

Do that, do that somebody
Do that, do that somebody

It's time to get ig-ig-ignorant
Def be the beat that I'm rockin'
Yo so, come get a hit
And put your thinking cap on, you've been forewarned
I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin' in my cauldron

That means my nugget, sometimes I'm rugged
The style I posses be havin', the other brothers buggin'
And this is for those who oppose
To propose to overexpose disclose
Pose a threat to my brother

Like any other man makin' a stand
I'll be damned if I let you play this hand
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked
What do you expect to win when you're used to playing craps?

Do that, do that somebody
Do that, do that somebody

It's gettin' tricky, I mean it's a sticky situation
To resurrect a groove with feeling and give it this much affection
Passion flows and who knows what lurks in the gallows of my mind
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow

12 inches of non-stop sole
I'm on a roll with P, it's time for the show
So do that, do that somebody
