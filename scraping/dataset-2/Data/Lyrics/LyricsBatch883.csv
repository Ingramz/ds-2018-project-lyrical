Raven-Symoné,"She was a young girl, eighteen
Addicted to the dreams of bein' on the big screen
Then late one nigh, kissed her mama goodbye
Took the keys to the car and drove off in the night

Don't be in a rush to leave
You'll never get these days again
But she was blinded by all the stars in her eyes

All she wanted was the Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
But when the sun goes down
You can almost hear the sound of the broken dreams on the ground

She was raised in a small town
She's been here for a year, her body losin' weight now
Never called back home, she's embarrassed to go
She don't eat, she don't sleep, all she hearing is no

She feels like there's no place to go
There's no one there to hold her close
So in comes the night with the tears in her eyes

All she wanted was the Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh, woah

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
When the sun goes down
You can almost hear the sound of the broken dreams on the ground

All she wanted was to live the life
Her mom got a call form her baby late one night
It was crying on the other end of the phone
She told her baby please just come back home
Everything is going to be alright this time

Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
When the sun goes down you can hear the sounds of the dreams

Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
When the sun goes down
You can almost hear the sound of the broken dreams on the ground

Raven-Symoné,"There's a photo book that can tell you countless things of me
So many memories, I remember every one of them
One look and the moment comes right back to me

I can see it clearly, all the details right in front of me
And all so heavenly, every story, every moment
Playing back just like it's on a movie screen

It's all there
It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
Capture pieces of my life like a voyage into time
It's all there

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
All the faces, all the places, my gentle memories
It's all there

I remember this like it happened just moments ago
My laughter wouldn't cease like escaping into history
Quiet little voyage of a memory

It amazes me to see what has come of me
Still but yet in motion, worth a thousand words or even millions more
It's right here

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
Capture pieces of my life like a voyage into time
It's all there

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
All the faces, all the places, my gentle memories
It's all there

Flipping through the pages are the many stages, different ages
As time passes by life flashes right in front of me, who'd have guessed
The things that were to come from reflections of what used to be

It amazes me to see what has come of me
Still but yet in motion, worth a thousand words or even million more
It's right here

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
Capture pieces of my life like a voyage into time
It's all there

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
All the faces, all the places, my gentle memories
It's all there

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
Capture pieces of my life like a voyage into time
It's all there

It's all there in the pictures, it's all there in the pictures
All the faces, all the places, my gentle memories
It's all there

Raven-Symoné,"I'm just walking, girls were talking
Nothing crazy, a typical night
Situation we always facing, haters hating
They must have no life

I can't stand how do they manage
To find my flaws that I'm sure
There is something they could be doing
Other then thinking about me

Things will always be like this
As long as jealously exists
That's not how I choose to be
I'm cool being simply me

I got mine and you got yours
Take a little, make it more
Only way that you can be
Is being comfortable in your skin

What you have is not for me
If I got to be, I be
The true life only begins
Being comfortable in your skin

They still lookin', keep it pushin'
Run into the ultra mistakes
Something happened as we were passin'
Made me stop, I had to say something

Hey, there ladies is this the way
We should do each other? If it's that tape
Take the energy you use to hate on me
It will get you further

No, that's just not me
I'll never agree with negativity
You can keep that over there

Things will always be like this
As long as jealously exists
That's not how I choose to be
I'm cool being simply me

I got mine and you got yours
Take a little, make it more
Only way that you can be
Is being comfortable in your skin

What you have is not for me
If I got to be, I be
The true life only begins
Being comfortable in your skin

What's this about? She won't get off it
Staring like she wanna get into it, blaze and skip
Finally I had to approach, she tells me
Tells me her man's the one I can't get with, wait hold it
Is that what this about? Girl, please

Things will always be like this long
As long as jealousy exists
That's not how I choose to be
I'm cool being simply me

We don't need to waste the time
Maybe this is all a sign
Way I see it's good to know
Here's the problem, let it go

I got mine and you got yours
Take a little, make it more
Only way that you can be
Is being comfortable in your skin

What you have is not for me
If I got to be, I be
The true life only begins
Being comfortable in your skin

",In Your Skin,2008
Raven-Symoné,"He who asks for a friend
Must first prove himself friendly
Trials will come, will you be
Fair weathered or will you be steady?
Surely, firmly, are you my friend?

We were close, closer than most
More than friends, nothing could come between us and then
Arguments and experience
Came creepin' in, how long has it been?

Didn't want you to leave, we couldn't agree
So I said to you stop talkin' to me
That's where we left and now I'm reconsidering
I did the wrong thing, girl, listen to me

Tell me, what's up? I've had enough
How do we get back on telling you sorry?
My mom said, that's how you keep a friend
Keep a friend, keep a friend
Tell her you're sorry when you're wrong

That's how you keep a friend
That's the way you keep a friend
And that's how you keep a friend
That's the way you keep a friend
That's how you keep a friend

I told you things never told nobody
We shared everything
Somebody told you I was in town
Where was I? Had you gotten a reply?
I apologize wish you'd come around

Didn't want you to leave, we couldn't agree
So I said to you stop talkin' to me
That's where we left and now I'm reconsidering
I did the wrong thing girl, listen to me

Tell me, what's up? I've had enough
How do we get back on telling you sorry?
My mom said, that's how you keep a friend
Keep a friend, keep a friend
Tell her you're sorry when you're wrong

That's how you keep a friend
That's the way you keep a friend
And that's how you keep a friend
That's the way you keep a friend
That's how you keep a friend

Can't even remember why we fell apart
But I'm so glad we got back together
Girl, you're like a sister to me
So much more than a friend
So make sure it don't happen again

Tell me, what's up? I've had enough
How do we get back on telling you sorry?
My mom said, that's how you keep a friend
Keep a friend, keep a friend
Tell her you're sorry when you're wrong

That's how you keep a friend
That's the way you keep a friend
And that's how you keep a friend
That's the way you keep a friend

That's how you keep a friend
That's the way you keep a friend

Raven-Symoné,"It's been awhile, there was you and I
Doin' things to have you
But it wasn't right, said some things
You maybe shouldn't have said, yeah

But you saved a part of my life
If another choice, what would you chose to let you go?
I can't just get, get enough, no
Always stay in love

I wanna let you go, tell me you need me
But you gotta love me or leave me, baby
Why can't I let you see, you are the only one for me?
Oh, how I need you but you gotta love me or leave me, baby
Leave me, ohh, oh leave me, baby, ohh, oh leave me, ohh

My heart is broken apart because of you, baby oh
Can't think about nobody else and I can't help it
But you're not ready for me to love you like I do
As many times that you heard me, you shouldn't desert me
But you're there forever that I won a million, yeah

I wanna let you go, tell me you need me
But you gotta love me or leave me, baby
Why can't I let you see, you are the only one for me?
Oh, how I need you but you gotta love me or leave me

Babe for you, I want to really think
Oh, anything just to bring you around
I can lie, it hurts, I can lie it hurts inside
Makin' it hard for me, so hard for me
Makin' it hard for me to let go

I wanna let you go, tell me you need me

Ravenous,"You are lost between the worlds
You are lost inside yourself
All your faces I have seen
And yet you still surprise me
Always thought I knew the person
Always thought I knew you
But right now I must confess
That I know little of what you do
Illusions rose up in my mind
Illusions of our future
Created a perfect world
But this world is without you
Always thought I could help you
Always thought you needed me
But since then I have learned
There was nothing I could do

Ravenous,"I have already seen it all 
A thousand times before
Gazing into outer space 
Where the timelines cross
Far out and away from here
It pushes its way into the air
Still a bit to surreal 
But we bring the lies to life
It only exists within our minds 
And so man created god
We tried to put it into focus 
Until it became all too real
And still there is some kind of need
This idea came to life
Still not completely understood
It unites and tears apart

A man made force in our world
Combines the evil and the good 
Religion is what we call it but isn't understood
It was created to give hope
But its caused so many wars
And it will bring so many more

Now what have I got here?  An instrumental spot, yeah
Time for me to put some funky hip-hop there
.. allow me to do the honors
You know the voice, but did you know the name was Ron or
M-O-N-E-why dash, be	 so don't be alarmed
when you be hearin please oh please oh please
Money be	, get loose, I never argue
I step up, with a whattup, whattup I'm on you
are next, what you'd expect a strong rhyme
It goes like this, for a long time
Cause ticka time is money (money) and money is ticka time (time)
And Money gets money everytime, that I go for mine
Line after line, like a laser
I be what they call a leaper, for the ways I
leap into the airwaves, sky with the rhyme flow
Droppin bombs on the others below
And while I'm climbin, they seem to get smaller than ants
And I'm hyped, cause I can see 'em dancin
And the few, standin 'round waitin
for me to come down, but I keep elevatin
Cause yo, I get up, and then continue to climb..
.. I got hang time

Doowhutchalike, that's what my boy cold Shock'n said
And what I'd like to do, is cold clock the bread
.. and so I make it like a bakery
There's no takin me, so what you make of me?
You're just another perpetratin sucker that steals
While I was makin rhymes, you made crack deals
Thought it was funny you - said ""Yo Money's through""
Heard it and hippidy-hopped on like a bunny do
Silly rabbit, kick the habit
Stop smokin, I'm from Oakland
And all that means is that I know where I'm from
and where I'm goin to, cause I'm a (?), see?
I'm kickin it out, better than nice, I'm naughty
Backstage I kiss my girl and my forty
I hear my name cause my people, support me
And those who don't know say, ""Go shorty! Go shorty!""
Heads and arms, begin to swing and then
just like Spike, I +Do the Right Thing+
I like pick a fly topic, to speak about
And then like Jordan on the court'n, I freak it out
I clock a score much higher than a nine point nine
.. I got hang time

Not all about kickin it, but you know this
For kicks I'm takin my flicks in gangster poses
I'm doin this for the money, and I suppose it's
the way I kick my verbals that's why you all, chose this
ace to be your number one I'm sharp as a knife
Short in stature yet the rep I get is larger than life
And I'm doin this for the Money, and not for my health
And you're correct if you suspect, I'm stuck on myself
I'm not tall, but when I play ball, I take - charge
Cause in this thing, I'm livin EXTRA large
Cause I'm bodacious, I'm bodacious
You're likin the way that I'm sayin it twice
cause my display is nice, so
Feel free about pressin rewind..
.. uh-huh, I got hang time

Time out, is over, the buzzer is soundin
I catch my breath, the mic is inbounded
I take possession, now I'm in control
So just keep on movin, like Soul II Soul
As I, bring it up, stop, at the top of the key
The pressure's on, they're lookin at me
But it's the competition, that brings out the man in me
I play it cool cause my fans keep fannin me
A team of MC's standin there blockin the hoop
They try a double team, but I don't play that poop
My man Fuse, sets the pick, and I break
Another sucker steps, and so I give him the shake
I give the next one a dose, of the same old drug
As I dip through the hole, he tried to plug
And the last MC in my path, with seconds to go
Standin bout six ten and a half
I take flight, right over the great big punk
and throw down a Darryl Dawkins chocolate thunder dunk!
So next time, you want to contest you climb
.. punk, I got hang time {*""Yes, yes!""*} see-ya!

We coopin we must be inta trouble, 
Some hard type shit that cost a quarter mill a pop 
It makes me laugh ha, life is so ironic, 
How I would get tha cash I become so iconable 
Cop the fast cars that come with the trip tonic panel 
I live the life that's filled with the jealousy 
Doomed from the start its like we born wit a felony 
Where's the longevity 
We in the place where best friends become enemies 
And foul nigguhs got the tendency 
You gotta watch what you wish for 
I hope to god its on a switchboard 
When I'm tryin to say a prayer and I'm callin' hope you listen lord 
See its just my position lord 
Gotta me smokin on this blunt while I'm lookin' at the sky 
Make it rain so I know the doves cry.

Lord do you hear me praying, when I'm lookin' at the sky 
I hope you can hear what I'm saying 
Its like my, my, my 
I'm not really complaining, but it makes me wanna cry 
I know you can see what I'm saying 
Its like my, my, my 
Its like my, my, my 

Cause God ain't cryin' when the sky starts to rain 
That must you and god in heaven poppin' champagne 
And speakin' of the shams, remember in Miami 
You got bent pussy it was your first trip wit me 
We was goin' hard to many bottles up in free-vay 
You was goin' crazy wit my Haitian man t-sway 
Pass that on the twins I had teesh fer like three days 
And I can't forget you're be-day 
We had dead body tap we was deeper then aye 
And now I'm just wishin' I could see a nigguh face 
And they kill, bang bang, did you get it wit em yet 
And its a damn shame because nigguhs still upset 
Like chita chala god musta needed y'all 
I think about the street dream saw how we were born 
But now all I got is the memories of two great soldiers 
That are dear friends of me

I'm tryin' to stay afloat, they say I'm doin' the most 
I'm doin' way to much I'm playin' death to close 
I'm think bout the thought of goin' back to court 
For the petty little games I really should avoid 
But its the calculator risk on how we make the chip 
Realizin' if I slip its a bottomless pit 
If you'd a filled my shoes, would you walk a mile 
Let the media tear you down and turn around and smile 
I thank god that I'm alive to see a black president

So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1992

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1990
Ray Anthony,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat

I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

That he'll only break me heart again

Where the peaceful waters flow

With no insults, and all the morals.
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France.

I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me?

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.

How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

Ray Anthony & His Orchestra,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Bebía why en el fragor del champan

Tus bellos ojos que tanto adore

Que nos llamen los mareados

No volveremos a vernos mas

We were destined to share the stage someday. 
Not only are my girls fine singers and dancers, 
Not only are they gorgeous and talented, 
But they also think I'm god!

They function as a greek chorus.

But they know plenty about Trojans.

This group is already well on its way to oink oink land. 
Oops, so sorry. Once again behaving in a manner I had sworn to aschew. 
Thank you. Once again falling into the vat of vulgarity. 
Oh tut tut. I did so want to leave my sordid past behind and emerge 
Form this project beathed in a new and ennobling light. 
I wanted to come out and be the sweet, pure, honest, 
Unadorned person that I really really am. 
I wanted to show you the good beneath the gaudy, 
The saint beneath all this paint, the sweet, pure, 
Winsome little soul that lurks beneath this lurid exterior. 
But fortunately, just as I was about to rush down the path 
To repectability and righteousness, 
A wee small voice called out to me in the night 
And reminded me of the motto by which I've always tried to live my life: 
F$CK 'EM IF THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE!""

[From the soundtrack:] ""Hi! ""After many a summer dies the swan,"" 
But not when she's stuck in a turkey the size of this one! 
Make no mistake about it folks, eggs will be laid tonight! 
Ain't that right girls? Oh, my girls. 
My three favorite schochkies on the breakfront of life. 
I'll never forget the first time I found these girls, 
Peddling their papayas on 42nd Street. 
Not only are my girls fine singers and dancers, 
Not only are they gorgeous and talented, 
But they also think I'm god!"" 

I am the one they call the bi-I-I-I-g noise!
I am a living work of art!
I just flew in from Winnetka, daddy-o!
I'm gonna blow this joint apart!

Everyone has a bit of big noise in his heart.
Everyone loves a little sin.
Well, I'm gonna be the first girl in the line
When the festivities begin!

I was a scandle, too hot to handle!
They said, ""You'd best depart!""
Oh! Exit Big Noise from Winnetka.
Enter

Enter! Enter!

I'm feeling so fresh and alive
And I'm so glad to arrive
It's all so grand

It's easy to see you don't need a palace
To feel like Alice in Wonderland
Back in Ohio where I come from
I've done a lot of dreamin' and I've travelled some

But I never thought I'd see the day
When I ever took a ride on the Santa Fe
(Wanna take a ride on the Santa Fe)
I would lean across my window sill

And hear the whistle echoin' across the hill
Then I'd watch the lights till they fade away
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe
What a thrill (what a great big wonderful thrill)

With the wheels a-singin' ""westward ho""
Right from the day I heard them start
'Cross the Kansas plains from New Mexico
I guess I've got a little gypsy in my heart

When I'm old and grey and settled down
If I ever get a chance to sneak away from town
Then I'll spend my busman's holiday

You were there with me
We walked along the streets of gold
Beside the crystal sea
We heard the angels singing
Then someone called your name
You turned and saw a young man
He was smiling as he came

He said friend, you may not know me now
But then he said but wait
You used to teach my Sunday school
When I was only eight
Every week you would say a prayer
Before the class would start
One morning when you said that prayer
I asked Jesus in my heart

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

Then another man stood before you
And said remember the time
A missionary came to your church
His pictures made you cry
You didn't have much money
But you gave it anyway
Jesus took the gift you gave
And that's why I'm here today

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

One by one they came,
As far as the eye could see
Each one somehow touched
By your generosity
Little things that you had done, sacrifices made
Unnoticed on the earth, heaven now proclaims
And I know up in heaven
That you're not supposed to cry
But I was almost sure
There were tears in your eyes
As Jesus took your hand
And you stood before the Lord
And He said my child look around you
For great is your reward

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave
I am so glad you gave
I am so glad you gave",Thank You,1990

Slowly each name He'll call
When He calls to me

Of how it's going to be
But I'll keep fighting until then

Ray Boltz,"You spoke the word
And lit the day
With loving hands
You formed the clay
And made the ones
Who would betray
Your mercy

They heard You speak
Saying, Blessed are the poor
And meek
And on Your knees
You washed their feet
Oh, mercy

Your mercy shines like the morning
When the darkness runs
From the day
Like the rising sun
Oh, Your glory
Chases the shadows away
And we are changed
By mercy

To bear the nails to save a friend
Is a thought I cannot comprehend
But to die for those
Who drove them in
That's Your mercy

And though heaven
Truly has in store
An eternity of great rewards
The only thing I'm praying for
Is Your mercy

Grace wants to change
But it's just so tough

Just a girl who wants to be loved

Everyday life is moving faster
Grace is trying by it just won't work
She knows her life
Is headed for disaster
Never knew how much living could hurt

She was running in the wrong direction
Till she met a friend of mine
Now He's

Ray Boltz,"I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honor His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

I have heard how Christians long ago
Were brought before a tyrant's throne
They were told that he would spare their lives
If they would renounce the name of Christ
But one by one they chose to die
The Son of God they would not deny
Like a great angelic choir sings
I can almost hear their voices ring

I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honor His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

Now the years have come, and the years have gone
But the cause of Jesus still goes on
Now our time has come to count the cost
To reject this world, to embrace the cross
And one by one let us live our lives
For the one who died to give us life
Till the trumpet sounds on the final day
Let us proudly stand and boldly say

I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honor His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

To the Lamb of God who bore my pain
Who took my place, who wore my shame
I will seek to honor His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honor His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb",I Pledge Allegiance to the Lamb,1994

Ray Boltz,"They tell me Jesus died
For my transgressions
And that He paid that price
A long, long time ago

When He gave His life for me
On a hill called Calvary
But there's something else
I want to know

Does He still feel the nails
Every time I fail?
Does He hear the crowd cry
Crucify, again?

Am I causing Him pain?
Then I know I've got to change
I just can't bear the thought
Of hurting Him

It seems that I'm so good
At breaking promises
And I treat His precious grace
So carelessly

But each time He forgives
What if He relives
The agony He felt on that tree?

Does He still feel the nails
Every time I fail?
Does He hear the crowd cry
Crucify, again?

Am I causing Him pain?
Then I know I've got to change
I just can't bear the thought
Of hurting Him

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord

Do you still feel the nails
Every time I fail?
Have I crucified you, Jesus
With my sin?

I never want to hurt You again

",Feel the Nails,1995
Ray Boltz,"I was in the crowd
The day that Jesus died
And as He hung upon the cross
His mother cried

I saw the crown of thorns He wore
The stripes upon His back
The water and the blood ran out
And then the sky turned black

My mind was filled with anger
My heart was filled with shame
This man brought only healing
Who could bring Him pain

Why does it seem the strong
Always victimize the weak?
And suddenly I found myself
Standing to my feet

And I cried, ""Who nailed Him there?
This Child of peace and mercy
Who nailed Him there?
Come and face me like a man
Who nailed Him there?""

And the crowd began to mock me
I cried, ""Oh my God, I do not understand""
Then I turned and saw the hammer
In my hand

I am just a Roman soldier
An ordinary man
I love my wife and children
I do the best I can

How could I have killed Him?
It must be someone else
There's got to be an answer
I just can't blame myself

And I cried, ""Who nailed Him there?
This Child of peace and mercy
Who nailed Him there?
Come and face me like a man
Who nailed Him there?""

And the crowd began to mock me
I cried, ""Oh my God, I do not understand""
Then I turned and saw the hammer
In my hand

I nailed Him there

I nailed Him there

",The Hammer,1995
Ray Boltz,"Walking on the road to Jerusalem, 
The time had come to sacrifice again, 
My two small sons,
They walked beside me on the road,
The reason that they came was to watch the lamb.

""Daddy, daddy, What will see there,
There's so much that we don't understand"",
So I told them of Moses and Father Abraham,
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb"".
""There will be so many in Jerusalem today,
We must be sure the lamb doesn't run away"",
And I told them of Moses and Father Abraham,
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb"".

When we reached the city,
I knew something must be wrong, 
There were no joyful worshipers, 
No joyful worship songs,
I stood there with my children 
in the midst of angry men, 
Then I heard the crowd cry out
""Crucify Him"".

We tried to leave the city but 
we could not get away, 
Forced to play in this drama
a part I did not wish to play,
""Why upon this day were men condemned to die?, 
Why were we standing here, Where soon they would pass by?"".

I looked and said, ""even now they come"",
The first one cried for mercy, 
The people gave him none, 
The second one was violent,He was arrogant and loud, 
I still can hear his angry voice 
screaming at the crowd,
Then someone said ""there's Jesus"", 
I could scarce believe my eyes, 
A man so badly beaten,
He barely looked alive, 
Blood poured from His body, 
From the thorns upon His brow, 
Running down the cross, Falling to the ground.

I watched Him as He struggled, 
I watched Him as He fell, 
The cross came down upon His back,
The crowd began to yell, 
In that moment I felt such agony, 
In that moment I felt such loss,
Till a Roman soldier grabbed my arm
and screamed, ""you, carry His cross"".

At first I tried to resist him,
Then his hand reached for his sword,
So I knelt and took the cross from the Lord,
I placed it on my shoulder,
And started down the street,
The blood that he'd been shedding
was running down my cheek.

They led us to Golgotha, 
They drove nails deep in His feet and hands,
Yet upon the cross I heard Him pray
""Father, forgive them"".

Oh, never have I seen such love in any other eyes,
""Into thy hands I commit my spirit"" 
He prayed and then He died,

I stood for what seemed like years,
I'd lost all sense of time until 
I felt two tiny hands holding tight to mine,
My children stood there weeping,
I heard the oldest say,
""Father please forgive us,the lamb ran away"".

""Daddy, daddy, What have we seen here?,
There's so much that we don't understand"",
So I took them in my arms,
And we turned and faced the cross,
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb""",Watch the Lamb,1995

While they were still asleep
I packed a box of food and clothes
And walked back to their street

Beside them on the ground
And the card I read from Santa said
Inside the three of you
The real heart of Christmas
Is still beating strong and true

Pilate's house where Christ 
Is on trial"" It sounded like

There didn't say nothing at all

I didn't make a sound

""Guilty, convicted and sentenced to death, 
Soon it will be finished on a cross made of wood

He said ""we're standing 
Here at Calvary's tree, 
The sky has turned black,
 blood covers the land, 
From the spear in His side 
And the nails in His Hands,
Now some called him a Saviour,
Said He lived without sin,
Some said it did not do much for Him, 
Some called Him Messiah, God's only Son, 
Others shook their heads and 
Said the good die young.""

Until you see that the 
Stone's been rolled away,
Jesus is defeated when you 
Look at all the pain He had to feel 
Until you read Isaiah 53 and 
It says that's the way we were healed
And Jesus was defeated when you 
Look at everything He went through
And then you realize He went 
Through it for me and you, 
Things in the media they're not 
Always what they seem, 
Jesus is alive, do you know what that means?

It means, Jesus defeated 
The power of death, 
Oh yes it happened 
Just like He said, 
He bore our sins on 
A cross made of wood
He triumphed over evil for good 
And the one who built 
His kingdom on bondage and fear, 
The one who killed the prophets, 
Left their families in tears,
The father of lies, the author of sin,

Are kneeling down to pray

Some are finding mercy
Forgiveness for their sin
Some are fighting battles
And they're struggling to win

To give them to the Lord

Those burdens anymore

There's a love that's true

A mother kneels beside them

Is standing there in tears
Giving up a part of him
That he's held back for years

Hearts are being broken
Lives are being changed
And those who call upon Him
Will never be the same

And Jesus is waiting
He is waiting here for you

Go quickly now
Before they close the door
That's what the altar is for

Go quickly now
Before they close the door
And you can give your burdens
To the Lord, that's what this altar is for

Ray Boltz,"I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honor His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

I have heard how Christians long ago
Were brought before a tyrant's throne
They were told that he would spare their lives
If they would renounce the name of Christ
But one by one they chose to die
The Son of God they would not deny
Like a great angelic choir sings
I can almost hear their voices ring

I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honor His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

Now the years have come, and the years have gone
But the cause of Jesus still goes on
Now our time has come to count the cost
To reject this world, to embrace the cross
And one by one let us live our lives
For the one who died to give us life
Till the trumpet sounds on the final day
Let us proudly stand and boldly say

I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honor His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

To the Lamb of God who bore my pain
Who took my place, who wore my shame
I will seek to honor His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honor His commands

Ray Boltz,"I dreamed I went to heaven
You were there with me
We walked along the streets of gold
Beside the crystal sea
We heard the angels singing
Then someone called your name
You turned and saw a young man
He was smiling as he came

He said friend, you may not know me now
But then he said but wait
You used to teach my Sunday school
When I was only eight
Every week you would say a prayer
Before the class would start
One morning when you said that prayer
I asked Jesus in my heart

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

Then another man stood before you
And said remember the time
A missionary came to your church
His pictures made you cry
You didn't have much money
But you gave it anyway
Jesus took the gift you gave
And that's why I'm here today

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

One by one they came, 
As far as the eye could see
Each one somehow touched
By your generosity
Little things that you had done, sacrifices made
Unnoticed on the earth, heaven now proclaims
And I know up in heaven
That you're not supposed to cry
But I was almost sure
There were tears in your eyes
As Jesus took your hand
And you stood before the Lord
And He said my child look around you
For great is your reward

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams

And Cuban rum

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought

No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Going no where
Guitar packed in the trunk
Somewhere round mile marker 112
Papa started hummin' the funk
I gotta jones in my bones before we know
We were singing this melody
Stop the car pulled out the guitar
Halfway to New Orleans

Said take me home
Said take me home

Could feel the sun about to rise
When I realized we had nothing to fear
It's just me and my daddy and a kid named Cope
Making music that nobody would hear
And then the sun let up and it split the night
Spilling over our jubilee
Ten thousand cars by the side of the road
Grooving far as the eye can see

Said take me home
Take me home
Said take me home
Said take me home

Hot damn you should have felt the groove
Like I was swimming in a sea of soul
The sun was rising and the day was hot
And we was all about to lose control
My daddy turned his face up towards the sky
And I knew that there was nothing to lose
I felt the crowd breathe in and I closed my eyes
And we disappeared into the groove

Said take me home
Take me home

Years full of tears and regret;

Sunshine and joy always nigh;

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning, with alarm
The British museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through the foggy London town

It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's, it's de-lovely"".",It's De-Lovely,1959

Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit before the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So goodbye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things",Just One of Those Things,1959

I was faithful and true but what good will it do

And do, do just as you should?

Yes you had the right touch but I was askin' too much
Won't you turn that new leaf over,
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?

There's a farm I know near my old home town,
Where we two can go and try settling down.
There I'll care for you forever,
'Cause you're all in this world I crave.

And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Ray Brown,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice,
Warmer than the Summer night.
The clouds were like an alabaster palace,
Rising to a snowy height.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.

It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar

Ray Brown,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,1989
Ray Brown,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1989
Ray Brown,"Now, out of the night
New as the dawn
Into the light
This Child
Innocent Child
Soft as a fawn

One work of art
Here in my arms
Here he lies
Trusting and warm
Blessed this morn

Ray Brown,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Ray Brown,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe God is now, was then and always will be.
With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.

Ray Brown,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love?,1990
Ray Brown,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Ray Brown,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Ray Brown,"You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da

That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
 
Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind

How faint the tune
Somewhere there's Heaven
How high the moon

There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music

So we're singing it just for you

Does it touch the stars?
How high the moon
Does it reach out to Mars?

Ray Brown,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew, and never wished for Turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball, and what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad (Coward)
But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games, with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's OK
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
I'm alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp",The Lady Is a Tramp,1992
Ray Brown,"Your my funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine, 
You make me smile with my heart, 
Your looks are laughable, un-photo-graphical, 
Yet youÂ´re my favorite work of art 
 
Is your figure less than Greek? 
Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak, are you smiling? 
But donÂ´t change a hair for me, 
Not if you care for me.

Ray Brown,"Every time it rains
It rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune
Fallin' all over town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me

Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin' (That I Love You),1994
Ray Brown,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1994
Ray Brown,"I search for phrases
To sing your praises
But there aren't any magic adjectives
To tell you all you are!

You're just too marvelous
Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby, amorous

It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean, they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much
And just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary

And so I'm borrowing
A love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words",Too Marvelous for Words,1994
