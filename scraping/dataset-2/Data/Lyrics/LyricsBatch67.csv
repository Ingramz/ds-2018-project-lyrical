Clay County,"I hear the wind a-blowing through the lonesome pine
    And I know my love is gone too
    I hear the wind a-blowing through the lonesome pine
    That's why I'm blue love, so blue



She's gone so far away thats why I'm griving
She's left me here alone among the trees
And all that I have left is just a memory
And it always haunts me with a breeze



  * Refrain



I'll leave the day they try to find my darling
I don't know where on earth she can be
I know that I can't ever live without her
For each night in dreams her face I see

",Lonesome Wind Blues,1992
Clay Crosby,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner,1996
Clay Crosse,"So many voices in his ear
Are they playing on his fears
It's a bad situation
All the way around
But with a solid foundation
He's gonna stand his ground 

Take a little time
Plant the seeds
Give him reason to believe 

Give him roots, and give him wings
And he'll grow up to do great things
Let him know the joy that he brings
Teach him the value of the truth
Oh you gotta give him roots, give him wings 

When he comes to you
And he needs your help
And he's so unsure of himself
Give him vision
So he can see the Light
Let him know the difference between
Wrong and right 

Share the wisdom
Of your peers
There'll be laughter
There'll be tears 

He should aim as high as the sky
There ain't nothing he can't do
If he'll only try",Give Him Roots,1993
Clay Crosse,"You say, you fell out of love with no place to stand
You say, your heart's on the mend from a broken romance
You say, you don't want to trust because it hurts too much
And you think, I'd never understand

Tell me what have I got to do
To make a believer of you?

Do I have turn water into wine, turn some stones into bread?
Do I have to paint my heart across the sky in a blazing shade of red?
Do I have to push the sun into the sea to make you fall in love with me?
Oh, if that's what it takes then let it be
(That's what it takes)

You say, you don't need my love but I know it's a lie
You say, I shouldn't even try

Tell me what have I got to lose
To make a believer of you?

Do I have turn water into wine, turn some stones into bread?
Do I have to paint my heart across the sky in a blazing shade of red?
Do I have to push the sun into the sea to make you fall in love with me?
Oh, if that's what it takes then let it be
(That's what it takes)
Let it be

You need me to turn the tide of your ocean
Let me set your heart back into motion
Ooh yeah

Do I have turn water into wine, turn some stones into bread?
Do I have to paint my heart across the sky in a blazing shade of red?
Do I have to push the sun into the sea to make you fall in love with me?
Oh, if that's what it takes then let it be
(That's what it takes)
Let it be, yeah

Do I have to turn water into wine?

Clay Crosse,"You've been hurt before, lost many wars
And you realize the danger you're in without Him in your heart
To make a new start, you're taking a chance you'll get hurt again
Don't be afraid, it don't have to be that way, remember

[Chorus]
Love in the right hands
Is like sunlight burnin' through the mornin' sky
Love in the right hands
Is a powerful thing, so put your hand in His

He'll be there for you, He'll help you get through
When the pressures in this world surround you
You know it will rain but He'll soften the pain
You'll find shelter with His arms around you
Don't be afraid, have faith in Him, remember

Clay Crosse,"I've walked along a hundred highways
Some I wish I could forget
And I've burned a lot of bridges
But there's not one that I regret
'Cause every path I've taken
They all have led me to knowing my place
My place is with you

I've had my promises forsaken
Into many empty words
And I'm amazed and so astounded
That I won't get what I deserve
Whatever lies I've lived for
I have finally found the truth
I know my place, my place is with you

You are my treasure forever
The one dream I've searched for

I've not been given my tomorrow
I'm only certain of today
If I don't see another sunrise
I will not have to be afraid
I know we will be together
When all my days are through
I know my place, my place is with you",My Place Is With You,1993
Clay Crosse,"I've got a secret, been hiding oh so long
Trying hard to keep it and never tell anyone, but
It's getting hard a little harder every day
I feel it moving inside me, moving in mysterious ways
And I'm not alone no matter what I do
No matter where I go I know, I'm gonna be with You

[Chorus]
Your love is working in my life, I can feel it every day
You pick me up and take me higher
But I'm not afraid 'cause I know Your love is working in my life

Always so independent, thought I could stand alone
I never needed anything from anyone
But since You found me and I found You, You reached out to me
And showed me what the power of love can do

[Chorus]

I don't know just where this road is leading
But as long as You hold my hand, I'll keep believing

No I am not afraid 'cause I know Your love is working in my life",Your Love Is Working in My Life,1993
Clay Crosse,"For so long I searched for answers
I looked in places where wise men never go
When I put my trust in your love
I found the truth some wise men never know
I'll stand alone 'till your light shines ('till your light shines)
Any time night or day
I just reach out your never far away

When ever I'm feeling low I call your name
It lifts me up
No other words feel the same
I call your name 
I call out your name (I call your name)
I call your name
I call your name

In a world that's always changing
It's hard to find a reason to believe
The time has come no more waiting
With you I have all I'll ever need
I'm thankful you reached out to me (reached out to me)
I feel that I can touch the sky
Your love gave me wings now I can fly

When ever I'm feeling low I call your name
It lifts me up

I call your name 
I call out your name 

I stopped running, I stopped hiding
Because now I know it was meant to be
Cause love so strong
Brings me to my knees

Well I call out your name
Every day every night
My lord I need your love

Clay Crosse,"Regie Hamm and Joel Lindsey
So many mountains that we try to climb
So many places where we fall behind
Deep in the struggle just to find our way
We lose the heart, we lose the faith
Sometimes this life can tear your world apart
But you've got to remember that...
Chorus:
His love is strong enough to win the fight
His love is strong and good and right
When the heart gets weak
And the road get's long
His love is strong
His love is strong
Within the wonder of a baby's cry
And in the thunder of the midnight sky
Is something stronger than the heart of steel
It's a power you can touch and feel
So when you think that all your hope is gone
You've got to remember that...
Repeat chorus
You may be walking through the darkest night
On a road that's rough
But keep believing in the morning light
And His love will be enough, cause...

Clay Crosse,"What's so wrong about daydreaming
And what's so bad about feeling optimistic
There's no use trying to hide, it's right there in your eyes
Well, I can feel it when my heart beats
We'd be fools not to jump in both feet

[Chorus]
Because His love's comin' over me
And His love's comin' over you
Well, it's what we were made for
All I have prayed for, comin' to set us free
Yeah, His love's comin' over you and me

Tears, they got no business here no, no
And heartaches gonna lose its place in line
Yeah, the feeling's mutual, there's no doubt in my soul
If there were my dreams got shot down
I know He'd steady my shaky ground

[Chorus]

I don't question this moment
And I won't hesitate no more
Now this time the shadows
Won't dare to darken my door like before

I can feel it when my heart beats
We'd be fools not to jump in both feet

Clay Crosse,"A silent house, moonlit walls
Shadows move like ghosts down empty halls
The daily news lies on the floor
A crazy world waits outside my door
As life goes on

[Chorus:]
I turn to you Lord
In my hour of desperation
When the waters of my life are running dry
I turn to you Lord
And I find the inspiration

To believe my dreams are worth and honest try
In a world that breaks your heart in two
I turn to You
In crowded streets, lonely eyes
Search for love beneath darkening skies
I fight and fall for foolish gain
When will I learn I earn it all in vain
Without Your love

And You're always there
To gently guide me home
In a world that breaks your heart in two
I turn to You",I Turn to You,1995
Clay Crosse,"I was a pilgrim on a journey
Through a desert cruel and unjust
I was lost, and I was thirsty
And there where no signs I could trust
Just when I started to falter
When I could no longer see
The sky of my world suddenly opened
And the heavens rained down on me
[Chorus]
I drank love from the sweetest cup
And my thirst was satisfied
I drank love from the sweetest cup
And it washed away my pride
I was blind, and I was weak
I was lost, and I was lame
But I drank love from the sweetest cup
And I will never be the same
From a voice that had no distance
With a sound so pure and so clear
Came words whispered so softly
Only my heart could hear
There, in the middle of knowing
Where my hope had started to sink
Grace, like a dove, guided me onward
And brought me all I wanted to drink
[Chorus]
You never know what's going to change you
Don't know the day or the hour
But when it comes it just might save you
'Cause it alone has the power
[Chorus]",Love from the Sweetest Cup,1995
Clay Crosse,"I've got trails and tribulations
Troubles all around
My desires and expectations have me lost more than I'm found
And lord knows I often falter in the smallest of my pride
But when I kneel down at his alter I am lifted up inside

'Till I stand upon that mountain 
'Till I sit beside the thrown 
'Till the waters of loves fountain carry me home
'Till I rise up from this mortal clay of blood and bone
Let the rock that was rolled away be my cornerstone

Help me face every tomorrow 
Give me strength to bare the load
Give me signs that I can follow
Set feet upon the road 
And may he who walked on water give me courage where I tread
And when I kneel down at his alter let my hungry soul be feed

'Till I stand upon that mountain 
'Till I sit beside the thrown 
'Till the waters of loves fountain carry me home
'Till I rise up from this mortal clay of blood and bone
Let the rock that was rolled away
Let the rock that was rolled away
Let the rock that was rolled away be my cornerstone

Let this faith be my foundation 
This hope, my liberation
'Till I fly away on that glorious, glorious day 

'Till I stand upon that mountain 
'Till I sit beside the thrown 
'Till the waters of loves fountain carry me home
Till I rise up from this mortal clay of blood and bone
Let the rock that was rolled away

Let the rock that was rolled away 
Let the rock that was rolled away be my cornerstone",The Rock (That Was Rolled Away),1995
Clay Crosse,"I have wrestled in the darkness 
of this lonely pilgrim land
Raising strong and mighty fortresses 
that I alone command
But these castles 
I've constructed by the 
strength of my own hand
Are just temporary kingdoms 
on foundations made of sand

In the middle of the battle 
I believe I've finally found
I'll never know the thrill of victory 
'til I'm willing to lay down
All my weapons of defense and 
earthly strategies of war
So I'm laying down my arms and 
running helplessly to Yours

I surrender all my silent hopes and dreams
Though the price to follow costs me everything
I surrender all my human soul desires
If sacrifice requires
That all my kingdoms fall
I surrender all

If the source of my ambition 
is the treasure I obtain
If I measure my successes on 
a scale of earthly gain
If the focus of my vision 
is the status I attain
My accomplishments are 
worthless and my efforts are in vain

So I lay aside these trophies 
to pursue a higher crown
And should You choose somehow 
to use the life I willingly lay down
I surrender all the triumph for 
it's only by Your grace
I relinquish all the glory, 
I surrender all the praise

Everything I am, all I've done, 
and all I've known 
Now belongs to You, 
the life I live is not my own
Just as Abraham laid Isaac 
on the sacraficial fire
If all I have is all that You desire
I surrender all",I Surrender All,1995
Clay Crosse,"There came a time when I realized my life was not my own
God above placed a seed of faith in me
That grew into a world I never known 
A kind of love my heart was never shown
Lord you found me
Now every part of me
Forever wants to please
The god that made me his own

I promise lord that I?ll seek you 
I?ll promise all of my ways
I promise I?ll keep standing to the end of my days
I?ll follow your light and make a home close to your heart
I make it a promise

The morning light rains its glory down in streams into my soul
I stretch my arms to the heavens high above
The beauty of your world before my eyes
Fills me with the love deep inside
Lord I love you
Every step I go alone I know that I belong to the one who calls me his own

I promise lord that I?ll seek you 
I?ll promise all of my ways
I promise I?ll keep standing to the end of my days
I?ll follow your light and make a home close to your heart

I want to be devoted to you
Abandoning everything I do
To dedicate all that I am
In your strength I can stand
I will stand

I promise lord that I?ll seek you 
I?ll promise all of my ways
I promise I?ll keep standing to the end of my days
I?ll follow your light and make a home close to your heart

Clay Crosse,"The blood that Jesus shed for me
Way back on Calvary
Oh the blood that gives me strength
From day to day
It will never lose its power

For it reaches to the highest mountain
And it flows to the lowest valley
The blood that gives me strength
From day to day
It will never lose its power

Oh I sooths my doubts
And calms my fears
And it dries all my tears

And it flows to the lowest valley

Ice is forming on the river
The barges are held in tow
Cold grey dawn, chilling to the bone

Must be ten below
Somehow you feel lost and alone out there
Feeling like you ought to leave
Such hard living in the cold cold world

People its time to believe
Sounds tear through the morning
You pull yourself from your bed
Try so hard to quiet your mind

Dodging thoughts of that lies dead ahead
A chance to be dashed on the rocks
Fooled by friendly lights
Shining solely to decieve

Such hard living in this cold cold world

Clay Crosse,"Before the threads of time began
Was pre-ordained a mighty plan
That I should walk with Him alone
The cords of trust unbroken


But fate foresaw my wandering eye
That none could yet restrain
To violate the friendship I
Would cause Him so much pain


Chorus:
And everytime I close my eyes
I see the nails, I hear the cries
He did not keep Himself away
He was no stranger to my pain
He walked a mile in my shoes
He walked a mile


Feet so dusty cracked with heat
But carried on by love's heartbeat
A man of sorrows filled with grief
Forgiveness was His anthem


No feeble blow from tongue or pen
Could ever sway my love for Him
Across the echoed hills He trod
And reached into my world.


Repeat chorus
",He Walked a Mile,1997
Clay Crosse,"We do a pretty good job of throwing sticks and stones
But everyone's got a closet full of skeleton bones
No need to tear each other down
'Cause we're all standing here on common ground


Chorus:
If we could love one another
We could bring Heaven down out of the sky
If we could love one another
We could bring hate to its knees tonight
Wouldn't every future be bright
If we could love one another
Love one another right


We find it easy enough loving the latest trends
Take something that's dead and make it our closet friend
Imagine what this world could be
If we worked as hard at loving you and me


Repeat chorus


Bridge:
Don't let your anger get the best of you
When you're provoked you simply refuse
Don't waste your time with retribution

Shake it up with a revolution - and set the world on fire.
",Love One Another Right,1997
Clay Crosse,"So many preachers 
So many churches and denominations 
Got their opinions and their documents 
And statements and beliefs and sometimes 
There's a miscommunication

And we complicate the truth 
And convolute the story 
But as far as I recall I do believe it all

[Chorus]
Comes down to a man dying on a cross 
Saving the world Rising from the dead 
Doing what He said He would do 
Loving everyone He saw
When it's said and done it all
Comes down to a man dying on a cross 
Saving the world

It isn't a secret  And maybe I'm being simple minded 
But it's about Jesus and a way, a truth, a life 
That can change a heart and a soul forever 
And we need to be reminded

It's the power of the blood 
That brings us to redemption 
We can rise above the fall 
And the reason for it all

Spend your time lookin' for a different girl
Carry on like there ain't no tomorrow


You can take your mind to a different plane
Push it to the edge and forget your name
Lose it all and you will beg, steal or borrow


But I don't want to live that way
Be another helpless stray
I'm lookin' for the truth today
And it's somethin' I've been prayin' for


Chorus:
I wanna be a sold out believer
I wanna follow my Lord completely
I don't wanna waste another day
I gotta love Him all the way
I want to be a sold out believer


You can put your faith in the moon and stars
Say there's really nothin' to the very scars
That belong to the hands of the Father


You can say the man wasn't what he seemed
Callin' Him a fool with a crazy dream
And in the end He was just another martyr


But let me tell you how I feel
I believe His love can heal
Yeah I know what He did was real
And it's somethin' I've been livin' for

I gotta give my all
Don't wanna go half way

Clay Crosse,"Just beneath the rafters
In a church of stone
Laid a stained glass window
In the attic all alone


A work of art forgotten,
A treasure thrown away
Taken from the sunlight,
It was just a useless frame


Chorus:
Ooh the things in life we take for granted
Ooh the things of wonder we could know
Ooh I want to be illuminated
Full of Heaven's light
Shining through my life
Let the window of my heart reveal Your love


I took the stained glass window
And held it to the light
Years of hidden glory
Reappeared before my eyes


Every brilliant color
Glowing like a fire
Full of revelation
And created to inspire


Repeat chorus


Chant:
Thirsting for the morning sun
I am Yours, Thy will be done
Let Your love in me unfold
With it's beauty to behold.


There's a stained glass window
In the soul of a man
A pattern of perfection
That was made with holy hands
And with the light of heaven
Pouring through each pane
Truth in all its splendor
Is revealed and will remain.

Clay Crosse,"Come on and gather round and listen to my story
About a fall from grace
A change of heart a rise to glory
A lesson learned, a doorway I went through

Now all I know is I was born to lead and not to follow
But the places that I led turned out to be so hollow
And in the end I just turned out to be a fool

Justification would make me shine
My performance a work of art
All I ever wanted was to walk that line
But I jumped across and broke Your heart

For all I've learned the days I lived it were so rare
The dust of innocence I scattered who knows where
And when I turned my back on You, You stood right there
And You never left me, no You never left me

These scars I have, I know they are here to remind me
That everything I've said and done I can leave far behind me
The door is shut and I shall never more return
Everybody says that Your childhood dies

A little bit more every day
But all around me are mercy's eyes
And they'll keep me close to You I pray

For all I've learned the days I lived it were so rare
The dust of innocence I scattered who knows where
And when I turned my back on You, You stood right there
And You never left me, no You never left me

You know I came to love You as a young man many years ago
But now You've brought me out of harm
And I feel just like a baby in Your arms

For all I've learned the days I lived it were so rare
The dust of innocence I scattered who knows where
And when I turned my back on You, You stood right there
And You never left me, no You never left me
You never never never, no You never left me",98,2000

Like a wayward son
I get a little lost sometimes
I come undone
Though I know what I believe
Still I find a way to leave and run

I start climbing mountains
To stand so tall
Thinking I belong there
Above it all
And my pride gets the best of me
I stumble on reality and fall
And when I fall

[Chorus:]
Let me fall
Into the arms of Jesus
Let me come into His kingdom
And kneel at His cross
When I stand beneath His mercy
I will give up my all
Let me fall into the arms of Jesus

When I've been broken
And stripped away
Of these things I hold on to
That just decay
That's when I find my resting place
I find out how amazing grace can be
So break my heart
Set me free

Then He stepped out and left his glorious throne
To establish heaven's kingdom

To follow, and to take up His cross
And to go before all nations
As God's living incarnation

Clay Crosse,"What would you do for a king
If He won all the battles He went out to fight
And returned as a hero on a starlit night to a cheering crowd?
Would it make you proud?

What would you do for a king
If He kept every promise that He'd ever made
Would you get out the tickertape and lead a parade, a society ball?
Would you care at all?

Kings always seemed to me as such grand, imposing men
So full of stature, full of power
So much authority in every word they say
I never thought I was quite the type
But Iíd still love to meet one someday

What would you do for a king
If He came to your door, would you ask Him in
Would you tell Him how much you admired Him
Do you think you'd dare
Would you be too scared?
Most kings don't seem to know much about the common man
So far removed and set apart
I cheer with thousands, we blend into a roar
Another face in an endless crowd
Is that all I really am, just one more?

So what would you do for a king
If He saw you fishing out by the sea
And He walked up to you and said ""Follow me - it's time you know""
Do you think you'd go?

And what would you do for a king
If He took off his crown and agreed to die
And as you tried to understand it, He looked you in the eye and said,
""This is for you""

Well, what would you do?

Moi qui criait famine
Et toi qui posais nue

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire, On est heureux
La bohème, la bohème
Nous ne mangions qu'un jour sur deux

Dans les cafés voisins
Nous étions quelques-uns
Qui attendions la gloire
Et bien que miséreux
Avec le ventre creux
Nous ne cessions d'y croire
Et quand quelque bistro
Contre un bon repas chaud
Nous prenait une toile
Nous récitions des vers
Groupés autour do poêle
En oubliant l'hiver

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire : Tu es jolie
La bohème, la bohème
Et nous avions tous do génie

Souvent il m'arrivait
Devant mon chevalet
De passer des nuits blanches
Retouchant le dessin
De la ligne d'un sein
do galbe d'une hanche
Et ce n'est qu'au matin
Qu'on s'asseyait enfin
Devant un café-crème
Épuisés mais ravis
Fallait-il que l'on s'aime
Et qu'on aime la vie

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire, on a vingt ans
La bohème, la bohème
Et nous vivions de l'air do temps

Quand au hasard des jours
Je m'en vais faire un tour
À mon ancienne adresse
Je ne reconnais plus
Ni les murs, ni les rues
Qui ont vu ma jeunesse
En haut d'un escalier
Je cherche l'atelier
Dont plus rien ne subsiste
Dans son nouveau décor
Montmartre semble triste
Et les lilas sont morts

La bohème, la bohème
On était jeunes, on était fous
La bohème, la bohème
Ça ne veut plus rien dire do tout",La  Bohème,2009
Clay Jenkins Ensemble,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2004
Clay Mac,"Yeah! I'm here nigga, Banks!!! G-G-G-G-G-G Unit!!!

[Chorus]
Now don't try to stand next to me (Right)
'Cause I'm the nigga they came here to see (Right)
Ain't nothin round here for free (Right)
And I'm here to let these motherfuckers know
That I'll do anything for the dough (Right)
A felony walkin out the front do' (Right)
Ain't a motherfucker I gotta change fo' (Right)
Therefore I'm a be this way until I go

Yeah! Guess who walk around with diamond chains and rings on 'em
A pair of throwback Jordan's, with the wings on 'em
With all this talking I'm guessin they got them things on 'em
Cause if not Milli's the Forty Cal's a ring on 'em
I know your kind gettin by leave the city quick
Niggaz bleed just like us I'm on that Biggie shit
First of all I'm sup-posed to ball
I'm sup-posed to have coast to, coast to calls
And your niggaz on your cd's garbage
Yeah they shootin but they missin, sprayin up the wall like graffiti artist
Some niggaz by the bootleg but go and cop the real shit
'Cause the fans love us I'm nicer than grandmothers
I wake up get dressed put on my tan butters
It been this way since Puma's and Super Man cover's
A ice pick could do your liver harm
And have you screamin in the back of the club louder than Lil' Jon

[Chorus]

You now lookin at the hood meal ticket seven thou on my wrist
It's kinda hard to keep the balance with this
It keeps the challengers pissed
I vacate to different islands and twist
And back home where the violence exist, now silencers fixed
You buy mileage as gifts as well as man's best friend
And I don't own no rottweillers and pits
It's getting extremely hard for the man to roam
With little kids putting this picture on the camera phone
Shit change now that the cameras on
A bitch will jeopardize the marriage to fuck you when they man is gone
These niggaz ramblin on about the paper that they getting stop it
I got more money than you in my little pocket
Yeah I'm stingy so it's stretch long
With G-Unit sweats on thread needle to Teflon
Des'Eagle and vest on, cause everybody ain't enthused
That's your name's around about good news, FUCK YOU!!!

[Chorus]

Yeah! Yeah!",Bang,2006
Clay Matthewman,"We were waiting for the bus
No-one much around but us
Then I see this young boy cut a look at me

I'm stunned
In a daze
He had the whole street set ablaze
It's only love they say
Makes you feel this way
She liked his eyes she wanted more
The baby gonna have your smile for sure

He saw a lovely girl
Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
She saw him looking acted like she didn't care

That's how we knew
And so love grew a flower
A flower that is you

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Even to the angels it may sound like a lie

For you child
He has the troops and extra backup standing by
For you child
For you he's the best he can be
For you child
For you he's the best he can be
Oh child don't you know

It' only love, love, love, love
Can make you feel this way

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Yeah daddy love you child

Your daddy knows you're a flame

Wanna laugh like a loon

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

And I hope the time can heal my heart
Heal my broken heart

'Cause I loved you and I was true
You know I've been carrying a failure's cross
I did everything to win your heart
But you never loved me at all
I was just your friend that's all

And they say, time heals all wounds
And I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart

And what of the nights
When you looked in my eyes
And you told me, you loved me?

You made me feel in my heart
It was real not a spark
But a flame burning inside
Who can put out this fire inside?

Time heals all wounds
And I guess you made up your mind, baby

And I hope the time can heal

And I hope the time can heal my heart

Clay People,"Pack it up, pack it in
Let me begin
I came to win
Battle me that's a sin
I won't tear the sack up
Punk you'd better back up
Try and play the role and the whole crew will act up
Get up, stand up, come on!
Come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling jump across the ceiling
Muggs is a funk fest, someone's talking junk
Yo, I'll bust em in the eye
And then I'll take the punks home
Feel it, funk it
Amps it are junking
And I got more rhymes than there's cops that are dunking
Donuts shop
Sure 'nuff I got props from the kids on the Hill
Plus my mom and my pops

I'll serve your ass like John MacEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe
Word to your moms I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the bible's got psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics and you ain't got none
So if you come to battle bring a shotgun
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel to the death
Try and step to me you'll take your last breath
I gots the skill, come get your fill
Cause when I shoot ta give, I shoot to kill

I never eat a pig cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a terminator
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try'n to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics homie I'll wet ya

To steal the essence of your life

You bleed inside

Paralyzing you
You're frozen in this cat's eye view
Stealing babies breath

In that demon's lair
Waiting for some sign

Clay Toyani,"I know you're the wayward kind
The way you always drag behind
Show me a horse and I'll feed it hay
Show me the cart and I'll throw it away
Prettiest face I've ever seen
It looked like something in a magazine
To a blind man it's plain to see
That I need you and you need me

I've got cold feet, it's a-crazy chasin'
When things get serious, time is a-wastin'
I'd cross my fingers but they don't seem to meet
There's no need to tell me that I've got cold feet, a-ha-ha

Took me home to tell your dad
That you were the best girl I've ever had
I stayed for dinner, I couldn't refuse
I spilt the tea and I ate the news
Ah, you must think you're really neat
Got me tied down to my seat
I can't move, it's hard to think
With cramp in my eyelids and I can't blink

Well, I've got cold feet, it's a-crazy chasin'
Things get serious, time is a-wastin'

Clay Toyani,"Everybody came to nobody's wedding
Everybody knew it was bound to be a hoot
What can you do when nothing else is cooking
Make your own amusement, bring a pile of loot

There was Alice the butcher, Tidy and Gunn
Who couldn't see where they were heading
It was sixteen days and sixteen nights,
And it weren't even nobody's wedding

What a great reception, all the people cried
Who stole the groom and who stole the bride
How did the countess slide underneath the door
Why is the wild boy chopping up the floor?

There was Alice the butcher, Tidy and Gunn
Who couldn't see where they were heading
It was sixteen days and sixteen nights,
And it weren't even nobody's wedding

Clay Toyani,"I'm Darby the tinker and my brother is Tam
We go where the work is, my boys, and we work where we can
With the mending and fixing, it's together we stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
We come to your cities and we call on your wives
We'll fix up your kettles, please dear missus, we'll sharpen your knives
And we always agreed that together we'd stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
At times they grew scanty and the money grew thin
We worked for a song but the money it didn't come in
Now brothers are kindred but hard times betray
And so we stumbled apart on the old changing way
We never agreed to divide our tin
And when you're out of love with your brother, your hard times begin
For the spikes and the brothels, they're shameful to see
But don't you travel alone, boys, this warning you take from me
You must share with your nearest till the end of your days
Or else it's forever you're on the old changing way
",The Old Changing Way,1972
Clay Toyani,"It's a grey, grey morning, the rain it do fall
I'm feeling hungry and low
My bed's so empty, how I wish I could call
On the painted ladies I know
When you've got no credit, don't hold no sway
With the painted ladies I know
It's a ''thank you for nothing, we'll see you someday''
The painted ladies I know

Leave at home what you value enough
And laugh all your senses away
When you want to love everyone, how can you love
The painted ladies all say
Those film stars and beauties will please you tonight
If you go to bed with a book
But they can't hold a candle to something that trembles
If you need to do more than look

They come from rich fathers and twinkle their eyes
And you're begging them please not to go
When you're starved for some loving, they can make you feel special
The painted ladies I know
If you're seeking fortune, if you're seeking fame
And you're looking yourself in the eye
And God help the children, playing their game
The end of the game is goodbye

They pass through your vision like thoughts in a dream
Your good times are slipping away
It's time to move on or go down with the ship

Clay Toyani,"Was there ever a winter so cold and so sad
The river too weary to flood
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

I was looking for trouble to tangle my line
But trouble came looking for me
I knew I was standing on treacherous ground
I was sinking too fast to run free

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

I would not be asking, I would not be seen
A-beggin' on mountain or hill
But I'm ready and blind with my hands tied behind
I've neither a mind nor a will

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

It's bitter the need of the poor ditching boy
He'll always believe what they say
They tell him it's hard to be honest and true
Does he mind if he doesn't get paid?

Begging somebody to change
And the other half prayin' to God
That they never would

And all it got me was twice as lost
When it all turned out the same
But all that beggin' finally did somebody good

I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on

Gunna do my dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
End the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open

Every time the world moved on
I fell a little further behind
From runnin' back or followin someone home

Until I learned that one step forward
Will take you further on
Than a thousand back or a million that ain't
Your own

Of a day that was gone

Me and Bobby watched the clock all afternoon
Waitin' for the bell and Mrs. Greer
To say, ""Have a good summer, see you next year""

That night I couldn't sleep 'cause the very next day
They started up the summertime matinees
With a different movie every afternoon

We drove Daytona and we won the race
We shot a lotta bull and some bad guys too

From a couple of quarters to a couple of bucks

We even saw a couple on the movie screen
John Wayne won the lady and I did too

Is a second hand store called 'Nothin' New'

With Betty on the couch sittin' next to me
We still hold hands like we used to do

Way down in Louisiana where the moss and cypress grew

In the back of the black bayou
Some folks called him crazy but I knew better than that
He kept a hundred dollar bill tucked away in the brim
Of his dirty old cowboy hat

Jack told me a story when I was ten years
He said there was once a fool tried to swim this swamp
With his back weighted down with gold

When your daddy said, ?Son do you love her
With all of your might?
I looked him in the eye and said, ?Yessir
I'd say that's right?

I'd say that's right on the money
Sure as the summer in Florida's sunny
I'd say that's right down the middle
Ain't no doubt, not even a little
Will I love you for the rest of my life
I'd say that's right

If I woke up tomorrow up in heaven
Saint Peter looked me in the eye
And said, ?Mister, would you rather be with her?
I'd say that's right

You and me and Mother Goose
Learning lines to nursery rhymes

Three, four, shut the door
Five, Six, pick up sticks

College days, miles apart
So afraid you'd forget
Writing letters every day
And evading every one like this

One, two, I miss you
Three, four, I walk the floor
Five, six, come back quick
I don't wanna miss you no more

Playing on a swing in the yard
As we watch, I hold your hand
You're still holding onto my heart

One, two, I love you
Three, four, let's have one more
Five, six, I wouldn't miss

I knew just where i stood

To ever feel so good

How she was gettin' over just one more sad affair
And as I waited for my change, you know it hit me then and there

That ordinary people have extraordinary love
A million little miracles far beneath the stars above
The greatest gift that I could ever wish for you and me
Is a life as ordinary as can be

Five long years together; it was Hollywood history
Now my grandma and grandpa never made no printed page

That they wish somehow, someway they were a little more like us

In his beat-up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down
Her Mercedes had a flat

He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Til he said 'I'm here to help you, ma'm
By the way, my name's Joe'

She said 'I'm from St. Louis
And I'm only passing through
I must've seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you'

When he changed the tire
And closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said 'How much do I owe you?'
Here's what he had to say

'You don't owe me a thing

Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do

Well, a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way

But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
She must have been eight months
Along and dead on her feet

No, she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her
Change from a hundred dollar bill

The lady slipped right out the door
And on a nakpin left a note
There were tears in the waitress' eyes
When she read what she'd wrote

I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do

That night when she got
Home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking about the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low

With the corn cup hat and button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

How he came to life one day
 
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance all around
 
Oh frosty the snowman
Was as alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said ""let's run and have some fun
Before i melt away""
 
Down to the village
With the broom-stick in his hand
Running here and there all around that square
Saying ""catch me if you can""

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him howler ""stop""

I'll be back again someday""

All decked out and made up for TV,
Askin' for some money from God's people:
Talking all that high theology. 

Well, I might be just an old blue collar:
There's things about the Lord that I don't know.
But I bet he never had a million dollars,
Or wore a lot of stylish fancy clothes. 

'Cause Jesus was a country boy,
Walkin' down a dirt road, with everything that he owned,
He never met a stranger.
Born in a barn underneath the stars,
His Mama laid him in a manger.
Swimmin' in the river, fishin' for his dinner,
Livin' with the sinners like me.
Makes me think, Jesus was a country boy. 

My Daddy never cared much for religion,
And my Mama worried a lot about his soul.
She'd hit her knees and pray for him on Sunday,
While Daddy hit his favorite fishin' hole. 

You see, Daddy was a rebel and a rambler,
But I always knew he loved my Mama so.
An' I never doubted he'd make it to Heaven,
'Cause it ain't who you are, it's who you know. 

An' Daddy knew: that Jesus was a country boy,
Walkin' down a dirt road, with everything that he owned,

I found me in the closet
Ready or not, I stumbled on

Sittin' on a Harley

Right above her halo

She runs and hides and still denies
That hip-high rose tattoo
She burned that box of forget-me-nots
When she found out we knew...

Clay Walker,"Twenty four C don't believe in God
But he always prays when the thing takes off
And the grandma that he's next to watches the window
Three B's got her headphones on
She's still not used to her daddy being gone
She gets to see him every three months for the weekend
Just people in planes

Seventeen A's in an exit row
Waiting for his Jack and Coke to show
Just wishing he didn't settle so fast in college
I'm over here in a middle seat
Watching the world, but half asleep
Wondering why there's never movies on the ones I'm on

And it occurs to me
Maybe I've got too much time to think
But it helps to be reminded how we're

Just people in planes, when it comes down to it
We're side by side on the same ride
There's not a whole lot of difference
At the end of the day,
We just want to know it's going to be okay
Counting on somebody we can't see to land this thing
We're just people in planes

Hey, do you remember back when
Your dad could still lift you then
He'd pick you up, and you'd think that you were flying
You'd spread your arms and start to land
Do you remember how to laugh like that
Why does that baby feel like crying

She's never met and will never see again
Has been weighing for a long time on her conscience

Honeymoon lovers and several in the back there looking hung over
Must be coming back from Mexico...or Vegas

D'une voix que seul ton cœur puisse entendre 

Teinte de printemps tous les coins d'ombre de mes jours 
Prenons le temps de goûter le miel de l'amour 
Depuis longtemps mon cœur qui semblait endormi 
Comme la belle au bois dormant a su attendre 

Viens, fais-moi rêver, fais courir un vent de folie 
Dans mes pensées je veux connaître l’embellie 
D'un bonheur au-dessus de tout 
D'un amour tendre, un amour fou
Au nom de nous 
Fais-moi rêver!

Viens, fais-moi rêver, illumine mes nuits d’espoir 
Viens murmurer à mon oreille dans le noir 
Des mots me parlant d’éternel
Ouvre-moi les portes du ciel 
Tu vois, je ne demande pas grand-chose 

Viens, fais-moi rêver, je veux me couler dans tes bras 
Et m'ondoyer aux sources chaudes de ta voix 
Avec tes phrases et tes mots
Lave mon cœur de tous ses maux 
Semant le grain de la métamorphose 

Ta main dans ma main, je veux connaître la passion 
Et ces chemins qui se perdent à l’horizon 
De mon destin en quête d’une déraison 
Que mon amour à ton amour propose 

Viens, fais-moi rêver, chassant mes doutes et mes peurs 
Fais-moi chanter, j’ai connu si peu le bonheur 
Et si peu rêvé avant toi
Rêve de moi, d’autres émois 
Et dans tes bras 
Fais-moi rêver!",Viens Fais-Moi Rêver,2009
Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra,"Voilà que ça recommence
Voilà que ça me reprend
La vie me fait des avances
L'espoir m'ouvre des printemps
Voilà que je me démène
Me passionne pour des riens
L'aventure a pris les rênes
Pour me montrer le chemin
Mon coeur s'emballe et puis s'affole
Ma raison s'envole
Et je pars comme lorsque j'avais vingt ans
Chaque nuit je rêve à ma chance
Chaque jour j'y pense
On a mis le feu aux poudres de mon sang
Voilà, voilà tout ce métamorphose
Et je me sent fébrile et impatient
Je vibre, je ris, j'explose
Et vis plus intensément
Voilà que ça recommence
Voilà que ça me reprend

Je suis dans mes jours de chance
L'amour me guette au tournant
Voilà que je ri aux anges
Prêt à faire des folies
Car j'ai des idées étranges
Qui me traversent l'esprit
Un jupon passe et je m'apprête
A perdre la tête
Soudain mon coeur en moi frappe à double tour
Et mes rêves qui vagabondent
Bâtissent un monde
Où tout n'est fait que d'aventures et d'amours
Voilà, voilà qu'enfin tout se déchaîne
Que l'horizon ce colore de joie
Et la vie refait des siennes
Voilà l'amour est en moi",Voilà Que Ça Recommence,2009

You saw me and fell in love, too
You and me, we fell in love
With each other last night
I told you that I was concerned
You told me of your concerns, too
Yet and still we both decided
To make love last night
Baby, please tell me

Where do we go from here my love
What are we doing baby
Boy you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want
I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together
Is what we choose
Oh my love
I think that we should talk
About us

Could this be a crazy dream
And if so then you're dreaming too
'Cause I know for sure that
You feel the same as I do
Could it be that we could be wrong
Even though we're feeling so right
I don't care because I know
That I want you tonight
And I know you want me too

Waited all my life
Just to be with someone like you

I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

A great man and the child in you
Enough when I take you far from here
Enough to cut a morning view

Strange how a sound could change your feelings
Staring wide and dirty breathing
I remember how a calling came in
Scared of deceiving and all I could hear was ""Run!""

I don't know, skip a beat!

I don't know, skip a beat
Why must I say it when I hate to speak
I said, I don't know, skip a beat
'Cause my wife to dance got to their feet
I said I don't know, skip a beat
Wanna be a social but I hate to creep
I said, I don't know, skip a beat
Scared of heights but I got to leap
I said I don't know, skip a beat

No clothes, I'm far from far
If I won't try, I won't go
I'll never leave, I won't go
Can't believe it, I won't go!
No, not far!

Move your left, move your right
I kept it in my head and I kept trying to fight
I said, mhm move your left, move your right
Come a little closer if you like the limelight!
I said mhm move your left, move your right!
I want to surround and keep your here in my sight
I said move your left, move your right
Getting abuse 'cause everyone's taking all their time
They chase and flex the beat, it's on my mind
Moves like that aren't cool, or even crime
Now they one-handed, won't land it
Won't stand it, Clean Bandit

Here's a touch, ?
Relax the tempo, sips some movato
And if I get too animato
Tan my face with that ?
Aliente, mezzoforte, allegro or andante
I can make this voice
Staccato ?
I don't know, skip a beat, we're rushing now, we feel the heat
The doors are open, but the ?
Is this the place, is the final round!
Cruising at the speed ?
Watching the beat, we'll get to Vienna
Without a doubt the strings are fine, the bass is out
Give us a beat, you wrote the ?

Couple of skip beats, a couple of movements out
Now we made it to Mozart's house!

You bring me Sun, sun, sun Sun-shine
You bring me Sun, sun, sun Sun-shine

So before the nights over
I want you to know that
I'm willing to change my ways

You bring me Sun, sun, sun Sun-shine

Come over, Come over
Come over, come Come over
Come over, Come over
Come over, come come over

I guess you're gonna run out luck love,
Sooner or later
You better make time to sit down
And put pen to paper oh-oh-oh
Because the things you want to do will slip away from you
It won't be long now
So just keep on being strong now

About you

Me hear them saying 'l'm sorry girl'
And both times no one feels to stay the night over
Nineteen days pass since I last see the girl
Be at the bedroom over
Got no fight over

Regular she cuss me
Tell her friends, then mos, how she no trusts me
Well if I saw you down from here, let me pay
Since the last three months
You know you want me

Clean Bandit,"Imagine if the life that you thought you shared
Wasn't really there
It was made up in your mind,
Could be anyone, anywhere

'Cause you'd been living in a world of your own design, undermined,
In another place other space in time

As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear,
It may get harder 'cause you just restarted
And wherever you are, land on another star!
It may get harder 'cause you just restarted

You better get real, real, real and
Realize that the situation's going nowhere
Because you act so tough I've totally lost control
So please try to understand that if I could
I'd call and I would be there
And if it didn't hurt so much you know I'd give you it all

Imagine if the hope that you thought you knew
Wasn't really true!
It just existed in your head
The reflection used wasn't you,

Completely unaware could be anywhere, any time,
'Cause there was shift in the paradigm

As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear,
It may get harder 'cause you just restarted
And wherever you are, land on another star!

You came in deep, I'm hijacked, it's a holdup
I'm on the Ritz and we spinning every time we touch
My head is gone and I think and think about you much
I've never been the type of girl to dream about
Sugary things and I don't believe in fairy tales
But now to me it's like your love is oxygen

So hear me when I say this, boy I tell you true, I ain't easy
There's something about you just make me so crazy

I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire (Fire)
Every single thing you do just set my heart on fire
I struggle to breathe, I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire (Fire)
Start it again, I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire

All about the feeling, it's off, and I'm ahead in this
It's a chemistry, I'm so jacked up on your medicine
This thing is next, I'm so in, I'll take it any chance, no
Boy, you got me freaking, I never thought I'd be like this
When you go, I'm tweaking and pining for another fix
Told you before, your love is my oxygen

So hear me when I say this, boy I tell you true, I ain't easy
There's something about you just makes me so crazy

Clean Bandit,"In the quiet of my room
I gather up my thoughts and questions
Could I ever be like you?
Could I ever be a person, so real and so true?
It seems implausible
I look at my reflection
If only I could say
The things I never mention
The things you never knew

And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes

Once upon a time there was a girl who so much loved the world
She gave her only begotten sunshine
And dried her stained eyes on a neck tie
Took the best lies made 'em truths
And spit sad soliloquies in the booth
'Cause people think they know but they barely knew
The reality of what the other-siders do
But I've been there, I've learned that
Seen a whole bunch of world and done came back
Got a reckoning for wrecking in my knapsack
'Bout to journey on foot through the outback
GRRRL PRTY is the label on my snapback
Doin' worldwide shows in a black hat
'Bout to tell your ass a story so take that
Free prophecies from a black cat

Seen his demise with a pair of brand new eyes
It was sickening, guy
Never wanted to be stickin' it to thickening thighs
But now he deeper than the secrets that he keep with a lie
""Mm, tastes good!"" baby say with a cry
Now wait
Thinkin' about it too much, too much
Deepen the profit sooner, sooner
He never wanted to be a loser
But the bruises of losing is oozing through his fingers
The tips that like to brush at my hips
Is now at the hilt of a sword, Lord
On the battlefield, torn, sworn
To never think about another lover
Hopin' he had time to recover but nothing's ever easy
Beware the sting of queen bee (Grr!)

And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes

So many things in he I would like to be
Wiser, more light on my feet
I could look up in the mirror and change me
Or right over my shoulder and save me
Thinkin' about back, back when, when I ain't have nothing
Not a thing or a ring to my name
Now my feet in the game, knee deep, don't speak
Feelin' like Gwen Stefani in this thing
But I can't complain 'cause we asked for this
Feelin' like a workaholic or a masochist
Don't call like I should like it's sacrilege
To make a dollar in a dream into packed venues
Take a second, put your shield down
Laying down my sword, getting off the battlefield now
Makin' bigger moves, bigger pictures in my view now
Get up out of my way I've got ammo for days, pow!

I can feel the weight of wars you've lost
They're victories in my eyes
Every swing you take brings me closer and closer
Open the gates and I'm poised to charge
You told me we'd never get this far
Now we at the final round
There's no way we'll escape battle scars
Battle scars

And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And I still can hear your big old belly growl""
So I steamed up a fresh heap of broccoli for you
You've got calories to burn and some pounds to lose

Well you can bring that broccoli with squirrel and dumplings
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin' for nuthin'

She said ""I've cooked non-stop in this house for weeks
Time to get your big butt up on somewhere's else to eat""
So I've been down to Shoney's four times today
I hit the Sizzler and the Quincy's they were on the way

I 'bout blowed out my colon from buffet jumpin
Cause Cledus don't stop a-eatin' for nuthin'

If you like love handles and big old buns
I've pounds of passion and tons of fun
I look like Flabio in my king-cab truck
To look like Brooks and Dunn I need a tummy tuck

We got to find a little place where I can eat some more
Before I start rollin' on this hardwood floor
Heck down to Hooters break out the wings
Then make a run down to the border I'm an eatin' machine

Fire up the stove and keep the fat clams comin
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin for nuthin'
If it's all you can eat then you'll see me runnin
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin for nuthin'
Tell Richard Simmons he can kiss my (bump-kin ???)

I could get back at my ex-wife,
With the touch of a button, I could ruin her life.

So I got the number off her Mastercard,
I bought a new lift kit and four new tires.
Then, I got on line to her bank account,
Went ahead and closed that sucker out.

Now the moral of the story, as a matter of fact,
In a couple of days I got my TV back.
She said she'd like to come back, as well.
I told her to go straight to AOL.

For droppin' that box at Cledus' address.

HANKENSTEIN

Midnight in Montgomery
Full moon shining on a shack
Where a country music legend is about to be brought back
Cledus got the idea from the late night creature feature
And figured he would foller a similar procedure

HANKENSTEIN

Now laid out on the table is the body of a man
In a white suit
Cowboy boots
And a guitar in his hand

He's hooked up to a tractor with a set of jumper cables
And if anything could start a cold cold heart a John Deere should be able.

HANKENSTEIN

Now what's about to happen here is nothin' less than shockin
With a record player in the corner blaring Hey Good Lookin'
That foot began to tap along with that old 45
And you can hear old Cledus yelling UH OH ITS ALIVE!!!!!

CHORUS:
HANKENSTEIN
He's a honky-tonkin monster
HANKENSTEIN
He's a honky-tonkin monster
HANKENSTEIN
He's a honky-tonkin monster

In no time Hankenstein was mo-anin' the blues
And Cledus has decided it's time to spread the news
They'll hit the road and put on shows all over the nation
Yeah, he's gonna be the next country music sensation

HANKENSTEIN

Everyone still loves to hear the tale of old Kawliga
And they all sing and dance when he cuts loose on Jambalaya
Playing on the Opry stage was his final test
Now Hankenstein has become a monster success

CHORUS

Lovesick in a hotel near the Mason Dixon Line
Hankenstein is sitting there so lonesome he could cry
He's had it with the life he leads singing all them tunes
Now he's out there somewhere honky tonkin howlin at the moon

Better go and buy her some of Deana Carter's wine

Cledus T. Judd,"I was staring a hole through CMT
Watchin' everybody else who'd been waitin' for me
I thought by now I'd been a household name
After all I had, if Shania was mine
And though ""Bigger Than the Beatles"" got played all the time
Them funny videos why there's my claim to fame

Now all of a sudden there's a slew of comedians
Foxworthy, Bill Engvall and back comes Ray Stevens
Folks right there's some real competition
I started getting a little bit paranoid
Heck if this keeps up, I'll be unemployed
Then out of the blue it came to me in a vision

Now I'm the psychic to the stars
They call me up from wherever they are
I'm always over-booked
Lord my phone rings off the hook
I'm the psychic to the stars

Ha ha
I told Tim and Faith they ought to tie the knot
Why you think Deana Carter's so hot
Boy I'd shave my legs for a sip of that Strawberry Wine
When Mindy McCready's on my caller ID
I'd take her call immediately
Ten Thousand Angels couldn't get me off of that line
Garth Brooks called dang near a hundred times
But I was too busy consultin' Leann Rimes
Trying to predict the number of albums she sold last night

I had Brooks & Dunn on a conference call
They said ""Cledus would you look into your crystal ball""
I said ""I'd love to boys, but I got Tanya Tucker on hold,
Gotta go.""

Now I got a new career and I charge a hefty fee
Why it worked for Dionne Warwick now it works for Cledus T.
Call me

Now I'm the psychic to the stars

I've got a clairvoyant sense
For a feller that's so dense
I'm the psychic to the stars
Just call the psychic to the stars",Psychic to the Stars,1998
Cledus T. Judd,"Don't tell her what it's worth, third rock from her thumb

Well, he walks in the pawn shop, one thing on his mind
Wants to buy a diamond but he doesn't have a dime
He finds the one he likes and they cut him quite a deal
A two carat solitaire but neither one's real

Picks up the pay phone, puts it to his ear
Calls his chick, collect and says, ""Get over here""

When he shows his girlfriend, she can't believe her eyes
She never thought she'd ever really get one that size
He tries to think of somethin' when she asked him ""where'd you get it?""
Down at diffie's pawn but he never will admit it

He tries to change the subject, ""Forget the wedding list
Let's head on out to Vegas and get it over with""

Flaws and defects, no billing ads
Hope she never finds out how much he spent
Nothin' else shines like a zirconia
Don't tell her what it's worth, third rock from her thumb

Just outside of Vegas, the truck gets a flat
She says, ""We woulda made it if you weren't so doggone fat""
They try to hitch a ride from some hippies in a van
To a ratty little motel called 'The S and M grand'

Puts on her little nightie, gives him a little wink
Ring slips off her finger, down the bathroom sink

She starts to call a plumber, he begins to shout
""Give me a coat-hangar, I think I can get it out""
Fishes out the ring in a big ball of hair
Slips it on her finger as he pats her derriere

Thinkin' to himself, ""It's a lucky thing
A plumber woulda cost me much more than that ring""

Hope she never finds out how much he spent
Nothin' else shines like a zirconia

Maybe she'll look like Terry Clark or Faith Hill or somebody. 
Hm, hope this ain't a party line.

Thought I'd have a late night snack
So I headed to the kitchen on a commercial break
When sup'm called me back

It was the sexiest voice that I'd ever heard
Comin' out of my television set
Said, ""Call now, you can hear me live
And I'll tell ya 'bout my naughtiness.""

So without hesitation or further ado
I grabbed a hold of my Visa
And dialed the number flashin' on my screen

And on the second ring
She whispered, ""Hello. This is Sheila.

I said, ""How much will it cost
For this here trip to paradise?""
She said, ""You can't put a price on love""

She had me chewin' on the receiver

Like a man possessed I dialed her number
Mornin' noon and night
And slowly but surely we fell in love
As my phone bill shot out of sight

After so many costly heart to hearts
I just had to meet her face to face
She wouldn't give me her home address
So I had her number traced. He-he.

Well, I thought it'd lead to a passion palace
Some penthouse in the sky
And, I must admit I was a little let down
When I found her in a double wide
A double wide?

That beauty that I envisioned
That goddess that drove me crazy
Answered the door with a cigar in her mouth
And weighin' in at over two eighty. He-he-ho!

They say love conquers all, well I reckon it's true
Even when it's for a fee
We said I do, and now were one
Though she makes two of me

And she talks to me no charge
Every time she takes a breather

Cledus T. Judd,"Cledus went down to Florida, he was lookin for a car to steal.
He was in a bind, ten payments behind so the bank repoed his wheels.
When he came across this old man down at Jalopy's Used Car lot.
Then Cledus jumped up on the top of one and said:
""Fella, let me tell you what.""

""I'm not gonna be proud of the deed I'm 'bout to do.
""With no time to spare, I gotta be somewhere, 
""So I'm gonna steal a car from you.
""Now I've seen your selection here and I admit the pickin's are few.
""I know the Pinto's gold but consider it stoled,
""''cause I got a show to do. "" 
The man said: 'My name's Jalopy,"" as he gave an evil grin.
''cause he knew that car wouldn't get too far 'fore the motor blew up again. 

Cledus, you better hit the road if you're gonna be a star. 
The show's way up in Georgia and you're opening up for Garth. 
Your future's riding on this shiny Pinto painted gold.
And if you're late, it's Jeff Foxworthy's show. 

Oh, gosh a Pinto, my foot. It drives more like a horse and buggy. Durn. 
Cledus said: ""No way in heck you're gonna open up that show.""
Then fire flew from the manifold as his right front tyre blowed.
And he pushed that wreck across the street and man was Cledus tissed.
And he tried and tried to start her up but it sounded something like this.
Come on. Come on. 
Oh Gawd, I'm in a mess what am I gonna do.
My one big shot for Garth Brooks .
Oh durn it. 

When Cledus opened up the hood he said: 'I'll be a son of a gun'.
And didn't long to figure out why the heck it wouldn't run. 

Fire from the engine, lots of smoke.
He can already hear them redneck jokes.
Dead blamed oil pan laying in the road.
Will he make the show, heck no, heck no.
Whoa oh.

Taxi! Greyhound! Yellow cab! Somebody!
I'll show him a redneck.
He'll have a redneck when I get my hands around his throat.
I'm sick of it.

Cledus shook his head as he watched Foxworthy's show.
And he heard him joke of how he passed a burning gold Pinto.
Then later on, Garth told Cledus: ""you'll never get the chance again,""
As he gave the check to that durned redneck who drove a Mercedes Benz.
He said: ""Tough break, big guy.
""Before I go would you like to hear another redneck joke'
""Did you know I got my own TV show'""
Well, does anybody watch it' (No, heck, no.)

Well, you might be a redneck if your mom and daddy cathes you out behind the barn.

Eatin' all of my bear claws
While he's watchin' ol' hee-haws
And drinkin' all my wine

I'm gonna scalp her maw-maw
Making long distance phone calls
To her friends in Arkansas
Talkin' on my dime

They're drivin' me up the dang wall
Using all of my dental floss
And leave the room smelling bad

They moved into my wigwam

They order filet mignons
And stick me with the tab

They're hanging 'round my teepee
Can't wear my Buffalo briefs
Ain't had me no whoopee

Seven days a week

Chain-smoking them Pell Mells
Wish they'd get them a motel

I'll take a pipe and pop his knee
Like Tanya did Nancy
They're skating on thin ice

I'll take my bow and arrow
Pretend I'm shootin' at a sparrow
I might miss and uhh oh
Hit her maw-maw's behind

Might be kin to Tim McGraw

Might have to leave my wife

Came to visit me and my squaw

Four little, five little, six little Indians
Seven little, eight little, nine little Indians
Ten little Indian in-laws

She's so squeezable

Most folks think I'm full of baloney
I'm never lonely

Never thought I could buy someone not

Flammable
Air brain-able
Recycle-able
No I ain't full of bull
Didn't need a down payment on that pretty little plastic thing

It made my mama cry
When we ran off one night
And caught a Vegas flight
And I made her mom whine

She blew her mouth still when I gave her a ring

My flexible

Yeah inflatable

(Oh Dang lady you give a new definition of taking a man's breath away)

Makes me feel so proud that I'm her feller
I'd never sell her
People get your mind out of the gu-gu-gu-gutter

She's blonde-head-able
Re-head-able
Brunet-able
Interchange-able

Cledus T. Judd,"Be vewy vewy qwiet…we are huntin' somethin')

Me and Harold Muffert were outdoors men
Set in our backwoods ways
Both members of the huntin' club
Both active in the NRA
(National Redneck Association)

We scouted a location where we had no doubt
We'd kill the biggest buck in the world
(About a 34-pointer)
Harold waited in his tree stand
But all he seen was a squirrel

Dang near two weeks since the season started
And neither one of us was amused
(HA HA HA)
We had on real tree camo, high-powered ammo
But no big game to shoot

Then we finally saw a deer as big as a horse
Harold had him in his crosshairs
(Shoot him!)
But that squirrel jumped off of a branch above us
And landed in Harold's hair
(Dang, get it out! Dang!)

Harold fell off the stand, on his head he landed
Like a wimp he laid there cryin
Till I climbed on down,
Picked him up off the ground
And it didn't take us long to decide,
That squirrel had to die

Goodbye squirrel
With black-eyed peas,
You're gonna taste good to me
Squirrel
It's you or me,
Come on out of that tree
Squirrel
Hey guess what,
You've eaten your last nut
Squirrel

Me and Harold went down to the surplus store
Bought a keg of dynamite
Two baseball bats and a case of M-80s
We were in for one heck of a fight
(We'll show you!)

When you're huntin' with dumb and dumber
Something's surely bound to go wrong
(Now be careful)
And when Harold lit that real short fuse
I knew it wouldn't be long

When the dynamite blew,
Harold's foot did too
And fingers began to fly
(Fly)
We were barely alive
When the game warden arrived
And much to our surprise,
That squirrel didn't die
(Gosh!)

Goodbye squirrel
Just one more shot,
You'll be in my crock pot
Squirrel
You'll make a lunch,
You overgrown chipmunk
Squirrel
I'll skin ya hide,
And make a hat when it's dry
Squirrel

Gimme that, I said gimme that gun
Look out!
Look out, duck!
I think I killed somethin')",Goodbye Squirrel,2000
Cledus T. Judd,"Twas the fight before Christmas
When all through the house
No furniture left standing, no TV or couch
Our aquarium, heck they even knocked over my Chia Pet
MeMaw was flung 'cross the room by her hair
By her sister Ethel who never fought fair

Let's get ready to tumble!!!!!!!

The children all wrestled and jumped off the beds
Dropping elbows and knees on each other's heads
And mamaw with her frying pan and pa with his bat
Cleared half the room in ten seconds flat
The whole brawl began from an innocent matter
When aunt Flo thought Eugene said ""she looks a whole lot fatter""
She knocked him through the window he fell with a crash
Tore down the gutters and busted his leg really bad

You ought to have saw it 
It looked like he'd been in a motorcycle wreck
No kiddin'
Yeah awful I couldn't turn to look at it

you see both sides of our family have never gotten along
And every holiday something always go wrong
You ain't supposed to fight but spread joy in this season
But when they get the nog they just look for a reason
In no time at all everybody joined in
And right there we squared off with our closest of kin
It's a time for givin' said uncle bill
As he gave a black eye to his brother-in-law phil
I heard somebody say ""it's the thought that counts
And right now I'm thinking about knocking your butt out""
Presents and fists flew all over the room
And nana had some fancy moves with the broom
She took out three cousins and knocked down the tree
And I ducked just in time she swung out at me


It's my favorite time of year
Dad always has too much beer
Gets on the roof and hunts reindeer
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily

Tie the antlers on the dog
Save some shine for Santa Claus
From all the in-laws and outlaws
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily


I crawled to the phone lord it seemed like a mile
And called 9-1-1 which we keep on speed dial
In a matter of minutes out the window appeared
Flashing blue lights and the sheriff John Deere
Just then six men burst through the door
Some yelling ""hey it's us"" some ""get on the floor""
A stray punch from grandpa found the sheriff's chin
And just for good measure he clocked him again
It took all 6 cops to get grandpa in cuffs
You know he gets feisty when he runs out of snuff
We all stopped our fighting and cheered grandpa on
Heck I thought he could take them I guess I was wrong
As they dragged him outside he yelled ""I've been framed""
He was kicking and screaming and calling them names

""You (bleep) you (bleep) 
Let me go you (bleep) 
You donut eatin stupid (bleep) son of a (bleep)""

We stood on the porch as did all our neighbras
Who always took interest in our family's behavior
""mind your own business"" we heard grandma shout
And ""we'll take back the presents and then come bail you out""
By now we'd forgotten what we were fighting for
We were battered and bruised but united once more
Then we all joined hands and sang ""violent night""

Violent night

And we heard grandpa exclaim as they drove off out of sight:
""Merry christmas to all...man that was a good fight!!!!""


Deck your neighbor deck the halls
'Tis the season for a brawl
From all of us to all of y'all

I honestly believed that she 
Loved me just for me

I walked out of the courtroom crying
She left with a grin

Cause she got half
And I said ""OW!""
I mean dang
That comes to nearly fifty thou 
Per date
My butt had never been so chafed
Cause she got half

I wondered if I'd remain lonely
Or would I find my one and only
Then the answer to my prayers 
Appeared on my TV
(Call me now)
The cutest little tarot card reader
I knew that I just had to meet her
Then she said it was in the cards
For her to marry me

Oh...wasn't three months later I was in court again
No way she could have predicted
The way it would end

Cause I got half
And she said ""OW!""
Two dollars a minute 
So everyone call right now
Your
Future awaits
And I will be the next Bill Gates

Cledus T. Judd,"Lately I've been thinking about this crazy life I live
All the things that I've been given
And just what I have to give
Oh I may not be a rich man in a lot of people's eyes
But I found the treasure I can share
Inside this heart of mine

[Chorus]
Oh I'd like to be remembered by the smiles on your face
And if troubles come to find you you can always look my way
I will be right there beside you as you travel down life's road
I hope I leave you laughing when the curtains close

I'd like to give you silver around your clouds of gray
Some gold that you can cling to and the memories we made
And if by chance tomorrow Heaven's angels call
And I go on before you to the greatest show of all

[Chorus]

A merry heart would make good medicine the Bible tells us so
That's what I try to bring to you at each and every show

I'd sure like to leave here laughing when the curtains close",Leave You Laughin',2002
Cledus T. Judd,"I got a buddy named Stacy Fay
He's been known to stay up for days
Pulls the shades and locks himself in the house
Sits in his room with his hand on his mouse
His phone's been busy now for over a week
So I dropped by to see what in Sam Hell is going on

And here's what he said to me:
Come on in and let's burn one Cledus
No need to go to the record store
I've got every song that you're looking for
On my PC
And they're all free
Just click and download you some MP3s Presto you can make your own CDs
I'll show you how it's done
Fire up the computer and let's burn one

Before my eyes could not believe my ears
Every song ever sung in the last fifty years
He made me Conway Twitty's greatest hits
And threw in the Flock Of Seagulls for the flock of it
Time sure flies when you're burning one
It was three A. M. when I got home
My wife was mad at me
Till I gave her that CD
With a mix of her favorite songs

And I said
Lemme show ya how to burn one baby
No need to go to the record store
I found every song you're looking for on the PC
Even got me
No you won't ever find me downloading porn
Just Haggard and Jones, Limp Bizkit and Korn
And I could use some Brooks and Dunn
So Fire up the computer and let's burn one

Country jazz rap and pop
A lotta Bocephus and a little Kid Rock
And like Toby says ""Get'chya some
Fire up the computer and let's burn one

I don't know if it's wrong I ain't saying it's right
But I'd sure love to hear some Metallica tonight
And I'm a little low on funds
So fire up the computer and let's burn one

Cledus T. Judd,"Buddy I'm sick of shootin' at clay
Dreaming of opening day, how 'bout you?
Yeah me too
The only thing I want to do is hunt with you
Kill a bird or two go get your gun

Let's shoot dove all day long until all our shells are gone
Shoot five times then reload
Run like heck if the game warden shows
Yeah when the sun comes up let's shoot dove

You know Faith gets mad at me when she thinks I'd rather be
In a field with you sippin' brews, shootin' anythin' that moves
I think my sight's a little off to the right, you can't hit nothing

Let's shoot dove all day long until our eardrums are blown
By tonight one things for sure
Boy our shoulders will be sore
I just can't get enough let's shoot dove

Let's shoot dove all day long until all our shells are gone
Point your gun towards the sky
I want to see them feathers fly
And when the sun comes up I just can't get enough let's shoot dove

Hey do you get one?
Nah do you?
Yeah I think I winged one

Uh yessir do you have Man of Constant Borrow by Cledus T. Judd

No sir somebody's already borrowed it


Constantly borrows everything

I'm the man of constant borrow
There's nothing I can call my own
Some may try to say it's all stolen
I prefer permanently loaned
He's the biggest mooch we ever known

SOLO

My grass mowin
Bot I've got no mower
My neighbor won't let me use his
I can't really say is though I blame him
Kept it three years last time I did

He thought for sure that it was his

I need a ride down to the pawn shop
Lend me the keys to your Corvette
What do you mean you don't trust me
I never not brought it back yet

I don't think I could take that bet
You know dang well (he's gone away)

Well you may have heard of me
Cledus T J-you-double-D
Better known as the reining King of country parody
Coming with a new style
High profile
When I'm on the mike well you know I'll get hog wild
Comedian
Extrodinaire
A fat Eminem with the bleach blonde hair

I know that you think
I've got your chainsaw
You can't find it anywhere
I can't cut no wood
Since way fore winter
I gave it back to you last fair

Check his garage it's probably there

I sure could use a hundred dollars
I'll gladly pay you back Tuesday
I know that's what I said the last time
You can't believe a word I say

He has no plans to (really???) pay

I was eleven when I was signed
I was on the CMA's and
Y'all thought that Vince Gill sang high

Then puberty played a trick on me
A few mustache hairs
A change occurred
My voice matured

My first single did so good
I bought bikes for all my friends at school
A little something for mom and dad
Like an in-ground swimming pool

Look at this pimple
Oh, man it hurts
The sweetest voice you'd ever heard
'Till my voice matured

My voice, my high pitched voice
It just went away
It happens to all boys
It keeps changing every single day

I bet nobody thought
I'd go overnight from soprano to bass
Now all of my hits are too high
For me to sing all the way

I need some help, it sounds absurd
I used to sing just like a girl

It's 6:30! 
Can't that wait till Monday? 
What are you putting up over there a log cabin? 
God I wish he'd move
Yeah

I bought a little house in a west side neighborhood
The girls came over to party life is good
Till Willie moved in next door and he's made my life a wreck
Now the girls are always over at Willie's cause 

Willie's got a big deck
With
A hot tub on it
And the girls really want it
There's a band playing and lots of thong bikinis
There's a barbecue grill in the corner and they're eatin' weenies
Check out the blond on the hot tub ladder
I guess it just goes to show size does matter
Willie's got a big deck

I decided to get some redecoratin' done
I got some plants made sure they were well hung
I thought a long hot tanning bed might do the trick
But all I got was this tan and 

Willie's got a big deck
With
Hot babes on it
And they know how to flaunt it
In those itsy bittsy teeny weeny yellow dental floss bikinis
They're drinking frou frou drinks with umbrellas and they're burning tikis
Check out the twins on the hot tub ladder
I guess it just goes to show size does matter

Cause Willie's got a big deck
Well
If you can't beat 'em might as well join 'em
And that's exactly what I did
Now me and Big Willie and I are the best of friends
And some day I'm gonna be like him

Cause Willie's got a big deck
With
My tanning bed on it
And the girls really want it
The hot tub's bubbling over with thong bikinis
They're funnelin' beer and sippin' martinis
There's a nekkid redhead everybody's staring at her
Willie showed us all size does matter

Cause Willie's got a big deck
Hey you know mine might not be as big as Willie's but it's, uh, all I got,
You know I was thinking about adding on what do they call it?

Elmo and Patsy
Wrote me and said they'd written the perfect country Christmas comedy 
Song.

I said ""No you didn't. You didn't mention nothing about...
Well...yeah you pretty much got it all. I mean Grandma and of course the
Family and getting drunk and run over by heavy machinery and...""

Well since I needed the money I felt obliged to include it on this record.

And it goes a little something like this:

R: Grandma got runned over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog,
And we'd begged her not to go.
But she'd left her medication,
So she stumbled out the door into the snow.

When they found her Christmas mornin',
At the scene of the attack, 
There were hoof prints on her forehead,
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back. 

R: Grandma got runned over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.
(On her way home)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
(Say there's no Santa)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.
(Lord, we believe)

Now we're all so proud of Grandma,
He's been takin' this so well.
See him in there watchin' football,
Drinkin beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle.

It's not Christmas without Grandma.
All the family's dressed in black.
And we just can't help but wonder:
Should we open up her gifts or send them back? 

R: Grandma got runned over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.
(Midnight before Christmas)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
(Say there's no Santa)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.
(Lord, we believe)

Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig.
And a blue and silver candle
That would have just matched the hair in grandma's wig.

I've warned all my friends and neighbors.
""Better watch out for yourselves.
They should never give a license,
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.""

Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.

At the Christmas pot luck dinner
At the Holy Roller Hall
They don't allow no drinkin
Of any alch-ee-hol
So my Aunt Hazel makes a juice
Without the use of liquor
And every year
It seems to disappear
A little quicker

CHORUS
It's Hazel's homemade Hallelujah Punch
Guaranteed to spread some Christmas cheer
Fill the cup
And drink it up
It doesn't take too much
Of Hazel's homemade Hallelujah Punch

When everyone's done eatin'
And they're had a glass or two
The strangest things start happenin'
Just like they always do
The spirit of the season
Flows throughout the congregation
There must be some magic in that bowl
To cause such a sensation

CHORUS

She swears there's nothing in it
But the juice of fruits and berries
Some raisins, dates, a few yeast cakes, and maraschino cherries
She corks up two five-gallon jugs
And seals them every spring
And when she opens them up for Christmas
The cheer starts to sing
Ah

HALLELUJAH

Aunt Hazel makes
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
An amazing punch

Hallelujah
You'll hurl your lunch
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
If you drink too much
Hallelujah

And every sip tastes better and better
And better
And better

I love candy bars...eat them all the time
My combo meal's are super-sized
And I crave the stuff they put inside those dang ding dongs
Mmm

My cholesterol is off the chart
I keep a blood pressure cuff on my left arm
Doctor says that my poor heart won't last too long
My nickname in school was double wide
Cause my momma fried

Always huffin and puffin
Lay around the house all day
No wonder I can't lose no weight
See that pizza on the TV
Oh man don't it look cheesy
You know they deliver here for nothin'
That's why I weigh 270 somethin'

My insurance said that they'd co-pay
I made the same appointment Carnie Wilson made

When I came to in the recovery room
Wouldn't much left of me
When he removed the bandages from my thighs

Come on you no good worthless piece of foreign...
(BEEP)
Wait till I get me a royalty check
I'm gonna buy me an American made car
Piece of junk

People always shout obscenities
When I stall in their lane
They're all convinced when they see me driving this heap that I'm insane
But seat belted in
I push the gas down fearlessly
Breaks stop working then
I watch the engine overheat

I need a new car
I can't ever get far
This one breaks down on me all the time
It's got four bald tires
And it always backfires
And I'm sick of that check engine light
I need a new car

I replaced all the cables and hoses
Had grease all over my face
For a couple weekends I had parts thrown all over the place
I put it back together fast
But now it's even worse
Now my friends just laugh
Cause it only goes in reverse

I need a new car
Getting to work's hard
When you have to drive backwards all the time
I'd find a junkyard and I'd sell it for parts
But I know they won't give me a dime
I need a new car

I won't repair anymore
Now the dang transmission's about to fall out
The only thought that's on my brain is the new car
I could be driving now

Rumor is they're having a sale over at the push pull or drag car lot
If I can get this towed down there I swear I'll take anything they've got
So with a credit line of $20,000 plus
No interest or money down and no more taking the bus

I got a new car
Looking like a big star
I don't care if the price is too high
It's got a VCR cruise control and Onstar
So I know where I'm at all the time

Well I'm sittin here rockin our cute little baby
Tell me why you just won't stop cryin'

Yeah I burped you twice sounded good
Did everything a father should
Read Barney and nursery rhymes
I guess your momma needs a girls night out every once in a while

I put on a brand new diaper baby

Everything was going just fine
Till's you threw up on me when I fed ya

Where's your mommy

Staring at my lousy ravioli can
As she walked right in and said to me
Is there any way that I can make your day complete
I told her if there's anyway you can
Could you grease up that old metal roasting pan

And bake me a country ham
Honey glazed with a side of yams
Leave it in till it's golden brown
Pineapples all the way around
Let the sweet smell fill the air
Serve it to me in my underwear
I'm tired of eating imitation Spam
Could you bake me a country ham

I looked at her, with hungry eyes
She asked if I needed ketchup for my curly fries
I held my breath I could hardly wait
For my little slice of heaven on that Dixie plate
I could feel the juices running down my chin
As my stomach started singing once again

Could you bake me a country ham

Leave it in till it's golden brown

Let the sweet smell fill the air
Serve it to me in my easy chair

Lysol and Pine Sol too

Yes I admit I've got a stinkin problem
I filled the tub right to the top
I'll start with my Brillo pad

I wake up and right away
A foul odor hits my nose
What's my sweat glands start to pour
I'll stink from my head down to my toes

Calgon won't take me away

Put Dr Scholl's in my flip flops

Well, it'd be worth it waitin' on obama

With the price of gas this year
Sometimes, I think they did it 'cause they can do it

Now, I'm killin' time in the welfare line

It's way past time for bush to go
And that makes sense 'cause I know folks is ready
So, stop, here comes obama time
And once he's in that house of white
I'll get myself some credit if they've got any

She's bubbling in a man's world
Give it up cause she's a man's girl

Now tell me, can you tell the difference
Between a fast-tracking, skank-gaming tramp
And a man's girl
Kind of seems the same with just one glance

Money be	 gonna get you in there

Not just hoes work them skirts that's mini
Prostitutes that dress this way

Cause she's the shit, no doubt
She's so about her scrill, that gives it all the more thrill
Can't lie, a little high

Let me do my thing, let a brother breathe
But she make it so convenient when she around
I don't ever want to leave

What I'm gon' do, how I've been riding with my crew
She says play on, ain't nothing wrong
As long as eventually I come home

The joke's on me cause she's gone
Taking care of she instead of worrying about me
(Money B: For shee?) For sheezy, she pleases me
Knowing that I got her back with what's important
Knowing that I'm down and when I clown with my homies
It's a necessity Â­ she gets to me, yes, I confess it
Secure with her intellect
Never afraid of flexing them hoe-ish dresses

Where gray turning gold

Jokingly blowing a bubble
As the teenagers slammed on their brakes

A great unholy clatter quickly filling me with dread
I wondered then if silence had forever disappeared
What, with everybody yelling the end was finally here

I scrambled for the television, desperate for its light
Hoping that my favorite stars could stop this endless night
I waited for instructions, I waited for a sign
I listened very carefully when told just what to buy

Lovers became bitter, mathematicians counting crumbs
Some were filled with angry lust, the rest felt mostly numb
The sun became the enemy, they'd hunger after dark
And kill time swapping partners at a club called Noah's Arc

Those who spoke of doom impending, suffering and such
Had found the place in people's heart that beauty had once touched
They filled the auditorium, the tickets far from cheap
Those that couldn't get in started fighting in the street

The day came so we gathered in a field behind the mall
A noted scientist predicted there we'd see it all
The city council members came, they told us not to fear
The king and queen of homecoming both shed a poignant tear

Just like that it happened, the starling blinked its eye
The molecules collided and became part of the sky

For you, you decide to spread
Your wings, spread your wings and leave this town
Denise, there's something you should know

I hid the bottle in the woods
To mark the spot where I first realized
That what we have is more than good
And seems to shine a light behind my eyes

Denise, if only just to hear the sound
Of you breathing in my ear
I swear I'd let them put me in the ground
Denise, I will not be ignored

I hid the bongs behind the shed
To mark the spot where I first saw clear
Where what we have will never die
And everybody else can disappear",Denise,2010

Est un pays bonheur-misère
Tout commencé, tout reste à faire
Je suis à lui trouver un nom
Entre Jeunesse, Amour et Terre

Tombée la nuit, fermé le jour
Il n’est de vrai que nos amours
Tombée la nuit, fermé le jour
Il n’est de vrai que nos amours

J’aimerais dépenser ma nuit
À te courir mer et merveille
Mais c’est au creux de ton oreille
Qu’un de mes mots cherche son lit
Un mot qui sonne comme veille

Tombée la nuit, fermé le jour
Il n’est de vrai que nos amours
Tombée la nuit, fermé le jour
Il n’est de vrai que nos amours

Je cherche un mot doux comme Amour
Mais dont on n’aurait point la rime
Je cherche un pas qui danse et trime
Mais se passerait de tambour
La mort a tant de synonymes

Tombée la nuit, fermé le jour
Il n’est de vrai que nos amours
Tombée la nuit, fermé le jour
Il n’est de vrai que nos amours

Avant de jouer au bonheur
Au sommeil ou à la misère
Rappelle-moi comment j’espère
Et que j’ai l’âme au coin du coeur
Et que je rame à ta galère

Clement Verzi,"Elle a de ces lumières au fond des yeux
Qui rendent aveugles ou amoureux
Elle a des gestes de parfum
Qui rendent bête ou rendent chien
Et si lointaine dans son cœur
Pour moi c'est sûr, elle est d'ailleurs

Elle a de ces manières de ne rien dire
Qui parlent au bout des souvenirs
Cette manière de traverser
Quand elle s'en va chez le boucher
Quand elle arrive à ma hauteur
Pour moi c'est sûr, elle est d'ailleurs

Et moi je suis tombé en esclavage
De ce sourire, de ce visage
Et je lui dis ""emmène-moi""
Et moi je suis prêt à tous les sillages
Vers d'autres lieux, d'autres rivages
Mais elle passe et ne répond pas
Les mots pour elle sont sans valeur
Pour moi c'est sûr, elle est d'ailleurs

Clementina de Jesus,"Batuque na cozinha 
Sinhá não quer 
Por causa do batuque

Pra ver uma cebola

De uma tal crioula 

Deixei a cebola, peguei a batata 
E o branco com ciúme de uma tal mulata 
Peguei o balaio pra medir a farinha 
E o branco com ciúme de uma tal branquinha

E da casa de cômodos da tal Inês

Eu estou com razão 
Eu não moro na casa de arrumação 
Eu fui apanhar o meu violão 
Que estava empenhado com Salomão 
Eu pago a fiança com satisfação 
Mas não me bota no xadrez 
Com esse malandrão

Que é Paraíba do Norte, Maranhão

Clémentine,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2000
Clémentine,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2000

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na

There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,

Boy, I know you're not, I can tell you're terrified
Nobody has to know and if they did, they wouldn't care

Forget about it baby, let's not waste our afternoon (forget about it baby)
Cause we're gonna go fly to the moon (I wanna go fly to the moon)
Yeah, but anyway (Pack your bags, pack your bags)

Rubbing through your hair

Probably couldn't tell but I be blushing when you with me
When you kiss me, swear to God, blood was rushing to my chimney
Laying on my trampoline, looking at the stars
From my fake space fog machine
Now you know my arm is dead
From the push that you had
I said I loved you, said it back
Like it was scripted, instrumented, like the flavor of that lemonade
That we was sippin on our sushi-ridden dinner date
Oh, you think you special now?
Other bitches trippin' now
Cause we're fleeing to the moon
Fuck Earth, man we sick of y'all
Wings on my backs and we ain't gotta cop a ticket, nah, nah, nah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah, let's go to the moon!

Clementine Jilot,"On dit que ce monde est un mirage donc en fait rien n'est acquis,
Le diable joue avec nous et avec un rien nous taquine,
On se fatigue mais tout part vite comme dans un karting
Où ta future carcasse est garée dans ton parking.
Le jour se lève et mon heure fait encore un pas,
J'me tape chaque jour pour rendre à dieu mon corps intact,
Car toutes mes affaires en fait s'appellent revient
Et quand je serai dans ma tombe personne me dira je te rejoins.
A la mairie elle t'appartient pour la vie,
Mais cinq ans plus tard avec un autre elle parcourt la ville,
Quant au succès il t'appartient pas, t'accroches ap,
Si tu loupes le co-ch, le public te fait un croche-pattes.
Tout ce qu'on t'a prêté tu le rends
Même ce que tu bouffes tu le rechies,
Dis-leur chut, l'argent est un fidèle poto dealer de shit.
Dès le choc que j'ai reçu en sachant qu'on était seul j'me suis dit
""Mehlich il m'reste la foi donc j'mets mon front au sol""

Rien ne t'appartient, tu t'attaches aux biens,

Du quelque des soucis qui vont te noyer, il faut que tu nages.

Avec la même fougue qu'y'avait dans vos nuits de rêves!
Le propriétaire ne fait que louer une terre jusqu'à sa mort
Ce monde t'appartient autant qu'Hitler avait de remords
La vie est-elle une illusion à laquelle on s'accroche
Ou la plus grande des convictions pour laquelle l'homme devient atroce?
Même mon corps n'est qu'une location j'évite les tatouages,
On s'imagine à la retraite bien qu'on puisse partir à tout âge
Attaché grave à ton pote mais c'est ton pote qui t'a poucave
Il se foutait de la belle époque, il a tout avoué!

Tout est voué à l'échec, les belles villas les grosses caisses,
Six pieds sous terre rongé par les vers!
Tout est voué à l'échec, quelque soit ton style de vie!

Io c'ho una lista da buttare nel cesso fratmo
E dopo tiro lo scarico e carico il caricatore
Guarda che radio, non passa roba troppo napoletana
Dovresti scrivere in lingua italiana,
Mi dicevano che nella rai non sarei entrato mai
Troppi raccomandati qui in gara
Da Nola fino alla top ten,
Italia no bomber
Chiamatemi Robben
A Napoli obbè
Il marchio di Obey
La iena the monster
Assolo di col tray
Gancio di un boxer
Più sangue di hostel
Ti cadono I poster
A casa dei Coldplay
Meglio col gospel
Magari c'è il Nobel
Del fatto di popper
Ti sparano I cocktail, John Waine!

Ma quando li scrivi sti testi nuovi
Perchè qui sono tempi duri tempi duri

Per ogni skater che si impenna sulla tavoletta
Rapper, che si impegna già dal mind-check up
Writer, o con la penna o con la bomboletta
Ogni breaker con dj selecta

L'apocalisse cade e voi che ci scherzate
Ma con chi vi schierate?
Famiglie disperate
Ma come è triste fratè
Quanti ne ho visti atterra
E voi che ci istigate
Crolla il tetto e vedo il cielo in una stanza
A quest'ora c'è la buona stella?
No è andata in vacanza
Bevo del wisky
Amen
Ultimo tiro Camel
Ascolto I dischi
Brother
E penso di viaggiare

E se domani non sarà più un giorno
Come un altro me ne andrò verso il mare
Gli orizzonti via da qua
Una città con il sogno ricorrente di emigrare
Cambiare direzione, aquila reale
E se domani non sarà più un giorno
Come un altro me ne andrò verso il mare
Gli orizzonti via da qua
Una città con il sogno ricorrente di emigrare
Cambiare direzione, aquila reale

I colpi d'asma
I colpi d'ansia
I conti in tasca
Chi il fondo raschia
E se la depressione sale 
Brucia tanto che a confronto
Questo thè bollente è l'Alaska
Alla ricerca della libertà 
Come tempo fa leggevo
Nelle storie del gabbiano Jonathan
E la mia vita passa macchine animali
Andando a tempo un battito di ali
Di aquile reali

E se domani non sarà più un giorno
Come un altro me ne andrò verso il mare
Gli orizzonti via da qua
Una città con il sogno ricorrente di emigrare

E se domani non sarà più un giorno
Come un altro me ne andrò verso il mare

Una città con il sogno ricorrente di emigrare
Cambiare direzione, aquila reale

Chi ha tre figli e si è arreso
E non arriva alle spese
Fino alla fine del mese
E via dal paese 
Vedo che sono poche
Le bocche dissetate 
Qui mangiano gli stessi
Le fughe disperate 
Come le situazioni italiane
Soldati fate parlare sti ragazzi in piazza caricati
Agitati cervelli confusi
Generazione d'abusi
Tesori nei bauli chiusi dei pirati

Quanti sono sotto un Dio che non li sta pensando
Solo gli attimi che colgo io fratè
La storia cambia 
Noi viviamo dove le tempeste piano
Si avvicinano occorre un battito di ali
Di aquile reali 
Quanti sono sotto un Dio che non li sta pensando
Solo gli attimi che colgo io fratè

Così come ogni tango è sangre e dolore

Haciendo un chilombo

Senza ascensore arrivi in cima
Con un polmone in mano
Portoni aperti
E carry al pianerottolo
Gli sbirri in rally in elicottero
Sul pusher che lavora a cottimo
Su centocelle il sole splende

Con le nike squagliate tutt'uno 
Con st'asfalto incorporate
So cazzi per chi campa
Con la svolta in una scarpa
E la storia nell'altra

Ma puntano al massimo
E premono sul limite
Tra un uomo ed il suo simile
La strada è l'università
Che laurea chi attacca 
E si difende dal pusher
Che ti compra
E ti rivende a un prezzo da miseria
Ti fa pagare l'aria

Voi siete buoni e lo dovete a me.
Gira e rigira qui nessuno è innocente,
Il mondo si divide tra chi fa e chi è òmmo 'e niente.
Vivo o morto dimmi,
Che differenza fa?
Questa vita è peggio dell'aldilà. 
Io di morire no, non ho paura
E il Paese solo grazie a me
Non è affondato ancora.

Giuro di dire la verità
Sicuro la colpa è di essere vivo, per carità.
Giudice, questo è un equivoco sai che qua, 
Pentiti in giro che gridano falsità
Nelle colonne di cemento armato 
C'è minimo il nonno, il fratello e il cognato 
Che sono stai fatti a pezzi da Dio.

'Sti ragazzi pippano il granito che è tagliato
Con il chewing gum e li porterà nell'aldilà.
Sono storie di merda,
E non ci posso fare nulla,
Io sono innocente come un bimbo nella culla.

E la mia unica colpa è quella di essere vivo.

È inutile che prima fa il pazzo e dopo nega. 
A parte il fatto che non siamo solo noi il cancro della società
C'è la crisi nell'aria si sa.
I vecchi al governo non lasciano il posto ai giovani 
Chi guarda la differenza di costo e poveri.
Diciamo che un certo Roberto Saviano,
Diciamo che un certo Giuseppe Impastato,
Diciamo che un certo Giovanni Falcone
Non vi fate Capaci, come l'attentato.
È difficile azzerare tutto e ricominciare da capo, 
Ricominciare da ca-, ricominciare da capo
In cella mangierò bene quando il pranzo è servito,
E la mia unica colpa è quella di essere vivo.

Vivo o morto, che differenza c'è?
Voi siete buoni e lo dovete a me.
Gira e rigira qui nessuno è innocente,
Il mondo si divide tra chi fa e chi è òmmo 'e niente.
Vivo o morto dimmi,
Che differenza fa?
Questa vita è peggio dell'aldilà. 
Io di morire no, non ho paura
E il Paese solo grazie a me
Non è affondato ancora.

La storia va storta, avvocato
Coi casi irrisolti e coi morti nel prato.
Tutto sommato,
Lei crede alla Chiesa 
Non vede se è Satana o Madre Teresa 
O-K mi fa capire perché dovrei 
Sentirmi dire certe cose, potrei
Prendere pistole, minacciarla farei 
Una grossa bomba a mano e poi venire da lei.

Vivo o morto, che differenza c'è?
Voi siete buoni e lo dovete a me.
Gira e rigira qui nessuno è innocente,
Il mondo si divide tra chi fa e chi è òmmo 'e niente.

Ti giuro mamma
Questo è l'ultimo caffè che bevo
Il poco riposo mi rendo nervoso
E mi chiedo
Se rimarrà solo la polvere
Nelle mie mani
Ed il risultato sarà correre
Su quelle navi.
I figli di puttana
Fanno saltare I miei piani
Loro ci vogliono trattare
Da poveri schiavi
E chi sogna l'america più lontana
Come un secolo fa il sangue
Dei nostri avi
Dimenticati dal padre eterno
Brucia qua l'inferno
E chi non sta mai fermo
È perché è stanco dentro
Camminando a testa alta
Ascoltando la voce del vento
Avrà fatto centro.

Parlo a nome di una generazione
Che qui non ha più niente
Ed è costretta a dipendere
Sempre dalla gente
Andare via fino a su
Ma con la mente di giù
Rimane solo il vento
A noi artisti
Sempre di più
Con la valigia in mano
Varchiamo una nazione
Che non dà opportunità
O valore
A quello che inventiamo
Nun c'a' facc' ‘cchiu
Trent'anni in mezzo a sta' merda
Ma mi rimbocco le mani
Frà ricominciamo
Se credi che da grande
Ragioni così
Allora ragazzino
Tu non hai capito un cazzo.
Ti aspettavo
E per la prossima fine del mondo
Come disse un vecchio saggio
Io speriamo che me la cavo.
Guarda la gente quand' sent' o' vient

N'copp' ‘a pell'
Ragiona che cos' n'copp' all'anema
E quell' che pruov' a chiamma' verità
Sensibilità ppe' l'aria din't a' na carica

Che ho a disposizione
Per confessare I miei peccati
E quanti no, signore!

Ti giuro mamma
Questo è l'ultimo caffè che bevo
Come troisi
Mi rende nervoso
E poi mi chiedo
Quando le storie finiranno
Sempre le stesse
Il tempo mi passa davanti

Scaglio l'ultima pietra
Tra peccatori ci capiamo
E voi benvenuti al sud
Mo' ve lo speghiamo
Porto una croce come gesù cristo
Ed il suo calvario
È quello di essere italiano
Sai come mi chiamo? Bravo
Le persone che mi apprezzano
Per quello che sono
Perché a volte non c'è un prezzo
Per quel suono
Le mie idee continueranno
A viaggiare
Con la voce del vento
Di chi non ha nulla
E che sa cantare

Clementino,"Dammi la mano e adesso stringimi
Che farò notte
Il battito del cuore a tempo
Come un pianoforte
Hai solo 16 anni ti senti già grande
Tuo padre torna ubriaco a casa
I buchi nelle scarpe
L'espressione e il volto della depressione
Pochi mesi fa un agguato e per sbaglio
La mamma era al mercato
Tu non l'hai mai accettato
Gli psicofarmaci ti servono 
A guarire o alleviare ferite
Mi chiedo se tutto questo
Ha un senso se con un fiore
Combatti il cemento
Passano ore e parole che invento
Immortalare momenti rubati dal vento
E quando guardi quelle foto
Vuoi la forza di 300 soldati messi in fila
Pronti a puntare il pugnale 
Bevi rum e tequila per imparare a scordare
Almeno questa sera non ti può
Fare del male
Almeno questa sera ti può sembrare normale

Dimmi adesso dove andrai
Dimmi che succederà
Quando le vele saranno ormai
Tutte spiegate
Dimmi poi cosa sarà
Di chi profuma di strada
Quando le vele saranno ormai
Tutte spiegate

Una città che brucia
Qual è la strada giusta
Conti sti pezzi d'erba
Tutti messi in una busta
Gli amici qui 
Ti vogliono veder felice
Sorridere e poi lo sanno
Che la noia è una cosa terribile
Per il tuo amico non è stata
Rosa e primavera
Per lui e per tutti gli altri
Suoi fratelli li in galera
I tatuaggi fatti bene perchè 
Il tipo è esperto
Fanatico del calcio segna pure
In mare aperto
Però c'ha un male dentro
Ed è un veleno 
Che ha già preso il sopravvento
E la faccia da spavento
Le mani tremano 
Hai fumato 4 pacchi
E non ti tengono alla prima
E tutti alzano I tacchi
Rimani solo in questo porco mondo
È naturale e questa merda nel tuo cuore
Che sta per scoppiare
Almeno questa volta non ti può fare del male
Almeno questa sera ti può sembrare normale

Dimmi adesso dove andrai
Dimmi che succederà
Quando le vele saranno ormai
Tutte spiegate
Dimmi poi cosa sarà
Di chi profuma di strada
Quando le vele saranno ormai
Tutte spiegate

I tipi fanno a botte fuori da quello chalet
Sembrava una scazzottata
Come le tante altre
Non ti farà pensare al dramma
Che potrà arrivare
Con I miei occhi ho visto un uomo 
In aria saltare
Il giorno dopo sul giornale 
Una notizia gira
Non è la fine del mondo
Ma quella del rispetto
La fine dei ragazzi
La fine della vita
Per chi rimane in strada
Ancora carenza d'affetto
Un mare di cazzate che raccontano in tv
Se non la spacco devo ringraziare la tribù 
Di quelli che mi stanno sempre più vicino
E che ci credono alla profezia di Clementino
Adesso fuori qui fratello
Scoppia il temporale
Non ci rimane che andare
Sotto la pioggia compare
Almeno questa volta 
Non ti può fare del male
Almeno questa sera ti può sembrare normale

Dimmi adesso dove andrai
Dimmi che succederà
Quando le vele saranno ormai
Tutte spiegate
Dimmi poi cosa sarà
Di chi profuma di strada
Quando le vele saranno ormai

E sono morto ridendo qui mentre tutti piangevano.
Suona rock, house, blues, Rock and roll's, lo sciamano nel deserto,
Segnala la strada sicura ma mi perdo.
Se un giorno all'improvviso ti svegli e non vedi il sole
In poche parole, o sei morto o sei il sole.
Sfonda le porte della percezione, è un'eccezione,
Che convalida la regola e in testa un'ossessione!
Voglio tornare bambino, perchè le ginocchia sbucciate 
Fanno meno male che dei cuori infranti da vecchio,
Dal momento che non mi fido piu' di nessuno 
È sicuro fratello il mio migliore amico è lo specchio
Se ti dicono che l'amore è un sogno 
Tu sogna pure ma non stupirti se ti svegli piangendo
Siamo buoni a nulla ma capaci a tutto, 
Questo pezzo te lo dedico e il mondo se ne sta cadendo

Chi di voi sa di esser davvero vivo,
Ogni giorno qui è veleno nocivo,
Piccola lady, che mi succede?
Questa è la fine, this is the end
Chi di voi sa di esser davvero vivo,
Ogni giorno qui è veleno nocivo,

E la notte è un pozzo nero
Dove bagno le mie opere è un mistero. 
Ora! Baby balla intorno al totem, 
Mentre vado a uccidere mio padre, 
A fottere mia madre!
E vedrai apparire li un serpente,
Sulle scaglie avrà la storia di tutta la gente.
Divora le coscienze,
Mostro di energia onnipotente
Sulla fronte un occhio rosso ed un occhio tutto verde
Io poeta maledetto, hai capito del delirio 
Sono la vera divinità
Mi puoi chiamare Re lucertola 
E sta sicura rimarro' con te per l'eternità

Tu sei come sei

Tu sei come sei
Perchè non parli mai
Il sole nei tuoi occhi
Brucia tutto e te ne vai
Bella come sei
Non cambiare più
A illuminarmi l’anima
Ci riesci solo tu
Non so se sia una follia mia
Quest’indelebile svarione di malinconia
Il peso dei ricordi che lascia la scia
Con un messaggio ho rovinato tutto
E sei andata via
Non mi rimane che il mare
Guardare le onde
Qui sono profonde
Fenomenale come le note
Di quella canzone
Che tu mi mettevi
Ogni giorno a colazione
Dici che sono stronzo
Perchè non ti rispondo
E signorì sei solo tu
La vera fine del mondo
Ordini di tutto e non ti va
Di mangiare
E c’ho la forza ancora
Di chiamarti lascia stare
Ma siamo fuori
Sono io che ti ho lasciato ieri
Siamo riflessi nello stesso specchio dei pensieri
E la tua voce che è più calda di queste parole
Picchi in testa come rum sotto al sole

Tu sei come sei
Perchè non parli mai
Il sole nei tuoi occhi
Brucia tutto e te ne vai
Bella come sei
Non cambiare più
A illuminarmi l’anima
Ci riesci solo tu
È un destino
Quello di essere soli
Come me
Nel cestino le emozioni
Non so contenere
Monogamia
Sociopatia
Fotografia dei nostri tempi
Non per sorridere
Mi mostri I denti
L’amore è autodidatta
I corpi sono gli strumenti
Accordati il suono spacca
Senza effetti
Come indumenti
Settime ottave
Se ti può dare
Cosa importa il tono
Se è il falsetto grave
Per una coppia così
Ci vuole un letto grande
E un tetto trasparente
Lo spavento sta sparendo
Spasmi fantasmi una scala di tasti
Spaghetti di nastri
Disastri rimasti di altri
E sono sempre e solo
Le tue mani che voglio su di me
Finchè viene domani
Too man groupie
Entrano nel backstage
Finte come le loro extention
E il peggio sono tutte ex dei miei

Tu sei come sei
Perchè non parli mai
Il sole nei tuoi occhi
Brucia tutto e te ne vai
Bella come sei
Non cambiare più
A illuminarmi l’anima
Ci riesci solo tu
È che non ti faccio mai un regalo
È che sono sempre in ritardo
È che sono io il più bastardo
E come al solito quello più codardo

Quando il tempo cambierà
Chissà cosa farai?
Quando tutto questo passerà
E passerà
Alle medie I professori
Ci chiamavano
Ritardati mentali
Tutti coi capelli uguali
Fatti a criminali
Ballavamo trance ai mak P
Arrivavamo in discoteta in 3
Sopra a un si
Quando ero a scuola
Dopo l’occupazione
Ci misero dentro un salone
Di una villa abbandonata
A fare lezione
Passare le ore
Copiare il compito di matematica
Uanema fuori dal balcone
Dream team la tribù che dal sud
E con l’asso di bastoni
Sulla targa a testa in giù
Non c’era un cazzo e inventavamo
I giochi più strani
Lo schiaffo del soldato
A nascondino frà non ci trovavi
Le impennate con le moto truccate anormali
Il mio scooter fra la scia
Dietro la ferrari (uanema)
Ero perso tra I sogni
E I miei tabuù
Senza fare il biglietto sul bus

Camminando per le vie della città
Osservando poi la strada che se ne va
Svagando svarionando
Senza pensieri
Tu puoi guardar cadere le stelle dei desideri
E cominciai a fare rap
All’epoca suonare
Nei locali era difficile per me sai
Perchè? il tipo mi diceva
Si ma quanta gente mi porti?
Se lo sapevo facevo il PR cumpariè
Forse è meglio iniziare a fare le gare
Che tantomeno fai dei soldi
E poi ti fai notare
E I miei dicevano Clemè statt accort
Andavo solo senza doppie manager e scort
Le partite ai videogiochi fino all’alba
Con quelli seri I miei fratelli
Botte da orbi sul divano
Scugnizzi per le strade
Hinterland napoletano
Una mente contorta
Come Frank Matano
E mi affidavo alla saggezza degli anziani
Che mi dicevano di rispettare
I sogni e I piani
Hai imparato a camminare e mo ti piace correre
Si ma fai piano così tu andrai lontano

Camminando per le vie della città
Osservando poi la strada che se ne va
Svagando svarionando
Senza pensieri
Tu puoi guardar cadere le stelle dei desideri
La mia vita suddivisa tra pagine e righe
I pensieri dalla mattina alle 15
Intendo fino a ieri
Così la svolta parte da una birra al bar
Le gare musica illuminaci la via
Più giusta a noi guerrieri
E mi domando che sarà
Quando il tempo passerà
Voltandomi vedrò lo sfondo
Della strada scomparire da lontano
E le abitudini che qua sono diverse
Dal posto in cui sono nato
Dove respiro aria di mare
Aspiro ad arginare questa negatività
Fino ad arrivare lassù
Sulla punta di una vetta
Sventolando una bandiera
Con la faccia di una iena estrema
E non lo so se poi tornerò
Sui miei passi brò
Al massimo è un classico
Che chi ritorna indietro
Lo fa senza rimorso
Quindi se c’è un muro ci si passa attraverso
Camminando sulla sabbia a piedi nudi
E sentire sotto l’acqua l’effetto che fa
E poi cantare respirando aria di mare
E poi andare a far l’amore fino a quando ti pare
Ma che sarà?
Quando il tempo cambierà
Chissà cosa farai?
Quando tutto questo passerà
E passerà
Passerà
E passerà",Senza pensieri,2013

Questo è il terzo giorno che ci svegliamo male e chiami giuda me,
Hai buttato giù la mia valigia dalle scale quanta rabbia esplode ancora prima di un caffè,
Ieri poi a vedere ""I love radio rock""
Senza lenzuola addosso,
Uno schock,
Dio quanto mi piacciono I tuoi viaggi,
E poi quando mi baci I tatuaggi,
Please miss? kiss me
Gira una ruota d'amore,

Qui vedi va bene così,
In vacanza da un bel pò 
Con te che amplifichi il mio battito cardiaco baby,

E I tuoi capelli al vento,
E come queste piante,
Dici che per tante pietre ho perso il miglior diamante.
Non è il corvo piove sempre,
Quelle notti tu hai presente?
Sono I nostri ricordi ma dirtelo adesso lo so che poi non vale niente.
Ti ricordi la luna com'era?
Quella sera eri sulla cometa,
Guardavamo universi e la costellazione di Orione da un altro pianeta.
Ti dicevo che quando mi amplifichi il battito sala in un attimo istinto animale.
Apro gli occhi sono quaggiù poi mi giro e tu non sei più qui

Qui vedi va bene così,
In vacanza da un bel pò 
Con te che amplifichi il mio battito cardiaco baby,

Clementino,"Quante volte ti ho aspettato che bussavi quella porta
Quante volte tu incazzata volevi dare una svolta
Fuori casa vedi il mare chissà dove ti porta
Vuoi la zattera e scappare per tagliare la corda
I tuoi amici sanno tutto si ma che gliene importa
Infondo a parte un paio qua la vita è dura per molti
Tutte le pietre che ci metti sopra ma il pavimento lo sfondi
Vuoi la via d'uscita per regolare i tuoi conti
Lontano da qua
Fuoco sulla fronte che arrita
Nella sua terra lui ti aspetterà
E per ridarti la tua libertà
E nei vicoli della città
Quante volte siam passati quà
Al tramonto
Te ne andrai
Per la tua strada a due passi da casa
Il telefono rimane spento neanche foto sopra al web
E mentre io ti cerco int è canzoni poi me perd
Il sigaro cubano che mi hai regalato ce l'ho stretto qui dentro al cassetto conservato giù da me
E quel bastardo non ti tratta bene mollalo e vieni di qua
Vediamo un film lontano non ci troverà
Si t'aspett stasera pa verità
Che sta semp cu me nun a ma parlà
Vorrei guardarti dentro fino al centro dei pensieri
E farti un monumento a guardia di tutti i segreti
Vengono in mente tutte quelle avventure di ieri
Le cazzate, i sogni e quelle montagne di scleri
E poi farti capire
Lì come gira male
E poi guardarlo da altre prospettive tale e quale
Le chiavi dell'auto sono sul davanzale 
vuoi scappare 
ora sei pronta e bella per attraversare il mare
Lontano da qua
Fuoco sulla fronte che arrita
Nella sua terra lui ti aspetterà
E per ridarti la tua libertà
E nei vicoli della città
Quante volte siam passati quà
Al tramonto
Te ne andrai
Per la tua strada a due passi da casa
Hey tu non ti vedo più come una volta
E i ridi liberi danno una scossa
La mia visione mossa è la miglior risorsa
E andare più lontano quella è la risposta
In tutti questi anni e tutti questi acciacchi
Provare a restare si ma fuori dai ranghi
Nascosta dietro agli angoli di questo buio
La mia luce a intermittenza che ti fa da scudo
E nei vicoli della città
Quante volte siam passati quà
Al tramonto
Te ne andrai
Per la tua strada a due passi da casa

Clementino,"Ti vedo se guardo il mare
Sei un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Perché sei napoli
Ti penso se guardo il cielo
Sei un ricordo che rimane per sempre

E ora pinù non ci sei più
Ti sento dentro i testi delle canzoni
Dentro i versi che facevi tu
Guarda questo mare quanto è blu
Per Napoli e per il Sud, per l’Italia
E tutto il mondo a me piace il blues
Hai raccontato la verità
Quella era la mia terra
Una tazzulella di questo caffè e passa l’appucundrì
Con una sigaretta sopra e quando piove è una magia
Anima e cuore e con la chitarra hai composto queste poesie
Io so pazz e non me scassat o’cazz
Ora si rivolta il rione e tutti scendono dal palazzo
Saluta totò, massimo e pure edoardo
Ti penso in queste note se mi sento quando quando
napoli è un carta sporca, Napoli è mille colori
E ci hai lasciato in queste vie nere con la paura
E se ogni scarrafone è bell a mamma soia sicuro
Allora la voce di questi bambini resta il futuro

Ti vedo se guardo il mare
Sei un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Perché sei napoli
Ti penso se guardo il cielo
Se un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Guarda come se cambia davvero
gesù, Gesù non te ne accorgi più, guagliò
Ti vedo se guardo il mare
Sei un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Perché sei Napoli

Io dubbi più non ho fratello che dio ti benedica
Che male c’è se adesso questa canzone è la mia amica
Un deserto di parole, non calpesto I fiori
Vorrei essere allegro con uno spinello qua fuori
Chi ama il mare cammina a bocca salata lo sai
Che siamo neri a metà, yes I know my way
Io sto vicino a te ma tu resta con me
E guardo dai balconi di napoli se è morto un re
Stanotte è suonato il telefono e la notizia mi uccide
Io stavo dentro l’albergo sveglio senza dormire
Mi hai lasciato in bocca l’amaro di chi non può scappare
So che sei fiero di me e ora mi devo fare ascoltare
Il tuo nome rimarrà impresso in queste vie
In queste teste, in questi dischi una canzone amica
Grazie per i consigli mi danno coraggio
Voglio dire solo zio pino ora fai buon viaggio

Ti vedo se guardo il mare
Sei un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Perché sei napoli
Ti penso se guardo il cielo
Se un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Guarda come se cambia davvero
gesù, Gesù non te ne accorgi più, guagliò
Ti vedo se guardo il mare
Sei un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Perché sei napoli

Porterò con me i preziosi consigli che mi hai dato
E terrò custodito con cura quel regalo che mi hai fatto
Così le parole delle tue canzoni
Saranno trasmesse di generazione in generazione ancora di più
Terrò vivo il tuo ricordo nella mia musica per sempre, promesso

Clementino,"Ye
Tolgo gli occhiali scuri
Voglio guardare il celo
E voglio fare bene, la vita appesa ad un treno
Nella mia scesa tremo
Paura del futuro come Martin io volo
Contro il muro del suono
Trattami come un figlio adesso che ci sei
Le notti testa e foglio scrivo fino alle 6
Un altra fiamma accesa ci sta aspettando
Tocco il silenzio per loro nei giorni che verranno
E sognavamo su panchine viaggi che calore
Eravamo nel cortile calci a quel pallone
Qui fuori grandina gocce di pioggia frenano sul vetro di questa finestra che mi affascina
Il cuore che si agita quelle foto buttate nel cesso
Di un dimenticatoio che sparirà e facevamo
Senza capire fratelli e amici ed eravamo felici
Fumavamo queste radici
Oh oh non andare via, via dalle mie mani
Oh oh non andare via, via da questo sguardo",Lettera Alla Musica,2015
Clementino,"Notte che nasconde i colori dietro alle stelle
Riempio le valigie di momenti insieme
Le volte che noi ridevamo a crepapelle
Pensare di nuovo al passato non conviene

Domandavi se era l'amore puro
O era senza futuro
Un cuore duro, una kalimba di luna per magia
Ci guidava quando il sole
Se ne andava via

Adesso tutto è cambiato
Sei scappata lontano
Colpa della fiducia
E alla fine del caso
Perché non c'era un piano
Quindi noi ce ne andiamo
Per due strade diverse
Perché noi ci capiamo

Sento la tua voce nel silenzio
Questo tuo profumo ferma il tempo
Chissà se ci vedremo nello stesso posto
Ricordi l'anno scorso ad agosto

Ricordo quella notte al mare
Un sogno che non può tornare
E penso a quelle cose rare
Che adesso vorrei sotterrare
Ricordo quella notte al mare
Un sogno che non può tornare

Quando l'onda ci travolgerà

Kalimba de luna
Sient' arrivà l'onda

Te la passo, mi guardi due tiri e già riparti
Mi lasci solo in questo party
Vuoi toccare il cielo? Non serve un aereo
E adesso sale un fumo denso dallo stereo
Ti chiamo quando meno te lo aspetti
Ti diverti
Inventi
Mi dici sono fatto di difetti
Perfetti

Ti arrendi

Pubblicavi le tue foto sorridente
Ti arrabbiavi quando mi vedevi assente
Mi taggavi negli stati continuamente
Ho cambiato già tre nomi praticamente
Tutte le discoteche, i murales a Londra
Ti piacevano e correvamo sotto la pioggia
Tornavamo in Italia, c'era un sole bestiale

Quella sera dovevo andare a suonare al mare
Dopo il concerto sulla spiaggia

C'era la luna più bella mai vista
Veniva sempre più vicino
Ci addormentammo davanti a sto falò
E ci svegliammo col buongiorno delle prime luci del mattino

Adesso non ci sei più ma quando ascolti 'sto groove
I pensieri che salgono mano a mano lassù
Nella testa sento ancora un ricordo che fuma
Attraverso il suono di una kalimba de luna

Ricordo quella notte al mare
Un sogno che non può tornare
E penso a quelle cose rare
Che adesso vorrei sotterrare

Clementino,"Vorrei tornare indietro! ma quanti sbagli fra’
Ho capito che non li ripeto
Il cuore dentro si era fatto qui come la pietra
A 15 anni una promessa che volevo questo e prendermi anche una cometa
Quante notti oscurate, nocche spaccate, 
Note stonate, quanti dei nostri a fare le cose sbagliate
C’è chi si è perso dietro un muro e chi va avanti per il suo
C’è chi ha la forza tutti I giorni e poi combatte il buio
Io che sto qui a guardare il mondo da più sfumature
Lontano da mamma e papà dove sono le cure? 
Circondato dal disordine, scappato come rondine
Se guardo il mare fra’ mi sento un vortice
E quann stong luntan, ricordo qualche anno fa

E mo ca song emigrante, e voglio o ciel a’guardà

Quante cose cambiate negli anni
Un amico mi chiamava e diceva frate
Perché se cadrai io ti rialzerò
O mi sdraio qui vicino a te
La storia di un musicante emigrante anima vagante
E guarda come cambia tutto quando sei distante
E la voglia di sentirti grande
5 ragazzi e un volante
Uanema santa
Ma k capa vacant
Così mi tengo stretto dentro tutto quello che ho
Pregando che dall’alto qualcuno ci salvi perciò
Chi porta I figli a scuola tutti I giorni spera in un futuro migliore
E c’è chi guarda fuori e prega il signore
Me lo lo riscrivo adesso con l’inchiostro sulla pelle
Di tutti quei ricordi come schiavi nelle celle
I chiari di luna, la notte più infame e ribelle. 
Noi da bambini volevamo toccare le stelle. 
E quann stong luntan, ricordo qualche anno fa
Guagliun miez a na via, na luce ind’a sta città
E mo ca song emigrante, e voglio o ciel a’guardà
Penso ca’ si stat a primma, tu si tutt a vita mia

E voglio o’ciel a guarda da quando ero in fasce
Come fenice che fra poi da zero rinasce
Apar vasc, guardo fuori che piove è tempesta
Chi muore presto e nelle mani qua polvere resta. 
Tutti quelli scappati altrove
Fammi vedere il colore li dove non c’è sole

Clementino,"Ti ricordi quando sei partito?
Nelle tasche nemmeno un quattrino
Perso in un campo un fiore appassito
Ti nascondevi come un assassino
E la musica volevi nella vita
Forse l’unica che avevi tra le dita
Alti e bassi fra risate e pianti
Questi grandi passi con i tanti pazzi

Quando sei arrivato lontano
Cercare un lavoro non è molto strano
Su queste cose ci passerei
Quando resti solo come ""Cast Away""
E cercavi delle buone idee
E dicevi dove sono i miei?
E tua madre dice come stai?
E tu al telefono ""mammà poi vedrai""
Quando sarò di nuovo laggiù
Questo ragazzo che tornerà al sud
E ti racconterò di più

Il giorno che io tornerò
Sotto le stelle canterò
Il giorno che io tornerò
Come ti sembra frà la mia città
Non è cambiata ma
Sotto le stelle canterò

Ora che tutto è cambiato
Vorresti tornare ma come ti senti?
Fra vari spaventi rimangono in testa
Domani chissà cosa inventi e rimangono in venti
Da mille che avevi
Ne avevi un milione
Quanti ce ne sono ancora
Preme la stretta il microfono al cuore
La mano alla Panda guardando il signore
Eravamo ragazzi
Vivevo per trovare incastri
Mano che è sporca di nero ma il tempo passava firmando i palazzi
Ora le note traducono passi
Mille volte trasudano sassi
Questi passi mi spingono forte
Di notte le casse diventano massi
Quando sarò di nuovo laggiù
Questo ragazzo che tornerà al sud
E ti racconterò di più

Il giorno che io tornerò
Sotto le stelle canterò
Il giorno che io tornerò
Come ti sembra frà la mia città

Nelle bustine come bombole, fuga di gas
Appartati sempre nelle peggio situazioni

Le luci dei lampioni, panchine nei rioni
E chi compatte ancora adesso signore e signori
Dai ruderi del sud italia e gare di freestyle
Fin sopra al nord magica iena segna per noi
Dicevano I ragazzi dei palazzi negli studi 
Di tatuaggi dentro I club di quartieri quelli marci

Se penso a me stesso mi stresso e dentro è dinamite

Distratto dalla società che sta affogando

Ma quanto male farmi, io cerco di scordarti
Cerco di disprezzarti, ma metto via le armi
Artigli già rientrati, i denti non sporgenti
Quanti finti interventi, quanti ripensamenti
Le notti più crudeli, i tempi sono quelli
Ma quanti sbandamenti, questi respiri freddi
E adesso che ti inventi, tutte le uscite insieme
E molti sti lamenti, questi destini incerti
Come mi trovi cambiato?, ora dimmi in fretta
Mi gira strana sta vita, bastarda chi diserta
Lo fa per cambiare il mondo, e pure se fallisce
Magari ha perso qualcosa, e più non ci riesce

Una promessa fatta per sempre come mery

Quelle volte che sei lontana, la tua voce nell'anima
La mia mano in auto, la marcia ingrana
Tra le mie canzoni e la mariua
Chissà se proprio adesso, tu mi starai ascoltando
Che sei a mille miglia da dove io sto cantando
Come quelle volte che sei lontana, la tua voce nell'anima
Chissà se proprio adesso, tu mi starai ascoltando
Che sei a mille miglia da dove io sto cantando
La mia mano in auto, la marcia ingrana
Tra le mie canzoni e la mariua

Il resto tutto bene, cara amica ti scrivo
Tu sei laggiù, adesso il mondo c'è crollato addosso
Spostami il palinsesto, danze tribali e penso
Tutti I tuoi lati nascosti sotto il cappotto rosso
Cammino a più non posso
Voglio cercare le orme bagnate dei tuoi passi
Vorrei averti tutta adesso
Nuda sul letto, due cannette e pure solo un sorso
Di quello che ci manda fuori il tempo di un morso
Eppure in questo mestiere ci si ritrova soli
Tra le corriere, macchine, ti sposti, navi e voli
Il mio respiro grande, di tutta la giornata
La mia rivincita sei tu, nuova puntata

Quelle volte che sei lontana, la tua voce nell'anima
La mia mano in auto, la marcia ingrana
Tra le mie canzoni e la mariua
Chissà se proprio adesso, tu mi starai ascoltando
Che sei a mille miglia da dove io sto cantando
Come quelle volte che sei lontana, la tua voce nell'anima
Chissà se proprio adesso, tu mi starai ascoltando
Che sei a mille miglia da dove io sto cantando
La mia mano in auto, la marcia ingrana
Tra le mie canzoni e la mariua

E qui dall'ultima volta sempre le stesse cose
Aprono e chiudono bar e a ment na rapos'
Aument chi arrfus, o tropp è carstus
Fratè ma come stai? ma ij nun c'car scus'
Solo per la strada che porta all'inferno
Vivere in eterno, sì, ma a quale prezzo
Quanto t'incontrai sembrava tutto bello
Ci ritrovammo a pranzo soli come un frutto acerbo
E adesso è andata come doveva andare
Chiuso nel vischio, il microfono non fa respirare 
Aspetto il cielo che migliori la mia giornata
Attendo il giusto suono per una nuova puntata

Quann o' tiemp n'aspett vuless stà aller almen nu mument 
Quann o' tiemp n'aspett vuless stà aller almen nu mument 

Chissà se proprio adesso, tu mi starai ascoltando
Che sei a mille miglia da dove io sto cantando
Come quelle volte che sei lontana, la tua voce nell'anima
Chissà se proprio adesso, tu mi starai ascoltando
Che sei a mille miglia da dove io sto cantando
La mia mano in auto, la marcia ingrana

Mic check, torna il re dei cypher
Il tipo che sai che ha le bombe a tempo e il timer
Spegni pure l’iMac, non credere all’hype, man
Guardo ‘sti rapper live e gli serve MacGyver
Arrivo dalle battle, dalla tana delle tigri
Ho mandato molta più gente a casa io della crisi
Ho alzato gli standard, in strada come in TV
Ho sfidato i miei amici e battuto i miei miti
Che ne sai di questi giorni, non ritorneranno mai, guarda le cicatrici (ricorda)
Ho la fame di essere il migliore prima di essere il migliore
La vendetta sul piatto, riscaldo il riscatto su un loop di ventiquattro ore
La mia penna miete, sangue per chi ha sete
Taglia i nodi della rete, fotte un cazzo di chi cazzo siete
Al microfono vi spiego, vi piego e poi vi spezzo, cracker
Mezzo McGregor, mezzo Mayweather

Tu vivi l'ansia, ma no stress flow best miezz a tutt'e contest
Nascosto dietro al Vesuvio dove non vedi il sole
Le notti di plenilunio scrivendo rime hardcore
Ed un microfono come arma, spaccavo gangaster
Pensando a quando sul palco frate staccavo teste
O nome o sai che è Clementi e quann a iena abball

Clementino,"E le fiamme di chi sa aspettare
Tra le pagine di queste strade
Quando tutto si tramuta in nero
Tu sei la cosa più bella che ho

Il vento sulla faccia
Scappiamo tra le strade
E vedi quelle case in orizzonte e le serate
Mi dici sempre che io sono un pò rincoglionito
E non ti ho fatto i complimenti per questo vestito
Forse lo sai dovrei comportarmi ancora meglio
Ma dopo l’ennesima notte che rimango sveglio
Oggi che ancora tremo
Oggi che è ancora peggio
Adesso che ti cerco e non trovo coraggio
Da solo in macchina fumo un’altra sigaretta
La musica che consumo ma con la radio spenta
Sempre stata al mio fianco
E nelle notti in bianco
Pure quando sguazzavo stanco le mani nel fango
Non me ne frega un cazzo di ciò che dice la gente
Le favole distrutte da sti “felici e contenti”
Continuerò a cercarti perché ti troverò
Perché lo sai, sei la cosa più bella che ho

E le fiamme di chi sa aspettare
Tra le pagine di queste strade
Quando tutto si tramuta in nero
Tu sei la cosa più bella che ho

E la pioggia sotto questo cielo
Tu sei la cosa più bella che ho
Sei la cosa più bella che ho

Messaggi senza risposta
Ma dove cazzo sei?
Rimasta nei pensieri miei non so cosa farei
Una ferita indelebile che non passa più
Io mi sentivo invincibile, adesso manchi tu
Questo sole che mi acceca, l’orizzonte è distante
E senza le parole, silenzio è così grande
Spero che cambi sto giorno senza far ritardo
Aspetto l’estate come la bandiera al traguardo
Un uomo che non può restare ancora sempre solo
Non riesco a respirare se martella questo suono
E canto fino ad annullarmi questo mi è rimasto
Perché lottare senza armi forse è il modo giusto
Quando sembra che tutto ricominci da capo
Quando sembra che sto film non sia ancora finito
Quando dalla melma non risali senza botte
Sei l’unico pensiero che ritornerà sta notte

Pur si mo nun t vec chiu
Par ca staj vicin

Una foto è quello che rimane
E la pioggia sotto questo cielo
Tu sei la cosa più bella che ho

Non sento più nessuno e non ricordo niente
Dammi quello che manca, ti cerco tra la gente
La vista che si annebbia, non riesci a respirare
Quando esplode la rabbia, perché fa un male cane
Tra questi falsi idoli e il degrado generale
Io che corro nei vicoli rischiando di inciampare
Tra le vicende di una società che sta affondando
E adesso solo tu sei tutto quello che è rimasto
Guardo sto futuro da ciò che ho avuto in passato
Ma sono ancora in piedi ancora abbattuto e rinato

If you need a friend or a lover
Or a place that you can hide
I will always be there

You're all that I need

Whatever it takes
I won't make the same mistake again

Seemed made for just a boy and girl

I hear you whisper I always love you
I know it's over and yet
It's easy to remember but oh so hard to forget
So I must dream to have your hand caress me fingers press me tight
I'd rather dream than have that lonely feeling stealing through the night
Each little moment is clear before me
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember but so hard to forget

Cleo Laine,"He was beautiful, beautiful to my eyes,
From the moment I saw him sun filled the skies.
He was so, so beautiful, beautiful just to hold,
In my dreams he was springtime, winter was cold.

How could I tell him what I so clearly could see?
Though I longed for him, another trusted me completely so I never could be free.

Aah but it was beautiful, knowing now that he cared,
I will always remember times that we shared.
Now it's all over still the feelings linger on,
For my dream keeps returning now that he's gone.

For it was beautiful, beautiful, beautiful to be loved.",He Was Beautiful,1983

Trying to work out life's happy plan

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

Cleo Laine,"Good times and bum times,
I've seen them all and, my dear,
I'm still here.
Plush velvet sometimes,
Sometimes just pretzels and beer,
But I'm here.
I've stuffed the dailies
In my shoes.
Strummed ukuleles,
Sung the blues,
Seen all my dreams disappear,
But I'm here.
I've slept in shanties,
Guest of the W.P.A.,
But I'm here.
Danced in my scanties,
Three bucks a night was the pay,
But I'm here.
I've stood on bread lines
With the best,
Watched while the headlines
Did the rest.
In the Depression was I depressed?
Nowhere near.
I met a big financier
And I'm here.
I've been through Gandhi,
Windsor and Wally's affair,
And I'm here.
Amos 'n' Andy,
Mah-jongg and platinum hair,
And I'm here.
I got through Abie's
Irish Rose,
Five Dionne babies,
Major Bowes,
Had heebie-jeebies
For Beebe's
Bathysphere.
I lived through Brenda Frazier
And I'm here.
I've gotten through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover,
Gee, that was fun and a half.
When you've been through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover,
Anything else is a laugh.
I've been through Reno.
I've been through Beverly Hills,
And I'm here.
Reefers and vino,
Rest cures, religion and pills,
And I'm here
Been called a pinko
Commie tool,
Got through it stinko
By my pool.
I should have gone to an acting school.
That seems clear,
Still, someone said, ""She's sincere,""
So I'm here.
Black sable one day.
Next day it goes into hock,
But I'm here.
Top billing Monday,
Tuesday you're touring in stock,
But I'm here.
First you're another
Sloe-eyed vamp,
Then someone's mother,
Then you're camp.
Then you career from career
To career.
I'm almost through my memoirs.
And I'm here.
I've gotten through ""Hey, lady, aren't you whoozis?
Wow! What a looker you were.""
Or, better yet, ""Sorry, I thought you were whoozis.
Whatever happened to her?""
Good times and bum times,
I've seen 'em all and, my dear,

Sometimes just pretzels and beer,

Cleo Laine,"Here's to the ladies who lunch
Everybody laugh.
Lounging in their caftans 
And planning a brunch
On their own behalf.
Off to the gym,
Then to a fitting,
Claiming they're fat.
And looking grim,
'Cause they've been sitting
Choosing a hat.
Does anyone still wear a hat?
I'll drink to that.

And here's to the girls who play smart
Aren't they a gas?
Rushing to their classes
In optical art,
Wishing it would pass.
Another long exhausting day,
Another thousand dollars,
A matinee, a Pinter play,
Perhaps a piece of Mahler's.
I'll drink to that.
And one for Mahler!

And here's to the girls who play wife
Aren't they too much?
Keeping house but clutching
A copy of Life,
Just to keep in touch.
The ones who follow the rules,
And meet themselves at the schools,
Too busy to know that they're fools.
Aren't they a gem?
I'll drink to them!
Let's all drink to them!

And here's to the girls who just watch
Aren't they the best?
When they get depressed,
It's a bottle of Scotch,
Plus a little jest.
Another chance to disapprove,
Another brilliant zinger,
Another reason not to move,
Another vodka stinger.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!
I'll drink to that.

So here's to the girls on the go
Everybody tries.
Look into their eyes,
And you'll see what they know:
Everybody dies.

The dinosaurs surviving the crunch.

Do together,

Swear together,
Wear together,

The concerts you enjoy together,
Neighbors you annoy together,
Children you destroy together,

It's not so hard to be married
When two maneuver as one.
It's not so hard to be married,
And, Jesus Christ, is it fun!

It's sharing little winks together,
Drinks together,
Kinks together,
That make marriage a joy.
The bargains that you shop together,
Cigarettes you stop together,
Clothing that you swap together,
That make perfect relationships.
Uh-huh
M-hm

It's not talk of God and the decade ahead that
Allows you to get through the worst.
It's ""I do"" and ""you don't"" and ""nobody said that""
And ""who brought the subject up first?""
It's the little things,
The little things, the little things, the little things.

The little ways you try together,
Cry together,
Lie together,
That make perfect relationships.
Becoming a cliche together,
Growing old and grey together,
Withering away together,
That make marriage a joy.

It's not so hard to be married,
It's much the simplest of crimes.
It's not so hard to be married

I've done it three or four times.

It's the people that you hate together,
Bait together,
Date together,

Getting a divorce together,

Cleo Laine,"Doo-doo-doo-doo!
Doo-doo-doo-doo!
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!

You could drive a person crazy,
You could drive a person mad.
First you make a person hazy
So a person could be had,
Then you leave a person dangling sadly
Outside your door,
Which could only make a person gladly
Want you even more.
I could understand a person
If it's not a person's bag.
I could understand a person
If he meant as a gag.
But worse 'n that,
A person that
Titillates a person and then leaves her flat
Is crazy,
He's a troubled person,
He's a truly crazy person himself.

When a person's personality is personable,
He should not sit like a lump.
It's harder than a matador coercin' a bull
To try to get you off of your rump.
So single and attentive and attractive a man
Is everything a person could wish,
But turning off a person is the act of a man
Who likes to pull the hooks out of fish.

Knock-knock! Is anybody there?
Knock-knock! It really isn't fair.
Knock-knock! I'm workin' all my charms.
Knock-knock! A zombie's in my arms.
All that sweet affection!
What is wrong?
Where's the loose connection?
How long, O Lord, how long?
Bobby-baby-Bobby-bubbi-Bobby,

You could drive a person buggy,
You could blow a person's cool.
Like you make a person feel all huggy
While you make her feel a fool.
When a person says that you upset her,
That's when you're good.
You impersonate a person better
Than a zombie should.
I could understand a person
If he wasn't good in bed.
I could understand a person
If he actually was dead.
Exclusive you!
Elusive you!
Will any person ever get the juice of you?
You're crazy,
You're a lovely person,
You're a moving,
Deeply maladjusted,
Never to be trusted,

But oh my darling always I'll remember,
when your lips were close to mine
And we saw the midnight sun.
We saw the midnight sun.

Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice,
Warmer than a summer night.
The clouds were like an alabaster palace,
Rising to a summer light.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
And then I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit bay?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a Nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
And the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night?
It's a thrill I still don't really quite believe.
That lovely midnight sun, but after you were gone,
There was still some stardust on my sleeve,
There was still some stardust on my sleeve.

That flame may dwindle,
And the stars forget to shine.
We'll see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But darling always I'll remember,
when your lips are close to mine
And we saw the midnight sun.
Yes we saw the midnight sun,
We both saw the midnight sun.",Midnight Sun,1991

About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met

Is just to tell them that I love you, allot

I'm watching the sea,,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,

Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!

Do you remember?
Will you return?

Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Cleo Laine,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Since you been gone I'm hurtin' inside, yeah
Well I want you baby by my side

But I'm cryin', you know I'm cryin'
Hear me cryin' baby
Hear me crying
Hear me crying

Cletus Black,"There've been too many times
When I never said what was on my mind.
How was I to know you'd go so soon?
Your God would come to take you home
Leaving me stumbling over
Stupid lines on a shabby page.
Daddy, sometimes I'm filled with rage.
I lost the only thing that was really mine.
So daddy, can you hear me?
Oh daddy, do I still make you laugh?
And I know just what you'd say-
Is this really the time and place
To say all of those things that we never said?
There've been too many times
When my head was filled with stupid pride.
I hope you're laughing now
That all these words have been set aside.
Oh daddy, can you hear me?
Oh daddy, do I still make you laugh?
And I know just what you'd say-
Is this really the time and place
To say all of those things that we never said?
(solo)
It seems so long since I saw you,
And yet it seems like yesterday.
There's no need to make amends
For I look on us as friends.
Oh daddy, can you hear me?
Oh daddy, do I still make you laugh?
Oh daddy, can you hear me?
Oh daddy, do I still make you laugh?
Still make you laugh?
There've been too many times.
There've been too many times.
There've been too many times.
There've been too many times...

The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,2000

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?

Might have gone but what for?
