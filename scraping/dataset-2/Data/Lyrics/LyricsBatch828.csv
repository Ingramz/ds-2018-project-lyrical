Paul Weller,"It's not important for you to know my name
Nor I to know yours
If we communicate for two minutes only
It will be enough

For knowing that someone in this world
Feels as desperate as me
And what you give is what you get

It doesn't matter if we never meet again
What we have said will always remain
If we get through for two minutes only
It will be a start

For knowing that someone in this life
Loves with a passion called hate
And what you give is what you get

If I never ever see you
If I never ever see you
If I never ever see you, again

If I never ever see you
If I never ever see you
If I never ever see you, again

And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get

And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get",Start,2010
Paul Weller,"7 & 3 Is The Striker's Name by Paul Wellerittle prick, you're crossing every line
The winds of change and the sands of time
7 & 3 is the striker's name
Washing his hands as he walks away

Come on, come on
The sky has arrived
Wings are clipped
But we still might fly away

Come on, come on
The sky has arrived
Wings are clipped
But we still might fly away

Curse my master, and his slaves
And his soldiers too
Curse those fuckers, in their castle
They're all bastards too

Keep me stable, I may be fine
I don't want to fuck it up this time
She loves me tender, she loves me strong
We're star-cross'd lovers and we sing this song

Come on, come on
The sky has arrived
Wings are clipped
But we still might fly away

Come on, come on
The sky has arrived
Wings are clipped
But we still might fly away

Curse my master, and his slaves
And his soldiers too
Curse those fuckers, in their castle
They're all bastards too

Riding in the night like a thief, although
Not too skinny and not too bold
7 & 3 is the striker's name
Washing his hands as he walks away

She loves me tender and she loves me strong
We're star-cross'd lovers and we sing this song
Here goes...",7 & 3 Is the Strikers Name,2010
Paul Weller,"Aim high, hum along, lady
Too shy, bite my tongue and maybe
Unfair if you ever leave me
Need you like water needs a flower

Deep ravines within ourselves
Drunken nights up on the shelf
God, strike me down if I don't come through
You're my baby and I need you

Aim high to come along, lady
Blue sky, you are my nectar and
Forever need you, won't you stay with me?
Never leave you, don't you leave me too

Darkness has no flames
I feel I'm in with the chance
To give this world a different spin
Convince us we will win
We will win, we will win

Come fly and hum along, lady
Thus far the life is just a flower
Just aim high and save ourselves forever
Hung dry like a spider after shower

Paul Weller,"Tiny, tiny shades of light
Came dancing gently through my window
As I waved goodbye
To my other life

The dying planet grew dark and still
My feisty engines took me up and then
I could see ?
Oh, Andromeda

I'm not ethereal, unreal
And I'm not waiting any longer
For this world to be still

I raise my glass and I win my pride
Sweet Andromeda

My mood gets lifted with the gravity's pull
Looks like I'm smiling but I'm dying too
Within the last ?

Paul Weller,"A bag of nerves
I seem to suppress
Alien of being
Not known to duress
Moonshine, moonshine
There's something in the hills

I cannot possess
As dark as Sunday
We're woven again
I pack no meaning
I'm shrunken in vain
Moonshine, moonshine
I'm bleak as Tuesday
I seek no applause
Not really like me
Refuse to go on

My faith has been surely fired
I'm schooled in the test of time

Turn your face to the wall

Can't you see how distant we are?

'Cause my eyes have dried

Time before [Incomprehensible]

Wrapped it up in sin
And sold it to the night

Paul Weller,"Well, once I was a lover
With beautiful long brown hair
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I walk down any street
Men would stop and stare
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Boys would whistle
And their eyes would shine
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

My skirt would swish
To show my long strong legs so fine
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So fine

Was a time, I was a mother
Darling children would come for me
I loved them and I'd feed them
And in their eyes such love I'd see
They'd call my name in times of need

Trees Lyrics
And I'd be there
(And they loved me)
And they loved me
(And we loved you)

And I loved them
(And they loved me)
And they loved me
(And we loved you)

Once I was a man
My cock as hard as wood
I stood as strong as any tree
Look back, the winds are catching me

So, my woman, love me
And you know I am strong
I was raised and nude as trees
I stood

Trees Lyrics
My baby loves me
(My baby loves me)
My baby loves me
(My baby loves me)
My baby loves me
(My baby loves me)

I was back to this time itself
Deep and sharp within my empty cell
A comedy of errors I've become
And all my devils, I forgot
And on my name or where I've come

Someone take me back to the fields
Where I need to be
So once again I can stand tall and feel
Once more, a tree",Trees,2010
Paul Weller,"Two fat ladies at my door'
Over the hills and far much more
Seeking the teats of mother and child
Some marked bitter, others mild
Two fat ladies click, click, cock
I've gone too far and far too quick

Yester, yesterday is gone
Very nice then but now all worn
Dry that, dry that tear away
Come back when the world has changed

On and on and on we go
Courage and brave for all on show
On and on, on and on we go
Two fat ladies, 88

Chatting and waiting on a garden gate
Two young fellows not too late
What's the time andWhat's our fate?
Sugar, sugar - ain't it sweet
Loves your mind but rots your teeth
Looking for sugar for my bowl

Up the apples
And down the road Been all over
This town today
But can't find my feet
Or stand up straight

Silver veils that dance and hide
Golden tales lay on their side
Raise my glass, I'm in the pink

I'm sitting here
Waitinq for the sun to sink
On and on and on we go",Two Fat Ladies,2010
Paul Weller,"There's twelve steps to Eddie Cochran baby
Two flowers growing through
The pavement crack
Wish I was purple but I'm red instead
Catch a ride it's so pure
And fresh and clean
Shafts of light that stream and holler
The dust that dances
On the air to me, you'll see
Your lips are like milk, honey
I'll grow through your cracks
And you'll see
I'll make it right, I'll make it right",Up the Dosage,2010
Paul Weller,"Fish from the paper, fresh from the sea
The cracks in the pavement, the city in siege
I don't know where to replace it or who to believe
Can't find on the pavement or lay on his knees

We're going to wake up the nation, don't be no drag
Shake up the station, a night up ahead
We're going to wake up the nation, don't be no drag
Shake up the station, a night on our hands

Nowhere to be

Would fade just into sight
And oh, the feelings that changed
Were thicker than the brush

Of old southern Spain
And when senoritas sing

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Paul West,"Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

They tell him he looks nervous
He says, ""You look too close""

Shoves his dinner in the hall
The number that he's dialing
He'll really want to call
He gets down and starts praying

It's okay
Stained and not for fun
I won't stain your blood
I won't stain love (x2)

Got an eye for an exit
And an ear that just begs to
I hear does anybody here think you're great
Forever they ignore us
Not the guys that only bores us
Together we're gonna love everything that they hate

Hope to die
Is it love?

Starts to ring Ding dong Ding dong

In the middle of his work 
Starts a tune to the moon up above

Simply telling us to fall in love 

And that's why birds do it, bees do it 
Even educated fleas do it

Even lazy jellyfish do it 
Let's do it, let's fall in love

They say that roosters do it 
With a doodle and cock 

Some Argentines, without means do it 
I hear even Boston beans do it

Moths in your rugs they do it

The chimpanzees in the zoos do it, 
Some courageous kangaroos do it

But you ain't got me, no you ain't got me

With the shortest memory

Give me tambourines a pair of shaking hips

Well so long to the so-so years
Of river mouths and chandeliers
Morning crews that make me yawn
I hold my heave until I'm gone
I cock an ear and crack a smile
Last in line and single file
The only ones standing at this speech
Are the ones with the brooms and the mops and the keys

It's my last chance
Now I can't go back
It's my last chance

Bouncing balls and spinning wheels

Turning calendars forgotten
Expiration date is rotten
Behind my eyes I've seen it all
Years go past upon the wall

Checking on her face
Checks his sleeve for his ace
And both just in case wear clean underwear
Games would be played
Excuses would be made
The stupid things they said
In their prayers

 Oh about a love untold
 It`s a love untold 

Soft hands slowly move across the blank white page
Thinking of words for my silent lips and fingers to obey

And I've also met a chick or two
But I still can learn a trick or two

Kind of think I should know much more of it
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it

When there's no one there but you
There must be more to life than sleeping
Single in a bed for two

More than an Injun loves his scalps
More than a yodeler loves his alps

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

Willie's been fed and I've tucked him in bed, thank goodness the darling's asleep
He's a wonderful boy and a joy and a boon

[Spoken] 
Ahh, gee, you should have seen him this afternoon

Bang went the bridge lamp, down went the table, crash went the china tray
But he said ""I couldn't help it, my rocking horse ran away!""
Rip rip went the curtain, wham went the window, crunch went the new buffet
And I heard him tell his daddy ""My rocking horse ran away""

Somehow Indians got into our front room
Our cowboy grabbed for his gun and went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Slam went the screen door, smash went the mirror, looks like I'll soon be gray
But he smiles and what's the difference and maybe some Mother's Day
I'll remember when his rocking horse ran away

Got up early this morning, wore a flimsy negligee
Had to hurry to fix the breakfast and get daddy on his way
Figured I could get the paper, so the neighbors wouldn't see
So I sneaked out on the porch, very, very quietly
Wham went the dish pan, then came a holler, up went the neighbor's shade
It was Mother's little darling, out on a commando raid

Came home late from a picture. I was tired, my shoes were tight
Took off my stockings, dropped my girdle
Got undressed and pulled the light. boy!
Slipped into my night gown, then tiptoed across the floor
Better have a look at Junior, so I peeked into his door
Clang, clang, clang went a cowbell, whee went a whistle, I nearly had a stroke
It was mother's precious baby, just havin' his little joke

Always just when I'm breathin' a peaceful sigh
There's G-Men, coppers and robbers and hi-yo silver!
Bam went the book case, boot went the fruit bowl, boom went the glass bouquet
But he smiles and what's the difference and maybe some mother's day
I'll remember when, bang went the lamp, down went the table
Crash went the tray, rip rip went the curtain, wham went a window
Clang went a bell, whee went a whistle, bam went a pan, slam went a door

Bang went the bridge lamp, down went the table, crash went the china tray
But he said ""I couldn't help it, my rocking horse ran away!""
Rip rip went the curtain, wham went the window, crunch went the new buffet
And I heard him tell his daddy ""My rocking horse ran away""

Somehow Indians got into our front room
Our cowboy grabbed for his gun and went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Slam went the screen door, smash went the mirror, looks like I'll soon be gray
But he smiles and what's the difference and maybe some Mother's Day
I'll remember when his rocking horse ran away

Got up early this morning, wore a flimsy negligee
Had to hurry to fix the breakfast and get daddy on his way
Figured I could get the paper, so the neighbors wouldn't see
So I sneaked out on the porch, very, very quietly
Wham went the dish pan, then came a holler, up went the neighbor's shade
It was Mother's little darling, out on a commando raid

Came home late from a picture. I was tired, my shoes were tight
Took off my stockings, dropped my girdle
Got undressed and pulled the light. boy!
Slipped into my night gown, then tiptoed across the floor
Better have a look at Junior, so I peeked into his door
Clang, clang, clang went a cowbell, whee went a whistle, I nearly had a stroke
It was mother's precious baby, just havin' his little joke

Always just when I'm breathin' a peaceful sigh
There's G-Men, coppers and robbers and hi-yo silver!
Bam went the book case, boot went the fruit bowl, boom went the glass bouquet
But he smiles and what's the difference and maybe some mother's day
I'll remember when, bang went the lamp, down went the table
Crash went the tray, rip rip went the curtain, wham went a window
Clang went a bell, whee went a whistle, bam went a pan, slam went a door

I'd say that I had spring fever, but I know it isn't spring
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale without a song to sing
O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring
I keep I were someone else, walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard from a guy I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams
I'm as giggy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way, that it might as well be spring

Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone

But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man

But I don't care

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

In what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Manhattan Serenade,1996

I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams
I'm as giggy as a baby on a swing

Why am I sitting alone tonight,
when I could be out where the lights are bright?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.
Why am i wasting these precios years?
Why am I crying these bitter tears?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.

(Chorus):
Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers,
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours,
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim.
Jim never tells me I'm his hearts desire.
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years I've wasted on him.
Sometimes when I get feeling low,
I say “Let's call it quits.”
Then I hang on and let him go 
Breaking my heart in bits.
Some day I know tht Jim will up and leave me,
But even if he does you can believe me,
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim.

Paul Weston & His Orchestra,"On the summer shore, where the breakers roar
Lovers sat on the glist'ning sand
And they talked of love while the moon above
And the stars seemed to understand
Then she grew more cold, and he grew more bold
Till she tho't that they had better go
But altho' he heard, he not even stirred
Only murmured in tones soft and low

Cuddle up a little closer, lovey mine
Cuddle up and be my little clinging vine
Like to feel your cheek so rosy
Like to make you comfy, cozy
'Cause I love from head to toesie, lovey mine

Then she deigned to rest on his manly chest
Her dear head with its flowing curls
And she said, ""I'd stay on this lap for aye
How I envy the Capland girls!""

I'm building castles high

They come again in the morning

Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
Nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams they fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked ev'rywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles

When shadows creep, when I'm asleep
To lands of hope I stray
Then at daybreak, when I awake
My bluebird flutters away

Happiness, come forth and cheer me

Until I smile at you",I'll Never Smile Again,2002
Paul Weston & His Orchestra,"Each time I look at you 
Is like the first time
Each time you're near me 
The thrill is new
And there is nothing 
That I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight 
Of you for

The more I see you, 
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling 
Just grows and grows
With every sigh 
I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me 
Can only be you
My arms won't free you, 
My heart won't try",The More I See You,2002
Paul Weston & His Orchestra,"The most beautiful girl in the world
Picks my ties out, eats my candy,
Drinks my brandy,
The most beautiful girl in the world!

The most beautiful girl in the world
Isn't Garbo, isn't Dietrich,
But the sweet trick
Who can make me believe it's a beautiful world!

Social?  Not a bit!
natural kind of wit,
She'd shine anywhere,
And she hasn't got platinum hair!

The most beautiful house in the world
Has a mortgage, what do I care?
It's goodbye care
When my slippers are next to the ones that belong
To the one and only beautiful girl in the world!

The most beautiful house in the world
Has a mortgage, what do I care?
It's goodbye care
When my slippers are next to the ones that belong
To the one and only,
The one and only,
The one and only beautiful girl in the world!",The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,2002
Paul Weston & His Orchestra,"When the evenin' sun goes down
You will find me hangin' 'round
Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
But it's my life

Many people just like me
Dreamin' of old used-to-be's
Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
Ah, but it's my life

Listen to the blues that they're playin'
Listen what the blues are sayin'

Life is just another scene
In this old world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
But it's my life

Oh, the night life ain't no good life
Oh, but it's my life
Yeah, it's my life",Night Life,2002
Paul Weston & His Orchestra,"Swing high, swing low, upon the trapeze
At first you'll fall, but then
A year from now you'll do it with ease
Over and over and over again
A star does not come out of the sky
He starts to work at ten
To reach the top, you gotta keep trying
Over and over and over and over
And over and over again

It's up in the morning and down in the ring
Acrobat, rider and clown
Queen of the wire and aerial king
Work or you'll forfeit your crown
You stick to your trick
And your trick will be art
Artists are hard-working men
After you're perfect, that's when you first start
Over and over again, once again, and again
Do it over and over again

Swing high, swing low, upon the trapeze
At first you'll fall, but then
A year from now, you'll do it with ease
Over and over and over and over again
To reach the top you gotta keep trying
Over and over and over and over
And over and over again
Over and over again",Over and Over Again,2002
