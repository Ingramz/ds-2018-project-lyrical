Ian McFeron,"Cold rain running down the front of my shirt
I'm flat on my back wheels in the dirt
Angel makes her face up out on Baker Street
She's straddling the shifter in my front seat
There's nothing to lose, it's a heartbreak
The deck's stacked
So put your foot to the floor and darling don't look back

We're making night tracks through the blazing rain
Blowin' pistons, workin' the fast lane
Red line burnin', pocket's full of cash
Angel writes her name in lipstick on my dash
There's nothing to lose
It's a bad break but baby we're backed
Tonight we'll blow off the doors and honey we won't look back
We held it in our hearts in the pourin' rain
We made it through the heart of a hurricane
We tore it apart and put it together again

Well angel, won't you believe in love for me
C'mon and meet me tonight, darling, out in the street
We'll move with the city in the dark
You got to walk, it talk, it in your heart
There's nothin' to lose it's a heartache
The deck's stacked
So put your foot to the floor, darling
Tonight we'll blow off the doors, baby
We're gonna even the score
And honey we won't look back",Don't Look Back (I'll Be Gone),2003
Ian McKellen,"""Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride 
And greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight
And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair 
As the dining room proudly presents
Your dinner!""

Be our guest, be our guest
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
And we'll provide the rest
Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the grey stuff, it's delicious
Don't believe me, ask the dishes

They can sing, they can dance
After all, miss, this is France
And a dinner here is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then you'll
Be our guest oui, our guest
Be our guest

Beef ragout, cheese soufflé
Pie and pudding, on flambé
We'll prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret
You're alone and you're scared
But the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes, I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks

And it's all in perfect taste that you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be our guest If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest
Be our guest, be our guest, be our guest

Life is so unnerving
For a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Ah, those good old days when we were useful (hey Cogsworth)
Suddenly those good old days are gone
Too long we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills!
Most days we just lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and oops-a-daisy!

It's a guest, it's a guest
Sake's alive, well I'll be blessed!
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft-shoein'
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing

I'll get warm, piping hot
Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?
Clean it up, we want the company impressed
We've got a lot to do!
Is it one lump or two?
For you, our guest (she's our guest)
She's our guest (she's our guest)

Be our guest, be our guest!
Our command is your request
It's been years since we've had anybody here
And we're obsessed
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please
While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you, we'll keep going

Course by course, one by one
'Til you shout, ""enough I'm done!""
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest
Be our guest
Be our guest
Please, be our guest",Be Our Guest,2017
Ian McKellen,"We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast he's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home 'til he's dead
Good and dead

Kill the Beast

Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage to the sticking place

We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

Call it war, call it threat
You can bet they all will follow
For in times like this, they'll do just as I say

There's a beast running wild, there's no question
But I fear the wrong monster's released

Sally forth! tally ho!
Grab your sword, grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go

We don't like what we don't understand in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast

Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger's just increased
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come, we're fifty strong
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the Beast

Kill the Beast, kill the Beast",The Mob Song,2017
Ian McKellen,"There's something sweet, and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear, and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched, she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

New, and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True, that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

Well, who'd have thought? Well, bless my soul, Well, who'd have known?

Well, who indeed? And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?

It's so peculiar, wait and see, we'll wait and see a few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before

Here's a thought, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before

What mama?
There may be something there that wasn't there before

What is it, what's there?
I'll tell you when you're older
Okay, I'm older

Ian McLagan,"I took a long, long trip to the city
I was determined to get somewhere
I spent all my hard earned money
I had saved to put me there

Big bayou where did you go
To the river that's running slow
And to the Gulf of Mexico
Big bayou carry me home

I took a cotton picking job in Memphis

Stumble when I was in my prime
We cannot have it our way all the time,
And you cannot have it your way all the time

Does it have to be this way? 

Open your mouth and breathe on me
I need your sensitivity
Through the desert and ravine

Girl, I'm gonna give you a little kiss
You're gonna feel my hands all around you
Not a finger will you miss
After I turn you on, baby
I'm gonna blow your mind with some of this

Squeezed in that mauved dress you showed me
Child, that hemline's out of sight
With that foxy frame you're flaunting
It ain't no way it won't fit you right
We're going to a rock and roll revival
You know we're sure 'nuff gonna boogie tonight

They'd be playing them old and golden goodies
Used to blow my mind when I was a child
Back when I'd got my head together
I wouldn't walk a block, but I'd dance a mile
Girl, you better be in good shape tonight
'Cause we sure e'nuff gonna ball awhile

It's been a long, long time
Since I let me backbone bend
Oh, for them same sweet memories
When we didn't have nothing but time to spend
We'd boogie and ball all Saturday mornin'
Right back that night and ball again

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining 
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

For yonder beams a new and glorious morn

O night divine, O night, O night divine 

Truly he taught us to love one another 
His law is love and His gospel is peace 
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother 
And in His name all oppression shall cease

And fueling my own desires
I was a wild man

No, not swimming, women

I wanna go to Heaven
The place to be is right up there
I wanna go to Heaven
It's gonna be good so I won't despair

I decided to reform and pray
Beg mercy for my soul
I prayed in church
Threw away my bad habits
Prayed out of church
Adopted an entirely different role
I gave my money to the poor until I was poor
But at least I ensured that I would go up there
Instead of down below to the Inferno
Where the evil flames of desire
Burned higher and higher and higher

I'm gonna go to Heaven

Waved hi to St. Peter

Ian Paice,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car and
I was going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stop-watch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good
I had the tape deck roaring
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went of exploring
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it
I was turning tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
But at the canal turn I hit an only patch
Inebriation

Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Ooh can you hear my lies
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes

So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains
'Cause there was no tequila
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we get trashed we were laughing still

Ian Pooley,"Being with you
They call me the fool
They just don't know what love can do
They talk as if I'm just a baby.
They said I'd be used
Lost and confused
They'll never see you the way that I do
And I'll go along with all that you want me to.
I just can't wait to see you
I only need to hold you in my arms
I just can't wait to see you
And everything will be all right.
Maybe they're right
Maybe you're wrong
I only know the feeling is strong
I couldn't take any more good advice.
Believing in you the way that I do
I know our love will pull us through
I'll go with you as long as you want me to.
I just can't wait to see you
I only need to hold you in my arms

I just can't wait - I just can't wait - I just can't wait -
And even if the whole wide world should turn its back
It wouldn't change a thing
I love him and I'll give him everything.

Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,1999
Ian Shaw,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1999
Ian Shaw,"Tell me that it's true,
Tell me you agree,
I was meant for you,
You were meant for me.
Refrain
Dearly beloved, how clearly I see,
Somewhere in Heaven you were fashioned for me,
Angel eyes knew you,
Angel voices led me to you;
Nothing could save me,
Fate gave me a sign;
I know that I'll be yours come shower or shine;
So I say merely,
Dearly beloved be mine.
Repeat Refrain
",Dearly Beloved,2001
Ian Shaw,"every night was long and gloomy
shadows gathered in the air
no one ever listened to me
no one wondered, ""should I care?""
none in all the world to love me
none to count the stars at night
then the moon came out above me
and I saw that was young

I wished on the moon
For something I never knew
Wished on the moon
For more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On april days that would not dance by
I begged on the stars
To throw me a beam or two
Wished on the stars
And asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness
It all came true
I wished on the moon for you
",I Wished on the Moon,2001
Ian Shaw,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2001
Ian Shaw,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2003

Ian Tyson,"Carlos Zaragoza left his home in Casas Grandes when the moon was full
No money in his pocket, just a locket of his sister framed in gold
He rode into El Sueco, stole a rooster called Gallo Del Cielo
Then he swam the Rio Grande with that fighter nestled
Deep beneath his arm.

El Gallo Del Cielo was a rooster born in heaven so the legends say
His wings they had been broken, he had one eye
Rollin' crazy in his head
And he'd fought a hundred fights, and the legends say
That one night near El Sueco
They'd fought Gallo seven times, and seven times he'd
Left brave roosters dead.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in San Antonio
I have 27 dollars and the good luck of your picture
Framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Outside of San Diego, in the onion fields of Paco Monteverde
The Pride of San Diego lay sleeping on a fancy bed of silk
And they laughed when Zaragoza pulled the one-eyed
Del Cielo from beneath his coat
But they cried when Zaragoza walked away with a
Thousand dollar bill.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Barbara
I have fifteen hundred dollars and the good luck of
Your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Now the moon has gone to hiding and the lantern light
Spills shadows on a fighting sand
Where a wicked black named Zorro faces Gallo del Cielo in the night
But Carlos Zaragoza fears the tiny crack that runs across his rooster's beak
And he fears he has lost the fifty thousand dollars riding on the fight.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Clara
Yes, the money's on the table, I am holding to
Your good luck framed in gold
And everything we've dreamed of is riding on the spurs of Del Cielo
I pray that I'll return to buy the land Villa stole from father long ago.

Then the signal it was given, and the cocks rose
Together far above the sand
El Gallo del Cielo sunk a gaff into Zorro's shiny breast
They were separated quickly but they rose and fought
Each other thirty seven times
And the legends say that everyone agreed that del Cielo fought the best.

Then the screams of Zaragoza filled the night outside
The town of Santa Clara
As the beak of del Cielo lay broken like a shell within his hand
And they say that Zaragoza screamed a curse upon the
Bones of Pancho Villa
When Zorro rose up one last time and drove del
Cielo through the sand.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in
San Francisco
I have no money in my pocket, I no longer have
Your good luck framed in gold
I buried it last evening with the bones of my
Beloved Del Cielo
And I'll not return to buy the land Villa stole from
Father long ago.

Do the rivers still run muddy outside of my beloved
Casas Grandes?

Oes the scar upon my brother's face turn red when
He hears mention of my name?
Do the people of El Sueco curse the theft of Gallo del Cielo?
Well, tell my family not to worry, I will not return
To cause them shame.",Gallo del Cielo,1991
Ian Tyson,"Well it's two eggs up on whiskey toast
And home fries on the side
Wash it down with the road house coffee
Burns up your insides
Just a Canyon-Colorado Diner 
And a waitress I did love
I sat in the back neath an old stuffed bear
And a worn out Navajo rug

Well Old Jack, the boss, he left at six
And it's Katie bar the door
She'd pull down that Navajo rug 
And she'd spread it across the floor
Hey, I saw lightning cross the sacred mountains
Saw woven turtle doves 
I was sittin' next to Katie
On that old Navajo rug

[Chorus]
Aye, Aye, Aye, Katie
Shades of red and blue
Aye, Aye, Aye, Katie 
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you
Katie, shades of red and blue

Well I saw old Jack about a year ago
He said the place burned to the ground
And all I saved was this old bear tooth
And Katie, she's left town
Oh, but Katie, she got her souvenir too
Jack spat a tobacco plug
Well you should have seen her a-coming through the smoke
Draggin' that Navajo rug

[Chorus]

So every time I cross the sacred mountains
And lightning breaks above
It always takes me back in time
To my long lost Katie love
But everything keeps on a-moving
Yeah, everybody's on the go
You don't find things that last anymore
Like an old woven Navajo

Ian Tyson,"In a land the Spanish once had called the Northern Mystery, 
Where rivers run and disappear the mustang still is free.
By the Devil's wash and coyote hole in the wild Owyhee Range
Somewhere in the sage tonight the wind calls out his name.
Aye, aye, aye.

Come gather 'round me buckaroos and a story I will tell
Of the fugitive Claude Dallas who just broke out of jail.
You might think this tale is history from before the West was won, 
But the events that I'll describe took place in nineteen eighty-one.

He was born out in Virginia, left home when school was through;
In the deserts of Nevada he became a buckaroo, 
And he learned the ways of cattle, and he learned to sit a horse, 
And he always packed a pistol, and he practiced deadly force.

Then Claude he became a trapper, and he dreamed of the bygone days, 
And he studied bobcat logic and their wild and silent ways
In the bloody runs near Paradise, in monitors down south
Trapping cats and coyotes, living hand to mouth.
Aye, aye, aye.

Then Claude took to livin' all alone out many miles from town, 
A friend--Jim Stevens--brought supplies and he stayed to hang around.
That day two wardens--Pogue and Elms--rode into check Claude out, 
They were seeking violations and to see what Claude's about.

Now Claude had hung some venison, he had a bobcat pelt or two,
Pogue claimed they were out of season, he said ""Dallas, you're all through.""
But Dallas would not leave his camp.He refused to go to town.
As the wind howled thought the bull-camp they stared each other down.

Its hard to say what happened next, perhaps we'll never know, 
They were gonna take Claude in to jail, and he vowed he'd never go.
Jim Stevens heard the gunfire, and when he turned around
Bill Pogue was falling backwards, Conley Elms he fell face down.
Aye, aye, aye.

Jim Stevens walked on over;there was a gun near Bill Pogue's hand.
It was hard to say who drawn his first, but Claude had made his stand.
Claude said ""I am justified Jim, they were gonna cut me down, 
And a man's got a right to hang some meat
When he's livin' this far from town.""

It took eighteen men and fifteen months to finally run Claude down.
In the sage outside of Paradise they drove him to the ground.
Convicted up in Idaho--manslaughter by decree--
Thirty years at maximum, but soon Claude would break free.

There's two sides two this story, there may be no right or wrong, 
The lawman and the renegade have graced a thousand songs.
The story is an old one.Conclusion's hard to draw, 
But Claude's out in the sage tonight he may be the last outlaw.
Aye, aye, aye.

In a land the Spanish once had called the Northern Mystery, 
Where rivers run and disappear the mustang still is free.
By the Devil's wash and the coyote hole in the wild Owyhee Range
Somewhere in the sage tonight the wind calls out his name.
Aye, aye, aye",Claude Dallas,1996
Ian Tyson,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

She drank Canadian whiskey 
Pure blended whiskey 
She drank it like wine 
Her eyes were the color of Canadian whiskey 
Pure blended whiskey 
So light brown and fine

Brings her cases of whiskey

Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose

Sin pensar que ya es muy tarde
Y no sabré cómo quererte
Déjame que llore
Como aquel que sufre en vida
La tortura de llorar su propia muerte
Buena cómo eres salvaría
Mi esperanza con tu amor

Uno está tan solo en su dolor
Y uno está tan ciego en su penar
Pero un frío cruel
Que es peor que el odio
Punto muerto de las almas
Tumba horrenda y de mi amor

IBU,"Silly dreams I wake.
It was just a memory of how we used to be baby.
Early in the morning you would always call me.
And say how much you've missed me.

I think about, the times we shared.
Girl I'd give the world to have it all back again.
Even though the seasons been passing by,
I can't seem to get you off my mind.

[Chorus]
I can't get over you.
No I can't get over you.
Over and over I've tried to say goodbye.
(No, I can't. No I can't)
I can't get over you.
No I can't get over you.
Night after night I've asked myself why?
(Why I can't get over you.)

What can I do to stop this madness inside?
Should I go out? Should I stay at home?
Just the thought of you with another guy,
Makes me lose control, I'm going out of my mind.

When we're together, you made me feel better than anyone could ever.
All the pain and troubles, just burst away like bubbles baby.
And when the seasons are standing still,
It feels like eternity in my mind.

[Chorus]

Ever since the day we said
Farewell my life's been filled
With silence, Can't deny it
Laws of love and I can't defy it.

Driving down to your house one day,
Trying to think of sweet words to say,
Then I saw in your eyes that look of demise.
Now I can't stop thinking 'bout the times we 

Made out by the fireside,
Had dinner by the candlelight,
Broke up and made up so many times,
All vanished in just one night. 

Now what am I supposed to do,
In a nightmare that I thought would never come true?
You used to say time heals all wounds.
Tell me why I can't get over you.

[Chorus:Repeat x2]",I Can't Get Over You,2004

Cause I ain't gotta lie to kick it
Its easy for me to be pimpin'

Now if she understand that I am her blaming man
And when comes to sellin' out shes my sold out crowd
And if shes not the type that got a lot foreplay

Live life

When you figure out how
You're lost in the moment, you disappear

I'm telling you just how I feel

You don't have to be afraid to put your dream in action
You're never gonna fade, you'll be the main attraction
Wake up the members of the nation it's your time to be
Not a fantasy (not a fantasy)
Just remember me (just remember me)
When it turns out right (when it turns out right)

'Cause there's no chance unless you take one
And the time you see
Now if you live in your imagination
Tomorrow you'll be everybody's fascination
You see the brighter side of every situation

Na, na, na chill, chill, chill, na, na chill , where the weed at
It's da bullshit, bullshit, yo where the weed at fellas, what you lightin'

Yo, yo, you motherfuckers gon' learn
When it come to this shit, I ain't about takin' turns
'Cause Doc's in the place, the cold nigga, I'm too late to thaw
Doc unfold niggas 'til they ribs is raw

Whether you up the ball or ride the bitch
My pens write with a vengeance and Viagra in
Stay hard like the biceps when it's stacked
I'm gritty, I wouldn't love in a tennis match

I don't like to sign autographs half the time
I scribble my name and draw a jackass design
Calvin Kleins spilled on the floor, you just got
Dogged on the tour, so, send some new whores, H O

I got a food table to warm, a new neighbor to warn
And people at the label I'm on
Crunch time, what you think the forty-four is for
When I grub, I want the whole smorgas board

Gotta clean my act up and, get my thoughts straight
Stop smashin' the five and appear in the court dates
I won't ride the bike unless it's C B R
With no tricks but a bitch it'll be on next

I'm still wheel handlin, you die in a ambulance
Block prime scramblin', glock nine handlin'
Duckin' the flows of mind travelin'
You heard it before, you ain't Sunshine Anderson

Got a bomb plantin' and I'm ready for more
Bitches gettin' in my party givin' head at the do
All my niggas and my shorty's and get high in the audience
I carry a gaudy gun, you'll die in the audience

That's the- nah, nah, nah, nah, chill nigga

Yo, I put the pressure on a man without a gun in my hand
His limpin' lenny turn around and then I pump from the pants
One nine in each arm, I get hot as I squeeze from it
Now he's a cheap ornament, died in a street tournament

Peep the clues, not deep with dudes
My Benz don't carry shoes 'cause I'm cheap as Jews
But I let off this cannon bet your fleet would move
After that I tell you and what the beat to do

Fuck the Visine, duck when I lean out the window
With a shottie with me and myself and Irene and my team
Fuck your mainstream dry off feet
I'm explosive as Simon in Die Hard 3

Now you wavin' six flags like you at GA
'Cause my gun on standby like a flight delay
Sprayin' water on all those whoever's hot
Take they mic, take they jewels, then them Bezell, Doc

Stop IC-Don, get gone, nigga I'm here
Sippin' a beer, 5th with the clip in the rear
That'll lift him off his feet, make him flip in the air
I pull big guns out, like I'm hittin' a deer

You don't really know when trouble come
When you open your door and somebody
In yo, house chewin' bubble gum
With double guns, cocked in each hand
Nigga, you about to be buried in beach sand

I don't care if you broke or not
I don't care if you sell weed, dope, coke or not
Nigga, I still smoke the glock
Give your face polka dots, y'all better hope I stop

Man doom, I kidnap a classroom
Hide 'em in the left wing of my bathroom
Do you think you could survive all that we bring, ya
Bullets, comin' at ya just as long as your finger

And every, morning I linger on the corner just drinkin'
Borin' and thinkin', how I'm 'bout to score with this ink pen
You better hope we blow on this rappin' shit
You don't want us to go under the mattresses

Shorty lookin' at me funny like I don't get bank
My house is hot bitch, I swim in my fish tank
Every car got a bar, the whole clique drink
I'm a dirty nigga, nuts sweaty, dick stink

After we fuck, I'm takin' you to S and D's

I can train yo' bitch, with a chain an' whip
It blow the block down while I change the clip

'Cause the blunts that I light set off smoke alarms
And I stand on the corner 'til my coke is gone

But they know I got a gun big as Oprah's arm
And I know a old lady, that'll choke their moms
A attitude, that's what I don't walk without

Ic is the man, and I never been to Japan
Got a Japanese bitch, with my dick in her hand
This is the plan, I'm about to get in the van
Go and get rid of the man, I done did it again

Skunk I blow, then off to the trunk I go
Pull the pump out slow, dump out foe

With a black fifth up against my head, just, click, click, clickin' it
We check the barrel and start respinnin' it
We, I start, medics start sowing and restitching them
My constituents and scorpions poisonous stingers filled with opium

Stay grippin' 'em, I've got a venomous heart, filled with vigilance
That will shatter ten continents and ten palatinates

Peep the clues, not deep with dudes
My Benz don't carry shoes 'cause I'm cheap as Jews
But I let off this cannon bet your fleet would move
After that I tell you and what the beat to do

Fuck the Visine, duck when I lean out the window
With a shottie with me and myself and Irene and my team
Fuck your mainstream dry off feet
I'm explosive as Simon in Die Hard 3

Sippin' a beer, 5th with the clip in the rear

Bullets, comin' at ya just as long as your finger

And every, morning I linger on the corner just drinkin'
Borin' and thinkin', how I'm 'bout to score with this ink pen
You better hope we blow on this rappin' shit
You don't want us to go under the mattresses

I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said you're kind of cute I said yes I know
But by the way sweetheart what's your name
She said my friends like to call me exotic elaine
I said my name is the prince and she said why
I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy
But enough about me yo let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do
I popped some cash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town I wined her and dined her
She ask me did I like her I said well kinda
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape
I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death
I was arrested charged with agrivated assault

As we pulled up into her house I said I'm with you toots
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
She started winking and making little passes
At me she pat me close that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back I said oh your hands are cold
We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I better hurry up before I busted a groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said baby where are you
Her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin
And said boy I'm a tear your butt limb from limb
I was scared as hell where I was supposed to go
I just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm
And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were on pants back on sheila's book case
I was done sneezing and coughing
I hope this doesn't happen to often
But nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away

Jazzy: yo man you think they see your point
Prince: I don't know I don't think they really do
Jazzy: I think you should give 'em another example
Prince: awright give me a scratch let's make it funky right here

I got a ring on my phone may 5th last year
It was my girlfriend betty I said hello dear
I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the run dmc concert
(I'm wit it)
It's six o'clock now at eight will you be ready
(Yeah)
Aight fine see you then betty
I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my la cox ? ? ? ? 
Got to betty's at eight I was ready to jet
Until betty's mon said betty's not ready yet
I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35 she comes downstairs
And said I need a little longer to finish my hair
At ten o'clock we had then missed the show
She comes downstairs and says let's go
Go where go to sleep I'm gone
I was steamin like a demon as I drove home
But it just goes to show
Not trying to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme just remember my rhymes
Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away

Man first your parents just don't understand

So I rather kick some slang out

Ice cube is down with the P
Now every single bitch wanna see me
Big daddy is smooth word to mother
Let's check out a flick that exploits the color
Roamin' through Hollywood late at night
Red and blue lights what a common sight
Pulled to the curb gettin' played like a sucker
Don't fight the power  the mother fucker

As I walk the streets of Hollywood boulevard
Thinin' how hard it was to those that starred
In the movies portrayin' the roles
Of butlers and maids slaves and hoes
Many intelligent black men seemed to look uncivilized
When on the screen
Like a guess I figure you to play some jigaboo
On the plantation, what else can a nigga do
And black women in this profession
As for playin' a lawyer, out of the question
For what they play aunt Jemima is the perfect term
Even if now she got a perm
So let's make our own movies like spike lee

Who's the mack? is it some brother in a big hat 
Thinking he can get any b**** with a good rap? 
Rolling in a f***ed up Lincoln 
Leaning to the side So it looks like he's sinking 

Into that leopard interior 
This n**** thinks every girl's inferior 
To his tongue  get a dumb b**** sprung 
As she's selling more butt 

Don't even get a cut of the money 
His name is Sonny 
And he know the play 
And hope to God that he don't find a runaway 

That's looking to become a star 
He'll have your a** in and out of every car 
With every on and Rick, sucking every john's dick 
Come short of the money, get your a** kicked 

You don't like it but you still call him hunk 
Last night the n**** put yo' a** in the trunk 
You want to leave but Sonny started talking fast 
And it make you want to go and sell more a** 

He's getting rich, you his b**** and it's like that 
Now ask yourself 
Who's the mack?

It is that fool that want to pump the gas 
Give you a sad story and you give him cash? 
He starts macking and macking and you sucking 
Quick to say I'm down on my luck 

And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way 
Then you see his sorry a** the next day 
Are you the one getting played like a sucka? 
Or do you say, ""Get a job, motherf***er""? 

Every day, the story gets better 
He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-a**ed sweater 
He claims he wants to get something to eat 
But every day you find yourself getting beat 

He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways 
'Cause he's in a daze 
And almost get his a** hit for the crack 
Now ask yourself

Have you ever been in a hot tub? 
I know the game so I watch it unfold 
When I see the boy pinned to your earlobe 

He's talking s*** and you crack a smile 
When he tell you that he can go buck wild 
For a girl like you and make it feel good 
You know it's drama but it sound real good 

He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging 
The p**** so he can keep bragging 
He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?"" 
The p**** so he can keep bragging 

You want to do it but you feeling like a H-O-E 
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over

Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back

Macking is the game and everybody's playing

Ice Cube,"Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder 
What's the date and time it don't matter 
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort 
To make a long story short 
Ran into this girl named Carla 
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala 
She said what's up yeah what's the deal 
Check the hairdo of course it ain't real 
Then I looked down she was fat in the front 
I asked how long, well about seven months 
Oh how time flies when you're having fun 
She said yeah but the damage is done 
Where you been, on a little vacation 
Oh by the way congratulations 
Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue 
Then she said the lucky man is you 
I dropped my brew 
And everything looked fuzzy 
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy 
She said yeah remember that date 
I thought back and tried to calculate 
Then I said damn are you sure it's mine 
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times 
She said that day no I wasn't whoring 
Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring 
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court 
Paying a gang on child support 
Then I thought deep about giving up the money 
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy 
Naw cause then I'd really get faded 
That's murder one cause it was premeditated 
So what I'm a do 
I don't have a clue 
How many months left damn only two 
I'm gettin' faded 

No cigar, G 
Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded 

It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her 
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her 
See the booty and the front was all in place 
But the girl had the pitbull face 
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid 
Oh lord god forbid 
My homies see me at the motel 
Cause those fools would love to just go tell 
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep 
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept 
And hold your big fat butt steady 
Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready 
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey 
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque 
I dropped her off man and I'm knowing 
That I'm a hate myself in the morning 
I got drunk to help me forget 
Yo another day another hit shit 
I'm gettin' faded 

Ay yo you know what time it is 

Nine months later she's ready to drop the load 
And everybody in the hood already knows 
It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me 
You know Ice Cube can't be having that G 
I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her 
Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger 
JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up they won't shut up 
I'm gettin' fed up bitch 
Cause I know you're tryin' to break me 
But if I find out your tryin' to fake me 
I'm a buff that duff for a hoot 
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two 
That night she went into labor 
And the shit is getting kinda major 
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver 
Looking like my next-door neighbor 
She said it was mine that was her best guess 
But let's check the results of the blood test 
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative 
Damn why did I let her live
After that I should've got the gat 
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap 
But no I just told the hoe who laid me 
Excuse me bitch it's a switch 
You can't fade me 

Naw baby not this way 
Yo you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger 
I don't fall for the okey-doke 
And before I fall for the okey-doke 
I let the pistol smoke 
Now sing it

Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable

I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I reap all your fat shit, jack

'Ice Cube is wanted dead'
That's all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green
Hear shots and si-reens

So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
It's the American way
'cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A

And tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so
Who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap
You know I'ma beat the wack
With a payoff, cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick, stay off!
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest
So get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight
'cause I'm scarin' ya, wanted by America

Word, but who the fuck has heard?
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let em see a nigga invasion
Point blank for the Caucasian
Cock the hammer then crackle, smile
Take me to your house, pal
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin' in a dig, yo it couldn't be
(What up G?) Saw my face on TV
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Pack my bags and tried to hit the dough when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
'Cause the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin' my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbin' the white folks
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope

Ice Cube,"Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-see-E
And let me tell ya a story or two
About a punk-ass nigga I knew
Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop
Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe
At that type of shit he's a pro
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil' nap
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps
Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way
To make some money, why not?
Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew
For the man that was really important
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes
Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes
He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out
Saw, her and her friends sellin' sheepskins

Yo yo I got them sheepskins
Yo, my empty sheepskins
Yo baby, what's up with that?

Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors, too
Red Riding Hood, and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence? Yo I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go

Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit!

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
With a joint, drinkin' some 8-ball
Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville
Lookin' for, the wolf to kill
They're fucked up and they want revenge
Them and Humpty used to be friends
Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas
And Mister Rogers is gettin' mighty jealous
Of the cash that the pigs were makin'
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits
They said that the motherfuckin' wolf was next
So Mister Rogers better watch his step
So he let the wolf know
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho
Cause Cinderella is much too fast
Before twelve, givin' up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as they show, they gonna get popped
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em
Little Boy Blue is up front givin' orders
Little did they know Cinderella was a fink
She called the cops and got thrown in the clink
A bad influence? Yo, I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go",A Gangsta's Fairytale,1990
Ice Cube,"Well two bees in a bucket 
Mother mother fuck it 
You either Flavor Flav it 
Or you Chuck Chuck Chuck it 
Kiss my ass or suck a D.I.C.  
K. stands for kill so don't fuck with me 
I fucked that lady in the bed 
I missed that pussy and I bust a spread 
I tried it again in a thumping wagon 
The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging 
Tried it again and I failed to grasp 
I missed that pussy and I bust my ass 
Then I fucked this lady in the tree 
The baby came out and said ""Run-DMC"" 

I knew this girl who looked just like you 
Light brown and a fly hair-do 
I wanted to do her, screw her 
So I stepped to her 
On-key bitch had more ass than a donkey 
I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over 
Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over 
Just call me the plumber at the end of the night 
Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe 
She didn't get offended it was splendid to me 
Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be 
I guess I just wine her and dine her 
And by the end of the night I'll be behind her 
Waxing that ass like Rain Dance 
On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her 
Took her to the Comfort Inn 
Tucked her in 
Pulled out the third leg pumped it in 
She said will you call me 
Yeah I'll call you a bitch or a hoe after I ball ya 
Naw I'm just playin' but it's still the same 
Cause a nigga like Ice Cube is only out for one thing",I'm Only Out for One Thang,1990
Ice Cube,"Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand
Cause after I do ya
Huh I never knew ya
Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits
They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits
Ice Cube won't wait so give it up cow
After we do it you can go home now
I'm a brother with a big long...

First of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo
When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no
Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in
No, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore
And if that's what you're here for
Exit through the door
There's more
To see of me but you're blind so
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0

Ay what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo
I know you like to rap and like to flow so
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world
Stay down and play the playground you little girl

What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping
Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening
It never fails I'll always get respect
And you lose so take a rain check

Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second
If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon

Well you're mistaken
It's not going that far
I make brothers like you play the back yard
You used to flow with the title but I took it
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it

Damn it look it
Cause you're talking a lot of bull

Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Ah Miss Yo-Yo so what gives
I hear females always talkin about women's lib
Well get your own crib
And stay there
Instead of having more babies for the welfare
Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger
The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga
For you to look at when your hair get nappy
So take a piece of the pole and be happy

Hell no because to me you're not a thriller
You come in the room with your three-inch killer
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown
I'm a put it like this my man
Without us your hand would be your best friend
So give us credit like you know you should
If I don't look good you don't look good

I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant

But you don't know how funky that I can get

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Man women I put a lot of fear in em
Cause I had it up to here with em
Drink a beer with em
No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day
Yeah if you know what I mean baby

Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe
If you was more of a man instead of faking it
Women deserve the credit when they're making it

Yeah so what's the problem

Well I think we solved it
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it

Yeah I admit you can flow

Well that's true

But you see I'm a pro with the bank too

Yeah I can see you got it good

Oh that I know

But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo
The brand-new intelligent black lady

You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me

So what up then

Girl what you tryin to do

To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Or a big butt...",It's a Man's World,1990
Ice Cube,"I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga
That's why I'm sick of gettin' treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine double m
The damn scum that you all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down it's all about coming up
So what they do go and ban the AK?
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way
So you better duck away run and hide out
When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out
Cause I'm about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham
When I'm shooting let's see who drop
The police the media and suckers that went pop
And motherfuckers that say they too black
Put em overseas they be begging to come back
They say keep em on gangs and drugs
You want to sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
Kicking shit called street knowledge
Why more niggas in the pen than in college?
Now cause of that line I might be your cellmate
That's from the nigga ya love to hate

Fuck you Ice Cube
Yeah, ha-ha, it's the nigga you love to hate
Fuck you Ice Cube
Hey yo baby, your mother warned you about me
It's the nigga you love to hate
Yo, you ain't doing nothing pops
Yo, you ain't doing nothing pops for the brothers
What you got to say for yourself?
You do like how I'm living? Well, fuck you

Once again it's on, the motherfucking psycho
Ice Cube the bitch killa cap peeler
Yo runnin' through the line like Bo
It's no pot to piss in
I put my fist in
Now who do ya love to hate
Cause I talk shit and down the eight-ball
Cause I don't fake you're begging I fall off
The crossover might as well cut them balls off
And get your ass ready for the lynching
The mob is droppin' common sense and
We'll gank in the pen will shank
Any Tom Dick and Hank or get the ass
Fake it ain't about how right or wrong you live
But how long you live
I ain't with the bullshit
I meet cold bitches no hoes
Don't want to sleep so I keep popping No-Doz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low
And if you're locked up I dedicate my style in
From San Quentin to Rykers Island
We got em afraid of the funky shit
I like to clown so pump up the sound
In the jeep make the old ladies say
Oh my god wait it's the nigga ya love to hate

Fuck you Ice Cube
Yeah come on fool
It's the nigga you love to hate
Fuck you Ice Cube
Yeah run up punk
It's the nigga you love to hate
Yo, who the fuck you think you are calling girls bitches?
You ain't all that
That's all I hear, bitch, bitch
I ain't nobody's bitch
A bitch is a

Soul Train done lost they soul
Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes
I see a lotta others damn
It almost look like the Bandstand
You ask me did I like Arsenio
About as much as the bicentennial
I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools cause they all scared of
the Ice Cube
And what I say what I portray and all that
And ain't even seen the gat
I don't want to see no dancing
I'm sick of that shit listen to the hit
Cause yo if I look and see another brother
On the video tryin' to out-dance each other
I'm a tell T-Bone to pass the bottle
And don't give me that shit about role model
It ain't wise to chastise and preach
Just open the eyes of each
Cause laws are made to be broken up

And build mold and fold they self into shape

Ice Cube,"Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door - ""who is it?""
It's ice cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot
She said fuck em, cause they get sparked alot
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
And then I put my nikes on the coffee table
Her brother came in he's into gangbangin'
Cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin""
I don't bang I write the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminded me of good times
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
He threw up a set and then he was gone
I'm thinkin' to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
And fired up the sess it was sess no doubt
She said please excuse my house and all that
I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact
Lookin' at a fucked up black and white
Her mom's bitchin' cause the county check wasn't right
She had another brother that was three years old
And had a bad case of the runny nose
He asked me who I was then I had to pause
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked
Only thirteen and already pregnant
I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids
They were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin
And tellin and look at this young punk bailin
I heard a knock on the door without the password
And her mom's got the 12 guage mossberg
The nigga said ""yo, what's for sale""
And the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars
From a smoked out fool with ring around the collar
The girl I was waiting for came out
I said bitch I didn't know this was a crack house
I got my coat and suddenly
The cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome
And I said to myself once again it's on
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case
He said get out my face and musta had a grudge
His reply tell that bullshit to the judge
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin
I said aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin
She started draggin and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the patty wagon
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint
Now the story you heard has one little object
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects!",Once Upon a Time in the Projects,1990
Ice Cube,"You can't fuck with the criminal rapping over gangsta shit
First I load the clip and then I make the hit
I know some y'all can't fade this
Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
So you and your boys are ass out
When I'm rollin' in a seven deuce glass house
The Mob ain't nothing but a menace
When we get the motherfucking dog in us
Playing them old beats
I'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies
Ready to peel your cap
You can't believe ""Faces of Death"" on wax
Some say the Mob ain't positive
Man fuck that shit cause I gots to live
How I live and you could either give a fuck punk
Yo or get your ass bucked
Some rappers are heaven-sent
But Self-Destruction don't pay the fucking rent
So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job
I'd rather roll it wit the Lench Mob

To be down with the Mob is simple
Mind your own you want a spot find your own
And take mine if you're badder than the strong man
I do the right thing I do the wrong thing
Do anything cause I ain't faking the scene
It's all about how much bacon you bring
And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it
Yo you ain't seen nothing
Cause if you testify you're living blind
Cause in the city you live and let die
Rolling with the fools One Time can't beat
On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet
He said ""I know you"" I said ""you might
My name is Ice Cube I did a song you didn't like""
So he soaked me up like Bounty
Had to do a week in the county
A piece of cake it was just like a party
Cause in the county you know everybody
No I didn't kill or steal or rob
Locked up for what cause I'm rollin wit the Lench Mob

If you know a female that's rollin with the Lench Mob
Watch your step cause the gat is kept
In the purse like my homegirl Yo-Yo
You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no
Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out
After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out
Get the picture or bitch
You'll get the eighty-six
If she want to try and mix
Business and pleasure make up your own mind
You gotta be a hoe on your own time
Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep
Yo the Mob is still deep
And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit
You thought you got with the crew you can't get with
So get the noose ready for the lynching
Now 235 is what I'm benching
But nowadays it's still not enough
I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush
Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job

What's the date and time it don't matter 
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort 
To make a long story short 
Ran into this girl named Carla 
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala 
She said what's up yeah what's the deal 
Check the hairdo of course it ain't real 
Then I looked down she was fat in the front 
I asked how long, well about seven months 
Oh how time flies when you're having fun 
She said yeah but the damage is done 
Where you been, on a little vacation 
Oh by the way congratulations 
Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue 
Then she said the lucky man is you 
I dropped my brew 
And everything looked fuzzy 
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy 
She said yeah remember that date 
I thought back and tried to calculate 
Then I said damn are you sure it's mine 
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times 
She said that day no I wasn't whoring 
Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring 
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court 
Paying a gang on child support 
Then I thought deep about giving up the money 
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy 
Naw cause then I'd really get faded 
That's murder one cause it was premeditated 
So what I'm a do 
I don't have a clue 
How many months left damn only two 
I'm gettin' faded 

No cigar, G 
Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded 

It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her 
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her 
See the booty and the front was all in place 
But the girl had the pitbull face 
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid 
Oh lord god forbid 
My homies see me at the motel 
Cause those fools would love to just go tell 
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep 
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept 
And hold your big fat butt steady 
Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready 
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey 
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque 
I dropped her off man and I'm knowing 
That I'm a hate myself in the morning 
I got drunk to help me forget 
Yo another day another hit shit 
I'm gettin' faded 

Ay yo you know what time it is 

Nine months later she's ready to drop the load 
And everybody in the hood already knows 
It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me 
You know Ice Cube can't be having that G 
I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her 
Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger 
JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up they won't shut up 
I'm gettin' fed up bitch 
Cause I know you're tryin' to break me 
But if I find out your tryin' to fake me 
I'm a buff that duff for a hoot 
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two 
That night she went into labor 
And the shit is getting kinda major 
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver 
Looking like my next-door neighbor 
She said it was mine that was her best guess 
But let's check the results of the blood test 
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative 
Damn why did I let her live? 
After that I should've got the gat 
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap 
But no I just told the hoe who laid me 
Excuse me bitch it's a switch 
You can't fade me

Stupid motherfuckers shoulda stepped when I warned 'em
I'm from the Boondocks of Compton, California
I'm just anxious to whoop some ass
I went to high school, but I flunked every class
So what makes you think I give a fuck about respect?
I'll put your bitch in check, and I'll bet
You won't run up, son of a punk and a bitch, too
I shoulda did a drive by on you and your crew
Cuz ya'll be poppin' some shit that's unheard of
For you, what's the word? Uh (wack!) it's murder, son

Man what's up? Yo, yo

Come
On, man, bust this shit

Run with the beat as long as the track moves
Hot as lava, organized like a seminar
Serve you, your crew, him, and them and a
Couple of rap-saps who think they can get butt
You slipped and shit, so nitwit, just get the nuts
Stealin' your high hopes, watchin' you write notes
Better walk a chalk line, not fuckin' a tightrope
Rap slicker, thicker, quicker than others, then I stop swift
Shift from 1st to 5th, while you stop to shoplift
Take the mic stand whenever the duty calls
If I bust a nut for every rhyme I had, I'd get blue balls
Serious as drama, I'm-a watch her say ""Me too.""
You're shorter than Michu, your rhymes are see-through
You're nothin' like GQ, transparent, I made it apparent

Who grew up in the heart of the ghetto
Doin' what we had to just to make ends meet
Some steal for a livin', some stand on the street
Just slang. Some gang-bang, but big deal
They say in Compton, you gotta kill or get killed
Mothafuckin' police pull ya over, slam ya down
Then tell ya that your hood is their town
And I ain't goin' for no shit like that;
Cuff me up, take me to jail, I'll come back
Talkin' much shit, cuz I talk what the fuck I feel
A few weeks in the county ain't no big deal
So a punk like you can't fuck with me

Ice Cube,"Up early in the morning  dressed in black
Don't ask why? 'Cause I'm down in a suit and tie
They killed a homie that I went to school with(Damn!)
I tell ya life ain't shit to fool with
I still hear the screams of his mother
While my nigga laid dead in the gutter(Shit!)
And it's getting to my temple
Why is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo?
It makes me so mad I want to get my sawed-in
And have some bodies hauled in
But no, I pay my respects and I'm through(what up Cube?)
Hug my crew, and maybe shed a tear or two
And I want to get blitz
Grab my 40 ounce and then I reminisce
About a brother who had to be the one and only
So I dedicate this to my dead homies

Another homie got murdered on a shakedown{three gun shots}
And his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown
Two shots hit him in the face when they blasted{two gun shots}
A framed picture and a closed casket
A single file line about 50 cars long
All drivin' slow with they lights on
He got a lot of flowers and a big wreath
What good is that when you're six feet deep?
I look at that shit and gotta think to myself
And thank God for my health
'Cause nobody really ever know
When it's gonna be they family on the front row
So I take everything slow, go with the flow
And shut my motherfuckin' mouth if I don't know(Word!)
'Cause that's what Pops told me
But I wish he could have said it, to my dead homies

I remember we painted our names on the wall for fun
Now it's ""Rest in Peace"" after every one
Except me, but I ain't the one to front
Seems like I'm viewin' a body after every month
Plus, I knew him when he was yea big
Pour beer on the curb before I take a swig
But somethin' ain't right
When it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight
Lovin' each other in a caring mood
There's lots of people and lots of food
They say ""Be Strong"" and you're tryin'
But how strong can you be when you see your Pops cryin'?
So that's why Ice Cube's dressed up
Because the city is so fuckin' messed up
And everybody is so phony
Take a little time, to think about your dead homies",Dead Homiez,1990

Yo, Ice Cube man
Since you went solo 
What's up with the rest of the?

If you need help, hang up and dial your operator",I Gotta Say What Up!!!,1990
Ice Cube,"I was told  cause I didn't witness the whole act 
In and out was the movement of the bozack 
It was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin 
Then the nut came gushin 
And it was hell tryin to bail to the ovary 
With nothin' but the Lord lookin' over me 
I was white with a tail 
But when I reached the finish line  young black male! 
One cell made two  and two cells made fo' 
And so on  so now I'm a embryo 
Then I got a hunch 
That I'ma be on lock down, for nine months 
Chillin', with my mother to guide me 
And nothin' but a stomach to hide me 
From all that worry and bullshit 
Nine months later, I elbow pull and kick 
Cause my time is up and I don't care 
With one big push, I'm outta there 
June 15th, it's just my luck 
In 1969, a nigga is the product 

""Ghetto ass nigga, you ain't shit, 
And you ain't gon' never be shit!"" 

I learned how to walk and talk and all that 
They put me in school, but it don't matter 
Cause I'm sittin' in history 
Learnin' bout a sucker, who didn't give a fuck about me 
They try to shape us 
But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfuckin' rapist 
So I stopped payin' attention 
Ice Cube, headed, straight to detention 
Fuck that shit, I roam the hallways 
I'm sent home and I don't got all A's 
A high school dropout 
My father had beef so I tried to knock pops out 
But I got tossed, he's the boss 
I'm out of there and mad cause I lost 
Now bein' on my own is a factor 
So I become, the neighborhood jacker 
Gimme your car, run your jewels 
Makin' a livin' robbin' fools 
And if I let my nine rang out 
You know, it'll make your brains hang out 
So what's your fate? 
Am I the nigga you love, or the one you love to hate? 
The wrong answer is said, the nigga fled 
I pump lead, now he's in a puddle of red 
And if you got a buck, you're shit out of luck 
Stuck up by the motherfuckin' product 

""Uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job 
If you want to stay in my motherfuckin' house""

Twenty-one now, and paid in full 
Feelin' bad, from all the shit I pulled 
On people back in the day 
Plus, I got a little baby on the way 
So I'm tryin' to go straight 
I'm with my baby's momma, out on a date 
Til the punk ass cops ran my plate 
Now I'm on a bus upstate 

""Oh, the young nigga done caught a case!"" 
""Sittin' in the mess hall, sayin' my grace""

Where all the products go, no doubt 
Yo momma, I gotta do eleven 
Livin' in a five by seven 
Dear baby, your man's gettin' worn out 
Of seein' young boys gettin' they assholes torn out 
And then he got shanked with a spoon 
And he was 'sposed to get out soon 
Is it my fault, he was caught in production 
Where a young black life means nothin'
Just because, I didn't want to learn your grammar 
You say I'm better off in the slammer 
And it's drivin' me batty 
Cause my little boy, is missin' daddy 
I'm ashamed, but the fact is 
I wish pops let me off on the mattress 
Or should I just hang from the top bunk 
But that's goin out like a punk 
My life is fucked! 
But it ain't my fault, cause I'm the motherfuckin' product

""Hey, come to Los Angeles!
You and your family can have peace and tranquility.
Enjoy the refinement..""
""Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?""
""Hello, my name is Elaine 
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles""

How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove comparment
Cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive

""Hi this is Elaine again.
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles,
Or is somebody taking your things? Have you witneesed a driveby?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police,
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again.""
""This is Los Angeles."" ""This is Los Angeles.""

Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
Cause it ain't nuttin but a trap
And females'll get jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
Cause most niggaz get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed-off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight
Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench hoe
And you won't survive in South Central

""Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be.
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV.
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
Punk motherfucker!""

And you need your ass straight smoked
Yo I want to say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill
Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God damnit!

Rule number three: don't get caught up
Cause niggaz are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a vice
On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
We discern
Cause South Central L.A., is one big yearn
Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin ki's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central

Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass,
You tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out.
And for you so called baller-ass niggaz,
You know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke.
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers.
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit.
You'll sho' get got, just like that.
This ain't no joke motherfuckers.
Now I want to send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer,
Puttin his two cents in..

Ice Cube,"Down at the best spot 
It's me and JD and they sellin more birds than a pet shop 
The spot's hot and everybody nervous 
That's when the blue car served us 
Oh why did fools had to let loose 
Heard six pops from a deuce deuce 
Big Tom had to push us 
13 niggas runnin' straight to the bushes 
For they gats so they could draw down 
But why a motherfucker like me had to fall down 
Not known why I dropped out 
Fuck it, still can't afford to get popped out 
So now I gotta jet 
Only ran one block, but my shirt soakin' wet 
Tryin' to see if we got him 
Looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom 
Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out 
Yelled to the homies then I blacked out 

Woke up in the back of a tray 
On my way, to MLK 
That the county hospital jack 
Where niggas die over a little scratch 
Still sittin' in the trauma center 
In my back is where the bullet entered 
Yo nurse I'm gettin' kind of warm 
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin' form 
Coughin' up blood on my hands and knees 
Then I heard ""freeze nigger don't move"" 
Yo, I didn't do a thing 
Didn't want to go out like my man Rodney King 
Still got gaffled 
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel 
Now I'm handcuffed 
Being asked information on my gang affiliation 
I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes 
And I'm a victim of neighborhood crime 

I need to see a MD 
And y'all motherfuckers giving me the third degree 
Look at the waiting room 
It's filled to the rim like the county jail day room 
Nobody gettin' help 
Since we poor 
The hospital move slow 
Now I'm laid out 
People steppin' over me to get closer to the tv 
Just like a piece of dog shit 
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet 
One hour done passed 
Done watched two episodes of MASH 
And when I'm almost through 
They call my name and put me on ICU 
Halfway dead 
No respect and handcuffed to the bed 
Now the trauma starts 
'Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart 
Then I begin the ass kissin' 
Just to get looked at by an overworked physician 
Got the chills, but my temperatures 103 
Only got a band-aid and an IV 
That's when I start cussin' 
Police steady askin' me who did the bustin' 

Why oh why can't I get help 
'Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self 
Too many black bodies the hospital housin' 
So at 10 P.M. I was Audi 5000",Alive on Arrival,1991
Ice Cube,"Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad
Gots to get a job 'cause I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid like I was rappin' to the nation
But that's not likely so here's my application
Pass it to the man at AT&T
'Cause when I was in school I got the A-E-E
But there's no S-E for this youngsta
I didn't have no money so now I have to punch the 
Clock like a slave, that's what be happenin'
But whitey says there's no room for the African
Always knew that I would clock G's
But welcome to McDonald's can I take your order please
Gotta sell ya food that might give you cancer
'Cause my son doesn't take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes that you never give me back
What about diapers, bottles, and similac
Do I gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back?
Or should I just wait for help from Bush
Or Jesse Jackson, and operation Push
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
A masengel what the hell cracker sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches
Miss porker, little Joe or Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I got me a bird, better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po' to a nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
'Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
I'm never givin' love again
But blacks are too fuckin' broke to be republican
Now I remember I used to be cool
Till I stopped fillin' out my W-2
Now senators are gettin' high
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry, this is our only room to walk

I gotta go down to the store with the two
Oriental one penny countin' motherfuckers
That make a nigga mad enough to cause a little ruckus
Thinkin' every brother in the world's out to take
So they watch every damn move that I make
They hope I don't pull out a gat and try to rob
They funky little store, but, bitch, I got a job
""Look, you little Chinese motherfucker
I ain't tryin' to steal none of yo' shit, leave me alone!""
""Mother fuck you!""
Yo, yo, check it out
So don't follow me up and down your market
Or your little chop suey ass'll be a target
Of the nationwide boycott
Juice with the people, that's what the boy got
So pay respect to the black fist
Or we'll burn your store right down to a crisp
And then we'll see ya
Cause you can't turn the ghetto into black Korea

""Mother fuck you!""",Black Korea,1991
Ice Cube,"Here's another day at the stoplight
I'm looking in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South Central is putting Ice Cube to the test
With four brothers in the SS
Now I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game laying in the cut
Is this a jack or a kidnap?
Since I'm never ever slipping I'm fully strapped
I grab my gat out the glove
Do these fools got a problem with me?
Or do they got love?
And  when the light turns green, I don't bone out
I want to see what these black men are all about
'Cause if it's my time, I'm just short
If not, I'm plugging they Super Sport
First they get behind my ride
Then they switch lanes to the left side
I'm scoping out the one smoking indo
Coming up fast, rolling down his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my nine
Fool, 'cause I'm color blind

Killer Cali, the state where they kill
Over colors 'cause brothers don't know the deal
And they'll cap you, not if they have to
But if they want to, first they might confront you
But every nigga on my block can't stop 
And he won't stop and he don't stop
Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gang bang
And rookies ain't the only ones that drop
Some say the little locs are getting a little too loc'ed
And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most
Say the wrong word 
Then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
Bust a you-turn, come back and get served nigga
For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get
But men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split
It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me
'Cause I slang these things like a G
It's on, is anybody killing for the summertime
I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind

I'm fresh outta county on bail
And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail
For some gang related activity
'Cause everyday, different fools try to get with me
For no more than a color, or territory
Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story
So what's left, the judge goes deaf
When you try to tell your side
And you ain't blue eyed
Boy you better duck 'cause the book is comin'
And just hand your car keys over to your woman
Because it ain't no sunshine where you headed
And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
But now, I got time to think
Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
And I ain't even shed a tear
'Cause believe it or not, they got more love for me here
Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph
'Cause brothers, you don't know the half
On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
But ever since I've been down
I'm colorblind

Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
I was told to peel a cap on the other side
Yo, young and dumb, full of come up, a baby loc
I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke

Stable and able but I'm not ready and willing
'Cause I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killing
Grabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride
Started up the bucket and headed for the other side

Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip
Hit the 5 dollar stick and then I put in my clip

So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
I had my mind set on sending niggas to Harrison Ross

Caught one from the back and I looked in his eyes 
Thinkin' should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive
Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side

I ain't contributing to genocide (why?)
'Cause I'm colorblind

Niggas in the hood ain't changed
And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
'Cause, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
Every which way I get burned baby
Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red
Put 'em together then we color 'em dead
Dead, dying, getting smoked like part of the fun
They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral

I understand how all my homeboys feel
'Cause I was shot and to this day, I pack my steel
'Cause I was born in a certain territory
Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories
With blue and red bandannas on the street
And if you slipping, you'll be six feet deep

When I was young I used to hang with the seventh graders 
Little bad motherfucker playing Space Invaders

Either feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids 
Walking with the schoolhouse bully 
By doing that I had a lot of pull G

That it's wrong throwing rocks at the RTD 
Popping out your window with a BB gun 
Better yet knocking on your door and run 
Playing hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank 
Even though I was still shooting blanks 
As soon as the dark hit 
I was stealing candy out the corner market 
Until I got my ass whipped 
Cause I was ten years old, doing dumb shit 

Thirteen, that's how old I was 
When my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz 
And I was looking at any butt and ass 
Me and my homies started cutting class 
Going up to the high school 
Looking for any bitch I could lie to 
Tell em I was older than I really was 
Smoked my first joint and got really buzzed 
That's what a mack's made of 
But when I got my first piece of pussy I fell in love 
Hard as a rock the long way 
And then I put the rubber on the wrong way 
But I still gotta have it 
Overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit 
Goddamn I was hot 
A virgin but I still knew how to lay pipe 
Even though the hoe worked me 
I still knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque 
Then the shit got strange money 
I started shaking and jimmy felt funny 
Then the nut came gushing 
I jumped up got dressed and start pushing 
Cause I thought the bitch broke my dick 
Cause I was still young doing dumb shit 

At 17 got my first Volkswagon 
And mastered the life-long art of dragging 
To the women in college 
Hung out with the OG's and got some street knowledge 
Breaking in cars and all that 
Hitting punk fools with a baseball bat 
Fucking at a real fast rate 
Til they said that I might not graduate 
Then I said fuck the dumb shit 
Cause Pops'll fuck me up quick 
If things continued 
So I start rapping about shit I been through 
And I got real good 
Now I look at all the kids in the neighborhood 
Trying to be baby macks 
Doing shit that I did seven years back 
Going through a stage 
But before they can grow up they on the front page

He didn't get into an excessive amount of trouble

Ice Cube,"Your daughter was a nice girl, now she is a slut
A queen treatin' niggas just like King Tut
Gobblin up nuts, sorta like a hummingbird
Suckin up the Lench Mob crew, and I'm comin' third
Used to get straight A's, now she just skippin' class
Oh my, do I like to grip the hips and ass
Only seventeen, with a lot of practice
On black boys jimmies and white boys cactus
Sorry sorry sir, but I gotta be brief
A lotta niggas like bustin' nuts in her teeth
Drink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic
That don't mean shit, cause she's givin' up the ass quick
Quicker than you can say, ""Candy,""
The bitch is on my Snicker, and oh man she
Can take on three men, built like He-Men
Her little-bitty twat got gallons of semen
Fourteen niggas in line ready to bang your
Pride-and-joy, I mean daddy's little angel
Tell the little bitch to bring her ass out the house
Cause your daughter's known, for givin' up the nappy dug out

""I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang
I'm gonna do my thing, with your daughter!""

Mister, mister, before you make me go
I'm here to let you know your little girl is a ho
Nympho, nympho, boy is she bad
Get her all alone and out comes the kneepads
I know she is a minor and it is illegal
But the bitch is worse than Vanessa Del Rio
And if you decide to call rape
We got the little hooker on tape, now
Tell the fuckin' slut to please hurry up
And wear that dress that's tight on her butt
So I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed
Been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead
Face turnin' red from grabbin' them ankles
Fuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes
You should hear how she sounds with a cock in her
Boots get knocked, from here to Czechoslovakia
Two are on top, one on the bottom
First nigga got the boots, man, you shoulda shot him
Cause after I got 'em it was over
Now niggas get lucky like a four-leaf clover
On daddy's little girl
She keeps nuts in her mouth like the bitch was a squirrel
So tell Cheryl to bring her ass home
Cause the line at my house is gettin' long, ay!

Warning: when having sexual intercourse with a female like Cheryl
You must use, jimmy hat condoms

We're called jimmy hats, have you ever seen us?
Most guys wear us round rolled up on your penis
If you're real smart, you will always use us
Put me in your wallet, 'fore some dummy screws us
And goin bare back, without the bare facts
'll have creepy crawlers crawlin on your nutsac!
So get the J-I-M-M-Y to the hats

Lookin' at my girlfriend's black skin
You wanna jump in, but she don't like white men
So don't throw that work you fuckin jerk
Or get your punk devil ass hurt motherfucker
She ain't with the pale face
Cause y'all fuck at a snail's pace

Mr. Sexual Harassment
Asking for a blow while the answer is ""fuck no""
Looks like you wanna terminate
But that's when I go Psycho like Norman Bates
I wanna kill the devil for talkin' shit
Cause he can't get a taste of the chocolate
African breast, cause white bitches got no butt and no chest
Black women have bodies like goddesses
Sorta like Venus, but put away your penis
Cause the devil is a savage motherfucker
That's why I'm lighter than the average brother
Cause you raped our women and we felt it
But it'll never happen again if I can help it (me neither)
Cause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet
So horny little devil, you better listen
Before your ass comes up missin'
And it's like that

Now you wanna get me
Horny little devil must be a F-A-G
Tryin' to fuck me out my land and my manhood
Got broke eating Spam and canned goods
Locking down on my neighborhoods
Treat me less than a man cause right now you got the upper hand
But my ass is a virgin
You might have fucked the Indians
But you can't surgeon me
And when I'm on top I wont be fuckin' ya
I'd rather put a buck in ya
Cause I hate the devil with a passion
And when I see the whites of his eyes I start blastin'
Dig a hole and throw his ass in
And I won't be happy til I'm down to my last ten
Get his fuckin' pitchfork
Tie him up, and then feed the bitch pork
Little devil wanna fuck me out my pay
'Cause horny little devil true niggas aren't gay
And you can't play with my Yo-Yo
And definitely can't play with me you fuckin' homo
Cause we'll blow your head off
And turn that white sheet into a red cloth
Plus when they're all dead
I can quit that jheri juice and get a bald head
Then let it nap up
Go down to the corner store and beat the Jap up
Clean all the crap up
Out my city
Now the whole block look shitty
Put his dick on a wood block
Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop
Now who's the next to nut
Color Me Badd, but you can't sex me up

I wanna kill him, cause he tried to play me like the trick
But you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
I got the A to the motherfuckin K, and it's ready to rip
Slapped in my banana clip
And I'm lookin'
Is he in Watts, Oakland, Philly or Brooklyn?
It seems like he got the whole country behind him
So it's sort of hard to find him
But when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth
Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out
Cause the shit he did was uncalled for
Tried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore
And that shit ain't fly
So now I'm settin up, the ultimate drive-by
And when you hear this shit
It make the world say ""DAMN!"", ""I wanna kill Sam""

""Do the niggas run this moth-er-fuck-er?""

""Momma! Some man at the front do'!""
""Sit yo' ass down""
""Uh hi, I have reason to believe that someone in 
This household has just turned eighteen, am I correct?""

Here's why I wanna kill the punk
Cause he tried to take a motherfuckin' chunk of the funk
He came to my house, I let 'em bail in
Cause he said he was down with the LM
He gave up a little dap
Then turned around, and pulled out a gat
I knew it was a caper
I said, ""Please don't kill my mother"", so he raped her
Tied me up, took me outside
And I was thrown in a big truck
And it was packed like sardines
Full of niggas, who fell for the same scheme
Took us to a place and made us work
All day and we couldn't have shit to say
Broke up the families forever
And to this day black folks can't stick together
And it's odd
Broke us down, made us pray to his God
And when I think about it
It make me say ""DAMN! I wanna kill Sam""

""I'm comin'!""

Now in ninety one, he wanna tax me
I remember, the son of a bitch used to axe me
And hang me by a rope till my neck snapped
Now the sneaky motherfucker wanna ban rap
And put me under dirt or concrete
But God, can see through a white sheet
Cause you the devil in drag
You can burn your cross well I'll burn your flag
Try to give me the HIV
So I can stop makin babies like me
And you're givin' dope to my people chump
Just wait till we get over that hump
Cause yo' ass is grass cause I'ma blast
Can't bury rap, like you buried jazz
Cause we stopped bein' whores, stop doin' floors
So bitch you can fight your own wars
So if you see a man in red white and blue
Gettin' chased by the Lench Mob crew
It's a man who deserves to buckle
I wanna kill Sam cause he ain't my motherfuckin Uncle!

And thank God, I didn't have the drips
I was there so a hoe couldn't gimme that
Just to get, twenty free jimmy hats

Ain't that, yeah, that's the bitch from up the street!

To anybody who lived on the block

Bend that big ass over for the shot
Cause somebody is pipin hot
Drippin like a faucet, I'm glad I didn't toss it
Got you a college boy, who was worse than me
And he probably fucked the whole university
Still wanted him to dick you down, kick you down
With some bucks, now who got fucked?
With a nigga for the money he's earnin

Bitch, don't try to act surprised!""

And your pussy wouldn't be blowin smoke signals

Guess who got a big fat dose of penicillin?
They'll ask, ""Who?"", and I tell 'em you

But now in ninety-one it's a gun if you asked me
Just like a jimmy hat's used for protection
I use my nine when suckers start to flexin
Cause if you run up and try to play mine
I'd rather have a AK than a fuckin canine
Cause if you shot your gun, and my dog tried to fetch her
Me and the dog's goin out on a stretcher
And I ain't with that, so I gotta get that
Big black gat, aim and I hit that
Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den
Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend

Here is the reason why Ice Cube pack
Just in case the little punks try to jack
I can't put a motherfuckin pitbull 
Under a coat, in the small of my back
So I gotta take my beretta, and I betcha
It'll probably work, a 100 percent better
Cause it'll keep me out of danger
With sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber
So this goes to all y'all intruders
Beware of the owner, cause the owner is a shooter
I don't just wanna give your ass rabies
I'd rather have your ass pushing up daisies

Departing from Los Angeles final destination to St. Louis 
Thank you 

Damn G  the spot's gettin' hot 
So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot? 
Police looking at niggas through a microscope 
In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope 
They trying to stop it 
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit? 
Catch a flight to St. Louis 
That's cool, cause nobody knew us 
We stepped off the plane 
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers 
Rented a car at wholesale 
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel 
Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty 
Cause where we stayin', niggas look shady 
But they can't fade South Central 
Cause bustin' a cap is fundamental 
Checkin' out every block close 
Seein' which one will clock the most 
Yeah this is the one no doubt 
Bust a you Bone, and let's clear these niggaz out 

Hey hey man, whats up nigga? 
Yo, well this Lench Mob nigga! 

Now clearin' 'em out meant casualties 
Still had the L.A. mentality 
Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry 
Wouldn't you know, a driveby in Missouri 
Them fools got popped 
Took their corner next day, set up shop 
And it's better than slangin' in the Valley 
Triple the profit makin' more than I did in Cali 
Breakin' off rocks like Barney Rubble 
Cause them mark-ass niggas don't want trouble 
And we ain't on edge when we do work 
Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts 
Getting bitches and they can't stand a 
Nineteen-ninety-one Tony Montana 
Now the shit's like a war 
Of gang violence, where it was never seen before 
Punks whirl when the gat bust 
Four jheri curl niggas kickin' up dust 
And some of them are even lookin' up to us 
Wearing our colors and talkin' that gang fuss 
Giving up much love 
Dyin' for a street, that they ain't even heard of 
But other motherfuckers want to stand strong 
So you know the phrase, once again it's on 

Top of the news tonight, gangs from South Central 
Los Angeles which are known for their driveby shootings 
Have migrated into East St. Louis 
Leaving three dead and two others injured 
No arrests have been made 
Police say this is a nationwide trend 
With similar incidents occurring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma 
""If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere"") 

Boom, my homie got shot he's a goner black 
St. Louis niggas want they corner back 
Shooting in snowy weather 
It's illegal business, niggas still can't stick together 
Fuckin' police got the four-one-one 
That L.A. ain't all, surf and sun 
But we ain't thinkin', bout the boys 
Feudin', like the Hatfields and McCoys 
Now the shit's gettin' tricky 
Cause now they lookin' for the colors and the khakis 
Damn, the spot's gettin' hot from the battle 
About to pack up and start slangin' in Seattle 
But the NARC's, raid about six in the morning 
Try to catch a nigga while he's yawnin' 
Put his glock to my chest as I paused 
Went to jail in my motherfuckin' drawers 
Tryin' to give me, fifty-seven years 
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears 
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck 
And the public defender ain't givin' a fuck 
The fool must be sparkin' 
Talkin' about a double life plea bargain 
You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand G 
Plus the Black Guerilla family 
And the white pride don't like Northside 
And it's a riot if any one of us die
No parole or probation 
Now this is a young man's summer vacation

When I hit a left on Ruthelen, ""Whattup loc?""
Don't you know that niggas get smoked
That take they life for a joke, get in nigga
I take you to the pad soon
Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my low rider
Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps
But hoes lickin' nuts like stamps
One fool brought the music for the yams
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch
Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Give me the nappy and make me happy
The ho said 'Pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?'
I said yeah, but I don't play sex
Without puttin' on the latex
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night, no longer steady mobbin'",Steady Mobbin',1991
Ice Cube,"It's the nigga ya love to hate with a new song
So what really goes on
Nothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch
They hate to see a young nigga rich
But I refuse to switch even though
Cause I can't move to the snow
Cause soon as y'all get some dough
Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow
Moving out your neighborhood
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavor's good
Little kids jumping on me
But you, you wanna be white and corny
Living way out
""Nigger go home"" spray-painted on your house
Trying to be White or a Jew
But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
Get the hell out
Stop being an Uncle Tom, you little sell-out
House nigga scum
Give something back to the place where you made it from
Before you end up broke
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked
I ain't saying no names, you know who you are
You little punk, be true to the game

When you first start rhyming
It started off slow and then you start climbing
But it wasn't fast enough I guess
So you gave your other style a test
You was hardcore hip-hop
Now look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped
Giving our music away to the mainstream
Don't you know they ain't down with the team
They just sent they boss over
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
On MTV but they don't care
They'll have a new nigga next year
You out in the cold
No more white fans and no more soul
And you might have a heart attack
When you find out the black folks don't want you back
And you know what's worse?
You was just like the nigga in the first verse
Stop selling out your race
And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face
Niggas always gotta show they teeth
Now I'm a be brief
Be true to the game

A message to the oreo cookie
Find a mirror and take a look, G
Do you like what you see?
But you're quick to point the finger at me
You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy
Black man can't be no yuppie
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
You don't associate with the Negroes
You wanna be just like Jack
But Jack is calling you a nigger behind your back
So back off genius
I don't need you to correct my broken English
You know that's right
You ain't white
So stop holding your ass tight
Cause you can't pass
So why you keep trying to pass?
With your black ass
Mister Big
But in reality, you're shorter than a midge
You only got yourself to blame
Get a grip, oreo and be true to the game",True to the Game,1991
Ice Cube,"Could you tell me who released our animal instinct? 
And the white man sittin' there tickled pink
Laughin' at us on the avenue 
Bustin' caps at each other after havin' brew 
We can't enjoy ourselves 
Too busy jealous
At each other's wealth 
Commin' up is just in me 
But the Black community is full of envy 
Too much back stabbin' 
While I look up the street I see all the japs grabbin' 
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood 
Build a store, and sell their goods 
To the county recips
You know us po niggas, nappy hair and big lips? 
Four or five babies on your crotch 
And you expect Uncle Sam to help us out? 
We ain't nothin' but porch monkeys 
To the average bigot, redneck honky 
You say comin' up is a must 
But before we can come up, take a look at US 

Break em off some

And all y'all dope-dealers
Your as bad as the po-lice cause ya kill us 
You got rich when you started slangin' dope 
But you ain't built us a supermarket 
So when can spend our money with the blacks 
Too busy buyin' gold an' Caddilacs 
That's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin' 
Exploitin' us like the Caucasians did 
For four hundred years, I got four hundred tears for four hundred peers 
Died last year from gang-related crimes 
That's why I got gang-related rhymes 
But when I do a show ta kick some facts 
Us Blacks don't know how ta act 
Sometimes I believe the hype, man 
We're messin' up ourselves and blame the white man 
But don't point the finger you jiggaboo 
Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you 
Pretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice 
No Ice Cube, just Vanilla Ice 
And y'all sit and scream and cuss
But there's no one ta blame, but US 

Break em off some

Us will always sing the blues 
'Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes 
But if ya step on mine ya pushed a button 
""Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin' 
Just like a beast 
But I'm the first nigga ta holler out (peace, black man)
I beat my wife and children to a pulp 
When I get drunk and smoke dope 
Got a bad heart condition 
Still eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's 
Bet my money on the dice and the horses 
Jobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces 
Go to church but they tease us 
Wit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus 
They used to call me Negro 
After all this time I'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe 
No respect and didn't know it 
And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford 
In jail 'cause I can't pay the mother 
Held back in life because of my color 
Now this is just a little summary 
Of US, but y'all think it's dumb of me 
To hold a mirror to ya face, but trust 
Nobody gives a fuck about",Us,1991

Don't let me catch Daryl Gates in traffic
I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
I hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue
Goin up against the Zulu
Break his spine like a jellyfish
Kick his ass til I'm smellin shit
Off wit the head, off wit the head I say

Ice Cube,"Straight gangsta mack
Who's the mack? is it some brother in a big hat
Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?
Rolling in a fucked up Lincoln
Leaning to the side So it looks like he's sinking
Into that leopard interior
This nigga thinks every girl's inferior
To his tongue  get a dumb bitch sprung
As she's selling more butt
Don't even get a cut of the money
His name is Sonny
And he know the play
And hope to god that he don't find a runaway
That's looking to become a star
He'll have your ass in and out of every car
With every on and Rick, sucking every john's dick
Come short of the money, get your ass kicked
You don't like it but you still call him hunk
Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk
You want to leave but Sonny started talking fast
And it make you want to go and sell more ass
He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that
Now ask yourself
Who's the mack?

It is that fool that want to pump the gas
Give you a sad story and you give him cash?
He starts macking and macking and you sucking
Quick to say I'm down on my luck
And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way
Then you see his sorry ass the next day
Are you the one getting played like a sucker?
Or do you say, ""Get a job, motherfucker""?
Every day, the story gets better
He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-assed sweater
He claims he wants to get something to eat
But every day you find yourself getting beat
He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways
'cause he's in a daze
And almost get his ass hit for the crack
Now ask yourself
Who's the mack?

Is it that nigga in that club asking
Have you ever been in a hot tub?
I know the game so I watch it unfold
When I see the boy pinned to your earlobe
He's talking shit and you crack a smile
When he tell you that he can go buck wild
For a girl like you and make it feel good
You know it's drama but it sound real good
He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging
The pussy so he can keep bragging
He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?""
The pussy so he can keep bragging
You want to do it but you feeling like a H-O-E
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over
'Cause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover
Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back
Now ask yourself
Who's the Mack?
Macking is the game and everybody's playing
And as long as you believe what they saying
Consider the a M.A.C.K. and with no delay
They are gonna get all the play
But when it comes to me, save the drama for your momma
It's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a
Mack in my own right
When it comes to rhyme and rap
'cause all I do is kick facts
Unlike Iceberg Slimm
And all of them be claimin' be P.I.M.P.
No, I'm not going out that way
I'm just a straight up N I double G A
Next time you get over on a fool
And you did the shit like real smooth
Thank Ice Cube for giving up the facts
And ask yourself

Yo Jinx man, we gotta find somebody that's down for hers, man
All these girls simple man, who you think fit the category?

[Yo-Yo]
Its me, the brand new intelligent black woman why-O-why-O
Which is Yo-Yo, but I'm not to be played
Like I was made by matell
But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male
I rhyme about uprights upliftin the woman
For that are superior to handle by any male
Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show
And if you ask my producers that we fly and you know

(Chorus: repeat 2x, Ice Cube)
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
""Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out""

[Verse 1]
My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho
I like to flow so swift, its got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift, as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who came to dap
To the fact I get the 8-ball, or the jam
The earrings I wear are called dophins
Check the booty, yo its kinda soft and
If you touch, you livin in a coffin(word to mother)
I'm in the 90s, your still in the 80s right
I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady like
But I'ma lady, who will pull a stunt though
I kill suckas, and even hit the block
So what you want to do?
Ya must play it wrong(ay yo)
Cause to me, you simply can't get none
You wetter, then a hotter ho in snow
Tell em Ice Cube, 
(Ice Cube)
No, you can't play with my Yo-Yo
Suckas

(Chorus: 2x)
(Ice Cube)
what's yo name baby?

[Verse 2]
that's right, my name is Yo-Yo, but know I'm not a dunkin
As I rap, chilly chill bringin the funk and
I steal yo man, as if he was a hawk and
He'll call me baby, yo, or even pumpkin
I may be buttercup, or even Ms.Yo
We had dinner, and know we drinkin Cisco
Hit the slow jams, its gettin cosy
Your home alone, so now you gettin nosy
Your kinda young, so of course you had to call replace
Hang up in my face, its a sad case
So who ya man dippin the dollars, what
Yup, for puttin lipstick on his collar
At home, he's gotta listen to ya holla
But he'll slap ya, and sock ya, so why bother?
But if you come knockin at my do'(ay yo)
I'll smoke you, tell em Ice
(Ice Cube)
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, sucka

Fool, 1990 and stand sucka free, yeah
Tell em what's up

*Yo-Yo Rhyming Over Females Voice As She Did Earlier In The Song*
Yo, I hope you realize one day
That ya week is Monday threw Sunday
So listen to my why-O, here's my bio
And next to me, ha, your not fly yo
Ya lack skills to be a woman that's black
Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts
Yo-Yo, is just tryna to stop ya
Because the world ain't a big soap opera
It only takes one punch to drop ya
And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya
But no, I'm not livin like that first
Although I pack, a real small gat in my purse(right, right)
But no, its not to cause corruptions
Just to fight back on the structions
Just thought you want to know about the why-O-why-O
Yo, should I tell em Ice

They know what time it is

Stompin to the 90s!
For all why'all suckas
Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it
You Can't play wit my Yo-Yo

[Verse 3]
The simple to a methaphor, make someone to yell on
To keep it at a latest while they're yellin, ""more, more!""
I am very versatile, changin my ways to different styles
Knowledge is the key, expense is for my backround
Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel imperior
Follow me on the hands of time, makes no man superior
Should we jam and take the stand, and disback all the
Men who know no more the slang, slang
And thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think its time that we defeat
And stand on our on two feet
If we want to live wit justice and harmony
How many more rounds must I go
In order to let my people know
Times were hard, things have changed

Locate a dope break, and then I break it

I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to
Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm Audi
So when I come to your town don't crowd me
'Cause I know, you're gonna wanna kick it with me
But I know, none of y'all can get with me
So you think you're protected
Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record
Then I have to show and prove and use your groove

Got to the drawers and the ho said ""No!

""It's gettin kinda late, could you come back at eight?""
You said ""Yeah!"" cos you thought you met a wholesome ho

Can't wait till her little boy go to sleep
So you can seduce the G
Bust a nut and make an excuse to leave
You got her worked out cos you the man
But the bitch got diff'rent plans
She said ""Take off your clothes, jump in the bed""
While she powder her nose
You get butt naked, cos you ready to wreck it!
Cos you's a motherfuckin pro, next thing you know
The door flies open with a blast
With four niggas in ski masks
Pointin a gun at the pimp
You're scared as a motherfucker and Jimmy done went limp
They beat you down just a taste
Take ya to your house and make ya open up the safe
Drove you far, tied up in the trunk of your own fuckin car

Take you out and pop the cap
I told you the bitch was a trap
Don't trust em!

Little boy blue is outta folsome
Now them three little pigs gotta roast him
Drivin' down sesame street and I bet
That little motherfucker's out fuckin' smurfette
Ain't saw the wolf yet, but it's no doubt
They'll catch his ass slippin' at his grandma house
They got the mac-10 pointed out the coop
Cause they gotta follow they nose like fruit loops
Peeped out little miss muffet on her tuffet eatin' grits
She saw the mac-10 and the bitch had the shits
Ran into her house, called up her crew
Cause red riding hood wants to kill little boy blue
And the wolf too, what is mister rogers doing?
Moved out his Jordan, bought him a Ewing
Him, little boy blue and the wolf in the cellar
Planning on gettin' Cinderella
Cause Cinderella still works for the pigs
Through with the dwarfs, fuckin' bebe's kids
Now snow white got the horny ass fever
Fuckin' the beauty's beast like jungle fever
Now the word's on the street
When the crews meet
You better make some fuckin' room
Cause it's on with the pigs and them other nigs
When the cow jump over the moon, everybody jump

Now little boy blue is up front
With the nine millimeter, ready for the hunt
Little red riding hood caught his ass slippin'
Drew down on the boy cause the bitch is steady trippin'
About to get loose with the deuce deuce
That's when the boy said, ""what about the gang truce? ""
The little hoe had no words
The wolf came around and the bitch got served
Three little pigs bought wigs
Dressed like sheep, Cinderella is little bo peep
Tryin' to creep, on the crew
The wolf, the rogers, the blue, they through
Cause the pigs did the buck buck bang, ping
Now you hear the fat lady sing
Cinderella, ran like a bitch
To the pay phone cause the bitch is still a snitch
Now the pigs are caught by the pigs and taken
In the pen to get fried like bacon

Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dogs, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl want to dig out
Hooked it up on later as I hit the do'
Thinking will i live  another twenty fo'
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking brothers every way like M.J.
I can't believe, today was a good day

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a niggas direction as I ran the intersection
Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break 'em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day

Left my niggas house paid
Picked up a girl been tryin' to fuck since the twelfth grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep so deep so deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
she didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the morning got the fat burger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cube's a pimp (yeah)
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I got to say it was a good day

I gotta gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm
Ready to bring that noise
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys
April 29th was power to the people
And we might just see a sequel
Cos police got equal pay
A horse is a pig that don't fly straight
Doin Darryl Gates but is Willie Williams
Down with the pilgrims
Just a super slave
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave
I'm wicked enough to board this
Cos now it's on to the fullest
Gorilla straight from the mist
But I don't miss when it comes to this
Bring the yellow tape
The white cape, cause I'm so straight
Thru with the picket signs, take his job and stick it

Ice Cube,"Little boys and girls, they all love me 
Come sit on the lap of I-see-E 
And let me tell ya a story or two 
About a punk-ass nigga I knew 
Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick 
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick 
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot 
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop 
Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe 
At that type of shit he's a pro 
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil' nap 
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps 
Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay 
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way 
To make some money, why not? 
Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot 
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe 
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew 
For the man that was really important 
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan 
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes 
Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes 
He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out 
Saw, her and her friends sellin' sheepskins 

Yo yo I got them sheepskins 
Yo, my empty sheepskins 
Yo baby, what's up with that? 

Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock 
Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock 
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course 
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin her dwarfs 
Saw a fight over colors, too 
Red Riding Hood, and Little Boy Blue 
A bad influence? Yo I don't know 
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go 

Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it 
This is Little Russ in the house 
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit! 
[Well, you know the rest] 

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall 
With a joint, drinkin' some 8-ball 
Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville 
Lookin' for, the wolf to kill 
They're fucked up and they want revenge 
Them and Humpty used to be friends 
Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor 
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him 
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas 
And Mister Rogers is gettin' mighty jealous 
Of the cash that the pigs were makin' 
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon 
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick 
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits 
They said that the motherfuckin' wolf was next 
So Mister Rogers better watch his step 
So he let the wolf know 
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho 
Cause Cinderella is much too fast 
Before twelve, givin' up ass 
Double barrels all loaded and cocked 
As soon as they show, they gonna get popped 
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em 
Little Boy Blue is up front givin' orders 
Little did they know Cinderella was a fink 
She called the cops and got thrown in the clink 
A bad influence? Yo, I don't know 
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go",Gangsta's Fairytale 2,1992

Ice Cube,"Peace, quiet and good order will be maintained in our city
To the best of our ability
Riots, melees and disturbances of the peace are against the
Interests of all our people and therefore cannot be permitted

(The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty, not guilty)
We've been told that all along Crenshaw boulevard
That there's a series of fires, a lot of looting is going on
A disaster area obviously

(The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty)
Make it rough
(A lot of activity continues here in this command post)
Make it rough
(We have sporadic fires throughout the city of Los Angeles)

Not guilty the filthy, devils tried ta kill me
When the news get to the hood then niggas will be
Hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust
Kickin' up dust is a must

I can't trust a cracker in a blue uniform
Stick a nigga like a Unicorn
Vaughn wicked, Lawrence Powell, foul
Cut his fuckin' throat and I smile

Go to Simi valley and surely
Somebody knows the address of the jury
Pay a little visit, ""Who is it?""
(Who is Ice Cube?)
""Can I talk to the grand wizard?"", then boom

Make him eat the barrel, modern day feral
Now he's zipped up like leather tuscadero
Pretty soon, we'll catch Sergeant Coon
Shoot him in the face, run up in him witta broom

Stick prick, devils ain't shit
Introduce his ass to the AK40 dick
Two dazed niggas layin' in the cut
To get some respect we had to tear this muthafucka up
(Make it rough)

I gotta Mac10 for officer Wynd
Damn, his devil ass need to be shipped back to Kansas
In a casket, crew cut fagot
Now he ain't nothin' but food for the maggots

Lunch, punch, Hawaiin lyin'
Niggas ain't buyin', ya story bore me
Tearin' up shit with fire, shooters, looters
Now I got a lap-top computer

I told you all what happened and you heard it, read it
But all you could call me was anti-semitic
Regret it, nope, said it, yep
Listen to my big black boots as I step

Niggas had to break you off somethin', give bush a push
But your national guard ain't hard
You had to get Rodney to stop me 'cause you know what?
We woulda teared this muthafucka up
(Huh, make it rough)
(Huh muggs, make it rough)

It's on, gone with the wind and I know white men can't dunk
Now I'm stealin' blunts
And it came from Betty Crocker, overweight and blacker
Don't fuck with the black-owned stores but hit the foot lockers

Steal, muthafuck fire, Marshall Bill
Oh what the hell, throw the cocktail
I smelt smoke, got the fuck out, Ice Cube lucked out
My nigga had his truck out, didn't get stuck out

In front of that store with the Nikes and Adidas
Oh Jesus, [Incomprehensible] surplus got the heaters
Meet us so we can get the 9's and the what-nots
Got the Mossberg with the double eyed buckshot

Ready for Darryl and like beretta wouldn't say
Keep your eye on the barrel, a sparrow
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
But I'm rollin' so that's a fucked up slogan

The hogan's heroes spotted the gorilla by the sizzler
Hittin' up police killer
The super duper nigga that'll buck
We had to tear this muthafucka up, so what the fuck?

How many bullets can your back hold, suckin from the HK
The red dot`s on your dome, from the light ray
Boom bam bust oh shit kid, your head is a pile of puss
I`m kickin up much dust, the nigga ya can`t trust
This is my shit, my hood, my turf

My gold, my grip, whatever the fuck it`s worth
I don`t need nobody comin in my territory
Tryin' to rip a nigga off and fuck your fuckin sob stories

About to feel the wrath, of a greedy ass cracker
Pale as snow, so you know the hoe stand out
Comin' in my hood with his hand out

Tryin' to get over on the black, but the motherfuckin' mack
Will put a fuckin' slug in his back
And with the boom ping ping, it ain`t no thing to blast
On greedy motherfuckers that trespass

y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi 
military force, but we don't want ya 
Standin' on my roof with the rocket launcher 
""So fly like an eagle."" 
But don't follow us wherever we go 
The shit that I'm saying, make it's heard 
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird 

""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird"" 
""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird"" 

Now
My homey's here to lick on a trick for a Rolex 
And let me try the four next 
Now the four I was driving was hotter than july 
looked up and didn't see it whippin' in the sky 
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom 
""Calling all cars, I think we've got em."" 
I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood 
I think I drove through every single hood 
South Central, Compton and Watts 
Long Beach, bust a you, here come the cops 
Wish I had a genie with about three wishes 
Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious 
You know that I'm running 
Shit, I hear it humming 
Fuck, I see it coming 
Is it a bird? Yup 
Is it a plane? No 
I hit me a right on El Segundo 
Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala 
Let's see if they would folla 
Me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another 
met me a baby pitbull and his mother 
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window 
I wish it was my ten-four 
had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third 
'cause I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird 

""Just put his hat, ehrrr, 
he combed his hair and then put his hat back on. 
he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115 
miles an hour, with the police chasing him. 
they're not gonna be 
real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh
They hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse."" 

Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't want to see him 
could you please give me the keys to the B.M.? 
See, I didn't want to gank you 
but don't make me bank you, thank you 
Tried to get yo the hood, and you might guess 
that a fool like me woulda shot Cyrus 
Incognito, Ghetto Eagle 
Saying, ""Fuck, where did he go?"" 
I bust me a left from Rubellon. Park 
The 735 and I'm bailin'  
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man, 
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman 
Looked out the window by the black bed 
I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed 
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face 
I close the blinds cause I didn't want to catch a case 
All that night, I heard the bird circle 
while I was eating fish and watching Urkel 
She said I could sleep on the couch 
By two A.M. I was digging her out 
Fuck the ghetto bird 

""Which way is he going now?"" 
""Ok, now, now he's, he's actually southbound, on a service street
and, uh, Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure 
out which service street he suddenly turned off on. Uh, the sheriffs 
are, are, well I know that, Sheriffs ground units got thrown off""

Dan Quayle, don't you know you need to get your ass kicked
Where was you when there was niggas in the caskets?
Mutha-fucker rednecks all the same
Feel a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained
That's why we burn shit and wreck
Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dred, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga
But they can't take us alll 
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place [ha ha ha]
Keeping the smile off their white fakes
I ain't racist but lets trade places

Three teach four niggas
And them niggas teach more niggas

Ice Cube,"Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'
Thinking will I live, another twenty-fo'
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm asking y'all
Which park, are y'all playing basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggas every way like M.J.
I can't believe, today was a good day

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexing, didn't even look in a niggas direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watching yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Roll em in a circle of niggas and watch me break em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yelling domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day

Left my niggas house paid
Picked up a girl been trying to fuck since the twelve grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep
Put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the morning got the Fat-burger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cube's a pimp
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I got to say it was a good day.

Hey wait, wait a minute poo Stop the shit",It Was a Good Day [Remix],1994
Ice Cube,"Motherfucker, you'd better break yourself

My skin is my sin, look at my complexion
Section 8, erection great
Balls like Ru Paul and a big fat plank
Get you higher than a Spike Lee joint
See I'm a chicken hawk and I'm hunting chicken and watermelon
It ain't nothing but hard time bailing
Just got a misdomener
Cause I got a deuce-five, and I'm black as Sarafina
Get the hell out Somolia, we didn't call y'all
I can't wait till I can kill all y'all
Fuck Reggie Denton and Jimmy (Johnny) Cochran
Damn I couldn't get close enough to sock him
I plead guilty your honor
Cause I dissed the Pope more times than Sinead O'Connor
Huh huh, cool, like Butthead and Beavis
Truer than the Mack but I'm downer than he is
And that police chief named Willie
Can take his motherfucking ass back to Philly
Dropped a bomb on a crew named ""Move""
Years ago, here's a hoe
That's ready to stop me, they think I'm Khadafi
Rolling in a six-tre jalopy
They want to give me ten in the pen cause I'm smelling like Hen
My skin is my sin

My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin) 
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin) 

I Get Around like Tupac, just bought a new glock
And I want what you got
So please give it up so I can live it up
Just like the rich but I still eat grits
I don't know karate
But I can still beat the dog shit out of Nazis
You claim you want to put in work
Plotting to blow up a church
See you devils are all the same
You'll gun down a congregation in Jesus' name
Using me as a scapegoat, well cracker don't sleep
Far from a goat, more like a black sheep
Lamb of God, and it's odd
That Allah is a man that don't need a tan
And you can't stand when I talk like that
And why do black men have to walk like that?
Cause we swing low like a chariot
And now I got Harriet all on my dick
Cause my shoe size is much bigger than a motherfucking 10
My skin is my sin

My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin)
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin)

Who's that janky-ass nigga with last?
Standing like a G pissing on America's flag
Dub C, the nigga from Westside
Westide Maad Circle bailing with a double barrel
Cause uh, my skin is my sin
And all I need is knowledge of self and ammunition is my best friend
When it's time to roll nigga, we ain't calling on Jesus
I'm calling Mad Dog for the 9 millimeters
Cause I give the song with those peckerwoods to the fullest
And a bitch by the name of America's on it
The same bitch that jacked my forefathers
And the Indians took my motherfucking religion
Place a holy Bible in my hand, but for what?
Like Jim Kelly said, ""You try to set me up?"" Shit...
I'm too slick for your lies in disguise
When will you devils open your eyes and realize?
Like Pepsi, niggas got a new generation
And we don't want your American education
Ain't no brain washing this way
Fuck America, Tom Meztger, and KKK
And to the cracker named J.B. Stoner
Don't let me catch you on no corners
I see you on TV talking more shit
But just like your punk-ass ancestors, you's a bitch
You's a bitch if I ever saw one
Grand Wizard bring your ass on Imperial so we can get physical
And watch God show and prove
Not only mentally but physically the black man rules
So run devil run, you's to best start running
Because the niggas are coming, oh, the niggas are coming
And ain't no way you gon' win
Cause I come from a tribe of O.G.'s and my skin is my sin

Ice Cube,"My job is to tell it like it is
See who the fuck I'ma jack today
Nigga broke, shit and it's early in the mornin'
Today I'm going to tell you the story of Robin Hood

At last, grab my ski-mask out the closet
Now let's see how big did my balls get?
I brush my teeth, it takes a thief
Swervin' 'cause I'm tryin' to roll up the chronic leaf

At a stop sign, I take a hit and hold it in
I cough, now I'm off
Drivin' down the two-lane highway
It's all bad, thinkin' 'bout shit I never had

Pass through the W.S. neighborhood
Knowin' I can do my best in Westwood
Cut off by a white BM, driven by a yuppie
He sticks up his finger like fuck me

Now I gotta follow him home, with my chrome
Send him to the Twilight Zone, it's on
Niggaz say I'm gone 'cause I'm fuckin' with the rich
Say what but they all full of bitch, yeah

Don't need a snitch so I'm rollin' solo
In a straight bucket, no it ain't a low, low
He pulls up to a seven bedroom, eight bath
Oh yeah, he's got to feel the wrath

Pistol to the neck, devil turn off the Westec
And when you're rollin' have mo' respect, bitch
Tied his ass up and took everything I could
A nigga straight robbin', mobbin', back to the hood

All my niggaz love the adventures of
All my niggaz love the adventures of
All my niggaz love the adventures of
Robbin' Hood 'cause it ain't all good

All my niggaz love the adventures of

Robbin' Hood 'cause it ain't all good

Since two-eleven is my favorite number
Fuck squabbin' 'cause I be Robbin' like the Boy Wonder
Holy bandit, leave yo' ass stranded and you know that
Unhook the LoJack, cellular phone under the flo' mat

They wanna say that it's federal
Actin' like your ninety-five Coupe is headed fo'
Beirut they wanna shoot me like a terrorist
But I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm takin' care of this

Trigger finger got blisters
Heard from your sisters, you be rollin' on the twisters
Now when we meet, I can make your heart beat
And make you feel so neat

Or you can get us fifteen
Twenties out the ATM, I'll take all of them, give 'em up
I'm king of the Slim Jim, it's the incredible
Nine-oh-two-one-oh, is where I'm headed foe

Don't need no Merry Men, I fuck around and bury them
If they told, what I stole
Motherfuckers got to know that I'm lethal
Steal from the rich and slide it to my people

All my niggaz love the adventures of
All my niggaz love the adventures of
All my niggaz love the adventures of
Robbin' Hood 'cause it ain't all good

I stalk rich ass people like Hudson Hawk
Bitch don't talk, let's take a walk
Nigga got nuttin' to lose, you know the rules
The purse and the jewels or the eleven o'clock news

Which one? Magnum gun to the titties
Makin' scared devils move from my city
With the strong-arm, fuck the long arm of the law
Bitch count to ten and forget who you saw, hurry up

Had to clock her with the handle
'Cause your husband's a thief with an S and L scandal
Don't feel bad if you're stuck up
Nobody move, nobody get, shut the fuck up

I'm nervous, quick to serve this
Heat in yo' meat, make your blood skeet
A nigga just tryin' to get on his feet
So hurry up, rich bitch, before I twitch

She said, ""Don't rape me and don't kill me""
Nigga don't want to fuck, yo' filthy ass
Just give me the cash and we good
All I wanna do is rob you on my way to the hood

All my niggaz love the adventures of

Ice Cube,"Mr. Dirty Harry, you look really scary
With your .357, officer Kevin
Spent 11 years on the force trying to get mine
Head got the flat top, boots got the spit shine
Don't give a fuck about my neighborhood
Just wanna do your eight hours, then hit the showers
Shoot a brother down adn you don't send flowers
Goddamn sherrif, can't wait to tarriff
A chunk of a nigga ass, but watch a nigga blast
And get away nigga fast
You ain't gonna have me face down no more
You ain't gonna have a chance to clown no more
To the boys in blue, I got kids too
Ain't going out like a jigaboo, no no no
On my way to the store
You see me in a Range Rover, now you gotta pull me over
But where oh where is the ticket?
You got your hand on your gun cause you're wicked
You don't like the face of the original man
But you gotta treat me like an individual man
Talk right and I'll talk right back
Show some goddamn respect to the black
Cause I gotta get back to my wife
But I'm sorry, you ain't gonna take my life

Just because you got a badge
Did you think Ice Cube was gonna wave the white flag?
Cracker please, you can yell freeze
I'd rather die standing up than die on my knees
You think you can do anything you want to do
To my crew when you come through, man fuck you
Shooting up South Central
Catch your ass slipping at a rent show
Could have popped you off, one dead cop
But I know you got a wife and a dog named Spot
I show a little mercy cause I'm civilized
Looking through a nigga's eyes at a much bigger prize
But when I saw Rodney it got me so hot
Made me wanna go out and pop me a cop
Cause every time you see me sagging
Here comes the Grand Dragon, in the motherfucking patty wagon
Try to play me like a trick
Sometimes you act like a dick, Mr. Nightstick
Back then, I used to throw my Mack-10
But nowadays you got the black skin
Back then you don't like the voice of a nigga named Ice
But you ain't gonna take my life

You man let's get an understanding
I know that your job is demanding
But I only got me one life to live
You only got about six shots to give
And I got a big AK with a 50-round clip
So why should we trip?
You ain't gonna punk me, so what you trying for?
Ain't no job worth dying for, is it?
Might pay a visit to Petey Wheatstraw
When you stop me on the shore, officer of the law
And if I did something wrong, you can lock me up
Never never never gonna sock me up
So next time you have the urge, all of the sudden
To fuck with a nigga for nothing
Think about me, a brother that's 23
I got a son and a J-O-B
So before you pull your gun, you'd better think twice
Pig, cause you ain't gonna take my life
",U Ain't Gonna Take My Life,1994
Ice Cube,"Microphone check, yo, yeah

They won't call me a nigga
They won't call me a nigga

Listen to the preacher man, but are you talkin' to me?
I can't hear you with a mouth full of pig's feet
Thy shouldn't eat the swine flesh
Your body is a mess but you're blessed

With the Father, Son, Spirit an' the Holy Ghost
But my whole neighborhood is comatose
Lookin' for survival
The Devil made you a slave an' he gave you a Bible

400 years of gettin' our ass kicked
By so called Christians an' Catholics
But I'm a watch 'em burn in the fire
See I'm a G, that's why I ain't in your choir

The church ain't nuttin' but a fashion show

An' they won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven

They won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven
No they won't, no they won't, no they won't

You're waitin' for the Devil to come from the ground
Clown, take a look around
Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'
A beast in sheep's clothin'

But I'm rollin' with that knowledge of self
'Cause Heaven ain't just wealth
So mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe
Do I have to wait outside?

White man, please take another look
'Cause we couldn't be readin' out the same book
'Cause you'se a crook an' I'm a brother
King James had sex with his mother

Is that yo' edition? Is that your religion?
Black man, you gotta make a decision
'Cause God is comin' on day number seven
An' they won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven

They won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven
No they won't, no they won't, no they won't
They won't call me a nigga when I get to Heaven
No they won't, no they won't, no they won't

The same white man that threw me in the slammer
He bombed the church in Alabama
So if I cock the hammer, God won't mind
If I have to kill the human swine

'Cause God is a killer from the start
Why you think, Noah had to build his Ark?
An' God is a man from his feet to his hair
That's why you say 'Amen' after each an' every prayer

I just stare at the church, man
Spendin' mo' money on the church band
But Elijah's got a plan
Got the white man screamin', ?Damn that Farrakhan?

'Cause one day these babies'll uprise
Much more than bow ties an' bean pies

Instead of a tre-eight slug to the cranium
I got six and I'm aiming em
Will I shoot or keep you guessing
'Cause fuck you and that shit you stressing
Bitch get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighbourhood hooker
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Giving up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop the coochie and you dead
The bitch is a Miami Hurricane head
Sprung, niggas call her Lips and Lungs
Nappy dugout get the fuck out
'Cause women like you gets no respect
Bitch you better run a check

(serious nigga?)

Verse One: Ice Cube
I wish I was in high school
So I could fuck young bitches like Anotha Level do
Let me hip you to my Lethal Injection
The black erec-tion, in your midsection
I have you walking through
Like Bowlegged Lou, heidi heidi hoe, bitch
... it's on like a porno
I got Different Strokes like Willis and Arnold
Now, Mr. Drummond see me coming but
Watch your wife, for my dick'll be running a patch like
Slick Rick, thought I saw a putty-tat
Pussy fatter than the insane bitch that's singing
at the end of the game
Fumble more titties than Thurmond, Thomas, I'm as
great man as eight man, and Emmitt Smith
I got the gift to hit it swift
So bitch you need a lift and I'm out

Verse Two:
Well how can one young black mack unpack
papes in mad stacks with no gat? I'm cool like that
...and then some
I got styles in my files so I lend some, to the needy
You get up, kid, but you get hit up like graffiti
Yo this the A-L rhymes that we say well
So ease up, don't freeze up or get nervous
'cause if you do loc got Levels-N-Service
So cock back and top that
I wear a top hat, I'm at the top 'cause I'm all that
And extra adverbs, they're the kind you couldn't fuck with
I got my style and I'm stuck with it

got levels-n-service (2X)
Verse Three: Bambino
I down a brew, then I check one two it
And tellin bitches bend over, 'cause you know how we do it
In the W-E-S-T the best nothin less see
Smooth adolescent, anti-depressant Bambino
Suckaz, don't make me angry
Knockin fuckers out, when my Tanqueray's tangy
But I'm a playa, pullin Berry's like Holly
I freak hoes, and freak flows, with no follies
Like the proper brown eps, we're body
See most niggaz get paid and want to cracker like Polly
But Levels-N-Service, you know what's up
And niggaz probably think I'm crazy 'cause I'm bustin like a nut

got levels-n-service
Verse Four:
The pressure is on, I combine and come bust rhymes
In thousands of shows and still have Miller time
I speed it up, I slow it dowwwwn
I max, I smoke a pound
So sit back, and listen to me lyrically
come all over the track, I fake the wack
Fly honies I attract
Niggaz know not to act up, dips be on my tip
so much I tell em back up
But don't say nothin, just listen
I'm not on a mission, a wack MC dissing
I'm just here to present the rep of my group
We gots flavor, styles by the miles hoes and flows too
I'm tough actin like Tinactin for the feet
My niggaz love the way I'm reactin to the beat
It sounds sweet, I skate you to the street
And I make service, so niggaz get nervous

Ice Cube,"In world news today officials agree that rapper Brad Jordan alias Scarface must be stopped 
After being monitored by secret service agents for two years 
Evidence leads Tobacco and Fire Arms officials to believe that his 
literally dope lyrics promote drug usage and distribution 
Degrade women  influence gambling  promote and teach violence and more importantly 
Its influencing our minors and destroying our young community 
Officials say, he's the lord of underground rap and his music must be stopped 

We got this whole motherfucker on a mission 
Now the whole entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision 
They claim we threats to society 
And now they callin on the government to try and make somebody quiet 
For the bullshit they done to me 
Gangsta Nip, Spice 1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me 
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that 
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat 
So why you tryin kick some dust up 
America's been always known for blaiming us niggas for they fuck-ups 
And we were always considered evil 
Now they tryin to bust our only code of communicating with our people 
Lets peep the game from a different angle 
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled 
So why you criticize me 
For the shit that you see on your tv 
That rates worse than PG 
Just bring your ass to where they got me 
So you can feel the hand of the dead body 

[Chorus: x2]
Nigga don't believe that song 
That nigga's wrong 
Gangstas don't live that long 

So now they tryin separation 
And sendin black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation 
Tappin into our conversation 
Saying the message that they give 
Bring forth or premeditation 
So David's got a silver mag 
While listenin to Brad, David gets mad and kills his dad 
David Duke's got a shotgun 
So why you get upset cause I got one 
A tisket a tasket 
A nigga got his ass kicked 
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket 
An open and sgut situation 
Cop gets got, the want to blame it on my occupation 
If you don't dig me, than nigga you can sue me 
Because the shit that I be sayin ain't worse than no western money 
Don't blame me blame your man Gotti 
So you can feel the hand of the dead body 

[Chorus: x2]

You best to free your mine 
Before I free my nine 
And stop fuckin with the void in pop 
Or feel my hot rocks 
Bang, bang, boom boom, ping ping I'm the black 
White boys gat a magazine and don't kow how to act 
I'll attack and make you vomit 
Down with Kahlid Abdul Muhammad 
Do he got a brother, I'm it now 
I'm the illest 
want to kill this house nigga Don Cornelius 
Can you feel this? 
You punk niggas make me sick 
Suckin' on the devil's dick 
Scared of revolution 
Need to start deuchin' 
Houston is the place 
I caught a case 
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face 
But i bust two times to the gut 
To the Reverend Calvin Butts 
Gotta pair of nuts? 
I started this gangsta shit in 86 
Now you dissin' me 
For publicity 
Isn't he a hoe to the third degree 
Who me 
I'm a g who like to scrap-a-lot 
Down with Rap-A-Lot 
And I can't stop, won't stop 
So fuck Bill and Hillary 
Ice Cube their ain't no killin' me 
Ice Cube, Scarface 
Droppin' on these sellin' out niggas, doing it like this 

[Chorus: x2]",Hand of the Dead Body,1994
Ice Cube,"We're sitting here with Eazy E
Believe that 
How are you doing?
All right
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster ?

Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin' , I specialized in gankin
whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangster havin fun)
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear, and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala
Rollin, and runnin' from the police
Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief
or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
(Eazy E, were you ever caught slipping?)
Hell no! Just trippin' off eight-ball
And girls ain't  nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches! I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
out anybody gettin' on my nerves 
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
and if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn

Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called ""gank"" somebody?

Wait for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Look then all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow, cause it takes timing
Looked around, and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
Cause you know it's no time for shakin
Get what you gonna get, front and center
or get five years for breakin and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shht, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key, and I flee
out the back door with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall don't fall
Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?

Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, a armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a two hundred eleven ?
Yeah

There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
(Were you slick?)
Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said: ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
The man in the back had a camera
so he came out to test his stamina
against Eazy E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I ran
back to the bucket, then I said: ""Punch it"" 
Took the gun, and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
(Is all that true ?)
I don't lie
You see I'm not mister nice guy

Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?

Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my hit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
thought, and damn so what?
Down and dirty from the C-P-T
N-W-A and Eazy-E
One more, before we end this session
(What's your real name?)
No more questions!",No More ?'s,
Ice Cube,"Yo I want to get high 
I want to get high 

Walking through campus with my backpack 
Bailin' to orientation 
So I can change the nation 
See many faces but none of 'em mirror me 

Show my ID to the punk ass security 
Step on the quad lookin' for the track squad 
Walked by a bitch who think she's God 
Passing me a flyer talkin' 'bout the Messiah 

She want to take me higher 
Keep your rhetoric in the heavens 
Look and see a bro' with a fro like Michael Evans 
Done spent 6 years in the college 

Always telling me to question the knowledge 
Sittin' in the black hole with the black stroll 
And not even one cave bitch in our click 
Sayin' fuck Professor Fitz 

I come from the land of the Bloods and the Crips (What's up nigga) 
Don't like scholarships because they hurt me 
Nothin' but a slave to the university 
That's why ya see me on the track field run by ya 
Caught by a liar who want to take me higher 

[Chorus] 
Shit, he want to take me higher 
Wait until they get a load of me, shit shit 
I want to get high so high 
Chocolate Thai 

I want to take flight ya Goddamn right 
It's a party every fucking night 
Been there for about 6 weeks 
Walked by the freaks 
Look, black greeks 
How the fuck ya figure 
I dig ya me bein' from niggafied nigga 
White boy in the room with me 
Who never saw BET what the fuck 
He's about to erupt and turn red 
Start hangin' with the muthafuckin' skinheads 
'Cause he can't deal with the overkill 
College ain't nothin' but niggaville 
And he regret that his school is filled 
With niggas jews and wetbacks 
Plus chinks now he drinks 
Hour after hour screaming white power 
Motherfucker want me to call him sire 
He want to take me higher 

[Chorus]

A girl gets date raped just like that 
At a frat now she chase the cat 
Feminist saying women is God's gift 
Do you need a lift can I take a sniff 
Do I sound sexist cause I'm chasin' 
After Deja she from Texas? 
Down to kick the asses of the fascists 
Who want to put me in the oven and burn me to ashes 
But I'm not burnin' the world keeps turnin' 
And nobody learnin' 
'Cause college is full of shit 
Teachin' me to memorize nothin' but the lies 
Chillin' at a rally for peace 
The beast from white power up in the tower 
With the M-1 gun and a scope on dope 
Thinkin' he's the great white hope 
Motherfucker levels off 
He want to see me 6 feet deep shoveled off 
Cause Columbus University is nothing but a empire 
Who want to take me higher 

[Chorus] 
Shit they want to take me higher 
Wait until they get a load of me 
Shit they want to take me higher 
They want to take me higher 
Unh damn they want to take me higher 
Damn wait until they get a load of me 
Damn unh they want to take me they want to take me

Ice Cube,"We havin' big thangs.
Ice Cube, the only nigga that can bring Too $hort out of retirement.
Representin' money.
Hmm, beeitch.

[Ice Cube, Too $hort]
Wise crackin' felines, uh. 
Can a nigga make a bee-line
To that nappy area?  Don't want to marry ya;
Just want to bury ya head in a pillow.
Sorry, but I got a kill yo' pussy-willow.
Janked ass penicillin; ain't got ta ask how ya feelin';
I'm tha nigga that got ya squealin'.
Ya want to know how we keep these hos in check? 
Keep them broke, and keep their panties soakin' wet.
I like to smoke big, ride fat, and always stack cash.
Believe me, keep her breezy with her fat ass.  (Fat ass.) 
Big thangs on my mind; ain't trippin' at all.
They call me $hort, but I got a big dick in my drawers;
I feel like a giant sometimes; bitch, don't stare,
You'll go blind from my diamonds
Tryin' ta size me up, but basketball I ain't playin'.
Call a tech; blow the whistle; throw the bitch out the game.

[Chorus]
We havin' big thangs, (like it's the thang to do;) 
Big thangs, baby, ($hort Dawg and Cube.) 
We havin' big thangs, (like it's the thang to do;) 
Big thangs, baby, (you know it's true; really doe.)
 
[Ice Cube, Too $hort]
Now how can I let this bitch run it,
When her ass ain't never felt the seats of a six hunnit?  (Now.) 
Tricks, we take shits at the rents; we don't get excited 
Over long hair and big tits.
$hort Dawg, they get hella weak when I tell the freak 
We the richest niggas that you gonna ever meet.
We got bosses in the back, countin' the stack.
We got cunts in the front, with Hennesey and blunts.
Now what you want? 
She want to get fucked all night long; bitch, what's up? 
You know I got a tight song;
Heard me on the radio; I can't go wrong.
But you ain't got no features; this can't go on.
You're like a bundle of joy, but you're unemployed.
You ain't throwin', so the pussy is just null and void.
Do you really understand what I'm tellin' you?
Looks can be deceiving, and bitch, I ain't even feelin' you.

[Chorus x 2]

Best believe me; it ain't easy, to be off the heazee.

[Ice Cube, Too $hort]
You can try and figure out the new shit we on.
Before you break yourself make yourself at home.
Give thanks, when it's Ice Cube, $hort Dawg, and Ant Banks.
We all platinum; now ya got ta add francs
To the salary; that'll be cash or charge.
So large; got a whole floor actin' mirage.
We like big thangs; we like runnin' big trains
Of big beautiful bitches with big brains.
Bitches with big brains; I went to Spelman College
To see if my dick could get some higher knowledge.
But pussy is pussy, from Bel-Air to the projects;
Bitch better suck my dick.
Ain't nothin' new; the game is old.
You think the bitch is decent, and that's the same old ho;
Used to fuck the whole crew; we was ballin', man.
Westside!  You know we doin' big thangs.

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube, $hort Dawg]
We off that heazee, bitch.
Beeeyyyitch.
Hey $hort, give 'em yo' part.
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, make me rich.
Do all that shit.
She can even lick my dick, but I ain't lickin' no clits.

The world is mine (*whispered* the world is mine)

The world, belongs to me
Niggaz don't know my pedigree, W-S to the see
We be them hogs, that make it rain cats and dogs
We got the ""Bud"" just like them frogs

Now everybody on the West, show some love
And everybody on the East, respect the Corniche, it's not on lease
Breakin laws, swimmin through the water like Jaws
Gumby's pause, and take they drawers, no balls

God damnit, niggaz take my planet for granted I can't stand it
Catch a flight across the Atlantic
Step off the plane, nuttin but expense of the game
Bitch I'm rich you know my name, show me the cane

Now are you sure? One hundred percent pure
'Cause if it's not, believe me the shit gettin hot
I got a plot to make your whole family deaf dumb and blind
(tell em one more time) the world is mine

[Chorus: x 2]
The world is mine nigga, back up
I got's to get mine before I act up

It's a quarter to eight, I'm not finished my plate
I got a phone call to make, my niggaz tell me it's fake
Oh what a mistake, here's what I want you to break
Tie his feet with some weight, throw his ass in a lake

And then set up a date, between me and his mate
Tell her lobster and steak, and bitch don't be late
Oh the pussy was great, I'm still sealin your fate
'Cause you can't imitate, the nigga you love to hate

[Chorus]

Can I grin, show my fin, I'm down with mack 10
Dub-see, K-Dee, and Kausion
It don't stop, niggaz get to bowin a lot
When we enter the spot, look all the niggaz we got

Worldwide, nigga take a look outside
Got a brother named Clyde, he's like Jekyll and Hyde
Ice Cube is the lick, Westside is the click
(Can't get enough of this gangsta shit)

You want to check our cajones we got the feds up on us
We gotta roll on Daytonas because we know that they want us
And if they catch us in rap, it's a reasonable doubt
My niggaz pointin me out, my momma scream and she shout

But we got enough green, from our triple beam
To hire the prosecution, and the dream team
This world ain't nuttin but a dollar sign (ching ching)
I'm a partner in crime, the world is mine

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
Yeah, you punk ass niggaz know the side, so check it
When you meet us, you better bring your heaters
Cause the only way you could beat us, is if you cheat us nigga

Mad at us cause we on top

Better get it while the gettin' is good
Get it while you can, man
And stop hatin' me, fuckin' with my shit cause I got more hustle than you
Get yours, get yours baby

I'm seeing millions, niggas don't understand
Know what? I'm makin' moves, puttin' cash behind plans
To blow up, will he style like this
Everyday I parlay, sip Henne and Tanqueray
Stay in the mix like Alezay
V.I.P., my shit parked valet
On the prowl again to get hunnies familiar with the smile again
Some try to assault Dre, its still cavi
I'm eatin' steak while they struggle to break the slave mentality
I givin' livin' definition long as my hearts tickin'
I fought and made the world listen
Whatever fly Dr. Dre invented
Turn on the box and let my son watch these studio clowns on 60 inches
I push a rover, shit platinum before the sessions over
Rap master with the Houston heat holder
These players best to get they shit in check
Cause when I get my hustle on ain't no playin' with a full deck

Lord please, murder my enemies (Yeah)
Burn em at a thousand degrees
And lord please let me make mo cheese
Cause I ain't quite ready to leave (No)

Buck the whole world
Meant that, gotta stay strapped
Cause 99.9 a niggas, carry they gats
Super fist fightin' shit might come down to dyin'
When the time comes down for the tryin' I got nine
Reasons why niggas shouldn't step in my face
With the nonsense, cause I'm always heated and you can taste this
Audi little something out the seams a my trousers
With no hesitation I got a team to come clown ya
I down ya, so let your people know what they face
With the type of individual that'll bomb a sub-station
Kaboom! and everybody dies outside
There ain't no escapin' the Reaper so don't try
Go ahead, close ya eyes, who the next to step?
Face down, hit, bleedin' on the steps a death
Check yo self, you just been invaded by true soldiers

[Chorus]

(I've got all my life to live, plus with all my love to give)

Smokin' weed I never trail, I lead
Spendin' dough, tripped the cost of a ride like it was pocket money, Gs
But these are the things real players do
Talkin' shit is real things that the haters do
I'm namin' you
Shit's thick, its time to run for shelter
I kept the word, things could happen to marks like it was helter skelter
Dear diary, I'm runnin' outta pages
Fadin', in and out, takin' purple hazes
The dazes, Revelations in the last stages
Red sky's institute, the silent horns playin
I'm prayin' with tears in my eyes
Cause I'm tryin' to make it into eternal peace without dyin'
But they eyein' my bank account with beams on my rover
The killa failed to launch his attack (the game is over)

With this, gangsta click, droppin this, gangsta shit
Strictly for the riders who ride us I gotta WestSider
Rhymer for them niggas that's sittin on them Dayton wires
Pump the bass, hit the switch
Cause Ice Cube, Mack 10, and Dub-C, back up in this b-i-itch
Straight hoodsta for life, ain't no lookin back
Ink in my flesh, WestSide tattoed on my chest
Walkin with the shadow of death
Through the land of the skanless, South Central Los Angeles
Home of the Crips and the Bloods
Where even the strongest niggas is drug through the mud
And visitors from outta town best to stay in Hollywood
You get that tourist ass ganked strollin through my hood
West coast till the casket drop
I be throwin it up, so motherfucker West Up!

It's gun ho Mack one, no please you can't fuck wit deez
Ice Cubez and Dub-Ceez is my G'z
And hip-hop, top three niggas the new bosses
Never slippin cause we flosses, packin Nina Rosses
Nigga, thought You Knew How We Do It
Ain't a Damn Thing Changed, always On Them Thangs
Forever and a day, so back up, gimme room, don't neglect
Just respect and everything I can't check I wreck
Now you can cross out the bustas and snitches
Shit only killers hootchie bitches and hot hydraulic switches allowed
On the turf where the real hogs dwell
Sewed up the hood, the fattest boulders on the block for sale
Inglewood City, the throne I call home
Niggas be so bright, you might need your locs on
To bail through, it's fin you're in with Mack 10
And I gotta confess up, nigga this West Up! for life

Front back side to side
We be givin it up, till the day we die
Niggas hit me up, I'mma have ta erupt

We be givin it up, till the day we die
Niggas hit me up, I'mma have ta erupt
So motherfucker West Up!

Now I got ta show you how the West coast rocks
No razor blades, in my mouth, just a Glock
And I'm hittin you up, with that W-S
The sun rises in the East, but it sets in the West
No gold teeth, you gets a wreath
So hand me the goodies, stockin mask, no hoodies
Christmas day, I'm in a tre
While some of you niggas got the robe reindeer and a sleigh
We don't call it five-oh, we call it one time
It's my life my life my life my life, in the sunshine!
One nine weighs a ton
How the fuck you think that the West was won?
Now shit can be squashed over a forty ounce of backwash
No jokes, the land of locs and hundred spokes
In the East, we can be brothers
But when you come to L.A., watch your motherfuckin colors
West Up! nigga

Front back side to side
We be givin it up, till the day we die
Niggas hit me up, I'mma have ta erupt
So motherfucker West Up!

Front back side to side
We be givin it up, till the day we die
Niggas hit me up, I'mma have ta erupt
So motherfucker West Up!

Give it up, give it up
Like the nigga James Brown, me and my niggas are puttin it down
So bustas be wary cause see we represent the city
Where niggas caught slippin is left with they brains drippin
City of the Angels, more like a concrete jungle
Full of macks Cadillacs and crack sacks
I pledge allegiance to the shit till I die
So let the five-twenty slide and put it down from the WestSide

Front back side to side
We be givin it up, till the day we die
Niggas hit me up, I'mma have ta erupt
So motherfucker West Up!

Front back side to side
We be givin it up, till the day we die

Journey with me
Into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer
Since I came out the nut sack
I'm in a murderous mind-state
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck buck, Lights out
Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggas get hauled off

*Barrel one
Touches your motherfuckin' flesh
*Barrel two
Shoots your fucking heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to wreck mine
Fool its your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head
Like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitating I ain't hesitating
To put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver
Its like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag
And your frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller
Than this grave yard filler
Cap peeler
Cause I'm a natural born killa

[Ice Cube]
Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma
Cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker
(yeah what's up)
It feels like I'm busting a nut
When I open you up
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
Cause I'm giving dirt naps
Coming with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse
Perhaps, you never sleep
Cause every time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfucking nose
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days
Let me count the ways ^in a fucked up maze^
I never ever ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre
Like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how your living
I'm the unforgiving
Psycho driving
Murderer
Its authentic
Don't panic
I can't stand it
God Damn it
Schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit em with a brick
And I'm dancing

I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of Sirens
Terrified screams from the streams
Of Strychnine
Dumping on any motherfucker trying to trick mine
Cause motherfuckers want to violate
Now they stiff and cold
And they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain
Migraine
Headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes
Like that dude up in Singapore
So I'm a pull a fuckin Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana

Or a dime

Hallucination
Ain't no debating
I'm creating an escape
Route to be out without a doubt

Cause I can't wait

Which is Yo-Yo, but I'm not to be played
Like I was made by matell
But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male
I rhyme about uprights upliftin the woman
For that are superior to handle by any male
Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show
And if you ask my producers that we fly and you know

You can't play with my Yo-Yo

My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho
I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift, as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who came to dap
To the fact I get the 8-ball, or the jam
The earrings I wear are called dophins
Check the booty, yo it's kinda soft and
If you touch, you livin in a coffin(word to mother)
I'm in the 90s, your still in the 80s right
I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady like

I steal yo man, as if he was a hawk and
He'll call me baby, yo, or even pumpkin
I may be buttercup, or even 
We had dinner, and know we drinkin Cisco
Hit the slow jams, it's gettin cosy
Your home alone, so now you gettin nosy
Your kinda young, so of course you had to call replace
Hang up in my face, it's a sad case
So who ya man dippin the dollars, what
Yup, for puttin lipstick on his collar
At home, he's gotta listen to ya holla
But he'll slap ya, and sock ya, so why bother?

But if you come knockin at my do'(ay yo)
I'll smoke you, tell em Ice

Tell em what's up

Yo, I hope you realize one day
That ya week is Monday threw Sunday
So listen to my Y-O, heres my bio
And next to me, ha, your not fly yo
Ya lack skills to be a woman that's black
Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts
Yo-Yo, is just tryna to stop ya
Because the world ain't a big soap opera
It only takes one punch to drop ya
And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya
But no, I'm not livin like that first
Although I pack, a real small gat in my purse(right, right)
But no, it's not to cause corruptions
Just to fight back on the structions

Yo, should I tell em Ice

Stompin to the 90s! 
For all y'all suckas
Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it
You Can't play wit my Yo-Yo

The simple to a methaphor, make someone to yell on
To keep it at a latest while they're yellin, ""more, more!""
I am very versatile, changin my ways to diffrent styles
Knowledge is the key, expense is for my backround
Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel imperior
Follow me on the hands of time, makes no man superior
Should we jam and take the stand, and disback all the
Men who know no more the slang, slang
And thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think it's time that we defeat
And stand on our on two feet
If we wanna live wit justice and harmony
How many more rounds must I go

Kiss my grips like ? or Mel's Diner 
I'm meaner than a motherfucking Hyena, chasing Antelope 
Put a chrome to your dome, watch it bust like a Cantelope 
I can't stand a rope, so don't try to hang 'em 
Talk about dog's, boy I can sling 'em 
Ratta-tat-tat on your noggin 
Cause Ice will cream your ass like ? chocolate 
I get crazy when I catch a rap 
Even be flipping the toungue like ? Das-Efx 
So who is Ice Cube? 
I'm a rapper, actor, macker 
Got a little problem with the redneck cracker
Get the polly, whack her, ? is a devil shit-packer 
Coming with a crazy pitch 
And the statue of Liberty ain't nothing but a lazy bitch 
Don't want to give up the crack to the black 
But you call it racial, if we go and break the ho' 
But eat 'em up yum and your flawed

Never up in Spago's when we knock hoes
Head her off with some Reeboks and cagos
Westside rollin' even if the car's stolen
Even if my eyes shut & jaw swollen
That's how it's goin' down

Or it's styles that flow like Hudson River debris
Ship quarter keys of them Shaq CD's Roo roo

Pullin' together with my neighbor no playa haters

Jump out the pages from the book of MC's

Like Shaq when he go back & dominate

Squeeze pale **** cause disaster

In every game, we gotta have the brains and the muscle
The game and the hustle... to be real on these streets
So here you have it, the Brainiac
 Ice Cube
With the Maniac
 Mack 10

Mack & Cube: Yay-why-yay! X2
Verse One
Ice Cube:
While ya`ll niggas think about the pap¨¦
I think about which Titanic I`mma sink
The iceberg, with the nice words
I slice verbs and predicets, ghetto etiquette
Y`all better get, this dime-mega shit
The Braniac, the theory be conspiracy
Keep my eye on the birdie, but never get my hands dirty
Verbally call the Maniac and his attack dogs
Signing contracts with automatic jack clause

Mack 10:
I get full of their shit and take flight on these niggas
`Bout to show these so-called
Wig-splitters and nigg-hitters
Who the man be, and what the number one clique is
Let my nuts hang on these busts
And hoes see how big my dick is
Maniac Mack 10 always keep the heat toted
And teflon tips keep the .44 loaded 
Straight quoted in nine-trey, by the dime
Now we connected
He said, ""Mack, when you westsidin` and ridin` is expected""
So I...

Chorus
Cube: Maniac with Brainiac, Mack 10!
Mack: You do the drivin`, while I do the jackin`
Cube: Maniac with Brainiac, Mack 10!
Mack: My nigga if you plot it, best believe I got it
Mack: And it`s on... feel the chrome

Verse 2
Ice Cube:
You in the Stargate, trying t`escape, it`s not an option
Got torture techniques for them lies, don`t ever lie
Just put the car in drive, we can go ride- get this money
Determined as the Energized Bunny, make a left
Underground parking, guns start sparkin`
ATF enemies all around start chargin`
Tryin` to fuck up my new suit and my weekend
Ask me what you want, you bitch! I ain`t speakin`

Mack 10:
Shit, I gives a fuck what the next nigga think
(?) gives a fuck how much bitch you say you ain`t
It`s like this on mine, potna
By all means, I got the ball
So it`s your life, not mine nigga, so you make the call
Now, I can blow your brains out, punk and act the fuckin` fool
Or you can hand your guns over, and let everything be cool
But know this: I won`t hesitate to peel your wig back
I`m off that wet-bomb and the whole fifty yak
It`s Mack the Maniac, nigga

Chorus
Verse 3
Ice Cube:
What`s the plan? Everything thought out
Everything bought out, like Bill Gates
My niggas love steel weights
I`m still great, after 12 muthafuckin` years
I (?) your ass after 12 muthafuckin` beers
I act kind to my peers and everybody that listen
They know when the Brainiac`s missin`
The big fish, hanging with the chicken hawk
Got all the haters, claimin` that they want to talk

Mack 10:
You argue wit `em and negotiate, and I really want to kill `em
I`m tired of the bullshit, man I really want to peel `em
Dog, I knew they were scareless
`Cause my brother Snoop told us
So fuck the money and the dope that they punk-ass owe us
Now when I see `em, it ain`t no question it`s all the way on
But I`mma wait in front of they momma house
For that one nigga to get home
And when I gun, watch his body jump
And it`s all going to amaze me
To see his own self
Layin` there with his own brains on the pavement

Chorus
Outro: Mack 10
And it`s on... keep takin` `til it`s gone
And it`s on... feel the wrath of the chrome

I couldn't have treated her worse then in the ghetto
And turn our women's into widows
Sick to see my homie that I ain't with, trade with, payed with, laughed with
Dead in a casket.

That's by the number, we can slumber, on the under
Girl no wonder, you got a ass full of thunder

You still fuckin' with them faggets
We turn haters into maggets
Oak on the dash, but no coke on the hash
You broke ass niggas learn to mash, like me
Constantly, put the hustle down
With four or five niggas that's musclebound
Send your head to the taxidermist
Won't be satisfied, till I get my face on a thermos
You got to earn this, you can't take it
Can't fake it, got to live it, or we gots to visit
Who is it, the exquisite, Don Mega
Walkin' with my entourage, I think I'm betta, makin' chedda
You see me sag in my Jag, with the rag recognize the flag
You betta get back, everybody wanna do it like me

I keeps a firm grip on my shit when in transit
Uncandid, it's the young bandit
Fresh out the trenches, the wood works
City of the Tempeon, where the hoods lurk
In search of the rich blocks, to lick spots, and kick rocks
From shattered glass, down the pig locks
Want tips by the clock
You niggas scramblin' for fouyan
And settle for crumbs and croutans
I'm out for armored bucks and armored trucks, with armed killas
Bitch niggas get swallowed by the armadillos
Ain't no harmin' me, the army full honary niggas you can't see
So while you pace bitches and Saturn's livin' jenky
I hangs with niggas who got patterns on they hankey
After Ben Frankeys, with the big skullen eyes
You niggas bound and nullified
Sit back and mine stack it multiply

In a cold sweat  heard magnums in my dreams  my ears ring 

So this time on the mic I bring horror like Stephen King 

All my good times are turned bad like the Evan's 

Seen hundreds get wounded but like a thousand 187's 

Everybody that was so real  they were now phony 

And the nigga that used to be my homie, shit he turned on me 

I got a 45 that spit hot lead that'll drill him 

The nigga know too much about me, so it's a must that I kill him 

If it's time available at the shrink, man I need to spend it 

'cause now I see the chair rockin, but ain't nobody in it 

I'm psycho like Norman Bates in the fresh side of my mind and 

All I think about is comittin redrums like The Shining 

So Lord please help me and forgive me for my sins 

And tell me, why do I deserve the twilight zone that I'm in?

Look out for one another motherfuckin' color 

We quick to bring it, but ain't got time for the drama

I got my money to make, niggaz a gank, gay to chase 

Keys a takin', bottles of paint, pounds of flip, a bottle of steak

Snatch one inside, she wanna ride with this mission
Close the partition, he like to listen

While you worry 'bout the five mics, I'm in the limelight

Been on deck since my last felony
I'm that 0 for 2 motherfucker
With the Louisville Slugger
Shay Whitie, that left hand punk
Is on the mound and he comin' wit that off-speed junk
Its the West side Hustlers, vs these LA Pigs
You can say the damned vs the nigs
My little homies in the dugout
They lookin' sad, cause fourteen niggas done struck-out
My first offense was possession of weed
Now I'm in the major leagues and
That motherfucker Bill Clinton-is a son of a bitch
Had the nerve to throw out the first pitch
I'm just tryin' to get rich like Trump
The Home Run king is now in a slump, pass me a hunk
How the fuck can I stay out the pen
When its one-two-three strikes you in

One-two three strikes you in
Now how the fuck a nigga supposed
To stay out the pen, I'm on a blend

I swing, aw shit (foul tip)

Like to steal home and I betcha
That I can run over, the LA Pig catcher
Just because I'm black, wit a bat
They wanna send a nigga back to the warning track
Full of count they say I won't amount to shit

With a split in my mouth on tha cellular phone

And watch a pitcher get served
You from the LA Pigs
I know you coming with a curve
Hey batter, batter is the chitter-chatter
I'm the designated hitter, a nigga
Much badder, than Babe Ruth
Will I tell the truth and nothing but the truth
Hell yea, I'd rather be shootin' hoops
Cause a niggas guaranteed to win
Against a bullshit loss and three strikes you in

Take me out to the ballgame
Take me out to the crowd (wha what, wha what)

Keep ya peanuts Jeezuh
And fuck you Cracker Jack
I hope I never come back

If they don't win its a shame
Cause its one-two-three strikes you in
Twenty-five years of pain you know my name

They wanna nigga to run and get hung
High strung, so this pig can win the Cy-Young
I'ma hit this motherfucker a mile
In the batters box, high as Steve Hal
You can't salary cap my gat
No strike, cause gangsta-rap is on the map
I'm like Satchel Paige wit a gauge
Or Jackie Robinson, when I'm robbin' one
Of you Cracker Jacks fool I'm a motherfuckin' vet
And fuck yo seventh-inning stretch, so
Take me out to the ballgame,

Their fantasies of a life stress-free

But I will be back to California to see you 
Your son  Ice motherfucking Cube.

Ghetto destroyer  paranoia, I need a lawyer 
This bitch named Netoia, say they lookin' for ya 
Got to get the fuck out of here (yeah right) 
This bitch dimmed the lights (nigga, spend the night) 
Bust a quick nut, got to fuck up and gat on 
'cause this the same street I got shot on 
So God bless Don Polla, double-s 
I gotta holla 'cause I'm smokin' on double breath 
Freakin', niggas be leakin', information 
Got the feds seekin', incarceration

Count my pennies, only got a bag fulla twenties

It's so hard to get a room without a credit card 
It's so hard not to let em know where you are 
Tried to get a rent a car 
But he laughed when I showed him cash 
Had to mash 'fore he called the feds on my ass 
Went to Vegas for the weekend 
Met a hoe down freakin' 
Hey bitch, why you sneakin'? 
Grabbed the paper out her hand 
Am I the man on the front page? (Fuck) 
Same height, same age (click-click) 
Rap gauge, put it down the G-way 
Got my hostage suckin' sausage on the freeway 
She say ""Let's hear the circle K"" 
Ran inside and made the niggas all pay 
It's like I hit the Lotto outside Colorado 
Brought it there for his wallet and my bottle 
That's my motto and I gotta warn ya 
Before I'm through, I'm going back to California

My boys you're taught at Illonois 
Set the poise, so I can infiltrate

I'm up in D.C. with strike number three 
Clownin', made a little stock to get a little cock 
Now I got niggas bangin' and lootin' rock 
I'm going back to Cali where it's bound with my strikes

Cause if they are, we gots to be who we be! 
And make a star, out of a head enemy! 
The papers said, that he died tragically! 
They found his head, with no legs and bo-dy! 
We made a pledge, to the Dub-S-see! 
Bloodshed, if they got no love for peace! 
Sing it! 

[Chorus]

I'd rather break bread than uh, break your head 
Break your legs, have em broken, I ain't no joke 
Don't provoke, the gun smoke from the highest slope 
Eternal peace, for my peoples and my folks 
My crips and my bloods, criminals and my thugs 
Just show a nigga love when I'm rollin' on them dubs 
Just, give a nigga hugs, we can ride on this piece 
Westside for Life but still down with the East 
Sing it! 

[Chorus: x2]

After the haters attempt to blow up his car 
We find our hero, Ice Cube, on the ground 
Bruised, but not beaten 
He pulls out his cell phone, with the chip! 
And begins to dial Mack One-Oh 
Who's faded and rolling through Inglewood

Damn, what you doing over here? Whassup?
Yeah I was thinking about you the other day
And I was thinking I should have never fucked wit' your ass
I should have left you right where I founnd you
My bed (echo)
[Verse 1]
When I was with you all you ever do was bitch
Talk shit, but you could suck dick
So I didn't sweat all the fussin' and cussin'
On New Year's Eve, the night I was bussin'(wow)
I would stress and strain to mantain
And didn't need to hear your motherfucking ass complain
About niggaz in the house (mm), feet on the couch
Talkin' all loud (yeah), blunt in my mouth (yeah)
Bitch I got fifty cents on this genesis
Talkin' 'bout niggaz got to vacate the premises
(She's dead) Homie histor
An' outa nowhere your ass got hard
Poured out the pub, then you got drugged
We at it again, I tried to count to ten
There's no end to your naggin'
You can't treat me like I'm faggin', hoe
You see I'm saggin' (no)
Why I gotta act like a motherfucking asshole (why)
To be king of my motherfucking castle
You'll never be the missus (never)
Breakin' all my dishes
And fuck all my X-bitches
[Chorus 1]
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours
(repeat)
[Verse 2]
On an' off, off an' on, bitch I'm grown
So stop playing on my phone (stop)
It was a time we used to bump and grind
And find heaven (ahh)
Without a motherfucking reverend
Managoua twages and bomb-ass massages
And dreams of three-car garages
You say I'm cheating when I'm up at the studio
Come to find out you the hoe, oh
And you was way out
Talkin' 'bout rap, was gonna play ya
And I was wasting my time writing rhyme (hahaha)
You made yourself loud and clear
You wanted me to choose between you and my career (bitch)
Started fucking with this baller named Chris
Couldn't resist the Rolex on his wrist
I kept on writing my raps with profanity
Now I'm on tour fucking bitches like Fanady
You tried to diss this, now you missed this
And the first and fifteenth is like Christmas
Send me naked pictures but give it a rest
With Mrs Ice Cube tatood on your breast
Now you at the back door of my show
Dressed like a hoe, axin' could you blow (no),
Hell no but it's still delicious
Went from rags to riches
And fuck all my X-bitches
[Chorus 2]
Fuck you, fuck you, especially you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours
(repeat)
Now I hear you sayin' ""Yeah I used to fuck 'em""
Not lettin' 'em know I was a young buck then
Niggaz axin' me ""Man, did you love her?""
Loved her stupid ass enough to fuck her with a rubber (bitch)
Now I hear, I'm your big brother (who?)
Second cousin, friend
Bitch since when?
Incest ain't the way I swing (nah)
Never bought your ass a goddamn thing
That I had to pay for
I was hateful
Ungrateful (uh) and never faithful
Fuckin' everything that I could get my paws on
Walkin' through hell with gasoline draws on
Now I'm on the mic, music is my life
Kids and a wife, heard you was a dite (damn)
It's your thing if you like the switches
But it's my world and fuck all my X-bitches

Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy! (Yo!)
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit

Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in tha air, 
If ya don't care.
 
Standin' outside on a Friday livin on tha edge, 
'Cause we all got 'dem hard heads. 
It's seems like we all are waitin', 
For a drive by playin tag wit Satan. 
But we chillin' yeah we ready and willin',

Get tha grip in,

But OG said take ya little ass in tha house. 
My big homey just got out, 
Used tah be down now he's just crack ad. 
He's bout hard as Darth Vada 
In his sweat shirt, khakis and Chuck Taylors. 
Just see him in the drive way, 
Gettin' beat like a smoka fool 'cause it's Friday. 

[Chorus]

Why must I be like dat and chase da cat, 
Or settle for a hoodrat. 
Dookie braids no dreadlocks, 
Flyin in and out of jail have a chicken and a cock. 
And I love her 'cause she down, 
Tah fuck around wit tha underground pussyhound. 
And her ass is big round and wide, 
Jacked up makin' nigga down tah ride. 
Smokin' indo, 
Playin' dat Super Nintendo, 
Hear a rat tat tat on my window. 
Gave her ass dat pelvic thrust, 
Don't trust tha rubber 'cause its bound tah bust. 
In tha oven in tha nappy, 
I had on two so I was happy. 
'Cause dat HIV'll make ya dick hang sideways, 
And dat ain't cool fool 'cause its Friday.

Throw tha west side in da air, 
Throw tha east side in da air, 
Throw tha south side in da air, 
Throw tha north side in da air.

Run swipe up in, baby bulge and do I get em
When it`s on my niggas get sure in em then I send em

Up in the club, haters don`t want nothing with me

Where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimoni

The motherfuckin world is a ghetto
Full of magazines, full clips, and heavy metal
When the smoke settle
I'm just lookin' for a big yellow
In six inch stilletos
Dr. Dre {Hello} perculatin' keep em waitin
While you sittin here hatin, yo' bitch is hyperventilatin'
Hopin' that we penetratin, you gets natin'
Cause I never been to Satan, for hardcore administratin'
Gangbang affiliatin, MC Ren'll have you
Wildin' off a zone and a whole half a gallon
{Get to dialin} 9 1 1 emergency
{And you can tell em} It's my son he's hurtin me
{And he's a felon} On parole for robbery
Ain't no coppin a plea, ain't no stoppin' a G
I'm in the 6 you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
You handle shit sloppily I drop a ki properly
They call me the Don Dada
Pop a collar, drop a dollar if you hear me you can holla
Even rottweilers, follow, the Impala
Wanna talk about this concrete? Nigga I'm a scholar
The incredible, hetero-sexual, credible
Beg a ho, let it go, dick ain't edible
Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit
While you hand picked motherfuckers givin up transcripts

You slapped her ass that's alarmin
Cause she want my Worm like Carmen
We chin check niggas, them thin check niggas
Run trains on golddiggers beware these fo' niggas
Scarin motherfuckers like Steven King flicks
Makin' niggas clear the room like a dyke fleein' dick
Makin 2nd II None shit, nigga like Quik
So when I bomb first nigga who you rollin with?
Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck yo' fine ass bitch
Cause you could lose it in a tussle nigga watch me hustle
Watch niggas kiss my ass without flexin a muscle
Bitches - all in the back they knees waitin to buckle
Same time same channel don't change the dial

Rippin every ""Chronic"" poster on your wall off
Just cause I put away the sawed off
Now I got you sittin back with a smirk
Listenin with your arms crossed
Questionin Dre's credibility {What?}
Wondering if it's still in me to produce hits
Y'all be killin me

And six cars that are paid fo' suck my dick! {Hello}

Sellin tapes out of a trunk to movin this far up

Made a million plus and still don't give a motherfuck
Motherfucker I'm Dre - I don't need your respect
I don't need to make another album bitch I don't gotta do shit

When I'm big I want to be a thug 
You want to be a thug huh (Yeah yeah)
What choo know (About) a thug huh (Yeah yeah)
You want to see the bad guy
Look at Ice Cube (Yeah yeah) that's the bad guy
You need people like him can point cha fingas
Huh? (Yeah yeah) the fuck you know about this shit
You ready to die, OK a-why
Where is that, you ready
'Cause they ain't touch the bad guy, OK

I'm the nigga of the century 
Oh, so choo a bad guy, c'mon prove it 
C'mon, you think you bad
How bad you are 

I'm the nigga of the century 
C'mon lets see how bad you are 
C'mon bad guy, see'moawnl

We the worsest, all purpose 
You want murderers 
Well you serve us, hattin' motherfuckers with curb dust 
You heard us, don't shit make us nervous 
Not even when these fuckin' feds try to serve us 
Mention me, when you write it in your history 
As a nigger with the key to the mystery 
Grand motta ain word don't mean shit to me 
Who gives a fuck what they think, and what they see 
Live how I got to live 
Give what I got to give 
Teach my kids positive, as well as the negative 
Hope to raise better kids 
The world needs a sedative, pray to god that we let him live 

[Chorus:]
'Cause you bad guy, I'm the nigga of the century
The diamond scruff, all you niggas better mention me
Me that's who, it ain't no mystery
Goin' down in history, niggas better mention me

You better mention me, I'm the nigga of the century 
Ok a-why, all you niggas better mention me 
Me that's who, it ain't no mystery 
Goin' down in history, niggas better mention me 

A nigga told me to keep hope alive 
Survive, and 95 I'll get you paradise 
So I tried, nigga had to swallow his pride 
But look into my eyes, I'm too wise to cook fries 
Twelfth grade graduation, summer vacation 
Mama said get the facin' on them applications 
Didn't know back then, I was too young 
Public school made me dumb as a motherfucker 
What should I do in my life 
Reverend price, do you got some advice 
Before I roll the dice 
A nigga don't want to shoot craps, 'cause it ain't all fun and games 
When you tryin' to get that money mang 
Gangbang, maintain or slang cane 
T.V. got a nigga where he can't use his brain 
What the fuck you talkin' bout, choose or loose 
Bitch I don't know the motherfuckin' rules (For real) 

[Chorus]

Who am I when it's do or die 
You can see a man's soul through the human eye 
Can't spend all your lifetime gettin' high 
'Cause you and I got to do, for you and I 
Actin' wild as a juvenile 
Now my whole life depends on the outcome of a trial 
Wait-pow; these people ain't playin' now 
Got to bring 85 percent of the time now 
Fuck that, rather roll with the ruff pack 
In the jet black, listenin' to ruff rap 
See it's quite simple, you bitches ass niggas don't know 
What I've been through, the weather's presidential 
The warfare's mental, I sell my soul to the lord 
For the perfect instrumental 
And the number two pencil 
And all the hustle found in chromosomes of my kinfolk 

[Chorus] 

Yeah, OK, OK, ok, OK, call loko take it easy mang, choo got it
Choo leave it the fuckin' illest nigga to fuckin' shit you
Dess no problem withs that, gawn'na fuck dat
June have a fuckin' heart attack

Choo know dis motherfucker, OK a-why
It's over, that's it, die

Ice Cube,"Please listen to my demo [Repeats: x 8] 

A nigga told me  the record company's the pimp 
The artist is the hoe  The stage is the corner 
And the audience is the trip, god damn 

(verse one) {:21} 
Incredible young nigga  
You can't believe I'm just one nigga 
God damn I've gotten bigger 
Intellect superior  
Walk in a room and make the whole interior inferior 

If you look me in my eyes 
You might fuck around and loose control of your mind body and your soul 
Grab a hold 
Undisputed on the microphone, what you think 
If you wink, I'll make you extinct
Did you blink, did you ever drink your own brain matter 
Shotgun enema, this ain't no cinema 
All praises due to the creator 

For this man here, that can't no nigga stand near 
True, inventor of the 'W'
What You want to do, I got the red and the blue 
Show me one nigga dedicated to raps 
I'll show you ten niggas dedicated to snaps 

Record company death traps settin' decoys 
Just to pimp young b-boys 
With a cup full of yak, studio contact 
Maniac with a contract 

Well turn up the bass and the motherfuckin' treble 
About to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level 
Bullshit points, plus he want to rub it in 
And take all my publishin', god damn 

Do i take it up the rectum 
Just to rock the spectrum 
Give up a right arm, just to do a form 
Hell no, all you motherfuckers goin' leave this bitch limpin'

I'ma keep it simple, it went from ""please listen to my demo"" 
To ""get your ass out my limo"" 
Stretch presidential 
It's essential 'cause the record company will have your ass in a rental 

If you let 'em, You have to behead 'em 
Contracts you never read 'em 
CEO's you never met 'em 
Sent to an attorney, Burnstein and Burney 
Nigga that's his lawyer, ain't got nothin' for ya 

Treat ya like they employer, I'm a warrior 
Bite you in the ass like a Georgetown Hoyas 
When they ignore ya cause, you got to hold your balls 
Catch a motherfucker slippin' in bathroom stalls 

And then you show 'em that you ain't a rookie 
Let 'em know that you'd rather have, more points than more pussy 
Pimp turned bookie 
Now how the fuck I get in so much debt 
God damn, we just met 

He said, welcome to the rap game 
Motherfucker be confused and broke before he know what's happenin' 
You can be the star and fuck women 
I'm a just play the back and keep pimpin' 

No more (no more), record company pimpin' 
No more (no more), record company pimpin' 
No more (no more), record company pimpin'

So, low you can't get under it
So, high you can't get over it
I, can't get over it

Ready or not, here we come
Getting down for the one which we believe in

1993, much more bounce
Ice cube comin' with the half ounce
Not just knee deep, jeep fulla smog
Atomic dog
Like ya behind, heard it through the grapevine
How much longer will you be mine?
And I'ma tell ya, I don't like drama
So do I have to put my handcuffs on your mama
'Cause Bertha Butt did her damn boogie with her crew

But I'd rather boo you
And make you say humdrum, tweedee dum
Humdrum don't succumb when I'm done, buckin' hits
One nation under a groove gettin' down for the funk of it
Tear the roof of this mother like we did last night, son
And hit you with the bop gun

Here's my chance to dance my way
Out of my constriction
Gonna be freakin' up and down
Hang up really late
With the groove I only got
We shall all be moved

Ready or not, here we come
Gettin' down for the one which we believe in
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now

If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys
Playin' with our toys
M-1, 'cuz everybody's gotta have fun
Under the sun, under the sun
So rough, so tough when I get down
The disco fiend with the monster sound
I wants to get funked up when I'm chillin', whoa
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill in

You let her funk me 'cause my funk is the best
Comin' from the west

Kickin' that hits be occupied
Dedicated to the preservation motion of hips
Hittin' them dips, CD skips but I'm straight
As I bounce, rock, skate, now I'll toast to that
If it's rough, make the girls say, ""Do that stuff! aw, do that stuff!""
But ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week
For the top gun, hit you with the bop gun

One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now

Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There ain't nothin' wrong, so hit the bong
Waitin' on the double dutch bus for a ride
As the buffalo go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got daytons on the mothership
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale

'Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin' for the theme from the black hole
May I'll big bang you with my black pole
So, flashlight, red light, we don't like cops on the bike
Just made bail, tonight
So whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna have some fun with the bop gun

Ready or not, here we come
Getting down on the one which we believe in

One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now

If you on the streets nigga then shit bang

On the ass attack, can you keep it tight
And if the head right, nigga there every night

Dip into the 600 
Sagging in my overalls. Blunted 
Thinking of ... 
Quit fronting 
Cause gangsta shit WC running
Head hunting
Steadily pumping. 
I come though punking
Ya'll for ya'll rodies

and pass the 40s
Cause can't none of you bustas hold me

We got the niggas. We got the bitches 
We got the killas. We got the riches 
We got the dealers. We hit the switches 
We got every fucking thing you want 
And we can get it, punk-ass nigga, if you don't
We got the niggas. We got the bitches 
We got the killas We got the ritches

Ooh

.....Hit your bitch 
Nigga ran wit it
Ya'll need to quit it
This shit legendary
Fuck around with us and your mama get buried
Your fist born and that bitch you just married
Who give a fuck bout that baby she just carried
Up in all black like my fucking skin tone
How the fuck you gonna talk a bout the villain? 
You a phone
Biting every time you bust
Who gave all your balls a ...
Weak motherfuckers better say us
So if it ain't rough, it ain't my shit
Might have been....my bitch, it ain't my dick
Hate my click
Bitch mad cause I won't hit
Or a nigga I ain't fucking with
It's the villain
(Chorus)
I want to bang. I want to ride 
I want to slang. From my side
You and I. It's do or die. 
We can roll till the wheels fall off

Ice Cube,"""yeah! (yeah!) 
It's been a long journey getting' to
This motherfuckin' point of this crunk juice shit. (what?!)
But we done got to the last motherfuckin' song niggas
(last shit niggas!) and I got five of the hottest motherfuckin'
Emcees in the world, givin' you that gangsta shit!
It's the motherfuckin' grand finale!

We growin' doja in the basement in that underwater garden (okay)
When hereon in the bank shed, dry it 'til it harden
Make it hash up in the oven (man), put yayo in the hot plate
Drain and dry in the freeser, it's obvious we got weight
I said hard work, that's soft work even with wet work
Built-in clientele so we ain't gotta network (let's go)
We always got work, so we ain't gotta get work
And if you ain't gettin' your work from us you bound to get jerked
We yayo experts, we been whippin' the yola since the crackas decided to
Take the coke from coca-cola
Hold the rollers, the king of the trill
The underground as well, you can step in the ring when you feel
Nigga just sound the bell
Can't sound the heaters in this game, but the grind I'm lovin'
Nigga we passed all that pushin', man it's time for shovin'
I got the mask, I got the strap, soon as I find the gloves
We gonna start exposin' off like farhrenheit 9/11

I'm a speak clearly 'cause I don't think they hearin' me
A nigga only fear's gettin' charged with conspiracy
I'ma get it right to ya, sticky green white to ya
Wear whatever you want, bullets goin' right through ya
If you stressin' to get buried
My niggas'll send you back to the essence in a hurry
Sippin' crunk juice, blowin' dutchies in the chevy
Try to figure me out dawg, I'm light but I'm heavy
Yellow lemonheads in the bessie of the presi'
And yeah, anybody can rock but d-block rock steady (d-block!)
Fed's don't need no warrants 'cause y'all all informants
So I get higher than new york insurance
Try to keep shit clean like florence
Moved on up on the east side 'cause I never lost endurance
And it's all real niggas, if I ever get a license to carry
Shit, that's a license to kill niggas

I refuse to lose, I rather give these weak dudes the blues
And separate them from they jewels, teach 'em don'ts and do's
I raise tools, make crews make decisions confused
All spectators can say is, ""this lil' nigga's a fool""
A short fuse with some loose screws, some unscrewed
Better prove, you niggas pussy as the moulan rouge
So who guardin' who, you know who to you know what
To you know where, goin' 'gainst 'em's too unfair
'cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
Now you know I ain't no ?, I got ten folk there
They ain't powerful as the one at the end of your prayer
Got you runnin' for your life without a minute to spare
Catch you dead to the granite, melt the grease in your hair
When I go, them boys is gonna be indecent affair
Guarantee you nah a real nigga breathin' accounted
At your funeral, just your parents and the preacher was there
Hollow, television name-dropper reachin' for help
So I ain't gotta say a word, pimp you beatin' ya'self
You gon' get what you deserve for disrespectin' the game
Any nigga with the nerve to say another man name
When that other man ain't even present
And deny it when somebody ask him about it
That nigga's a lame, you like to lie on the mic
Hide behind fame, I was a g when I came
That's the way I remain

Who besides the egyptian-walker, fuckers have a conniption
My existence persistent to bring foes misfortune
I dassle 'em, like the alderman, billy dee in mahogany, minus the perm
From the tiniest sperm that the mightiest the almighty can muster
Project prophet, chronic blockage gives alzheimer's to youngsters
Amongst them is me, can't remembers my beefs
With who? for what? they screw-face me up, my boo laced me up
Bolinsiaga, flimsy condo with bimbos in south of kalan gro in pimp mode
The inf' glow on his clothes and you know it's over
Hammer hit pin, pin hit shell, from the shell the slug gonna chew ya
Try not to lose me, I try not to lose'ya
Mama say mama sa mu makasa, fly to cuba
To chill with some politi-kill niggas who ill
'cause y'all niggas are losers, don't get comfortable nigga
Say hello to mr. bad guy, get that cash par, I'm the last don
You'll ever know so, here you go y'all can take these thoughts
Anyway I'm chargin' emcees a late fee cost
So when y'all done with my style, please break me off
But never make nas mad just in case cross
'cause ah, lately y'all don't make me happy
To calm my nerve I need the herb gnc don't carry

Who the fuck is that? it's ice cube motherfucka'
He's a maniac, no I'm a fool motherfucka'
Old school motherfucka', blow through a motherfucka'
What you heard about a nigga so true motherfucka'
See I'm ugly and prettay, I'm polished and grittay
Shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50
See, niggas get shittay when I come to their cittay
When I hit the spot that bitch they like, she cummin' with me
Cause I got an ego big as to, but I'm not an eagle
Bitch, I roll with rigo 'cause gangstas don't dance we boogie
I told you motherfuckas kobe didn't take that pussy
Get money, get paid, you can beat that shit
Even if the da is a piece'a shit
Colorado got movatos, don't eat that shit
Another white bitch lyin' on thee black dick
I keep it flippin' like flapjacks, pimpin' like black 'lacs
Give niggas flashbacks, they sweaty as ass cracks
When I hit the tar mat, it feel like a carjack
Niggas get out and vanish like star treks
So fuckin' incredible, I'm so fuckin' credible
No matter what happen, I'll never turn federal
And that's my report comin' straight from cali

Fade the grade, played, and made a few mil 
And I keep stealin 
Ice Cube'll make it funky 
But right about now - let's get up in the hump
But I don't party and shake my butt 
I leave that to the brothers with the funny haircuts 
And it'll drive you nuts 
Steal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch 
Like jackin' at night 
Say hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin' 
And it sounds so sweet 
Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin' for beats 

Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it 
Locate a dope break, and then I break it 
And give it that gangsta lean 
Dead in your face as I turn up the bass 
I make punk suckers run and duck because 
I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to 
Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm Audi 
So when I come to your town don't crowd me 
Cause I know, you're gonna want to kick it with me 
But I know, none of y'all can get with me 
So you think you're protected 
Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record 
Then I have to show and prove and use your groove 
Cause suckers can't fade the Cube 
And if I jack you and you keep comin' 
I'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!

Got to put the nigga back in my Cadillac
Take him to the hood, where it's action packed
Let him know that the target's still on his back

When they get you in them lonely dark places

Where niggas like us get used like a mule
Don't let 'em catch you, arrest you
Strip and undress you, throw you in a cesspool
You wanna know the crime of the century
A ghetto elementary, a mental penitentiary
Black man, you never been friend of me
Boy you kin to me, why we enemies?
The ghetto is a trap
Fuck where you from, nigga look where you at
Where you wanna be? Point it out on a map
Don't be scared to leave homey, we can come back
If you wanna come back to this bullshit
Most of it comin' straight out the pulpit
We got to change our ways in the hood
Understand that it's AIDS in the hood

Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin 'em up
Some powder cake shit that's about to erupt

You and your family can have peace and tranquility.
Enjoy the refinement..""
""Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?""
""Hello, my name is Elaine --
and I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles""
[Ice Cube]
How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove comparment
cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
but if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
and don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
on stayin alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive
""Hi this is Elaine again.
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles,
or is somebody taking your things? Have you witneesed a driveby?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
to witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police,
so you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again.""
""This is Los Angeles."" ""This is Los Angeles.""
[Ice Cube]
Rule number two: don't trust nobody
especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
cause it ain't nuttin but a trap
And females'll get jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
cause most niggaz get got
in either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed-off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight
cause if so that's a monkey-wrench hoe
and you won't survive in South Central
""Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be.
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV.
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
punk motherfucker!""
And you need your ass straight smoked
Yo I want to say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill
Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God damnit!
[Ice Cube]
Rule number three: don't get caught up
Cause niggaz are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a vice
on everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
We discern
cause South Central L.A., is one big yearn
Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
and start slangin ki's
to an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
they live behind bars
So everybody's doin a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
as you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central
Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass,
you tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out.
And for you so called baller-ass niggaz,
you know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke.
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers.
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit.
You'll sho' get got, just like that.
This ain't no joke motherfuckers.
Now I want to send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer,
puttin his two cents in..

Mack & Cube: Yay-why-yay! [Repeat: x2]

[Ice Cube]
While y'all n****s think about the papÂ¨Â¦
I think about which Titanic I`mma sink
The iceberg, with the nice words
I slice verbs and predicets, ghetto etiquette

Y`all better get, this dime-mega s***
The Braniac, the theory be conspiracy
Keep my eye on the birdie, but never get my hands dirty
Verbally call the Maniac and his attack dogs
Signing contracts with automatic jack clause

[Mack 10]
I get full of their s*** and take flight on these n****s
`Bout to show these so-called
Wig-splitters and nigg-hitters
Who the man be, and what the number one clique is

Let my nuts hang on these busts
And hoes see how big my dick is
Maniac Mack 10 always keep the heat toted
And teflon tips keep the .44 loaded 

Straight quoted in nine-trey, by the dime
Now we connected
He said, ""Mack, when you westsidin` and ridin` is expected""
So I...

Got torture techniques for them lies, don`t ever lie

Determined as the Energized Bunny, make a left

Underground parking, guns start sparkin`
ATF enemies all around start chargin`
Tryin` to f*** up my new suit and my weekend
Ask me what you want, you b****! I ain`t speakin`

S***, I gives a f*** what the next n**** think
(?) gives a f*** how much b**** you say you ain`t
It`s like this on mine, potna
By all means, I got the ball

So it`s your life, not mine n****, so you make the call
Now, I can blow your brains out, punk and act the f***in` fool
Or you can hand your guns over, and let everything be cool
But know this: I won`t hesitate to peel your wig back

I`m off that wet-bomb and the whole fifty yak
It`s Mack the Maniac, n****

Everything bought out, like Bill Gates

I act kind to my peers and everybody that listen
They know when the Brainiac`s missin`
The big fish, hanging with the chicken hawk
Got all the haters, claimin` that they want to talk

[Mack 10]
You argue wit `em and negotiate, and I really want to kill `em
I`m tired of the bulls***, man I really want to peel `em
Dog, I knew they were scareless
`Cause my brother Snoop told us

So f*** the money and the dope that they punk-a** owe us
Now when I see `em, it ain`t no question it`s all the way on
But I`m a wait in front of they momma house
For that one n**** to get home

And when I gun, watch his body jump
And it`s all going to amaze me
To see his own self
Layin` there with his own brains on the pavement

Ice Cube,"There are seven known wonders of the world
You about to witness the eighth, muthafucka

I got King Kong in my trunk, King Kong in my doors
My nuts play ping-pong from the noise
You can hear me from a block away
I'm sittin' next to your ass
And can't hear what you got to say

My shit is loud, my ears is ringin'
My paint job is wet, my chrome is gleamin'
I feel like a vet ballin' on these rookies
An old-school bully, you must have played hooky

I bring it like a bookie, my aggression is depressin'
Don't give a muthafucka time to learn his lesson
A lunatic, y'all know what I represent
The only rapper that wanna fist fight the president

It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back

When I bang this, it's dangerous, nigga's go brainless
So bang this with the four five stainless
And understand that you lookin' at the famous
West-coast rapper who act like a anus

Hollywood, they thought they could tame this
Pit-bull, but I know what the game is
Them fuckers cheat like an NBA ref
If you smoke one, they'll electrocute you to death

I got God on my intellect, Godzilla by the neck
When the nigga come through, who you wanna holler at?
Ghostwriters hit the deck, when ya boi got a tech
Where the fuck is Africa Bambaataa at?

We need to take it back, fuck Viacom
Clear Clear Channel and Radio One
You muthafuckas programmed by the programmers
That's why you gettin' locked up by the dope slammers
Not me

It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back

They music so fluffy, I'm a stay gutter
That shit is kinda popcorn, my shit is so butter
My style never change in twenty two summers
Straight independent and doin' my numbers

This shit don't sell, you know I'm still paid
So sour-puss nigga's can drink lemonade
I'm doin' it for the love, you doin' it because
You need that advancement to spend on them dubs

I don't need a penny but I need many
Don't worry 'bout my money boy, 'cause I got plenty
You muthafucka's worry 'bout flossin' so much
You don't know the fundamentals
You forgot how to brush

These thirty two teeth will give your ass grief
Bite you like a fat burger if you got beef
So whose it gonna be, your favorite MC?
You're scared of the government
They scared of me, now what?

It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas and streets of crack

So young, so angry
Damn that rap music
",It Takes a Nation [Instrumental],2008
Ice Cube,"[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
And I was told in school I was a fool and money, I'd never gain none
But I used my flow as a tool, they was cruel
Said I'd be no rapper, but I did work and became one
Now it's a cryin' shame, I'm buyin' things and they got debts they got to pay back
I think I know why my teachers would look in my eye and say that
And whys that?

[Chorus: Big Krizz Kaliko]
Cause I'm a Blackboy
Came from nothing, don't mean my life means nothin'
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin'
Yall don't think I see them purses yall clutchin? (I do)
See I'm a Blackboy
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little white-boys want to be me
But you don't want to go through What I go through
True definition of a Blackboy

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
It must be the way that my pants sag
Or the sparklin' diamonds on the watch my left hand has
I know my appearance is looking like I am bad
In your department store all I wanna do is pop a damn tag
Made it honest, that's why the blacks get mad at you
Even foreigners shop and got big gratitude
I make more than you, but you got the attitude
Like I can't be shoppin' at Saks Fifth Avenue
I'm just tryin' to buy my baby some creed spring flower
But they don't know that the Tecca Nina cheese means power
So they look at me like none of my breed brings valor
Thats why when you see us in passing we seem sour
Last time I checked, my power shockeras
I was on top of the indy charts and not a slotera
But I'm the author of darkness and I like the opera
So why when I'm at Macbeth they wont treat me more propera?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Brother J]
Frontline, shoot, soldiers represent that
Frontline, shoot, Grand Verb, it's the snatch back
Head wrapped in the desert, boombox on the camel back
Escape from the clone lab, fugitives spook black
With finesse in you, its the knowledge from way back
The prophet of the page don't eat right till it all cracks
Blackboy rappin' from the pages torn
Street scriptures more classic than the Jimmy Cracked Corn
A spawn of the movement, keep the music movement
So my purpose stays clear and my music stays groovin'
I do it for the real, I don't need Jena Six
For me to know America is still on that bullshit
So people think that black are just ball players and singers
That massa complex is what fuels the street bangers
And street soldiers to stand up
No choice to get it right, so these Blackboys can finally get they man up

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Ice Cube]
I'm a Blackboy and always gettin' underestimated
But when I move next door, I know you hate it
You had my whole family investigated
And when they didn't find no crack, you said I ate it
Uh-uh, a motherfucker just elevated
Over ghetto life that was designated
You see this Blackboy, you know heaven made it
I don't want to go if I got to integrate it
You know pellot boy, be happy you made it
Just take what you got, and stop complainin'
OK, weather man will stop the rainin'
On my people head, and start explainin'
What your people said, believe in the bible
But you still act barbaric and psycho
My name is Ice Cube, bitch, it ain't Michael
I'll never bleach my own skin just to be like you

Ice Cube,"California ain't a state it's a army!

One fuckin' nigga in the projects killin'
The same motherfucker that would burn down the village
Where the niggas blunt full of that
You know, who gone take you back to Compton In that 64 two door
Sub woofers in the trunk kickin' that lethal injection
A hood nigga lost with no direction
So he bought a Black Smith and Wesson
Strapped on his vest and that's his protection
At the intersection waitin' on the robber
Cause in the city of Angels it's all about survival,
Motherfuck the 5-0, They wanna see you DOA, welcome to L.A.
Where the ghetto birds flyin' over my auntie's and my cousin's house
Tell me what they buzzin' bout
The little homie got smoked on the corner
And now his momma cryin', dead in California

Motherfuckers ain't gone learn,
Till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nuthin' but the ghetto bird light shinin'
Through the fuckin' palm trees,
California ain't a state it's a army

Motherfuckers ain't gone learn,
Till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nuthin' but the ghetto bird light shinin'
Through the fuckin' palm trees,
California ain't a state it's a army

Jumped in my impala took a trip to the swap meat,
The scoop bought EGO trippin' and some white T's
Cause some niggas in my old hood don't like me
Time to put the niggas on check, like my Nike's
Shoulda heard my my nigga Mack 10 on the chirp
All I need is me and my bitch,
If you scared go to church,
Cause in California niggas crack heads for the turf
And life ain't nothin' but Teck-9's and dirt
Dippin' through the the jungles, my Escalade hit a dip
Here come the gorillas in the mist
And they dressed like Ice Cube was in 96
Stone cold jerry curl and not one drip
I sleep with the worms before I swim with the fish
And I ride with my niggas before I roll with a bitch
If it don't make dollars it don't make sense
And I almost got shot because I hit a fence

Motherfuckers ain't gone learn,
Till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nuthin' but the ghetto bird light shinin'
Through the fuckin' palm trees,
California ain't a state it's a army

Motherfuckers ain't gone learn,
Till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nuthin' but the ghetto bird light shinin'
Through the fuckin' palm trees,
California ain't a state it's a army

Call the U.S. government and tell em it's a mutherfuckin' code red,
Niggas tried to straight up jack me and now they both dead
Third little nigga got away on his mo-ped
Caught him 'round the corner put the beam on his forehead
Jumped in the impala then smashed through the light
Without a one time in sight,
So I bust a right on Century headed to the L.A.X.
Where there ain't nothin' but fly bitches and checks
In and out of lanes and I almost wrecked
Off Brand a nigga in the 600 throwin up his set
He must don't know I got the 40 on deck
And the teck tryin' be Shot but it ain't time to flex
It's the third this shit happened to me all day
Guess it's time to add another dead body to the throw away
So I turned down my Spice 1 tape and hit the switch
Emptied the whole clip in his fuckin' face

Motherfuckers ain't gone learn,
Till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nuthin' but the ghetto bird light shinin'
Through the fuckin' palm trees,
California ain't a state it's a army

Motherfuckers ain't gone learn,
Till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nuthin' but the ghetto bird light shinin'

Mack 10 nutty as they come 
leave 'em face down
and numb from the waist down
It's a Sunday a gun day
rollin' down a one way
in my 'lac front and back
over train tracks
On yak and herb nigga swerve
it get's on my nerves
banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane
I'm butta man
Foot to the flo'
what you want from the sto'
I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
but niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'ma vet you can bet
that I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
everybody run when I bust a cap
puttin' Inglewood up on the map
look at what I do when I pull my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown
bitch hit the silent alarm it's goin' down

Verse 2

Khacki suit ski mask is my attire
with my luck cut my chucks on the barbed wire
Fool where ya keep the rims and tires
'fo yo' life expires I'm as nutty as Michael Myers
Didn't think about the Rottweiler
a lot of stiches in the ass
blood in the Impala
Sittin' in the County with a gold record
Ice Cube send me pictures of bitches naked
caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand
your Honor I'ma changed man
so please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go
and if he say no I'ma have to say
bitch get out the car slow
and leave ya fuckin' dough
'cause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world
let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

Verse 3

Call 911 there's a son of a bitch on the roof
yarned up in his birthday suit
(Mack 10 to the rescue)
my momma want to know why I do what I do
'cause I'm superman superbad supermad superfly
fool you can die
There's gonna be a lot of cars with they lights on
and I'm at home sewing stripes on
Cause I'm the General and you's a stowaway
'bout to buck you down with this throw away
with no serial number it's the summer
where niggas die
It's hotter than July

plus wings and a gown when I come around

How you get through it and them other niggas blew it""

Fuck with Cube, I'm better than YouTube
Fuck with them dudes them niggas is new school

The rhymes don't change just the fuckin' rhyme-sayers
They make it up as they go along
But I'm goin' on 25 years strong

Or change your whole life, in a major way
The shit they say, might catch you a case
The shit I say, feel like your birthday

Straight hell on earth, but come up out the abyss

Fuck the new dance I'ma learn how to eat

They keep callin' me
They keep callin', all the lil' homies keep fallin'

Get you in the system, get you in the soil

See New Orleans get bitch-slapped by FEMA

Free the Jena Six (Nigga free the Jena six!)

They want us to quit, forget

All I'm wearin' is dickies
Don't try to evict me
When we come to Atlanta we gon' re-open Nickies

I'm a gangsta rap teacher, nigga you better know it
It's the Don Gotti Jr. slash motherfuckin' poet
Sit back and take notes while I spin like hundred spokes
My flow is razor sharp I'm comin' straight for ya throat
With that west coast gang bang
Watch him when his chain hang
East coast down south
Niggaz do the same thang
Throw up ya dubs like Wu-Tang who bang
Harder than that nigga barrelin' thru ya hood wit two chains
Swangin' like he's nuts, 'cuz he don't give a fuck
I know nigga that ain't bangin' in no khaki's or some chucks
It's that westside, connected with that nigga who flow so wreckless
He spent a hundred thousand on his necklace, I bet this
Motherfuckin' coast ain't got shit after me
Ain't have shit before Cube except a Dub C
The mack circle is back with mad purple in fact
I'm 'bout to join the Lynch mob that's me squirtin' the mack",Get Use to It,2008
