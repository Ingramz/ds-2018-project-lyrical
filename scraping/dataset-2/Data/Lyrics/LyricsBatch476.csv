John Arpin,"Our love affair is a wondrous thing
That we'll rejoice in remembering
Our love was born with our first embrace
And a page was torn out of time and space
Our love affair, may it always be
A flame to burn through eternity
So, take my hand with a fervent prayer
That we may live and we may share
A love affair to remember
 
Our love affair is a wondrous thing
That we'll rejoice in remembering
Our love was born with our first embrace
And a page was torn out of time and space
Our love affair, may it always be
A flame to burn through eternity
So, take my hand with a fervent prayer
That we may live and we may share",An Affair to Remember,1995
John Arpin,"I hear a bird, Londonderry bird,
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Then tell me please

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay
How are things in Glocca Morra this fine day?",How Are Things in Glocca Morra? [From Finian's Rainbow],1995
John Arpin,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you",Moonglow [From Picnic],1995
John Arpin,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song [From Knickerbocker Holiday],1995
John Arpin,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,1995
John Arpin,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things [From Tokyo Rose],1995
John Arpin,"Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1995
John Arpin,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You [From Girl Crazy],1995
John Arpin,"Paradise can not refuse us
Never such a happy pair

Everybody must excuse us
If we walk on air

All the shadows now will lose us
Lucky stars are everywhere

As a happy being
Here's what I'm foreseeing

For you, for me, forever more
It's bound to be forever more

It's plain to see
We found, by finding each other
The love we waited for

I'm yours, you're mine
And in our hearts
The happy ending starts

What a lovely world
This world will be
With a world of love in store
For you, for me, forever more.

What a lovely world
This world will be
With a world of love in store
For you, for me, forever more.","For You, For Me, For Evermore [From the Shocking Miss Pilgrim)",1995
John Arpin,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine [From Jubilee],1995
John Arpin,"Good night sweetheart, till we meet tomorrow 
Good night sweetheart, sleep will banish sorrow
Tears and parting may make us forlorn
But with the dawn, a new day is born (so I'll say) 
Good night sweetheart, tho' I'm not beside you
Good night sweetheart, still my love will guide you
Dreams enfold you, in each one I'll hold you
Good night sweetheart, good night
 
Good night sweetheart, till we meet tomorrow 
Good night sweetheart, sleep will banish sorrow
Tears and parting may make us forlorn
But with the dawn, a new day is born

Good night sweetheart, good night",Goodnight Sweetheart,1995
John Arpin,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Say, it's only a paper moon

How happy I would be
If you believed in me",It's Only a Paper Moon [From Take A Chance],1995
John Arpin,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me [From Tip Toes],1995
John Arpin,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995
John Arpin,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

John Arpin,"I came from ole Virginy from the county Acomac
I have no wealth to speak of 'cept de clothes upon my back
I can do the country hoe-down I can buck and wing to show down
And while I'm in the notion, just step back and watch my motion

Oh go 'way man, I can hypnotize dis nation
I can shake the earth's foundation wit' the Maple Leaf Rag
Oh go 'way man, just hold you breath a minute
For there's not a stunt that's in it with the Maple Leaf Rag

I dropped into the swellest ball, the great exclusive it
But my face was dead agin me and my trousers didn't fit
But when Maple Leaf was started, my timidity departed
I lost my trepidation, you could taste the admiration

Oh go 'way man, I can hypnotize this nation
I can shake the earth's foundation wit' the Maple Leaf Rag
Oh go 'way man, just hold you breath a minute
For there's not a stunt that's in it with the Maple Leaf Rag

The men were struck wit' jealousy, the razors 'gan to flash
But de ladies gathered 'round me for I'd surely made a mash
The finest belle, she sent a boy to call a coach and four
We rode around a season 'till we both were lost to reason

Oh go 'way man, I can hypnotize this nation

John Arpin,"Moonlight, becomes you, it goes with your hair
You certainly know the right thing to wear
Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind, if I tag along?

If I say, I love you, I want you to know

John Arpin,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

John Arpin,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1997
John Arpin,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1997
John Arpin,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?

Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,

John Arpin,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you

John Arpin,"No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart, of my heart

John Arpin,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring [From State Fair],1998
John Arpin,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile [Love Theme from the Sandpiper],1998
John Arpin,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet

John Arpin,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

Deeper than the deep blue see is

Was the most I bargained for

Let me tell you both a tale of love and hope. 
It's a story that you may have heard before, told as mythical lore. 
But this translation is clear, unlike the embellishments that have reached your ears. 
There was a boy who shared your bones, your eager blood, your affinity for love. 
He had it all in his hands, and he watched it all turn to sand.

If this boy they speak of sincerely sits atop my family tree, 
Then I was truly meant to leave the Dark, 
Down this path set out in front of me. 
I will reunite this world's divided halves. 
Fulfill my history. 
This is more than divine decree, it's my destiny.

Digging 'round the deep, only missing out on sleep. 
Chasing 'bout my head like the wolf that found the sheep. 
Don't go digging 'round there, you be slipping bit too much.
Milling muck and mud with the mind that lost its touch. 
I been traveling 'bout in time, never stepping out for much. 
Deepest of the deep with the wolf that lost those sheep. 
Because it's more than a little but less than a bunch, 
Found their way around with the blind that lost its touch.

The choices he made that day to burn down the world he'd helped create. 
Don't be scared, kid. 
You're gifted. 
Follow this stream, and live out that prophecy. 
Watch out for the wicked ones who call themselves beloved ones. 
Beware of the medicine before you lay your head again. 
Watch out for the wicked ones who call themselves beloved ones.

So they arrived at the doctor's camp, his crude shack. 
A shanty with walls of broken glass, 
Light leaking through the shattered cracks. 
And through he was cordial, the young couple was doubtful.

If this boy they speak of sincerely sits atop my family tree, 
I was truly meant to leave the dark down this path set out in front of me.

For the longshoremen had warned them to keep a close eye on their adored ones. 
But they had journeyed for a reason, they were here for the medicine. 
To cure the infection. But nothing could prepare him for the events that would ensnare them. 
All he could do is trust what he knew. He would listen to his gut and live for his love.",Holy the Sea,2008

Love, love changes everything,
Days are longer, words mean more
Love, love changes everything,
Pain is deeper, than before
Love, will turn your world around,
And that world will last forever
Yes, love, love changes everything,
Brings you glory, brings you shame
Nothing in the world will ever be the same

Off into the world we go,
Planning futures, shaping years
Love bursts in and suddenly,
All our wisdom disappears
Love, makes fools of everyone,
All the rules we make are broken
Yes, love, love changes everyone,
live or perish, in its flame
Love will never, never let you be the same
Love will never, never let you be the same",Love Changes Everything [From Aspects of Love],1996
John Barrowman,"No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Say the word and I will follow you.

You'll guard me and you'll guide me

A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man

Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom 
When the jungle shadows fall 
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock 
As it stands against the wall 
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops 
When the summer shower is through 
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you 
Night and day, you are the one 
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun 
Whether near to me, or far 
It's no matter darling where you are 
I think of you 
Day and night, night and day, why is it so 
That this longing for you follows wherever I go 
In the roaring traffic's boom 
In the silence of my lonely room 
I think of you 
Day and night, night and day 
Under the hide of me 
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me 
And this torment won't be through 
Until you let me spend my life making love to you

Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore

All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself
Anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love's so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore",All by Myself,2007

Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too but what else can we do

It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from this long lonely nights

Does the feeling seem oh so right

And said that I can't hold on

John Barrowman,"Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve
As I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

John Barrowman,"She can kill with a smile
She can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But she’s always a woman to me

She can lead you to love
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But she’ll never believe you
And she’ll take what you give her, as long as it’s free
Yeah, she steals like a thief
But she’s always a woman to me

Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She’s ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind

And she’ll promise you more
Than the Garden of Eden
Then she’ll carelessly cut you
And laugh while you’re bleedin’
But she’ll bring out the best
And the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself
Cause she’s always a woman to me

Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She’s ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind

She is frequently kind
And she’s suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases
She’s nobody’s fool
But she can’t be convicted
She’s earned her degree
And the most she will do
Is throw shadows at you
But she’s always a woman to me",She's Always a Woman,2007

Keep it turned on

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star

They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more?

He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola,

Then he strikes like Thunderball

We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,

But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
It doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I brought some corn for popping;
The lights are turned way down low,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

How I'll hate going out in the storm;
But if you really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm.

She had a dream about the King of Sweden,
He gave her things that she was needin',
He gave her a home built of gold and steel,
a diamond car with the platinum wheel.

He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses,
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses,
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes,
She sat around and counted them all a million times.

Above earth's lamentations,
I hear the real, though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation.

Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear it's music ringing,
It sounds an echo in my soul.
How can I keep from singing?

While though the tempest loudly roars,
I hear the truth, it liveth.
And though the darkness 'round me close,
Songs in the night it giveth.

No storm can shake my inmost calm,
While to that rock I'm clinging.
Since love is lord of heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing? 
When tyrants tremble in their fear
And hear their death knell ringing,
When friends rejoice both far and near
How can I keep from singing?

In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging,
When friends by shame are undefiled
How can I keep from singing?

And I know when love is true
It's always with you

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Much wiser since my goodbye to you

I must return

But, oh, you haunted me so
Still, my tongue tied young bride
Would not let my love for you show

My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire

Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

[Chorus]

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.

And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by, dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head, until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars, they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see little people turn their heads and look away
Just like a newborn baby, it happens everyday

I look inside myself, see my heart is black
I see my red door and I see it's painted black
I see little girls walk by, dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head, until my darkness goes

No more little my green sea, go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee, this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me, before the morning comes

I see it painted black, I see it painted black
I see it painted, painted, it's all painted black

John Bayless,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

And she's gone.

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,

I'm more then just a little
More then just a little in love
I'm more than just a little
More then just a little in love

I carved your name on the sycamore in my front yard
I got your picture taped to the dash of my car
You can say that my behavior's adolescent at best
But this ain't no school boy crush girl

I'm more then just a little
More then just a little in love
I'm more than just a little
More then just a little in love

More and more I'm less and less
Inclined to hold my feeling's back
And I've got love that's in excess
Of anything your heart could (ever)ask

It would be an understatement to say
I'm obsessed
Since I live and breathe for your touch

More then just a little in love
I'm more than just a little
More then just a little in love",More Than Just a Little,1993

Someone who'll squeeze me and hold me tight
Someone who'll love me all through my life

If it's only more tears

If you'll open up
Then I can see
Deep in your heart
What's in it for me

Well,I have to admit
I'm glad that you're here
But I can't make the past
Just disappear
If you're back for good
I want you to be

And all is forgiven now
And a long and silent last embrace
Shows our respect somehow
But it's ok to cry a little

When love dies in your arms

You were once my deepest pain
But you were once my friend
And a part of me was holding on
Till I saw you again
I couldn't bear to see it end
With rage and jealousy
A feeling once so beautiful
Should die with dignity

You're still the only one
You're looking just as lovely
As the day our love was born
Remember when you told me
I could make it on my own
Without you here to hold me
I'm afraid I'm not that strong

Happy ever after's not so easy to acquire
Only you could ever measure up to my desire
Baby you gave up on me just a little bit too soon
And left me here for lonely, howling at the moon

All I need is one more chance to prove my love for you
I tried my best to live without you
You hold the power in your hands
You and only you can make these broken dreams come true

I'm asking your forgiveness
I know I'm the one to blame
I've finally learned my lesson

Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road,1994

Everybody falls in love somehow

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, the night when Christ was born

O night, O holy night, O night divine
O night, O holy night, O night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming
Now come the wise men from out of the Orient land

The King of kings lay thus lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friends
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger

Behold your King, before him, lowly bend
Behold your King, before him, lowly bend

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all our hearts we praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord, then ever, ever praise we

His power and glory ever more proclaim
His power and glory ever more proclaim

And they stayed in love

Like they're made out of glass

In love that can last
I will if you will

Once in every life
Someone comes along
Like you've come along

And it would be so nice
If this happiness
Could go on and on

But in this modern world, troubles come by
People let go the first tear they cry
Someone has to be strong
To keep love alive, I will if you will

People let go the first tear they cry

Let's do it or die

Thinking just how powerful the love we made could be
And I can't help believing it's all still possible
But if coming to our senses is gonna take a miracle

John Betjeman,"It's awfully bad luck on Diana
Her ponies have swallowed their bits
She fished down their throats with a spanner
And frightened them all into fits

So now she's attempting to borrow
Do lend her some bits Mummy do
I'll lend her my own for tomorrow
But today I'll be wanting them too

Just look at Prunella on Guzzle
The wizardest pony on earth
Why doesn't she slacken his muzzle
And tighten the breech in his girth

I say Mummy there's Mrs. Geyser
And doesn't she look pretty sick
I bet it's because Mona Lisa
Was hit on the hock with a brick

Miss Blewitt says Monica threw it
But Monica says it was Joan
And Joan's very thick with Miss Blewitt
So Monica's sulking alone

And Margaret failed in her paces
Her withers got tied in a noose
So her coronets caught in the traces
And now all her fetlocks are loose

Oh it's me now I'm terribly nervous
I wonder if Smudges will shy
She's practically certain to swerve us
Her Pelham is over one eye

Oh wasn't it naughty of Smudges
Oh Mummy I'm sick with disgust
She threw me in front of the judges
And my silly old collarbone's bust",Hunter Trials,2004
John Billing,"ThereÂ´s some things I donÂ´t have now
Some things I donÂ´t talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
DonÂ´t answer the question of what I am to you",The Birds,2007

Oh ! Sunny, ce matin encore c'était l'hiver
Sunny, depuis que tu es là le ciel est plus clair
Il y a du soleil dans les rues sur les toits
Le printemps est là avec toi
Et je t'aime toujours, mon amour",Sunny,2007
John Bucchino,"Honey come here
I have something to tell you
It won't make things perfect
And it may not make sense
But someday you'll see it as clear as my smile
Do you know the word temporary ?
It means only for a little while 

And everything is temporary
A friend moves, a tooth aches
A pet dies, a toy breaks
The detours a life takes
Temporary

Everything is temporary
A storm clears, a tear dries
A wing heals, a brid flies
The trust lighting in your eyes
Temporary

I know you want things to stay the same
I know it's hard to watch a childhood
Going up in smoke
It's hard for me to watch a child
Who's growing up
And choke back all the warnings
I could scream
To protect you from the things
That aren't as solid as they seem
But then, I'm only temporary

Everything is temporary
A child leaves, a heart breaks
A love dies, a world shakes
The difference one life makes
Temporary

The trick is:
Hold it now as tightly as you can
Whether it's your favorite toy
Or a sad little boy who's trying hard
To be a brave little man
Hold it tighter 'cause you know
You'll have to let it go

If you learn this, though
You won't feel so sad:
A playmete, a tearstain
A Christmas, a dad
The best times
The worst pain
All temporary
",Temporary,2000
John Bucchino,"If I ever say I'm over you
The unsentimental things I do
Will have driven out the ghosts,
Somehow,
And pulled me through

If I tend to disregard your touch
Well, it seems to me it would be
Such a waste of time to let this poor heart
Feel that much

But sometimes a photograph
Can make me cry or force a laugh
And somehow the memory
Of how complete we used to be
Is keeping me from you

If you ever hear me doubt the past
It's a simple fact; we didn't last
Run aground on hard times
While the good times flew too fast

I'm not sure if we can make amends
This may be the way out story ends
With too little left for lovers
And too much for friends

But sometimes a photograph
Can make me cry or force a luagh
And somehow the memory
Of how complete we used to be
Is keeping me from you
So don't believe it's true
If I ever say I'm over you


",If I Ever Say I'm over You,2001
John Bucchino,"I thought I did what's right
I thought I had the answers
I thought I chose the surest road
But that road brought me here

So I put up a fight
And told you how to help me
Now just when I have given up
The truth is coming clear

You know better than I
You know the way
I've let go the need to know why
For you know better than I

If this has been a test
I cannot see the reason
But maybe knowing I don't know
Is part of getting through

I try to do what's best
And faith has made it easy
To see the best thing I can do
Is put my trust in you

You know better than I
You know the way
I've let go the need to know why
For you know better than I

I saw one cloud and thought it was a sky
I saw a bird and thought that I could follow
But it was you who taught that bird to fly
If I let you reach me will you teach me

For You know better than I
You know the way
I've let go the need to know why
I'll take what answers you supply
You know better than I",Better Than I,2014
John Bucchino,"I've got a roof over my head
I've got a warm place to sleep
Some nights I lie awake counting gifts
Instead of counting sheep

I've got a heart that can hold love
I've got a mind that can think
There may be times when I lose the light
And let my spirits sink
But I can't stay depressed
When I remeber how I'm blessed

Grateful, grateful
Truly grateful I am
Grateful, grateful
Truly blessed
And duly grateful

In a city of strangers
I've got a family of friends
No matter what rocks and brambles fill the way
I know that they will stay until the end

I feel a hand holding my hand
It's not a hand you can see
But on the road to the promised land
This hand will shepherd me
Through delight and despair
Holding tight and always there

Grateful, grateful
Truly grateful I am
Grateful, grateful
Truly blessed
And duly grateful

It's not that I don't want a lot
Or hope for more, or dream of more
But giving thanks for what I've got
Makes me so much happier than keeping score

In a world that can bring pain
I will still take each chance
For I believe that whatever the terrain
Our feet can learn to dance
Whatever stone life may sling
We can moan or we can sing

Grateful, grateful
Truly grateful I am
Grateful, grateful
Truly blessed
And duly grateful 
",Grateful,2014
John Bucchino,"I hear your key in the door
Unlocking more than wood
The ceiling may not be dry yet
But it feels like home

Yes, we have come from a long way
Friends say wrong way
Still, I only know when you hold me
It feels like home

We don't need a dining room table
So far there's no one to invite
For me a cardboard box will do just fine
As long as I'm with you each night

It seems to me if you never ask
You'll never win
And since we're in this together
It feels like home

We don't need a dining room table

",It Feels Like Home,2014
John Bucchino,"He left a man in New York City
She broke a home in New Orleans
They made their way to California
Sweet dreams, children, sweet dreams

They hit it off in a Greyhound station
When she kicked the cigarette machine
And woke him up hard from his nap beside it
Woke him up hard from his sweet dreams

He talked about his suggar daddies
She talked about her mean Marine
The settled down in seats adjoining
Sharing sweet dreams, sweet dreams

Well there's no man to sell your heart to
When you're dancin' across the TV screens
No husband to beat you when you're in the movies
Just sweet dreams, children, sweet dreams

Run away to another skin
A tough one, a pretty one
That won't let the badness in

Now he's keepin' house for a big producer
Who pays for the classes and the limousines
And she's in a bar, passed out on whiskey
Dreaming sweet dreams, still dreaming sweet dreams

Run away to another skin
A tough one, a pretty one
That won't let the sadness in
Won't let the madness in

There is a sidewalk in California
Where they put the stars right at your feet
And people delight in stepping on them... 

",Sweet Dreams,2014
John Bucchino,"Sometimes I think my heart will burst
Like a balloon inside my chest
With all the love that's waiting here
Unexpressed

Fingers that ache to intertwine
Warmest of chords but missing tune
Where is the laugh to echo mine
Send it soon

The words my lips would form
The circle these two arms would make 
safe and warm
Someone could be safe and warm

But maybe the love we yearn to give
Can find a release some other way
Colouring how we choose to live
Every day

The kindness we can share

The kindness we can share
The comfort these two arms might lend
In despair
Someone's always in despair

Still, I'm longing to meet that pair of eyes
Dark as the night or endless blue
Holding a light I'll recognise
Something clear, something true

Something that seems to mean
Something I haven't seen
Since
You

John Bunch,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again

John Bunch,"For all we know
We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye

This might only be a dream
We come and we go

Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

From some enchanted land.

Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?

Searching the promenades seeking a clue

Little pleasures they will share

I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

To a degree.
I love the common folks.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

That's why I seem to have more than my share,

Her only answer is one little smile,

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

Where have I been all these years?

And some thrills I can't define.

Finding another world.

When all they do is brainwash our minds
Only telling what they want us to know
Only half of the story told

And if the truth can't be found
I'll find my own underground
And if the truth is never to be seen
I'll find my own in between

What you watch, what you read
What you percieve is to be truth
It is all so subjective
So what you believe is up to you

But what are we to believe in
Between the lies and the truth? Youth
Media has vested interest
So what you believe is up to you.
You know its up to you
Don't believe the lies, read between the lines,
Don't believe the lies, critically analyse

Nothing gonna stop old me from finding myself a new day

Nothing gonna stop old me from finding myself a new day
Oh no ,I said and nothing going to stop me or you

All alone and you don't even understand

So I'll obey, listen to what you say
'cause you are in full control now
But you're so scared, so scared of losing it all somehow
You're all alone, you're all alone

All alone and you don't even understand

You won't get any in return

See what you looked like,
I bet you look like your mother,

But your not coming out to play,
Not tomorrow or tonight,

Yes I hold her body tight.

I was running blind, but now I can be.
If there's just one sign, hell you know I can see.
Girl I'm meant for you, you are meant for me.

So I say,
I'm bound to ramble,
All my days with another.
All my days.

Her teachings in every day.
And boy I know she ain't preaching, but I feel the need to pray.
She's like the ocean size pounding on my shores.
Knocking down all my walls, opening up all my doors.

I'm bound to ramble,

He said everything was fine until that fateful day
That's when his luck started to change
The day he went to help and go blow up that Mountain Range
Ben moved to Town a year ago or maybe more
Straight out of Highschool, the whole he had in store
Wanted to travel, needed some dough
Everybody worked the Mines
Why should he say no?

Don't ask him why, he can't explain
Why now things for him have changed
It's not his land, they're not his songs
He can't work out why he don't belong

He part of Company, part of Company, part of Company Sin
Won't someone please tell the lad when Humbug did begin?
Part of Company, part of Company, part of Company Sin
Won't someone please tell the lad when Humbug did begin?

Now legend has it, or so they say
The Bones of an Ancient People, yeah that's where they lay
And their Descendants hold close to heart
Oh, that Mountain Range Ben was helping blow apart
And so I said for Ben things weren't quite right
Now he's waking up screaming every single night
Hearing voices in a different tongue
The screaming of the Old, yeah, the screaming of the Young

Don't ask him why, he can't explain
Why now he feels in so much pain
It's not his land, they're not his songs
He can't work out why he don't belong

Now Ben's moved on - job left him a while back
Now he's thanking God that his boss gave him the sack
But in the mirror, yes he can face
The day he stopped helping go blow up that Sacred Place

Then you start ripping off your friends,
Hell yeah man that's where my story ends

Sticking all their valuables into bags.
Going around to the hockshop
So once again man you can go and get ripped off
But what your looking for inside
It's up jumped gone and died

They can't all be right.
Can't you see your days,
They've turned into night.
Can't you see the sun,
Can't you see the moon,
Can't you see that Karma will be coming for you.

Now I don't mind just a little indulgence,
But you gotta do it with a conscience.

Now all your into is drugs.
Talking your shit man hanging with thugs.

To answer any of them tonight.
For I wear too many masks,
Too tell if any of them are wrong or right.
And confusion casts a shadow up on me,
Like a great big cloud in the sky.
And now I pray for rain,
Cause it's been so long since I let myself cry.

For so long I've sang this sad ol' song,
And it feels like my time is up.
For she came and landed in my arms,
And she filled my half empty cup.
Yes she filled my half empty cup.

There you are right in front of me,
A brand new day sunrise over sea.
No longer my cup half empty cause there you are,
You and your mum in front of me, in front of me.

And now I look up above me,
And I thank that great ol' God in the sky.
For tellin' me my cup ain't half empty,
It took my little girl to show me why.

Your peaches & cream to me.
You both are peaches & cream to me.

I love you...

From the one I thought I'd never meet.
Beyond my greatest expectations.
You exceeded everything.
Well here I am

Take me for what you see
For I'm transparent in the light of you.
And look inside,
See that fire burning bright
The same one that you rekindled inside me

My mouth was dry
Only you quenched my thirst
I thought I was last
You told me I was first.

And I thought I was seeing Angels
And now I know I was.
Your wings around me
Feel good they always does.

So there I was
Ain't the same man I used to be
But do you still like what you see in me.

Still see through,
Always will be with you.
Can you stand to see my vulnerability

For I am frightened
Shed so much I clung onto
The only things I have left is this guitar and you.

Nowhere to run
Been out here too long
Under the sun.
Am I too afraid
To get some.
To afraid to give myself some shade
I hope and pray I do some day.

So Mother Earth is what you need
Maybe this is what you be looking for.

Oh Mother Earth
Got to respect her
She's all around me
Under my feet you know I got to remember,
Mother Earth
Got to defend her.
And to defend her I must respect myself
You know I got to remember
I must remember.

There'll come a time
When we can't take anymore
When the air that we breathe
Has left us rotten to the core
And the water that we drink
You know its no good to drink any more
Do we have to let it go,
Do we have to let it go this far?

Beautiful moon shining over the ocean
Don't you know I'll do it all for you.
Give up my days and my tomorrows
If the words I singing are not true.
Cause in this world and the others
Not a thing that I wouldn't do
Mother Earth your in my soul.
It's my blood your running through.

Must respect myself to Defend her.

Cause I got a recipe and you know I can cook
And I come forth with only good intent,

Get the job done like my momma told me to.
Only one thing can remember she said,
You gotta earn all of your respect.

And I don't care what race or what colour or what creed
All that shit don't bother me,
Only one thing that you should not forget ,
You gotta treat you mama with little respect

I don't care about the car or the clothes you do wear.

You know they're doing their part
You know they're doing their bit.

God bless the people in New York when they were attacked
God bless the children being bombed there in Iraq
God bless the goddamn junkie with a monkey on his back
God bless everybody under the sun

Cause the world ahead will end if we don't got love
Do your job and pay attention to God above
But eventually the only guarantee will be that the tea in your tank will run dry

He graduates man without learning

So long ago
This son's a puppet with a master
The hands stand still right by his side
Middle finger on the button of disaster

And most of us we stand and watch
Like old lady getting handbag stolen
It's time to chase, chase them criminals
I see the devil and the devil is running

Bad business ties turn out sour
Backstabbed man nothing forgotten
And in an unforgotten hour
Seeds fall from an apple rotten
Now hate and fear have their own way
And don't the scum just love the distraction
Black blood will need to be lanced
And when it's found you just blame
The guilty faction

And now it's time not just to watch

Now there is only cheap regrets
I guess that?s just the way it be
Is it world, how I see me

Boy now you are really bugging
Really bugging 
Yes you are bugging me
Can?t you just shut right up
Your cup is overflowing
Overflowing
And you think it is empty
You don?t even know what side
You are fighting for
Boy would you turn your Game Boy off
Stop pretending it?s you against the world
I am sick and I am tired 
Of hearing you always say

Who fed you fish and scratched your ears?
You'd notice him

Suppose you was a woman wed
And sleepin' in a double bed
Beside one man for seven years
You'd notice him

A human being's made of more than air
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there
Unless that human being next to you
Is unimpressive, undistinguished, you know who

Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

I tell ya Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there
Never even know I'm there

I hope, I haven't taken too much of your time

John C. Reilly,"Won't you play the music so the cradle can rock
To a lullaby in ragtime
Sleepy hands are creeping to the end of the clock
Play a lullaby in ragtime
You can tell the sandman is on his way
By the way
That they play
As still, as the trill, of a thrush, in a twilight high

So you can hear the
Rhythm of the ripples on the side of the boat

As you sail away to dreamland
High above the moon you hear a silvery note
As the sandman takes your hand
So rock-a-by my baby
Don't you cry my baby
Sleepy-time is nigh
Won't you rock me to a ragtime lullaby
So rock-a-by my baby

Don't you cry my baby
Sleepy-time is nigh
Won't you rock me to a ragtime lullaby",Lullaby in Ragtime,2006

Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase

There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

John Cacavas,"He has a powerful weapon
He charges a million a shot
An assassin that's second to none
The man with the golden gun

Lurking in some darkened doorway
Or crouched on a rooftop somewhere
In the next room, or this very one
The man with the golden gun

Love is required, whenever he's hired
It comes just before the kill
No one can catch him, no hitman can match him
For his million dollar skill

One golden shot means another poor victim
Has come to a glittering end
For a price, he'll erase anyone
The man with the golden gun

His eye may be on you or me
Who will he bang?
We shall see, oh yeah!

Love is required, whenever he's hired

Had no intention to do the things we've done
Funny how it always goes with love, when you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind, we move as one

We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight, let the flight begin

I don't want to waste a waking moment; I don't want to sleep
I'm in so strong and so deep, and so are you
In my time I've said these words before, but now I realize
My heart was telling me lies, for you they're true

We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love

John Cacavas,"Diamonds are forever, they are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
 
Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
When my monster, from its slab, began to rise

And it's a graveyard smash
He did the Mash, it caught on in a flash

To the master bedroom, where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds

But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this:
The fourth, the fifth.
The minor fall, the major lift.
The baffled king composing Hallelujah.

Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah.

Your faith was strong but you needed proof.
You saw her bathing on the roof.
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.
She tied you to a kitchen chair.
She broke your throne, she cut your hair.
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.

Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah.

Maybe I've been here before.
I know this room, I've walked this floor.
I used to live alone before I knew you.
I've seen your flag on the marble arch.
Love is not a victory march,
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.

Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah.

There was a time you'd let me know
What's real and going on below.
But now you never show it to me, do you?
Remember when I moved in you?
The Holy Dove was moving too.
And every breath we drew was hallelujah.

Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah.

Maybe there's a God above.
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you.
It's not a cry you can hear at night.
It's not somebody who's seen the light.
It's a cold and its a broken hallelujah.

Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelu...

Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah.",Hallelujah,
John Cale,"She makes me so unsure of myself
Standing there but never talking sense
Just a visitor you see
So much wanting to be seen
She'd open up the door and vaguely carry us away

It's the customary thing to say or do
To a disappointed proud man in his grief
And on Fridays she'd be there
And on Wednesday not at all
Just casually appearing from the clock across the hall

You're a ghost la la la
You're a ghost
I'm in the church and I've come
To claim you with my iron drum
La la la

The Continent's just fallen in disgrace
William William William Rogers put it in its place
Blood and tears from old Japan
Caravans and lots of jam and maids of honor
Singing crying singing tediously

Get to know the date and tell the time of day
As the crowds begin complaining
How the Beaujolais is raining
Down on darkened meetings on Champs Elysee",Paris 1919,
John Cale,"Queen Victoria,
My father and all his tobacco loved you,
I love you too in all your forms,
The slim and lovely virgin floating among German beer,
The mean governess of the huge pink maps,
The solitary mourner of a prince.

Queen Victoria,
I am cold and rainy,
I am dirty as a glass roof in a train station,
I feel like an empty cast iron exhibition,
I want ornaments on everything,
Because my love, she gone with other boys.

Queen Victoria,
Do you have a punishment under the white lace,
Will you be short with her, make her read those little Bibles,
Will you spank her with a mechanical corset.
I want her pure as power, I want her skin slightly musty with petticoats
Will you wash the easy bidet out of her head?

Queen Victoria,
I'm not much nourished by modern love,
Will you come into my life
With your sorrow and your black carriages,
And your perfect
Memories.

Queen Victoria,
The Twentieth Century belongs to you and me.
Let us be two severe giants not less lonely for our partnership,
Who discolored test tubes in the halls of Science,
Who turned up unwelcome at every World's Fair,
Heavy with proverb and correction
Confusing the star-dazed tourists
With our incomparable sense of loss.",Queen Victoria,
John Cale,"I want to go home, I want to go home
I want to go back to Adelaide
It' s time for a change, don't want to be late
It's probably night in Adelaide

In a day or two, I'll be there asking for you
To come back to Adelaide with me
The weather there is so good.

So pass me the phone, I'll go it alone
I'll whistle my way to Adelaide
There's no time to cry, I'll be there tonight
The trains and the boats and planes are on time.

But before I go, I'm knock-knocking on your front door
Be sure to say good-bye to your friends
And to all my friends back home.

And I think the journey did her well
Her face has lost it's touch
The tell tale signs of loneliness inside

But I love her still
And need her company still more
Come down, come down once more
And I think, the journey, did her well

She says she fell in love
With men who knew the way to treat a lady
Her life has settled for the best of things
That I couldn't give her

Started long ago, in my paper cup saloon
And the back-room boys still carrying that same old tune
We've just one bottle left, standing on the shelf
I'd better bring it on up, I'd better bring it on up

Time to get the wagon, and in the back of the car
With the sherriff and me, singing out of key
Sooner then than later, I was up behind bars
With that empty bowl laughing right at me

John Cale,"The manager is waiting to be paid
Along with priests and deacons of his court
A quartermaster, quite a man, a mistress of the line
Has found a last cent avenue of pain

A Mardi Gras just passed this way a while ago
Making hungry people of us all
Along the Mississippi you can hear the fiddlers play
Fandangos and boleros to the lord

Many times, many tried,
Simple stories are the best
Keep in mind, the wishful kind,
Don't want to be like all the rest.

My uncle was a vicar in the big parade
Selling fountain pens that never write
San Sebastian gamblers never cheat nor lie
They know good fences make good neighbours

I wish I knew what time of year it was What kind of people will be there When gruesome tales of two cities ran Running all the way Father might have heard his prayers were answered Inhibitions all the way from home Consider now, consider then before the deed is done The blood of consolation runs so true Many times, many tried, Simple stories are the best Keep in mind, the wishful kind, Don't want to be like all the rest.",Charlemagne,1970

How you should say, what you think is the way out
Will you, won't you, will you see me through
Maybe you could help me find a thing or two about you.

Cleo, Cleo, now's the time for you to tell me
If you, want to, you can leave it up to me girl

Peering through the cutting wrist, at grand old mother greedy
Rolling out the cotton ship, upon the carpet pillow
Throttling children callously, a messy day with Clancy

Gideon lied and Gideon died
The force of China felt
Gideon smiled as Gideon died
The thought of China held.

Rolling out the golden robes and other foreign language
Stretching out the verbs and nouns together in the greeting
Some that felt the blade often, some deep confused emotion
Struck eye first against the wall of China under fire.

Sits idly fully armed
The powder and mascara there
A warning light for charm
We see her every movie night
The strong against the weak

The empty voice that speaks

Her heart is oh so tired now
Of kindnesses gone by
Like broken glasses in a drain
Gone down but not well spent
The road from Barbary to here
She sold then stole right back
The vanity, insanity her hungry heart forgave
The fading bride's dull beauty grows
Just begging to be seen

Barbary to here

Too late but wait the long legged bait
Tripped uselessly around

John Cale,"Very slowly he sipped his tea, not shifting his glance from the thick double-spaced printing he read with his jeweller's eye

Engrossed in his corner, he passed onto the other inhabitants of the room a scrawled insularity of time and space

For both passed him by with the speed of light, not unlike the flow of substance, however varied, into that lysergic entity known as the black hole

He was hardly ugly for his time, and conversation was certainly not lost on him
Drastic measures were called for, and as in antiquity the lonely man was blessed with wisdom to the point of desperation

But there in his corner, developing around him like a sun, was a climate of such rare beauty that sight and sound could no longer be considered sufficient food for the senses

And he had begun to notice, as his hearing failed, that mind and matter were in no way connected to one other, as if in fact the one could not propose and prove its erotic existence in terms of the other

""What does this word mean?"" he enquired of the solemn waiter hopefully
""Nothing for dessert sir,"" came the reply, ""perhaps a cocktail, demitasse or a herbal essence, it helps the breathing you know sometimes."" ""The bill, if you don't mind,"" quickly he shot back

And as the patter of the feet faded in the room, for he barely heard them now, his eye slowly began to close, and by the time he emerged on the sunny street he was forced to rely entirely on the other eye for help, but happily it continued its many functions, blinking gently for lubrication, and registering images
It was rush hour, in Hawaii only 10 am

So, turning into his street, he stopped at the drug store and bought an eye patch that soon covered the reluctant eye

Climbing the stairs he pondered what to do next, he would call a doctor and have tests made, eat nourishing food and if necessary consent to surgery, the last resort of the gambling man

And at 1 am he awoke from a dream and after fumbling his way in the obolescent light of his room he peered into the rusty veins of his mirror and lifted away the patch
What he saw astonished him. Where once was tremulous tissue and membrane was now a follicle and perfectly formed vagina with vulva, overgrown and mysterious, unrevealing and still to the untrained eye

But in the deep dark recesses of that sticky occlusion lay the unclosing watchful eye of disgust in its closing moments, lunging forward and hungry for the cold light of days",The Jeweller,1975

John Cale,"Standing waiting for a man to show
Wide eyed one eye fixed on the door
This waiting's killing me, it's wearing me down
Day in day out, my feet are burning holes in the ground

Darkness warmer than a bedroom floor
Want someone to hold me close forever more
I'm a sleeping dog, but you can't tell
When I'm on the prowl you'ld better run like hell
You know it makes sense, don't even think about it
Life and death are just things you do when you're bored
Say fear's a man's best friend
You add it up it brings you down

Home is living like a man on the run
Trails leading nowhere, where to my son?
We're already dead, just not yet in the ground
Take my helping hand I'll show you around
You know it makes sense, don't even think about it

John Cale,"Me and my partner we work on the run
The quick try to get quicker
And the creepers get hung
Now it's you that got wasted tonight on the job
One lost his liquor
And the other lost his hand

Ten sticky thumb prints on the door and the sink
But nothin' saw nothin' - just smell the stink
Five hundred mugshots and a hundred to one
Four forgotten and the rest just won't come

When you've begun to think like a gun
The rest of the year has already gone
When you've begun to think like a gun
The days of the year have suddenly gone

(Well) blood on the windows and blood on the walls
Blood on the ceiling and down in the halls
And the papers keep downing on everything I burned
And the people getting restless but they'll never learn

I picked up a doctor - he's good with a knife
Says anaesthetic's a waste of his time
Works in a hurry but always worthwhile
Knows they won't be back for a long long time

Top of the staircase was ready to fall
We were still waiting downstairs in the hall
Watch out for big mama, she'll set you on fire
Or go for your neck with the chicken wire

The days of the year have suddenly gone
Once you've begun to think like a gun

I don't care nothing about you anyway

John Cale,"The bugger in the short sleeves fucked my wife
Did it quick and split
Back home, fresh as a daisy to Maisy, oh Maisy

And the twelve-bore it stood in the corner
Quite operatic in its self-disgust
It blew him all over the living room floor
Like parrot shit, parrot spit, parrot shit was shot

Now suppose it was someone familiar
Someone we all would know
embarrassing denouement, n'est-ce pas?
Familiar hyperbole

And there would go the secret plot
The piss had missed the hole in the pot
Like that ancient teenage dream
From soul to poison soul to poison soul

Guts, guts, got no guts
And stitches don't help at all
Guts, guts, got no guts
Holes in the body, holes in the legs
Holes in the forehead, holes in the head
Holes in the body, holes in the legs
There should never be holes at all
There should never be holes at all

I hear the tanks crawling

They're breaking it up, they're breaking up my spell
And what else is there, what else have I got?
What else have I got but that spell?

Honest and faithful till the very end
Well enough of that I'm tired of hearing it anyway

Lying there nude sporting that stupid grin
So get on with it straight on and porno bound
Just leave me out of it I'm not proud

It would have taken you a long long time

Happy to see her in the back of a limousine

John Cale,"As I walked out in the streets of laredo,
As I walked out in laredo one day,
I spied a young cowboy wrapped up in white linen,
Wrapped up in white linen and cold as the clay.
""O beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly;
Play the dead march as you carry me along.
Take me to the green valley and lay the sod o're me,
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I done wrong.""

""I see by your outfit that your are a cowboy.""
These words he did say as I boldly stepped by.
""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story;
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die.""

""My friends and relations they live in the nation:
They know not where their dear boy has gone.
I first came to texas and hired to a ranchman,
O I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.""

""It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing:
It was once in the saddle I used to go gay.
First to the dram house and then to the card house,
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today.""

""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin;
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song.
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin,
Put roses to deaden the cods as they fall.""

""Go gather around you a group of young cowboys,
And tell them the story of this my sad fate.
Tell one and the other before they go further,
To stop their wild roving before it's too late.""

""Go bring me a cup, a cup of cold water
To cool my parched lips,"" the young cowboy said.
Before I returned the spirit had left him
And gone to it's maker--the cowboy was dead.

We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly,
And bitterly wept as we bore him along.
For awe all loved our comrade, so brave, young, and handsome,
We all loved our comrade although he'd done wrong.",The Streets of Laredo,1981

John Cale,"It was a very cold clear fall night
I had a terrible dream
Billy Name and Brigid were playing under my stair case
on the second floor about two o'clock in the morning

I woke up
because Amos and Archie had started barking
That made me very angry
because I wasn't feeling well and I told them
I was very cross the real me
that they just better remember
what happened to Sam the bad cat
that was left at home and got sick and went pussy heaven

It was a very cold clear fall night
Some snowflakes were falling
Gee, it was so beautiful
and so I went to get my camera to take some pictures
And then I was taking the pictures
but the exposure thing wasn't right
and I was going to call Fred or Gerry
to find out how to get set it
I was too late
and then I remembered they were still probably at dinner
and anyway
I felt really bad and didn't want to talk to anybody
but the snowflakes were so beautiful and real looking
and I really wanted to hold them
And that's when I heard the voices
from down the hall near the stairs
So I got a flashlight
and I was scared and I went out into the hallway
There's been all kinds of troubles
lately in the neighborhood
and someone's got to bring home the bacon and anyway
there were Brigid and Billy playing

And under the stair case
was a little meadow sort of like the park at 23rd street
where all the young kids go and play frisbee
Gee, that must be fun
maybe we should do an article on that in the magazine
but they'll just tell me I'm stupid and it won't sell
but I'll just hold my ground this time, I mean
it's my magazine, isn't it?

So I was thinking that as the snowflakes fell
and I heard those voices having so much fun
Gee, it would be so great to have some fun
So I called Billy
but either he didn't hear me or he didn't want to answer
which was so strange
because
even if I don't like reunions I've always loved Billy
I'm so glad he's working
I mean it's different than Ondine
He keeps touring with those movies
and he doesn't even pay us and the film
I mean the film's just going to disintegrate and then what
I mean he's so normal off of drugs
I just don't get it

And then I saw John Cale
he's been looking really great
He's been coming by the office to exercise with me
Ronnie said I have a muscle
but he's been really mean since he went to AA
I mean what does it mean
when you give up drinking and then you're still so mean
He says I'm being lazy but I'm not
I'm just can't find any ideas
I mean I'm just not
let's face it
going to get any ideas up at the office

And seeing John made me think of the Velvets
and I had been thinking about them
when I was on St. Marks Place
going to that new gallery those sweet new kids have opened
but the thought I was old
and then I saw the old DOM
the old club where we did our first shows
It was so great
And I don't understand about that Velvet's first album
I mean I did the cover
I was the producer
and I always see it repackaged
and I've never gotten a penny from it
How could that be
I should call Henry
but it was good seeing John
I did a cover for him
but I did in black and white and he change it to color
It would have been worth more if he'd left it my way
but you can never tell any body anything I've leaned that

I tried calling again to Billy and John
they wouldn't recognize me it was like I wasn't there
Why won't they let me in

And then I saw Lou
I'm so mad at him
Lou Reed got married and didn't invite me
I mean is it because he thought I'd bring too many people
I don't get it
could have at least called
I mean he's doing so great
Why doesn't he call me?
I saw him at the MTV show
and he was one row away and he didn't even say hello
I don't get it
You know I hate Lou
I really do
He won't even hire us for his videos
And I was proud of him

I was so scared today
There was blood leaking thought my shirt
from those old scars from being shot
And the corset I wear to keep my insides in was hurting
And I did three sets of fifteen pushups
and four sets of ten setups
But then my insides hurt
and I saw drops of blood on my shirt and I remember
the doctors saying I was dead
And then later they had to take blood out of my hand
'couse they ran out or veins
but then
all this thinking was making me an old grouch
and you can't do anything anyway so
if they wouldn't let me play with them in my own dream
I was just going to have to make another
and another
and another
Gee, wouldn't it be funny if I died in this dream
before I could make another one up

And nobody called

And nobody came

Hello, it's me

I really miss you, I really miss your mind
I haven't heard ideas like that for such a long, long time
I loved to watch you draw and watch you paint
But when I saw you last, I turned away

When Billy Name was sick and locked up in his room
You asked me for some speed, I though it was for you
I'm sorry if I doubted your good heart

Hello, it's me, that was a great gallery show
Your cow wallpaper and your floating silver pillows
I wish I paid more attention when they laughed at you
Hello, it's me

""Pop goes pop artist"", the headline said
""Is shooting a put-on, is Warhol really dead""
You get less time for stealing a car
I remember thinking as I heard my own record in a bar

They really hated you, now all that's changed
But I have some resentments that can never be unmade
You hit me where it hurt I didn't laugh

From inside her idiot madness spoke and bang

And I believe life's serious enough for retribution
I believe being sick is no excuse and
I believe I would've pulled the switch on her myself

When they got him to the hospital his pulse was gone
they thought that he was dead
His guts were pouring from his wounds onto the floor
they thought that he was dead
Not until years later would the hospital do to him what she could not

Some say images have no feeling, I think there's a deeper meaning
Mechanical precision or so it's seeming
Instigates a cooler feeling
I love multiplicity of screenings
Things born anew display new meanings
I think images are worth repeating and repeating and repeating

I'm no urban idiot savant spewing paint without any order
I'm no sphinx, no mystery enigma
What I paint is very ordinary
I don't think I'm old or modern, I don't think I think

It doesn't matter what I am thinking
It's the images that are worth repeating

If you think technique is meaning, you might find me very simple
You might think the images boring

You might find me personally boring

John Cale,"Before the end of the beginning, before the finish credits role, there is a brief but brutal truth along the high and mighty road. faces tend to run together, names be lost and legends told, of
Ays to be forgiven on that high and mighty road.

There is a will to test the power, there is the struggle for control of the basic rights of passage along the high and mighty road.
It is a journey for the taking, it is a choice that can be made.
It is the soul that may be shaken, it is the spirit to be sane.

There is hypocrisy and wonder, when fortunes pale and empires home to an ancient way of magic along a high and mighty road.
Money changers seeking payments for the privileged to be so bold, to say the train is not too crowded for a high and mighty road.
And the courage may be tested, by judgment harsh and cold, from the monitors of progress along that high and mighty road.

There are the words that have been spoken, there is the life that's been portayed, it is a promise to be broken, it is the joy that dies in vain.
Pale treasure, fragile beauty, or the messages set in coal, we delivered as nostalgic on that high and mighty road.
Sacrifice and deprivation are spiteful paradoxes sold as begrudging restitutions along that high and mighty road.
And yet the faces, oh god the faces, they seldom change from young to old, they only seem to grow more brazen along the high and mighty road.
It is the future we are trading, it is the prices that we pay, it is the mind that is mistaken, it is the heart we give away.",The High and Mighty Road,1994

The dawn, wrapped in coats of vanity. In the closets in the home hang the toasts
Of days gone by, breaking every haunted scheme confusing thoughts with fantasy.

The train - I saw -
People danced that's all it took
Again. to turn them around.
One world strange world,
We're in. no sound.
We'll find the same things
The same thing. are everywhere around.
Never mind... you'll see,
With time, with time
We'll dance again. we'll dance again.
If it all fades away... let it all fade dancing away.

On a summer night, I found,
And the quiet words that's all it took
We exchanged. I felt to turn him around.

To emphasize - he sighs.

Into mona lisa's eyes. a touch of her eyes.

Turning bad days into better nights. 
Waving smoke out the window, 
Catch my hand against the background of night. 
Dragging fingertips through constellations. 
When we make the last turn 
When we make the last turn for home 
We know half the battle is through. 
Still sufficient in depending on you 
Depending on each other.

John Cale,"The Ship of Fools is coming in
Take me off I've got to eat
Same old stories same old thing
Letting out and pulling in

Mister, there's a caravan parked out back
Restless hoping for a Christian rider
The black book, a grappling hook
A hangman's noose on a burnt out tree
Guess we must be getting close to Tombstone

The last time we had eaten
Was when the flies were going for free
You could count the hardships by the open doors
But sandwiched in between
Were the fishermen who still
Wished they could sail from Tenessee to Arizona

So hold on, won't be long
The call is on the line
Hold on, Sister's gone
South to give the sign

We picked up Dracula in Memphis
It was just about the break of day
And then hastily prayed for out souls to be saved
There was something in the air that made us kind of weary

By the time we got to Swansea it was getting dark
Tumble, jungles, bugles and the prize
The tides turned west at Amerforth
As if they didn't know what to do
But Garnant stood its ground and asked for more

All the people seemed quite glad to see us
Shaking hands and smiling like the clock
Well we gave them all the message then
That the Ship of Fools was in
Make sure they get home for Christmas

So hold on, won't be long
The call is on the line
So hold on, Sister's gone
South to give the sign",Ship of Fools,1996
John Cale,"Day after day , they go
They go to gain just a 
Little more control
And when they took yours away
I couldn't sleep at all
I lay in bed for days


I died a sudden death
I made an awful mess
I didn't stand a chance
I didn't stand a chance

Made you so afraid

Discuss what steps were made before
You don't need them anymore
You know more than I know
You know more than I know

Instead, we read the morning news
In bed - what endlessness ahead
And there's no more to be said
You know more than I know

The blind may see, but stay behind relief
Of all liability and greed

They don't believe it

We set like traps, like traps for us, the rats
And there's nothing more to catch

John Cale,"I wish I could sail in a big black boat
With a big white sail over me
And once in the while
I'd pull into port
Drink some wine with a girl

But Sylvia said,
""Come to bed.
It's so good
To have you here.""

Some time ago
When time passed so slow
Too weak to know where to go
But now thinking back
On what strikes me the most
Is I'd made up my mind long before

And Sylvia said,
""Come to bed.
It's so good
To have you here.""

So I'll cope with you
Don't cope at all
So let's leave it all to the chef
Please send my regrets
In case I forget
To P.O. Box ""Nobody Home""

John Cale,"Come over to the window, my little darling,
I'd like to try to read your palm.
I used to think I was some kind of gypsy boy
Before I let you take me home.
Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again.

Well you know that I love to live with you,
But you make me forget so very much.
I forget to pray for the angels and then the angels forget to pray for us.

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began 

We met when we were almost young
Deep in the green lilac park.
You held on to me like I was a crucifix,
As we went kneeling through the dark.

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began 

Your letters they all say that you're beside me now.
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
Is fastening my ankle to a stone.

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began 

For now I need your hidden love.
I'm cold as a new razor blade.
You left when I told you I was curious,
I never said that I was brave.

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began 

Oh, you are really such a pretty one.
I see you've gone and changed your name again.
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside,
To wash my eyelids in the rain!

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began","So Long, Marianne",1999
John Cale,"I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
As you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That mis'ry loves company, wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applaudin' from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine

Stretching their necks in the goal
Taking them out in the elephant grass feeding them to the hyena's

I'm on a beach in Zanzibar
Or at least I'll be here soon
What a shame we carry with us
The residue of fools
Instead of better wisdom
And advance tools

we prefer to be standing
Looking out from higher ground
Breathing air to lift the spirits
Or racing balloons in the alps
While on the beach in Zanzibar
We're struggling in the surf
Seeing the look horizon
Moving further away from us

And I close my eyes
I think it's me
Out on the look horizon where I found you.

Across the Nile
The land of pharaoh is digging up its past
The broken amulets of history
Strewn in our path

Next to a cow in the pouring rain",Look Horizon,2003
John Cale,"I forgotten how often we saw Magritte
He's been much on my mind these days
Often we saw Magritte
Inside a canvas of blue saturated with beauty
In a web of glass
Pinned to the edges of vision

There's a car-horn in the street outside
And a museum with its windows open
Often we saw Magritte
Running with the legends of conspicuous men
And how often we forgot Magritte
How we remembered him then
And worshiped at his feet
Pinned to the edges of vision

Somebody's coming that hates us
Better watch the art
Upstairs there's a canvas stretched
For umbrellas and bowler hats
Everybody knows Rene did that
Often we saw Magritte
Pinned to the edges of vision
Often we saw Magritte
We all know Rene did that
Often we saw Magritte",Magritte,2003

A sign that madam is not feeling well

Like the pigeons in the yard she's getting fat on starch
She's cooking for sailors and combing her hair in the dark
She loves everybody she'll even love me
When I'm born in the traffic on the rolling seas
She's in over her head

Or long static shots of half naked men in the desert
She loves everybody",Over Her Head,2003

Saving enough for the Cobra on sale downtown
Test driving my motor and she was reading my mind
Four on the floor hugs the road designated driver tonight

Chaucer was to Canterbury what you were to the zone
Instead of trying to solve it you left it alone

Set themselves out upon a plate
For him to choose
What had he to lose

Not a ghost bloodied country
All covered with sleep
Where the black angel did weep
Not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

And wandering's brother
Walked on through the night
With his hair in his face
On a long splintered cut from the knife of g.t.

The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long
To his skull-shrill yell

Shining brightly red-rimmed and
Red-lined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind
On ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Cut mouth bleeding razor's
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool goodbye
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gone to choose, choose again

Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget
Where you come from
The stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame, choose again

And roverman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
Went the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

And if epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on

If the stone glances off
Split didactics in two
Leave the colors of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose, if you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start
