Melachrino Strings,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart
 
You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!

Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart",You Stepped Out of a Dream,1997
Melachrino Strings,"Call me irresponsible
Call me unreliable
Throw in undependable, too

Do my foolish alibis bore you?
Well, I'm not too clever, I
I just adore you

So, call me unpredictable
Tell me I'm impractical
Rainbows, I'm inclined to pursue

Call me irresponsible
Yes, I'm unreliable
But it's undeniably true
That I'm irresponsibly mad for you

Do my foolish alibis bore you?

Melachrino Strings,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,1997
Melachrino Strings,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue,

It had to be you, wonderful you

It had to be you.",It Had to Be You,1997
Melachrino Strings,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around",The Second Time Around,1997
Melachrino Strings,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1997
Melachrino Strings,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
For strangers in the night.",Strangers in the Night,1997
Melachrino Strings,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1997
Melani L. Skybell,"No cares for me 
I'm happy as I can be 
I learn to love and to live 
Devil may care 

No cares and woes 
Whatever comes later goes 
That's how I'll take and I'll give 
Devil may care 

When the day is through, I suffer no regrets 
I know that he who frets, loses the night 
For only a fool, thinks he can hold back the dawn

Melani L. Skybell,"Love makes me treat you

The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you

There's nothing in this whole world too good
For a boy so sweet and true
Gee, baby ain't I good to you

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas
Diamond ring
Big Cadillac car and everything
What makes me treat you
The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you","Gee Baby, Ain't I Good to You",
Melani L. Skybell,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me
",Imagination,2001
Melani L. Skybell,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,2001
Melani L. Skybell,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2001
Melani L. Skybell,"This can't be love
Because I feel so well
No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs
This can't be love

I get no dizzy spells
My head is not in the skies
My heart does not stand still
Just hear it beat

This is too sweet to be love
This can't be love
Because I feel so well

I love to look in your eyes
I love to look in your eyes
This can't be love

No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs

I love to look in your eyes
I love to look in your eyes",This Can't Be Love,2001
Melani L. Skybell,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2003
Melani L. Skybell,"I look at you and suddenly, something in your eyes I see;
Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.

You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle.
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride;

Full of butterflies inside.
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.
Just when I think, I'm free as a dove.
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love.",Old Devil Moon,2003
Melani L. Skybell,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

When darkness hovers and city lights take over
I am blinded to the words ""I am alone"".
It's useless to cry for a star in the sky,
For the city lights tell me there's none.
But what to do?

To dare dream that I am alone.

I had a little beetle
So that beetle was his name
And I called him Alexander
And he answered just the same
And I put him in a matchbox
And I kept him all the day
But nanny let my beetle out
Yes nanny let my beetle out
She went and let my beetle out
And beetle ran away
She said she didn't mean it
And I never said she did
She said she wanted matches
And she just took off the lid
She said I mustn't worry
And I really mustn't mind
That there's lots and lots of beetles
The she's certain we could find
She said I mustn't worry
But it's difficult to catch
An excited sort of beetle
You've mistaken for a match
If we looked in all the places
That a beetle might be near
And we made the kind of noises
That a beetle likes to hear
And I heard a kind of something
And I gave a sort of shout
It was a beetle house
And Alexander beetle coming out
It was Alexander beetle
I'm as certain as can be
And he had that kind of look as though
He thought it might be me
And he had that kind of look as though
He thought he ought to say
""I'm really very sorry that I tried to run away""
And nanny's very sorry too
Cause you know what she did
And she's writing Alexander
Very blackly on the lid
So nan and me are friends because
It's difficult to catch
An excited Alexander
You've misstaken for a match

And geese in flight and dogs that bite

And wasn't it fun in the bath tonight, 
The cold's so cold and the hot's so hot. 
God bless Daddy, I quite forgot. 

If I open my eyes just a little bit more 
I can see Nanny's dressing-gown on the door; 
It's a beautiful blue but it hasn't got a hood, 
God bless Nanny and make her good. 

Mine has a hood and I lie in bed 
And I pull the hood right over my head, 
And I shut my eyes and I curl up small 
And nobody knows that I'm there at all. 

Thank you God, for a lovely day, 
And what was the other I wanted to say? 
I said, 'Bless Daddy', so what could it be? 
Now I remember: God bless me"".

He has taught me all the evils that my ego must avoid.
Repression of the impulses resulting paranoid
As the id goes marching on.

[Chorus]
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

There was a man who thought his friends to him were all superior
And this complex he imagined made life drearier and drearier
Till his analyst assured him that he really was inferior
As the id goes marching on.

[Chorus]

Do you drown your superego in a flood of alcohol, or something else,
And go running after women till you're just about to fall.
You may think you're having fun but you're not having fun at all
As the id goes marching on.

[Chorus]

Oh sad is the masochism, the vagaries of sex
Have turned half the population into total nervous wrecks.
But your analyst will cure you, long as you can pay the checks
As the id goes marching on.

[Chorus]

Is your body plagued by aches and pains that you can't understand
Compound fractures ingrown toenails, floating kidneys, trembling hands,
There's a secret to your trouble: you're in love with your old man
As the id goes marching on.

I need to find, find someone to call mine,

You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,
No matter how long it takes;
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again.
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on,
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,

How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.
I grow impatient for a love to call my own,
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,

No love, love don't come easy,
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night,
For some tender arms to hold me tight.
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting,
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no,
You just have to wait,

Stop to pretend that you are in love with me
Stop telling me lies - I ain't gonna cry

I won't let you hurt me baby!
I won't let you drive me crazy!
I don't trust your angel eyes!

Don't forget your heart!
It's my turn - I will start again
And do the things I love!

It's too late - you had your chance
The game is over...
Time out!
I'm not a game to play
I'm not your joystick when you play your game!
It's too late - for you to say I'm sorry, baby!
Time out!
I'm not your game boy, no
I'm not your play-girl you can push around!

No more games with my heart
No gamble with my love
Right back to the start - this is where I have to go now
Respect my dreams and do the things that I need!
That's how I feel!
I'm gonna live my life right now!

I won't let you hurt me baby!
I won't let you drive me crazy!
I don't trust your angel eyes!

It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy

A fine line's between fate and destiny. 
Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be? 
When you tell me the stories of your quest for me. 
Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly. 

And as our energies mix and begin to multiply. 
Everyday situations, they start to simplify. 
So things will never be the same between you and I.

All I need is honesty
Tell me, baby...

Do I, do I
Do I feel like someone you could love? Yeah
Do I, do I
Do I feel like someone you could hold on to?
Am I the one
The one who makes you come undone?
Do I, do I?

Like a planet spinning around the sun
Something cosmic has begun
We won't swim against the tide
We'll just hold on tight, go for a ride

Lightning strikes in a second or two

I can't hold it back no more

Just like there's always gonna be
A place for you and me
A ship that we can sail on
Just like if one and one were three

And everything was free
At the end of some rainbow
Just like a needle and a gun
A circle in a sun

And a knock upon a hidden door
It is you I adore

Here it comes again
Filling my soul, never want to let go

Before all this mess began
I never felt alone

Simple into it

Did you see me coming
I made a choice
And now I´m running

When my life was not my own
I would throw it all away
Without sorrow
But it couldn´t change a thing
Wouldn´t change the way I feel
For today´s the price I pay for tomorrow

Did you see me coming
I made a choice
And now I´m running

It´s slipped away from me

just be a little piece of a bigger man

And Adam rocked my world
I was his biggest fan
No such thing as being a girl
He had the whole world in his hands

Now that was the life
No worries no pain
Just stay in my place
and grow a little more each day
I never had to make a plan
just be a little piece of a bigger man

And Adam rocked my world
I was his biggest fan
No such thing as being a girl
He had the whole world in his hands

Then I started to wonder
What's this spell I might be under
It's time to break away
It's time to feed this hunger


Never had to take a stand
just be a little piece of a bigger man",Adam's Rib,1999

Amazing unconditional inseparable love
That feels like forever that always emotional
But still exceptional love
Can't nobody tell me nothing
It is what it is any mistake you make I just may forgive
Right now right now at this very moment
I still lover her like I loved her then
I love her in an out up and down and
Round and round and over and over again
So rare they swear that you just don't exist
There's only one person I can think of
Makes me feel like this

'Cause I'm a fool such a fool (for you)

Wooh that deep that sweet soft
That wet that fire that funky stuff
That's up that down that front and that back
Baby I can't seem to get enough
Oh please let me do it do it till I'm satisfied
I'll beg and I'll plead baby I ain't got no more pride
Oh o oh

Sweet sugar I surrender
I don't want no other woman baby you win
You ain't never got to worry ever got to worry
You'll never be alone again'

I don't want it all the time

Melanie Fiona,"[Chorus]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this,
It's like sunshine on a rainy day,
It's like a, ""How could you take me away?""
""Take me away.""
""Away.""
It's a beautiful bliss.
When you feel like this (beautiful bliss)
When you spill out hits (beautiful bliss)
When you fly as a bitch
And you ride with tits
And you aint bothered a bit now baby.

Fresh out the airport
Fresh out the tan with the clippers
Like Sean Lippet thinking, hmm
I'm trying to get it like Sean get it
If lord giveth a mill and a milf like skibbit
Its slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That anvil night hard mine is bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my hearts in it
When Brett Hart meet Brett Favre
A sharp shooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less stick some more
On your vest then my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My pro-ject is like what pros inject
And niggas so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath no joke
You see them boys sign me to the 'Scope, right?

[Chorus]

I fall whole to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil' nigga 
From the ville could get a deal
And tell them niggas at the top 
We want yo spot we are for real
And yet we heard you got it locked 
But like them socks we on your heels
So you best be on your toes nigga
Especially on your flows nigga
'Cause man they keep on checking 
For me especially all your hoes nigga
Catch me on your doorstep
You see me let me in
All I wanna' do is eat
I'm like the freaky lesbian
Know all I wanna' do is ball on TV knee E.S.P.N.
They heard I'm bout to blow so all my enemies say, ""Let's be friends.""
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
Where all the girls that we knew scream, ""Fuck you""
Gon' let me in
I'm definitely in a class of my own
And dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton
He just pass the Patron
And he ain't givin' dog is earned
If you just live in dog you learn
I let you niggas see the light
I'm like the prison yard I yearn
For that living large but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your son rise
Kick back and know your son set
Forever I ain't run yet
And never will
Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said, ""Fuck the world and I ain't come yet.""
You up yet?
My punchlines like gut checks
I'm raw dog
I'm rough sex
I'm on deck
I'm up next
I'm godbless
I'm success
So fuck stress
You can get the fuck from around me
And if you listening know you wondering
Where the fuck they found me
I'm from the ville boy
(Aye Wale, good looking.)

[Chorus]

Another day up in my ES
Wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet
Fuck it
I don't be stressed like relaxed muscles
Your feedback ain't flexing
Then you can keep it running
Like a muffler
When we not in summer
They like A list actors
They not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function
I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female Dijon a puncture
Waiting showing you her beauty if she's naked
It's like the view of a paintin' or a lakehead
This shits how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital for Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or it I placement 'cause
Shift the keys get your capital raised up
(Mother fucker)

Make him, laugh until he cries,
Hold him, stand by his side
Hoping he'll change his way of life.

Still I keep the vision of candle lights
Wanna be alone, wanna be with you

Oh don't do me any favors
I guess I'll see you later

And left me right here on the sidewalk
on the corner is where he dropped me

begging Johnny baby bring me back my heart

Bring me back my heart

Why did I let him go? now I'm

Was drive me home

Just fill your head with why
Then you're caught living a lie again
Its sad that all he ever said
Was that he loved me to death
But that hes gone again and I was wrong again

'Cause you think its easier easy like that
Just when I wasn't finished
You were gone like that
Can't you hear me crying
'Cause I need you back
And I'm slowly dying
'Cause I need you bad
But your gone
And never coming back
Gone and not coming back
He's never coming back

Should've known the long kiss goodbye
Would bring sadness in my life
Wearing this disguise again
I wish that you would've said
Or lied to me instead
Like a bullet to my head
Like a fool I pretend
That its on again on again

'Cause you think its easier easy like that
Just when I wasn't finished
You were gone like that
Can't you hear me crying

Has never been on mine
Whoever said that he'll get his

That I cant buy back

I hope you got your lighter

Although they dimmed the lights
They try to knock my future down
The trees they tried to hide

They say I'm an optimist
Now look I topped the list
Approved but not to this
From negative to positive
Yeah, don't fight the planes
No parachutes, we let it rain
From the inn I brought my troops

Feels as if it never ends

Cant stop forming
May as well embrace

Said id walk the last for long
Said I had one hit and wondered back my parted songs
Asking whats the label on
Had this came along
Why the hell designer writes
Told my A.N.R. he's okay but now the game is wrong

Now picture this
Now I've got his day miss
I've planned it all
To rule the black the mist
And now it's hours
Lite and waiting for hours
Full of basement to the rooftops
We just played the hours

Read the days that weave through the maze
The seasons so amazing
Feed them and raised them
Seasons are aging
Earthquakes, wars, and rumors

We more than shooters, more than looters

And even in this generation, living through computers
Only love love love can reboot us

Thinkin' bout the things you do when 
I'm waiting over here and you ain't got no skoo

I was with the model type, body like a gymnast
Hot sex each night, It was just ridiculous
We was a match made in heaven but we had to 
Split because we couldn't fix the differences
And the differences, she was manipulative
And I wanted to do just whatever I did
But apparently you had a better idea and you left, I guess that's how it is
Hollywood divorce after Hollywood romance
Now when we together, we don't even hold hands
We don't even two step and we don't even slow dance
We was a duet, we was on bed
But now I'm solo, It's no show and no fans
That's how I go, you strike out like Molan
But strike out like Baseball, you go down the goal man
And now you frozen, and don't know there's no chance
She put them hooves on your head like a Colts fan
Now they comment on your life like a sportsman
I need a mediator, you need a mediator, you need a mirror and maybe you'll see

The faster you let it go
The faster you will hear me happy on the radio
Stronger I let it flow
The deeper I fall into this hole

Right beside each other and somehow it felt distant

Smile just glisten, your booty like a cushion
Is this the moment where we making up
And realise we tripping forever breaking up
And then I break you off, put you to sleep know its deep
When the girl of his dreams is the same one to wake him up

Thought I could be strong

What you gotta know about me
Is that I'm dying in this lonely hell

And I don’t wanna be without you

No, I didn’t mean it

Said you’ll care for me

Clowning these lames you're Bill Murray in Quick Change
Control your mission, keep up with my pole position
Brag it about the ride you're whipping, your soul is missing
Race it till your death to your holly celebration
God bless a lady if only accelerate you
Cause we’re speeding when we drive on this highway of information
The devil try to deny us the highest of elevation
They keep us at sea level so I’m staying on my A game
They local like the C when I express like the A train
My a-alikes take what I write, use it to maintain
We be alike and see alike, cause we got the same brain
We in the same change, work in the same fields
Now we’re independent, you can keep your fucking lame deal
Total package, the flow is mastered, I low it past the procrastinators
Well fast, is bound to going backwards

Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go

They hate when I get it straight and they chase us
Have the little boys coming fast to the speed race
Pulling cables with my team best believe I'mma see paper
With extraordinary gena, trust me to lead lay you
Highway of life faster than a car
Rick it in the trunks of the rappers that got balls
Never rat out cause we lived through the battles, we got scars
Mr. international, half of the Black Star
It’s the sound that you’re missing I’m here with your air glisten
Play it loud at your wind when you’re gear shifting
Gifted like the island of the misfit toys, ladies apply like the lipstick
Boys take over when the shit drop
Boys wanna holla at birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Men wanna talk to the women, we ain’t screaming
Just whisper and then we’re leaving

Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door

Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go

When it’s gone to the wire
I gotta win to the fire
You can’t stop it
No, you can’t stop it
Because I’m destined to win
Like a full champion
And we know it’s happening
At the time, get ready, set, go

On your mark, get set, when I thought the jet
Look how far I get, I’m not only an artist they say
One is the loneliest number but still regardless
The second best don’t exist, it’s a little oxymoronic
What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high
Watermarks, cause the market’s flooded with garbage
You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic
Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic
Prisoner of conscious, nonsense
I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake
It’s so ironic, it’s beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral
We don’t get it away
Rappers nowadays are confusing you
I know you’re tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake
That’s why I’m leaping the faith, keeping the pace
Although it’s all about the winning, it’s never about the wait

Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops

Second round was never found, it ricocheted
Nowhere to run, I was stunned in a daze
A victim of a love I can't escape

I remember when you said you loved me
Three little words that burned into my soul
Maybe you didn't mean those things you told me
Maybe you didn't really mean those words at all

I'll bite the bullet
I'll do it in the name of love
I guess I'll bite the bullet
Or stop playing with loaded guns
Stop playing with loaded guns

What do you want from me?
Baby what do you want from me?
You think you have the ability to love two women equally
Well I don't have the energy to fight for your exclusivity
Oh no no no no

'Cause I remember when you said you loved me
That's why it's so damn hard to let you go
How did you mean them things you told me?
Did you ever really love me at all?

I'll bite the bullet
I'll do it in the name of love
I guess I'll bite the bullet
Or stop playing with loaded guns
Stop playing with loaded guns

All this back and forth, what is it for?
The silent games, the tug of war
Wish I could break down your walls
Be the one you call, catch you when you fall
Brick by brick, I thought that we could build again
But now I know this is the end

Gotta believe, that I can overcome
My fears are the worst and they always return

Lost in the wreckage of a million bad dreams
Hard to function, I just need some routine
God it's obscene, when did they stop the fun?

I knew that something must be done

That's why I had to run away

Feel the sun, waves crash like my emotion
Life has begun, now I will be safe from the storm
I found the one, this angel's my salvation
I'm feeling strong, you will be there if I fall

Guilt is no use it will tarnish your soul
Just let it go the battle will soon be won
Cold in the shadow of who I should be
There's a fire burnin' deep inside me
Helping me see, only I hold the key

And now I stand here unafraid

Though improbable it's not impossible. 
For a love that could be unstoppable. 

But wait. 
A fine line's between fate and destiny. 
Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be? 
When you tell me the stories of your quest for me. 
Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly. 

And as our energies mix and begin to multiply. 
Everyday situations, they start to simplify. 
So things will never be the same between you and I. 
We intertwined our life forces and now we're unified.

Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Because I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lassy
My father gave me nose a tweak
And told me I was sassy
But then one day I learned a word
That saved me aching nose
The biggest word I ever heard
And this is how it goes:

Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious

There's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word
And then you've got a lot to say
But better use it carefully
Or it can change your life

Je fais des brasses dans de l’eau douce
Un peu maladroite
Des châteaux de sable dans la mousse

Me noie pour un amour
À l’horizon des nuits moroses
Têtue je vais je cours

Je fais des cercles de fumée
Avec mes cigarettes
Je laisse griller les belles années
Mais n’en fais qu’à ma tête

Je fais des partitions au sol
À l’encre de chine
Des mélodies pour jours d’école
Faciles et sans épines

Je fais des remous dans le bain

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true

Your breath is breathing in my soul
Still I am gasping, aching, asking
Where are you now

Yeah, he's all right, but you not real
I'm a dog, s*** I eat the food I steal
Floors ain't dirty enough
My game is like carryin' shotguns and 21 rough

Doctor, I'm like the war on drugs
I don't stop, I'm all night vampire blood
Underground chud, since a kid
I finger painted in the mud, with dirty work gloves

I'm in yo' college campus corridor
You should call me Uno, the way I draw four
Brick City law, strip to your drawers
Boy now I can pick up two pair from the mall

It's time for Doc to check yo' a*** n***
It ain't hard, it's an easy pass n***

After 12, whattup to Dogg Pound

I roll out, like my earrings got ball bearings
Give me a Grammy to show my mammy
How I smash these Raggedy Ann and Andy's
I prove that I never left the street

I just knew I had to come back, with extra heat for y'all
Be-More are ya ready? Colorado are ya ready?
I'm at your neck like a Doberman mouth
With like 40 m*** out the covenant house, ya heard?

Gilla house in the circuit
And how we do it on purpose, only way to surface
Def Squad is the foundation
Three dawgs attached to 98 Dalmatians

Yeah, where them gilla niggaz out at night
You better run 'til you see the light, light
Yo, I know I had you waitin'
But death was chasin' me and my eight friends for Final Destination

Yo, I keep my ears to the street 'cause that's my job
But even the streets can steer you wrong
I'm walkin' with one man above me
Nuttin' on my waist, but if it's on you hearin' the palm

You forgot I'm ten years deep and out them ten years
I got two weeks of sleep and caffeine free
Amazin' right? I got a street team
That'll get paid to snipe

Yeah, by any means, I'm behind the curtain
My Betty Shabazz, hope I make it home, I invade alone
Catch you in the truck, babblin' on the phone
I miss you, I stick up your chaperone's

It's a dirty dog world, say it louder
Every Friday I'm bein' chased by Craig's father
That's why I'm on the low like pro
And my file is too hi tech to call next

And on the mic, I'm him times two of 'em

If you like it (a lil' bit) I will give you a (a lil' bit)
If you want it (a lil' bit) you can have some more
Now that you spent it (a lil' bit) you can taste it a (a lil' bit)
If you like it (a lil' bit) you can have some more

[Method Man]
Somebody tell honey I'm good, just like a licorice
Meth got 'em stuck in the hood just like a clitoris
Something like this track from Roc', ya'll, ridiculous
Don't touch her if I'm getting my rocks off, she ticklish
Now if I turn it up, shorty if you got a Dutch then we can burn it up
I ain't the type that need to drink to get his courage up
Half ya'll get a drink and think you murderers

[Redman]
Yo, I know you heard of us, Red & Meth, here take a photo
Walk in serious like Miguel Coto
Pimp in my mojo, swing in my logo
Def Squad, Wu-Tang, that's how I do things
Hit my blunt, baby I see your pussy a lil' bit
That's when I know it's on, it's time to head home
And we kick bitches out, around six in the morning

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
O.G. bubblegum, kush burn a bush
See you pussies like to eat out, need to learn to cook
Look, Meth wasn't eating 'em til I learned to juks
Tried to catch something, everytime I work a hook
Now if I crank it up, if I put it in the cup would you drink it up
Ever get caught up in a lie and try to change it up
You got a pocket full of lime, try and blaze it up

[Redman]
When I bust, I sip on that sir, fly to Miami and act up a lil' bit
I know eyes on me, when I count to three
Make believe you was indeed a copied MC
You can smell me a lil' bit, boy, my connect just mailed me a lil' bit
I got that block out of drought, now everybody love me
It's like Beetlejuice, shit gon' get ugly

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
I got to be out, at the club door with the key out
Bouncer at the door trynna tell me put the weed out
Honey got her feet out, the dudes coked up looking skied out
Tapped her on the shoulder like let's be out
Now should I speed it up, you know whisper in her ear, skeet skeet it up
Or should I take it to the crib and try to beat it up
A little candlelight and dinner when we need it up

[Redman]
Yo, another one light the dutch, it's Redman, holla bitch
Fuck you, that means she swallowed it
I do double on the turn, you must learn
Like K-are, the A-are, I grip it firm
If they brought hip hop back, sucker MC's be eating a lil' bit
Redman is on fire, so call him quick
You can reach me at 1-800 Eat-A-Dick

You fuckin' with a killa (you're so sexy)
You fuckin' with a killa
Lyrical, serial, either/or killa

Uhh, I'm in love with this pep
Switch a nigga up, put a thug in a dress
Chop a nigga head off, pick his head up
Turn it upside-down, drink his blood from his neck
Uhh, I fly across you with the Coupe now
I'm fire! The fire marshal shut the booth down
Uh, you fuckin' with a killa
Take your body, rape your body, dump it in the river
Turn myself in then, beat the case for it then
Turn around and put ""I really did it"" on my Twitter

Lyrical, serial, either/or killa!

First the clouds form, then they dark in the sky
Then the heavens roar when a couple of them collide
Then the most toxic rain landed on my
Caesar then Jesus Christ, the storm arrive
Six-foot-somethin' made of Spanish descent
What I write is fresh air like my hand's in a vent
Y'all 'bout to be lost like you don't know where your manager went
That's just a heads up, cause none of y'all was plannin' a vic
I'm from the projects, Grey Goose, a crate on the bench
Mike's Hard Lemonade'll get you amateurs bent
Where I'm from they don't hesitate the cannon that spits
Stand by the wrong man and watch your thoughts land on a fence!
I'm the voice of the gutter where your boys serve your mother
And the noise from a clucker puts your boy on a cover
We annoy undercovers cause they never put on
We from the hood, we don't snitch boy we weather the storm
We some killas!

[Chorus]

I'm comin' with flash just to blast your face mask
Bullets flyin' faster than the NASA spacecraft
Get half your face smashed by the click-clack
The impact's a passion of massive plane crash
The mic minister write literature, rhyme sinister
Might injure, your nine endin' your life when it's the
Prime miniature time witness the prime
Innocent lives kissin' goodbye, picture the I, givin' a fuck!
The truth (walkin') just walked in the booth (talkin)
Too (often) I put a hot beat in a new (coffin)
For instrumentals I dig a grave
Then drop so many bars around you when you listen feel like you in a cage
Niggaz styles is sour, you makin' lemonade
Take a thousand hours to write, our rhymes (Minute Made)
Me, Joey and Joell leave you crippled
Mother-fuck five cents, but we'll kill you over Nickel
We some killas!

I disagreed with my shadow when he got on Twitter (so I)
Don't like bein' followed so I shot that nigga
A known loner; that's backwards
I'm a loner that's known to attempt to put a comber in a coma
You lookin' at the prime suspect, with enough stress
If you can give a fuck, then I can give fuck less
Obsessed with who I struck next so I set it for
Success when I spit cause the vic is my next metaphor
Self-destructive mixed with light lies
If, you lookin' for psychotic, I got it
Or don't! Maybe y'all are retarded, absurd
And I observe while the whole world tries to act reserved
Need a Oscar, I'll put on an act that's superb
E'rybody relax, it's words
Maybe it's not! It's gotta be reasonable doubt (but)
Reason don't come out my mouth, I let it come out of hers

I am not trying to be in the store all day
Y'all can play the game one time
Let me go get change for a dollar real quick
Hey my man, what's up, you got change for a dollar?
What's up, man? You don't remember me do you? (Ryan!)
I remember you, I remember you, definitely
I remember you took my basketball and wouldn't give it back 'cause
I dribbled it inside the store but I was just messing with you
Plus that was my lucky ball
My Dad got it signed by Isaiah Thomas so I kept it with me

Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used bounce that, bounce that ball
I'm little Ryan from 16, 6-5-0 Bayers
Remember me? I used to buy all the mystery mix Now And Laters
I used to wait for God to come down and answer all my prayers

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers
All I ever, ever wanted was to be amazing (Ryan!)

Same little boy used to walk to the corner store
Who used to get the Funyun chips
Who ended up, dumb, young, and rich
I had young parents but they both were strict
I had a supersticious Grandad, wait, scratch that, crazy Grandad
I seen him turn his hat around three times
Drive his car around the corner three times in reverse
Just 'cause he crossed paths with a black cat
Man, you remember Hank? He used to be a Jimmy at the market
My mom used to do his laundry
He used to have me and my brothers dyin' laughing at him
Talkin about: you know you can't leave them clothes in the
Washing machine too long when they get done washed
And still put 'em in the dryer
Doing that makes the clothes stink
Damn, being back here bring back so many memories
You sure you don't remember me? You remember the ball
Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used bounce that, bounce that ball
Nigga, everybody know little Ryan from 17, 1-5-0 North Long
I used to come and cop pork rinds
I used to watch drug dealers come through in cars
Like, if I get one of those, its showtime

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers
All I ever, ever wanted was to be amazing (Ryan!)

Is that Ryan? Is it always good to see him in the neighborhood
Hey baby! How your momma? Look at that car, he done done it
I told y'all he was gonna do somethin'

Ryan! (Hell yeah)

Wow, this is overwheling
It feels like it was just yesteday I was watching Good Times 
Wishing I could get ahold of Thelma
Fighting with my brother over channels
I like watching movies
He likes stupid shit like Robin Williams going Nanu Nanu
Whatever that stupid ass show called
I ain't around here being no attention whore
I need niggas to look at these whips for every time we got those extension cords
God, I miss my big brother so much
He went to prison so much that I don't think I'd recognize him these days much
But I'mma always know what to get him from the Ice Cream truck
He used to get the Push-up Pops
I used to get the Snow Cone
I used to wanna be just like Turbo
He used to want to be Ozone
I got all the kids waving at me
All the elderly off they high horse
They wouldn't even let a nigga play twenty-one in the driveway
Nowdays the ball is in the my court (Ryan!)
Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used bounce that ball
Everybody going 'ain't that little Ryan from over there on Morrow
I ain't seen him since he was a baby'
Well I'm back in town to let the people know that you 
Don't need no lucky ball, you already amazing
And I'm still your neighbor
Little ol' Ryan

And God bless the child no matter how long it seems
Somehow he'll find his way home
It's so important baby
Between the memories and family, I don't know which one is more amazing

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers

I had a little beetle
So that beetle was his name
And I called him Alexander
And he answered just the same
And I put him in a matchbox
And I kept him all the day
But nanny let my beetle out
Yes nanny let my beetle out
She went and let my beetle out
And beetle ran away
She said she didn't mean it
And I never said she did
She said she wanted matches
And she just took off the lid
She said I mustn't worry
And I really mustn't mind
That there's lots and lots of beetles
The she's certain we could find
She said I mustn't worry
But it's difficult to catch
An excited sort of beetle
You've mistaken for a match
If we looked in all the places
That a beetle might be near
And we made the kind of noises
That a beetle likes to hear
And I heard a kind of something
And I gave a sort of shout
It was a beetle house
And Alexander beetle coming out
It was Alexander beetle
I'm as certain as can be
And he had that kind of look as though
He thought it might be me
And he had that kind of look as though
He thought he ought to say
""I'm really very sorry that I tried to run away""
And nanny's very sorry too
Cause you know what she did
And she's writing Alexander
Very blackly on the lid
So nan and me are friends because
It's difficult to catch
An excited Alexander
You've misstaken for a match

As the id goes marching on.

Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

There was a man who thought his friends to him were all superior
And this complex he imagined made life drearier and drearier
Till his analyst assured him that he really was inferior
As the id goes marching on.

Do you drown your superego in a flood of alcohol, or something else,
And go running after women till you're just about to fall.
You may think you're having fun but you're not having fun at all
As the id goes marching on.

Oh sad is the masochism, the vagaries of sex
Have turned half the population into total nervous wrecks.
But your analyst will cure you, long as you can pay the checks
As the id goes marching on.

Is your body plagued by aches and pains that you can't understand
Compound fractures ingrown toenails, floating kidneys, trembling hands,
There's a secret to your trouble: you're in love with your old man

I gotta feel a reason
To wash away the fear

For my heart to heal
This is how I feel
So sorry, there is nothing more to say

Falling from the clouds that hide the sun
It's over now, a new day is dawning

For mowing the yard - five dollars
And for making my own bed this week - one dollar
And for going to the store - fifty cents
An' playing with little brother, while you went shopping

And for raking the yard - two dollars
Total owed - fourteen seventy-five.

And a thousand memories flashed through my mind
So I picked up the pen, turning the paper over,
This is what I wrote:

For nine months I carried you
Growing inside me - no charge
For the nights I've sat up with you,
Doctored you, prayed for you - no charge
For the time and the tears.
And the cost through the years, there's no charge
When you add it all up.
The full cost of my love is no charge.

For the nights filled with dread
And the worries ahead - no charge
For advice and the knowledge
And the cost of your college - no charge
For the toys, food and clothes and for wiping your nose
There's NO CHARGE, son
When you add it all up,
The full cost of my love, is - charge.

And he looked up at me and he said,

Don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go back and start drinking again
I could hear lots of laughter just over the way

I started to walk but my knees gave away
As I fell I heard the voice say
Don't go don't go don't go don't go just kneel by your bedside and pray
Don't go don't go don't go don't go God will answer your prayers today
God freed me from sin like he did once before
Now I'm happy as a man can be

You've got me spinning like a top don't let this spinning ever stop
Just tell me that your love for me is true

WITH MELBA MONTGOMERY

I went to sleep last night lonely and blue
Tears were falling like the morning dew
But when I closed my eyes my loneliness was gone
Cause I dreamed my baby came home
And you were holding me kissing me like you used to do
My heart went crazy when you whispered I love you
Yes you were standing there sweet as you could be
Like you had never said goodbye to me
For just a little while my loneliness was gone
Cause I dreamed my baby came home
I went to sleep last night lonely and blue...
And you were holding me...
Yes you were standing there...

I let you go when I needed you so
Not knowing then I want you back again
Now that you're gone there's one thing I know
I'll always regret I let you go
Such a fool was I to be so blind
That you was within these arms of mine
It's too late now another's love you hold
I'll always regret I let you go
It hurts to know it was you I love so
Old mem'ry of you comes back to make me blue
One thought of you and tears begin to flow
I'll always regret I let you go
Such a fool was I to be so blind...

Honey won't you let me hold you tight
Tears keep a fallin' my eyes are blurred if I had the wings of a pretty little bird
I would fly right to your arms tonight
I'd jump the Mississippi deep and wide if you was a waitin' on the other side
Honey just to hug and hold you tight
I'd jump across and never get wet right there by your side I'd set
Yes indeed everything would be alright
If you would come back home to me make me happy like I used to be
I'd start and meet you halfway
I'd leave here and never look back I'd run a mile in a minute flat
To get to you before the end of day
I'd jump the Mississippi deep and wide...

MULTIPLY THE HEARTACHES

Once I thought two happy hearts would someday be as one
But then a third heart came along and now our love is gone
I count the many times I said I love no one but you
But don't be fooled by counting dreams that never will come true
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by everytime a heart breaks
The answer only tells that it's too late
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches...

Suppose tonight would be our last night together
And the love we have known came to an end
Would we laugh and tell ourselves think nothing of it
Or would we cry together for what might have been
I know I'd die in just a little while without you
Another dawn I wouldn't want to see
If you're supposed tonight would be our last together
Oh what a long and lonely night it would be

Oh, When you think that it's safe, girl
Just take a look around
I will be there behind you
There's nothing to fear, no
‘Cuz I can never hurt you
I think the world about you
Can you learn to love me, too
Can you learn to love me, too

The grubby hands that gripped the rail
Wiped the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch

A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore

Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded must be displayed

Large hands lift him through the air
Excited eyes contain him there
The eyes of those he loves and knows
But what's this extra bed just here

His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing

In those silent happy seconds
That surround the sound of this event
A parent smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend

And all you ever learned from them
Until you grew much older

Looking for something new
And you were nothing but a lonely girl
But you were something
Something like a dream come true
I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block
When I played my guitar
I made the canyons rock, but,

Every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go

In the middle of a steaming night
I'm tossing in my sleep
And in the middle of a red-eyed dream
I see you coming
Coming on to give it to me

I was out on the prowl down by the edge of the track
And like a son of a jackal
I'm a leader of the pack, but,

Every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go

Oh, baby, I'm a hunter in the dark of the forest
I've been stalking you and tracking you down
Cruising up and down the main drag all night long
We could be standing at the top of the world
Instead of sinking further down in the mud
You and me 'round about midnight
You and me 'round about midnight
Someone's got to draw first

Draw first
Someone's got to draw first blood
Someone's got to draw first blood
Oh I got to draw first blood
Oh I got to draw first blood

And like a son of a jackal I'm a leader of the pack but,

Melbourne Symphony Orchestra,"The sirens are screaming, and the fires are howling
Way down in the valley tonight.
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
And a blade shining oh so bright.
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky,
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets.
And down in the tunnels where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat.

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone.

[Chorus]
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes.
When the night is over, like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone, gone, gone.
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done
and the sun goes down
and the moonlight's shining through.
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you.

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver-black phantom bike.
When the metal is hot, and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light.
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole,
And everything is stunted and lost.
And nothing really rocks, and nothing really rolls,
And nothings ever worth the cost.

Well I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,
You know I want to be damned with you.
If I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night with you/
Well if I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned,
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night,
Dancing through the night,
Dancing through the night with you

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone.

[Chorus]

Well I can see myself tearing up the road
Faster than any other boy has ever gone.
And my skin is raw, but my soul is ripe,
And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape.
But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.

Then I'm down in the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun,
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike,
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.
And the last thing I see is my heart, still beating,
Breaking out of my body and flying away
Like a bat out of hell.

You got the kind of mind that does less than think

Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go

And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action

Is blowing down our bodies again

Coming on to give it to me

I was out on the prowl down by the edge of the track
And like a son of a jackal
I'm a leader of the pack but 
Every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go

Oh, baby, I'm a hunter in the dark of the forest
I've been stalking you and tracking you down
Cruising up and down the main drag all night long
We could be standing at the top of the world
Instead of sinking further down in the mud
You and me 'round about midnight
You and me 'round about midnight
Someone's got to draw first

Draw first
Someone's got to draw first blood
Someone's got to draw first blood
Oh I got to draw first blood

I was nothing but a lonely all-American boy
Looking out for something to do
And you were nothing but a lonely all-American girl
But you were something like a dream come true
I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block
And when I played my guitar I made the canyons rock
But every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow

Way down in the valley tonight
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
And a blade shining oh so bright
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky,
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets
And down in the tunnels where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone

Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes
When the night is over, like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes
But when the day is done
And the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver-black phantom bike
When the metal is hot, and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole,
And everything is stunted and lost
And nothing really rocks, and nothing really rolls,
And nothing's ever worth the cost

Well I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,
You know I want to be damned with you
If I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night with you/
Well if I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned,
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night,

Well I can see myself tearing up the road, faster
Than any other boy has ever gone
And my skin is raw, but my soul is ripe,
And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape
But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late

Then I'm down in the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun,
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike,
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell
And the last thing I see is my heart, still beating,
Breaking out of my body and flying away

And the harder you try and the longer you go

They're watching over me, they're watching over us all
You can send them home tonight, because you won't need them anymore
In your arms I think I've found the safest place to fall
When I step in the door and I stare at your face
There are so many things that I wish I could say
Well I struggle with words but they put up a fight
You can keep your mouth shut, because it doesn't really matter tonight

If I exercise my right
I will take your body language and hold it against you tonight

So many times I stumbled on the words I wanted to say
Then you say nothing at all
So many thoughts, that I should have just let my heart explain
Then you say nothing at all
So many ways we could turn the words around
Then you say nothing at all
So many nights our hearts came crashing to the ground
Then you say nothing at all
So many dreams that are finally coming true

What about your school?

What about your work?

What about your childhood?

As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
C'mon! Hold on tight!
Thought it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed

Cause we were barely dressed
And we were barely dressed
Baby doncha hear my heart
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun
And I gotta let you know
No you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well I want to make your motor run

And we were barely dressed
We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way
And tonight's the night

OK, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here, 
Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth, 
There's the windup, and there it is, 
A line shot up the middle, look at him go. 
This boy can really fly! 
He's rounding first and really turning it on now, 
He's not letting up at all, 
He's gonna try for second, the ball is bobbled out in center, 
And here comes the throw, and what a throw! 
He's gonna slide in head first, 
Here he comes, he's out! 
No, wait, safe-safe at second base, 
This kid really makes things happen out there. 
Batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch-he's going, 
And what a jump he's got, he's trying for third, 
Here's the throw, it's in the dirt-safe at third! 
Holy cow, stolen base! He's taking a pretty big lead out there, 
Almost daring him to try and pick him off. 
The pitcher glances over, winds up, and it's bunted, 
Bunted down the third base line, the suicide squeeze is on! 
Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close, 
Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it!

Stop right there!
I gotta know right now!
Before we go any further!

I couldn't take it any longer
Lord I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore that I would love you to the end of time!
So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time, so I can end my life with you!!

I was weak, but I never thought I'd speak about the darker site

Up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground in the middle of the night

I was laid upon the grave by a preacher's hand I cannot lie

And a Tempest made of fire, onset the sky aglow
And a sweet young thing called out my name
And this is how it goes, she says...
""Go boy, can you hear them?
Are you falling through the cracks in your eyes?""
And I got down on my knees

I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground and I'm falling back down

All the pain that you restrain keeps building up deep inside

There was fog crawling over the sand

And I was dying just to ask for a taste

Not another moment

Sometimes it's made for good sometimes for bad
But if we look behind us there's a wave coming down
Carrying us forward to a new age

What about the world around us
How can we fail to see
And now that our fathers have gone
And we've been left to carry on
What about the age of reason

So why can't we be still why can't we love each other
Is kindness an ancient skill buried by our blindness
And if we look behind us there's a wind blowing in
To create the age of reason

If we consider carefully the options put before us
So much wisdom so much love so much waiting for us
And if we look ahead there's the sun and the seasons

We have the chance, to turn the pages over
We can write what we want to write
We gotta make ends meet, before we get much older

We're all someone's son

Down the barrel of a gun?

You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear

‘I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies'

She's a gal who loves to see men suffer!

There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man!

Is like travelin' through Alaska in your BVDs.

Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world you never leave me
Fall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things ya do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter you'll never do me greasy

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you

Melendi,"Hoy voy a contar la historia 
Del arrepentido 
Que viviendo en la memoria 
Se perdió el camino 

Es hermano de ese que anda 
Siempre en el futuro 
Pasa temporadas largas 
Sordo, ciego y mudo 

Hoy voy a cantarte la canción 
Del arrepentido 

Si saltas vives 
Pero hay que saltar pa' 'dentro 
Y no hay parada de metro 
Que nos lleve a ese lugar 

Donde los miedos 
Se confunden con la vida 
Y no queda otra salida 
Que volvernos a encontrar 
Con el presente 

El que no lleva las cuentas pendientes 
Del más humilde hasta el más influyente 
El que te dice, oye Melen, pórtate bien 
Vamos pa' Oviedo que nos deja el tren 

Hoy voy a contar la historia 
Del que busca afuera 
Queriendo encontrar culpables 
Para sus problemas 

Ese que va por la vida 
Con la razón siempre 
Y no sabe que no existe 
Eso que defiende 

Hoy voy a cantarte la canción 
Del arrepentido 

Si saltas vives 
Pero hay que saltar pa' 'dentro 
Y no hay parada de metro 
Que nos lleve a ese lugar 

Donde los miedos 
Se confunden con la vida 
Y no queda otra salida 
Que volvernos a encontrar 
Con el presente 

Donde huyen a los fantasmas 
Y se ahogan las supersticiones 
Donde todo el mundo baila al ritmo 
De los corazones 

Ay donde todos los miedos, Carlos 
Se desaparecen 
Donde todas las tristezas se van 
Cuando me ven aparecer 

Si saltas vives 
Pero hay que saltar pa' 'dentro 
Y no hay parada de metro 
Que nos lleve a ese lugar 

Donde los miedos 
Se confunden con la vida 
Y no queda otra salida 
Que volvernos a encontrar 

Despierta, con cada segundo que pasa 
Se cierra una puerta 
En cada mirada perdida se muere un paisaje 
Que cada momento que vuela no vuelve 

Despierta, conecta 
Tu cuerpo mediante la mente 
La fuente 
Que mueve hasta lo que no ves 
Porque crees que es inerte 

Y así podrás al fin saber lo que grita el planeta 
Ya llego la hora de que miremos dentro 
Despierta",El  Arrepentido,

Cuando sale el sol 
Con cada mañana
 
Qué todo se apaga 
Pero que bonito es 
El saber que aún puedo comprender 
A qué he venido 
Porque sigo vivo 
Aunque no sé que soy 

Qué difícil es 
Aceptar que tengo miedo a todo 
Qué difícil es reconocerlo en su forma y modo 
Qué difícil es 
Intentar ser uno mismo 
Cuando estás en el abismo 
De saber que eres el todo 
Y la nada 

Si a la luna la llamamos luna
Y a la muerte muerte
Cómo puede ser
Que al mirarme en el espejo
No sepa quién es
Ese que me mira y no sabe que su pensamiento solo es
Una mezcla de barreras que ocultan su ser

Como el agua y el aceite

Y el tiempo se agota
Las horas son gotas
Que caen en un vaso
Que ha el paso que va
Siembran mi infinito
De escarcha y granito
En mi soledad

No pasa nada
Que sientes soledad
No pasa nada
Que tienes miedo a ser
No pasa nada
Que sufres sin porque
No pasa nada
Que no quieres mirar
No pasa nada
Que nunca pasará, ni pasa nada

En este Mundo de locos
Donde no somos pocos
Los que pensamos que no pertenecemos a él
Y que estamos aquí para recuperar alguna asignatura
Que se nos quedó pendiente
Me temo que es el amor esa cosa pendiente
Pues, según lo voy sintiendo
Más aleja el pensamiento de la ley de la materia
Convirtiendo en algo etereo mi vivir
Y olvidando al fin
Mi guerra personal por existir
Voy sintiendo que mis pasos
Nunca fueron mios del todo
Y quizás, tal vez el camino estuviera marcado
Y aunque torpe, siempre fui
Para ver, sin intereses
Impropios de un cantautor cuya casa es su canción
Y la vende sin dobleces
Que lindo maestro es la vida
Que te repite el examen hasta que por fin lo apruebes
Y si no es en esta vida
Lo haremos en la siguiente
Yo seré un alumno más, eternamente
Ahora que sé donde el amor mora
En el presente, en el ahora",Como El Agua Y El Aceite,

Déjala que baile en esta fiesta
Con la idea de liberarse de una moral impuesta
De no culpabilizarse por buscar la respuesta
Si tiene que casarse que sea con su protesta
Este solo es mi humilde modo de decir
Que aquel que busca un florero es que no cuida su jardín
Así que olvida todo lo aprendido y sal a bailar
Pues ninguna estrella pide permiso para brillar

No sé si fue por mi camisa a cuadros
Por mi colección de Star Wars

No sé si fue porque soy diferente

Así que, tranquilízate, tomate un café

Y mientras tanto navegando a la deriva
En el estrecho que separa tus dos pechos en patera

Si juntas en la vida
To' el amor y todas las penas
Recoge hasta el sol
Un saco de dulces condenas

Si el mago que yo era
Se ha quedado ya sin magia
Tranquila, yo te cazo
Al alzo si eso hiciera falta

Sientes que la vida es diferente, 
Que su mirada es tan ardiente, 
Como la leña en el fuego, 
La sal en la heridas, 
Cuatro filas bien seguidas 
A nuestra boda en el sol, 
Y ya no sé, 
Si por naturaleza 
O por todo lo que mi madre a luchó por mí­, 
Que ya no hay pájaros en mi cabeza, 
Ni castillos ni princesas, 
Ni aquella alergia a las fresas,
Ni recuerdo para ti­

Y todas las estrellas son de colores, 
Y desde mi ventana añoran los cantores, 
Desde aquella triste tarde que murió el arte con Lola Flores

Siempre una bonita canción 
Debe tener un bonito final, 
Puede ser alegre o tan triste 
Que nos haga llorar, 
Como llora ese angel en la trena, 
Que está cumpliendo condena, 
Por aplaudir cuando baila el viento 
Debajo de tu falda, 
Los celos y los amores 
Del que ayer no muere y mata

Y dijo un rey que el dinero 
No da la felicidad, 
Y yo digo que es una sensación tan parecida, 
Que por mucho que lo intento, 
Haga sol o sople el viento, 
Esté llorando, esté contento, 
No logro diferenciar

Melendi,"Me voy pal barrio, to' contento que la vida hoy me sonríe
Buscando que alguien me sirva y garantice
Que un mal pico no me la vaya a amargar

Voy por la sombra, porque al sol los bomboncitos se derriten
Y me gusta retener en la memoria
Esos culitos que me dan vueltas como una noria

Son de colores, como los peces, como las flores
Hay que será el encanto que tiene este barrio

Porque en moratala, la luna no se va
Hasta que encuentre al fofe
El fer está en el coche comiéndose la noche
Tatiro tiro viene y va

Porque en moratala, desde el vaco al bar del Chema
Que es la ruina que nos quema, pero da la libertad
Su gente es de verdad, sus aceras son sinceras
Así es moratala

Y aquí en el zeta, los domingos de resaca se superan
Contando los años como primaveras
Y a mí me faltan tantos añitos como al que mas

Y ahí llega el David, va partiéndose una caja imaginaria
Pues la noche fue tan dura como larga
Y con nosotros Dios en patrones no se arruino

Son de colores, como los peces, como las flores
Hay que será el encanto que tiene este barrio

Porque en moratala la luna no se va
Hasta que encuentre al fofe
El fer está en el coche comiéndose la noche
Tatiro, tatiro, tiro Viena y va

Porque en moratala, desde el vaco al bar del Chema
Que es la ruina que nos quema, pero da la libertad
Su gente es de verdad, sus aceras son sinceras
Así es moratala

Melendi,"Ella, sólo quería ser la reina de mis besos 
Me hizo nombrar caballero de los traviesos 
Me hizo olvidar un segundo la realidad 
Ella, único vicio comparable a la botella 
Mi única estancia con amor en un hostal 
La única reina con corona de alquitrán 
La única rana que nadie supo besar 

Ella es la mujer pantera que cruzó en patera 
Las olas del mar y dio la vida entera 
Por un segundo de libertad

De aquella fortaleza y de aquella bruja 
Que todo el mundo llama madama

Ella, vive en el 13 de la calle Magdalena 
Muere más de mil veces al día de pena 
Pero no llora por temor a naufragar

Voy cantando por la carretera 
De copiloto llevo el sol.

Q me lleve hasta tu portal 
Como ayer estaba borracho 
Fui tirando migas de pan 
 
Voy camiando por la vida, sin pausa, pero sin prisas 
Procurando no hacer ruido, vestio con una sonrisa, sin complejo ni temores, 
Canto rumbas de colores 
Why el llorar no me hare daño siempre (y) cuando tu no llores 
 
Why el milindri a mi me llaman 
En el mundillo calé 
Porque al coger mi guitarra 
Se me van solos los pies. 
 
Why este año le pido al cielo ( ay vamonos) 
La salud del anterior. 
No necesito dinero, 
Voy sobrao en el amor.

Why no quiero amores, no correspondidos 
No quiero guerras 
No quiero amigos 
Que no me quieran sin mis galones

Ni falsas miradas de inexpresion 
Que no dicen nada 
Del corazón que me las propone

Más loco que de atar
Dibujo corazones
Después de echar mi aliento
En los cristales de tu voz

Y vuelvo a respirar
Tu aire y mis pulmones
Se llenan de la vida que me quitas
Al andar en otras direcciones
De las que sigo yo

Que pronto me olvidaste

No entiendo lo que has visto
En aquel tipo del chaqué
Si cuando se lo quita sus principios
No hacen pie, no hacen pie
No hacen pie y yo estoy
Completamente loco

Loco, borracho, perdido
Tan enamorado de ti y de mis vicios
Tirado en alguna cuneta en la meta
De la soledad

Y ya no se, camino del revés
De cara a la pared
Están mis sentimientos castigados
Sin saber, que por mirar pa' atrás
Tú no vas a volver y sigo torturando
A mi cabeza por tu piel

Si estoy en carne viva
No me tires alcohol, cúrame con saliva

No hacen pie, no hacen pie
No hacen pie y yo estoy

De tu corazon 
Y a veces cae la noche y me desvelo 
Casi al mismo tiempo que pierdo yo el sueño

Y por amarte tanto, muero yo

A una dama con la moral distraída

Y en la acera de enfrente dos policías 
Disfrazados de secreta
O es lo que ellos interpretan
Observando la jauría

Y la luna brindando por ellas
Las mas bellas, las botellas
Y las noches pasando de todo 
Y los coches picándose quemando ruedas

Y en el baño, más disparos 
Que en un espagueti western 
Y los gatos más que pardos
Son celestes

En la esquina de la barra
Puestos hay dos caraduras
Que de cada cinco copas 
Solamente pagan una

Su amiga la camarera
Es una adicta a la anestesia 
Le suele pagar en carne 
Lo que la dan en especies

Y un gitano que se llevan detenido 
Grita desesperado: ""se han confundido
Agente soy inocente, el que usted está buscando 
Lleva raya al otro lado""

Y la luna brindando por ellas
Las mas bellas, las botellas
Y las noches pasando de todo 
Y los coches picándose quemando ruedas

Y en el baño, más disparos 
Que en un espagueti western 
Y los gatos más que pardos
Son celestes

Y los tejados llenos de gatos celestes
Unos huyen de si mismos 
Y otros huyen de la gente 
Porque nadie les comprende

Dios los cría y ellos se juntan por los callejones 
Para contarse batallas de heridas de amores
Maquillando sus historias de imaginaciones

Y la luna brindando por ellas
Las mas bellas, las botellas
Y las noches pasando de todo 
Y los coches picándose quemando ruedas

Y en el baño, más disparos 
Que en un espagueti western 
Y los gatos más que pardos
Son celestes",Gatos Celestes,2012
Melendi,"Si mi corazón aun no se viste solo
Es porque no ha encontrado a su medio limón
Lucha en los asaltos que manda la vida
Vive con cien gatos en un callejón
Y en el horizonte de mi pecho en llamas
Soy un superman que busca tu cabina
El sujeto de quien no llora no mama
Una puta con horario de oficina

Y puse tus recuerdos a remojo
Y flotan porque el agua esta salada
Salada porque brotan de mis ojos
Lagrimas desordenadas
No pienses que estoy loco
Por vivir a mi manera
Voy a pasarme todo el día bebiendo
Y por la noche, pegado a una botella

Si mi corazón sigue de calavera
Es porque aun no ha aprendido a disimular
Cada vez que ve paseando tus caderas
Se le caen las llaves al fondo del bar
Y en el horizonte de mi pecho en llamas
Soy un superman que busca tu cabina
El sujeto de quien no llora no mama
Una puta con horario de oficina

Y puse tus recuerdos a remojo
Y flotan porque el agua esta salada
Salada porque brotan de mis ojos
Lagrimas desordenadas
No pienses que estoy loco
Por vivir a mi manera
Voy a pasarme todo el día bebiendo
Y por la noche pegado a una botella

Y he plantado un jardín de la alegría
Para hacer mas divertidos mis días
Y he soñado que dormía entre tus piernas
Y he dejado el sueño patas arriba

Y puse tus recuerdos a remojo
Y flotan porque el agua esta salada
Salada porque brotan de mis ojos
Lagrimas desordenadas
No pienses que estoy loco
Por vivir a mi manera
Voy a pasarme todo el día bebiendo

Melendi,"Mi primer beso fue
Más bien tarde que pronto
Tenía 16 y ese bigotillo tonto
Ella se me acerco
Menos mal porque si lo tengo que hacer yo
Quizás aún estaría, más virgen que maría
Pero a todos nos llega el momento
Donde no hay otra salida

Ella me dijo: ""Espero que eso sea el móvil""
Cuando empezaron a temblar mis pantalones
Y yo le dije: ""no cariño, eso es mi hombría
Que lleva 16 añitos escondida"" 
Camino a casa paramos en 100 portales 
Y pude desabrocharle tan solo un par de botones

Por eso cuando fui a mear 
No os podéis imaginar 
Que dolor dentro de cartera
Cuando llego un municipal diciéndome
""pero chaval, qué haces meándote en la acera""
Ella tardo 5 segundos en decirle al policía
""nisiquiera lo conozco""
Exactamente lo mismo que tarde yo 
En guardar mi china disimulando en su bolso

Mi primer beso fue 
Algo contradictorio
Es verdad, hubo placer
Y un dolor de mil demonios
Pues yo jamás pensé 
Que dolería tanto la primer vez
Que quedas más caliente
Que el tipo del tridente
Y por fin llego el duro momento 
De la triste despedida

Ella me dio un teléfono para llamarla 
Y resulto ser el de un restaurante chino
Y cuando llamé preguntando por Yolanda 
Y un chino me leyó las clases de arroz frito
Empezaron a salir rallos y centellas 
Encima de mi cabeza, como si en una viñeta
Viviera triste y desolado con el único consuelo 
De haberte tocado las narices
Cuando tu padre descubrió en tu bolso 
Un sospechoso olor llegado de bajos países
Al fin de semana siguiente
Cuando nos vimos de frente
No quiso ni saludarme
Cuando le dije picaresco
""Nena, yo soy tu refresco
Agítame antes de usarme""

Y así como empezó mi andadura en el amor
Lo peor es que pasa el tiempo y no he mejorado mucho
Sigo siendo aquel niño flacucho
Lo que sí es verdad, es que no he vuelto a besar 
Ni lo volveré a hacer jamás con los ojos cerrados
Eso es solo para enamorados que pasan la vida en babia",Mi Primer Beso,2012
Melendi,"Sabia que era algo malo lo que aquel cabrón hacía 
Pero por miedo, rabia, nunca se atrevía 
A compartir la situación
Dolía más en su mente que en su cuerpo 
Y en la vergüenza del silencio 
Se marchito su corazón

Las otras niñas no jugaban 
Al mismo juego que jugaba Lyss 
Las otras no se desnudaban 
Ni les contaban los lunares 
Ni amanecían sus sabanas
Lagrimitas de sangre

La tortura de Lyss era su padre 
Más que padre, una cruz 
Más que cruz, el dolor 
Que vieron las paredes de aquella habitación
La tortura de Lyss

Creía que después de la noche oscura llega el día 
Pero en su caso nunca se cruzo el ocaso 
Nadie escucho su desnudez
Dolía más en su mente que en su cuerpo

Lo sabe desde el momento en que la ve

Durmiendo en la misma cama
Separados por el hielo
De hacer la compra en la farmacia
Sonreirle a la desgracia
Boxeando con los celos

Son el demonio que me tiene hablando solo

Soy el capitan de este barco roto
Soy el gilipollas que te sabe a poco
Soy el corazón bastardo de cupido
Que alejas del tuyo con cada latido

Soy como un satélite orbitando un cuerpo
Que siempre se enfría en el mismo momento
Soy tan solo el viento
Que ya no despeina el eco de tu voz

Como si fuera robado

De esconderme en el armario

No sé que hacer ni decir para despertarlo

Melendi,"Yo estaba vestido de Habanero 
Tú dijiste adiós con la mirada 
Mientras que sonaba un tan Romeo 
En un balcón de la vieja Habana 

No hay nada más perro que el amor 
Porque muerde siempre antes que ladra 
Me latió tan fuerte el corazón 
Me dijiste ""ven"" desde la barra 

Y yo te dije ""niña te invito un mojito"" 
Tú me dejaste clarito que la cosa no iba así (oye la cosa no va así) 
Y fue entonces cuando le pedí a la virgen 
De la caridad del pobre que intercediera por mí (ay que intercediera por mi) 
De repente, tú cambiaste de semblante 
Me empezaste a ver galante, yo te dije ""eres mi atril"" 
Fuimos sólo dos extraños y han pasado ya diez años 

Mi amor propio se quedó en los huesos 
Que pinga contigo, me dijiste 
Dejó de sonar el tal Romeo 
Le llegó el turno a Silvio Rodríguez 
Y a lomos de un unicornio azul 
Te perdiste por el malecón 
Yo me hice la señal de la cruz 
Tú no me dejaste otra elección 

Y yo te dije ""niña te invito un mojito"" 
Tú me dejaste clarito que la cosa no iba así (oye la cosa no va así) 
Y fue entonces cuando le pedí a la virgen 
De la caridad del pobre que intercediera por mi (ay que intercediera por mi) 
De repente, tú cambiaste de semblante 
Me empezaste a ver galante, yo te dije ""eres mi atril"" 
Luego por fin bailamos, yo prometí no pisarte 
Tú eras cien libras de arte y me empezaste a acalorar (tú me empezaste a acalorar) 
Me volviste, mi amor loco de remate 
Tus labios de chocolate, me invitaron a pecar (ay me invitaron a pecar) 
Y me dijiste ""no todas somos iguales"" 
Y mis manos ilegales comenzaron a temblar 
Fuimos sólo dos extraños y han pasado ya 10 años

Desde que estamos juntos
Porque volví a buscarte 
Yo te pedí perdón, me hiciste arrodillarme 
Desde que estamos juntos
Mi cielo, el de tu boca 
Y a cinco bajo cero sigue estorbando la ropa 
Desde que estamos juntos
Me muero por tus pecas 
Me licencié en tus piernas y en tu piel tengo una beca 
Desde que estamos juntos
Me ando quitando el sombrero 
Que del melocotón ardiente como el ron, mi dulce flor de enero 
Desde que estamos juntos
Oye que Cuba es Cuba y lo demás boberias 
Aay con frecuencia cubana, Melendi llegó a la Habana 
Desde que estamos juntos
Ay por Dios, se formo tremendo lío

Melendi,"Ella iba caminando sola por la calle 
Pensando ""Dios, qué complicado es esto del amor"" 
Se preguntó así misma cuál habrá sido el detalle 
Que seguro Cupido malinterpretó

El daba como cada noche vueltas en la cama 
Sonó de pronto una canción romántica en la radio 
Quizá fue Michael Bolton quien metió el dedo en la llaga 

Y como le faltaba el sueño fui a buscarlo 

Los dos estaban caminando en el mismo sentido 
Y no hablo de la dirección errante de sus pasos 
Él la miro, ella contestó con un suspiro 
Y el universo conspiró para abrazarlos 

Dos extraños bailando bajo la luna 
Se convierten en amantes al compás 
De esa extraña melodía
Que algunos llaman destino 
Y otros prefieren llamar casualidad 

Uh

Y él le preguntó al oído ""Mi amor, ¿dónde estabas? 
Durante todo el tiempo que yo tanto te busqué"" 
Ella le contesto ""Lo siento, es que estuve ocupada
Aunque para serte sincera, ahora no entiendo en qué"" 

La noche se hizo día, pero no se fue la luna 
Se quedo a verlos apoyada en el hombro del sol 
Alúmbrales con fuerza, brilla todo el día 
Y cuando llegue la noche yo sellaré su pasión 

Dos extraños bailando bajo la luna 
Se convierten en amantes al compás 
De esa extraña melodía
Que algunos llaman destino 
Y otros prefieren llamar, casualidad 

Y bailan 
Sin que les importe nada que suceda alrededor 
Y bailan 
Y la gente que les miran va creyendo en el amor

It's not very nice
Fool's paradise, you better think twice
It's not very nice

Bright lights and big cities
Don't go to my baby's head
You know I love you, baby
But you choose this life instead

So just remember what cha momma told you
Before she sent you on your way
She told never ever be too clever
To not see your own mistakes

I'll be here waiting for you
When you come off your trip
And I guess I will always be the one
To bring you back from your busy, busy, baby

Fool's paradise, you better think twice
It's not very nice
Fool's paradise, you better think twice
It's not very nice

I'll be here waiting for you
When you come off your trip
And I guess I will always be the one
To bring you back from your busy, busy, baby

Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

You know something about cocaine? Digame!
You kidding me or what man?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday, new guys
They said they got two keys for us, openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there

My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it, good me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh

Meliah Rage,"In the top of the trees all these eyes follow me.
All is black, like the crows, stiff my neck as it bows.
On my knees I will play among death and decay,
And it blackens the sun as the end has begun.

I never saw the mighty spirits
That gathered now to purity the world.
It is the time of the changing season,
The cleaning hands of water. Wind and fire - feel the fire.

Winter rides the wings of heaven
Sorrow marches through the land.
This is the beginning of the end.

And the flood rises higher, swallows cities alive.
Still the flames' hunger grows, taking over our homes.
In the eye of the storm, gods creation reborn.
666 in our hearts, it will tear us apart.

This is the age of the sunlight children
And from the ashes we'll build it up again.
The curtain of the night will fall down
And stronger, wiser than before we'll stand - take my hand.

Winter rides the wings of heaven
Sorrow marches through the land.
This is the beginning of the end.
Darkness covers lonely faces,
Merciful death takes their hand.

Where have I been
All these years invisible
Too much, too little, too late
My life, an illusion
Of shadows in the dark
How can I reason

Oh lord I believe
Oh lord I receive
All I can say
Is except my belief
Pray to the son
My hallowed one
All I can say is
Accept me your son

Soon life will pass
Confusion frustration
This anger drives me mad
Now searching for a feeling
Of strength, now I pray

To evil worlds beyond man

When seas ran red with blood

And dance in the darkness

From the book of the dead
They prey on your mortal soul
And take you to dwell in hell

This book is said to speak
Of a spiritual presence that reaps
Evil that roams in vain
In the forest and dark, bowers of man's domain
Recital of passages
They possess the living, to feed their dead
Evil confrontate
The things that were shall be again

And dance in the darkness

Evil dead decapitate
Bodies bleed reincarnate
Demons scream abominate
Witches hang in levitate
The chant you speak controls your fate
Dead by dawn, they laugh and wait
Evil dead will take you now
Evil dead will take you down

An open passageway
To evil worlds beyond man
Swallow your soul they say
To the world it came and death began
Final passage never spoke
Dark spirits and souls now ascend
Your life is twisted sucked away
Swallow your soul end your fate

Stygian shores now appear
She rises up from her grave
She came back, death day

The witching - lives are burning tonight
The witching - souls are burning tonight

The room below, her grave to be
Buried alive for centuries
A book of magic holds the key
The rhymes and verses have set her free

Your flesh burns, slaughters here
Stygian shores have appeared
She rose up from her grave
She came back it's your day
You're spellbound, frozen in fear
Her wicked ways cast you there
The pain and torment a smothered life
Damned and cursed, she takes your life

De que me sirve prender fuego
Si para ti sólo es un juego

El brillo de tus ojos me hipnotizó
Y por poco caigo presa en tu trampa de amor, umm no, no

Flotaba a un metro de la realidad hoy

He wants to add to the family tree

He wants at least two or three

He?s been waiting impatiently

For me to add to the family tree

There?s lots of hugs and kissing everything is oh so sweet

But he says there?s something missing, the pitter patter of little feet

He?s positively clucky like a rooster in a chicken house

Dirty nappies on the line, coochie cooing all the time

Does he know what he?s talking about

He wants to add to the family tree

He wants at least two or three

He?s been waiting impatiently

For me to add to the family tree

He came home with a boot load of stuff to paint the spare room blue

Lego and some play dough and a Bob the builder tool box too

He?s oh so gung ho, guess it?s time for me to face the fact

I?ll be feet up on the couch with a Joey in my pouch

Getting ready for an broken back

He wants to add to the family tree

He wants at least two or three

He?s been waiting impatiently

For me to add to the family tree

Dirty nappies on the line, coochie cooing all the time

I guess doesn?t sound so bad if he?s cute and cuddly

And looks a little bit like me with more hair than his dad

At a roadhouse an hour outta Rocky

She said ""You look like you need a cup of coffee""

""Pull up a chair, I'll be over in a jiffy"",

Really made me feel at home

And how she wouldn't change her life for quids

I was thinking how lucky she is

To be so satisfied with her lot in life

I tried to change it but I was having trouble

When a truckie with a two day stubble

Said ""Need a hand there love?""

We got talking 'bout life on the road

And how he loves his country radio

He said ""Hey aren't you that Beccy Cole?""

I said ""Yeah something like that""

And signed ""Love Beccy"" on his hat

Pales in comparison

Fireflies that dance on the night

Weeping willows and perfect rainbows

Damn I feel an inner air you will not still here
There ain't an us or a we or I'm a thing
Its a good bad karma thing
Its a song and an honest thing
I swear I feel something honestly",Feel It in the Air,2005
Melissa,"Quédate un poquito más
Todavía no es hora de abordar
Escucha estas palabras como despedida

Por qué no quieres explicarme
Por qué dejaste de amarme
O acaso todo siempre fue una mentira

Por que yo, si bien me he equivocado
Tenía la certeza que mi sitio era a tu lado
Y hasta hoy así cumplí

Pero a ti se te olvidó que prometiste
Que nunca me dejarías
Que sin mí no había razón para seguir viviendo, no
Se te olvidó que prometiste
Amarme hasta el final del tiempo
En las buenas y en las malas
Me darías tu calor
Se te olvidó que me robaste el corazón

Me dices que no hay marcha atrás
Incompatible a mí siempre serás
Y que no tenemos en común ninguna meta

Si es así que quede claro
Que todo esto se habría evitado
Si tú me hubieras siempre hablado con la neta

Por que yo, si bien me he equivocado
Tenia la certeza que mi sitio era a tu lado
Ya lo ves que sí cumplí

Pero a ti se te olvidó que prometiste
Que nunca me dejarías
Que sin mí no había razón para seguir viviendo, no

Aplausos señor
Bravo, bravo, bravo
Caray ya se está acabando este MTV Unplugged
Ya se está acabando
Muy bien, ahora vamos a empezar a terminar, desgraciadamente
Quiero por favor presentar a un guerrero de esta vida
Alguien que es un verdadero ejemplo para todos los que estamos en este negocio
Y que es uno de mis mejores amigos
Y que lo felicito, y que estoy muy orgulloso de él
Sinceramente, me enorgullezco de ser su amigo
Esta noche, con ustedes, en este escenario

Melissa Auf der Maur,"Feel me
Sneaking around again
Am I hanging around again
Can't you see
That my heart lies
My heart lies to you
I followed the waves to you
I've got to see it through
That My heart lies to you
Never have me true
(I lie I lie)
Please don't
Please don't make ammends
See me 
See me slip again
Break my heart
Carve the fate
Seal the deal
My heart lies

My heart lies to you
I followed the waves to you
I've got to see it through
That my heart lies to you
You'll never have me true
I followed the waves to you
I've got to see it through
That my heart lies to you
I'll never stay with you
Between my fire sighs 
And my burning eyes
My heart burns wildly in his eyes

And I, fall around the fire 
A higher me for you, 
Hire me for you 

Fall around town, down 
For the rest of the world to drown 
For you'll come down 
To the rest of your falling down, 

On your head 
Falling down 
With your head unbound 
I'm falling down 

Down to your ground 
Fall around town, down 
For the rest of the world to drown 
For you'll come down 

To the rest of your falling down, 
On your head 
And I said you could hurt me 
No more, 

With your heart on the floor 
I said you could hurt me no more

That you will hurt me no more 

To the rest of the world, 
You're surely hurting more

Melissa Auf der Maur,"In the last decade of the 20th century 
An event occurred in the lived and minds 
Of a random few 
It was an event of magical momentum 

A building was erected 
To house a dream of many 
3 dimensional sound 
For these people 

Who made sound their lives, 
This was a day of life changing quality 
It was loud!! 

I need I want I will 
Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on 

Into the triangular parlot they went, 
The music entered them, 
Through their skin, 
Into their blood, 

Following their heart beat 
The music became them 
And they became it 
Off they went following a dirt desert path, 

A brand new beginning for lovers of sound, 
They had to pass it on 
I need I want I will 

I need I want I will 
Pass it on, 
Pass it on, 
Pass it on 

The journey was not easy for them 
On their path there was an obstactle 
Down came the rain 
And the H.R. Giger crane, 

It all tried to stop them 
However they found the will 
To find their way back home 
To pass it on 

I had a dream, I pass it on 
I had a dream, I pass it on",I Need I Want I Will,2004
