Scary Kids Scaring Kids,"If I flew into a mountain, burn myself to nothing
There would be something, would it be enough?
A pistol to my temple, pull the trigger like it's nothing
There would be something but it's never enough

This is all an illusion
What do you take me for?

It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just won't ever be enough

I hurt someone that loved you except that I felt nothing
That would be something, would it be enough?
I had everything you wanted, it shows to give you nothing
That would be something, this is all too much

This is all an illusion
What do you take me for?

It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just won't ever be enough
It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just won't ever be enough

I'm burning alive
With a pistol to my temple

If we don't believe this reason for living
Then we'll never know, do I wanna know?
If we don't believe this reason for living
Then we'll never know, do I wanna know?
If we just give up, give into the pressure
We're losing it all, we're losing control

It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just won't ever be enough
It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just won't ever be enough
(Would I give it all for you?)",A Pistol to My Temple,2007
Scary Kids Scaring Kids,"I've grown tired of the same old story
I think I'm ready for a change
If there's a higher power up there watching over me
Would you give me a sign today?

'Cause I've grown tired, I've grown tired
Now I'm ready for a change, change
",The Power of Resolution,2007
Scary Kids Scaring Kids,"Through a stranger's eyes
I take a good look at my life
Only to find that I'm not living
I'm not alive

I wanna live to tell the tale
I wanna wake up before my ship sets sail
Don't wanna try to be anyone else
I just wanna try to find myself

We all go, life could end in an instant
We all just disappear
So let me put this into perspective
Let me make this clear

I wanna live to tell the tale
I wanna wake up before my ship sets sail
Don't wanna try to be anyone else
I just wanna try to find myself

I've grown tired of the same old fucking story
I think I'm ready for a change
If there's a higher power up there watching over me
Could you give me a sign today, today?
'Cause I've grown tired, I've grown tired
I think I'm ready for a change

I wanna live to tell the tale
I wanna wake up before my ship sets sail
Don't wanna try to be anyone else
I wanna find myself, I wanna find my self

I wanna wake up
(I wanna find myself)
I just wanna wake up
(I wanna find myself)
",Set Sail,2007
Scary Kids Scaring Kids,"All systems go, this one, she's outta control
She lost a breath, I think she fell off the edge
She's sinks her teeth in, there's no letting go
We all come to find she's just a snake, a snake devil

This is not a full discussion
Now you're a thing of the past
And I won't live to see the sunrise

She says I want you to know before you let me go
It's your faul, I'm demoralized
But I won't let what she says go to my head
No, not again

She's taking over the world one heart at a time
She'll chew you up and spit you out like nothing
Well, it's not her problem, well now we know
She's nothing more than just a snake, a snake devil

I won't live to see the sunrise
It's just a matter of time, only a matter of time
And I won't live to see the sunrise

She says I want you to know before you let me go
It's your fault I'm demoralized
But I won't let what she says go to my head
No, not again

And I won't live to see the sunrise
No, I'd rather just die than listen to your lies
No, I won't live to see the sunrise

You've already done the damage
You're a thing of the past
She's a snake devil

You've already done the damage
You're a thing of the past
She's a snake devil

You've already done the damage
You're a thing of the past
She's just a snake devil

You've already done the damage
You're a thing of the past
She's a snake devil
You've already done the damage

Scary Kids Scaring Kids,"Star crossed lovers, they say we're not meant to be
'Cause the stars in the sky and the fashion that they are aligned
I say if the future's been drawn out there's no point in living
I won't give up my love so that fate can have it's way

If the stars say that you couldn't love me
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth
Don't ask my permission, all is forgiven

Star crossed lovers, we do what we want to
Some learn the hard way, we all learn through consequence
I say if the future's been drawn out then nobody's living
I won't give you up, love, so fate can have it's way, it's way

If the stars say that you couldn't love me
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth
Don't ask my permission, all is forgiven

Is it over?
(The stars keep this fire from burning out)
Is it over?
(Are you saying that you'd really listen?)

Is it over?
(The stars keep this fire)
Is it over?
(The stars keep this fire)

If the stars say that you couldn't love me
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth

If the stars say that you cannot love me",Star Crossed,2007
Scary Kids Scaring Kids,"This silence keeps it easy
Keeps you safe for the moment
As you're walking away
Your footsteps get louder
All you needed was time
But now time will destroy us

It will all be over and here we are
We're stuck inside this salted earth together
You pierce my lungs
My limbs go numb as my colors fade out

You watch me bleed
You watch me bleed

I gave you everything to die with a smile
All you wanted was to live for a while
You took everything but it left you empty
You can't replace me, you can't

It's almost over and here we are
We're stuck inside this salted earth together
You pierce my lungs
My limbs go numb as my colors fade out

You watch me bleed
You watch me bleed

It will all be over and here we are
We'll die inside this salted earth together
You pierce my lungs
My limbs go numb as my colors fade out

You watch me bleed
You watch me bleed
You watch me bleed
You watch me bleed
Watch me bleed",Watch Me Bleed,2007
Scary Kids Scaring Kids,"Stand up
You know you have the right too
Speak up
For the things that you believe
And we lift off
They will stab you 
In the back over again
Take your integrity

[Chorus]
How long will you let this go on
They're drowning you in fear

Speak up
Your voice should stand in breaking through
It's time now
It's gone on way too long
As we lift off
They will tear you into little pieces
I think there is something wrong

[Chorus]

You're letting your hopes 
Go straight to hell
And I know the end is near
Is near

The time will come
The time will come
The time will come
You will be sorry for what you've done
The time will come

[Chorus]

You're letting your hopes 
Go straight to hell
And I know the end is near
Is near
You say you're sorry

Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us Notorious
Thug ass niggaz that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggaz be scramblin, gamblin
Up in restaraunts with mandolins, and violins
We just sittin here tryin to win, tryin not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily countin them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since ninety-two
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you know who
Fuck a few female stars or two
Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like Mike, shit
not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick, cause
Me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo' game, talk yo' shit
Grab yo' gat, call yo' click
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggaz I got ta fight one
All them hoes I got ta like one

Bone and Big, nigga die slowly

Shit, lyrically, niggaz can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke
Cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin it

Goodfellas down to the Mo Thugs dudes
Who's the killa, me or you?

And a forty-five indeed will beam

You willin to die, we'll see
how many flees when I cause the scene
We mean mug, Mo Thugs
Trained to be perfect, disciples
When it's survival tongue, never double-edged sword
Triple, six rivals spittin fire
This the real truth, bitch
Breakin out for lies
My Messiahs better be ready for Armageddeon shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child
The one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Claire
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender never no surrender no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand
One of my trusted friend friend, hey
Open it let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin
Baby we ain't marchin we shootin
In daily recruitin there's a tough law
Everyday in the ghetto
We start em off little we give em a bottle
and a pen and a pad to hit the label kick it

Nigga roll wit Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome wit a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck son gimme that Mossberg swerve
Up into my bag, cause I gotta get my mask and shells
to put in this twelve gauge sawed off
Get em all off, nigga yo' loss, take it all off
Got a nigga car door
But the Bone not Leatherface, too many are thinkin they Thugs
They need the most help to pull it in doves
And bitch if you stickin we buckin them guzzlers, fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But Willie be servin em clemency
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talkin
like gimme back me money
Thuggin with me killers, need us a leader
or liquor but niggaz ain't got shit
Wit a sawed off pump chrome thirty-eight pistol
Now who ready to get bent

Scatman Crothers,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Hey you!
If anybody's home, I'm trying to get through
With a story for you.
There's a monster out there and it really
Doesn't care what you say what you do
If you're young or you're grey.
Hey you!
You can take it from me.
I was talking that talk 'til I was 43.
I was walking in a web that was to thick
To shed, and it was only by degrees that I
Was brought to my knees.
Justification was my mode of operation,
Looking good number one on my list.
Trapped in a circle of a merry-go-round,
I couldn't get up getting down.
The things that I was doing was all I ever known,
I didn't know that I was driven by delusion to the
Bone.

But you really need a teacher, here it is.

Hey You!
Don't beat yourself up, be gentle with yourself
'cause there ain't nobody else, and it isn't
Your fault and I know it seems bleak,
And you're only in this u-turn 'til you meet defeat.

Hey You!
You can take it from me, there's more going down
Than you and I can ever see.
There's a tale being told and the water's all
Around, there's a brand new day. Get the heck out of
Your way.

I never let you tell me that I wanted to hear,
When you said it like it was, it never got to
My ears.

My behavior underneath was completely insane.
Kept playing those games with a saturated brain.
I never thought I had to go as far as I did,
I had to leave home and abandon a kid.

We can change with the seasons, no matter what the weather
Where we could be in harmony, together every day

Accepting you without the need to change the way you are

Both of us together through the sad and the good
Totally devoted as lovers and friends

Said, 'Won't you come and be my lover?' 
'Let me give you a little kiss' 
And he came, knelt down before him 
And fell upon his knees 
Said, 'I will give you gold and mountains 
If you stay awhile with me' 
And there was trouble taking place. 
There inside the garden 
They kissed, and the sun rose 
And he walked a little further 
And he found he was alone 
And the wind, it gathered round him 
He was thinking of his sins 
He was looking at his song-bird 
And he was looking at his wings 
And there was trouble taking place",The Garden,2005
Scatterbrain,"My mama's talkin' to me
She tells me how to live
But I don't listen to her
'Cause my head is like a sieve

My daddy he disowned me
'Cause I wear my sisters clothes
He caught me in the bathroom
With a pair of pantyhose

The basketball coach
Done kicked me off the team
For wearing hi-heel sneakers
And acting like a queen

The world's coming to an end
And I don't even care
As long as I can have my limo
And my long blond hair

And it don't bother me
If people think I'm funny
'Cause I'm a big rock star
And I make a lot of money

I'm so bloody rich
I own apartment buildings
Shopping centers, condominiums
And I only know three chords
You fools, watch me now

What's the matter, sleepwalking with out a clue?
Get real, here's the deal,

A good time, another stupid rhyme
Hell-bent on pleasure, that's no crime
Get wild, act like a child,
You gotta get loose every once-in-a-while
Get down, jump around
Run wild in the streets, all through the town.

You to get with Mr. Swift or Rift,

The man of the hour, tower of power 
I'll devour

You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;

Scenes from a Movie,"Listen up and listen close
Okay, so maybe I wasn't clear enough
With the words that I chose
Now I'm asking you, I'm begging you
Just so everyone knows
Or daring you to say something original
Give it up and oh, I know words are failing you
But sweetie, sometimes that's just how it goes
Matching words and matching phrases count the days
Because the battle might be done
But the war is well on its way
The war is well on its way
Oh, I know you feel it too

Now I'm watching you dig your hole
And it looks more like a grave
It's just a theory or so I'm told
There will be nobody left here to save you
Well, ask me how I'm so matter of fact
Well, the matter of the fact is just a matter of tact
There will be nobody left here to save you

Taste the poison on your lips
All right, now fill it up and drink it down
You know it's sealed with a kiss
Oh, I know just what you're thinking
And you know it wasn't me
Oh, I know just what I'm thinking and maybe you'll finally see
It's the poison we forget
It's behind you to remind you how little you will be missed
Saving faith in situations very similar to this
Now find out how quickly your words will be dismissed
Oh, you are dismissed
Oh, I know you feel it too

Hey, you'd never know it
But the end will leave you breathless and broken
Don't you change
No, don't you make it seem like you could care
Now I don't believe a word you say",Save You,2007

Sa che sti soldi non valgono niente per me
Vuole toccare le nuvole come su un jet, ma solamente con me
E sa che non avevo nulla, no
Sa che mi prenderò tutto sì, prima o poi
Mi teneva i contanti nella Louis Vuitton
Sporchi contanti, no, che non facevan per noi 
Un giorno saremo ricchi fidati di me

Non più da Google Maps, su un volo Emirates

Le hall et l'escalier, le parking et les caves, les préaux, les fauteuils
Les flingues à la buvette, l'héroïne, les épaves
Le ciel est rouge et gris, on reprend, on découpe, on emballe, on écoule
Un flash devant l'alim', un taxiphone sur écoute, au moins une mère à l'abri
Ils sont morts pour des doutes, pas l'intime conviction
Des fois les doutes suffisent, rogatoire commission, les PGP séduisent
Les couilles, la condition, l'époque et l'ambition, j'suis seul sur l'addition
Y a ton équipe qui cotise ou t'as mis des millions?
La drogue, la soumission, la banque dans un buisson
J'ai rien d'bien reluisant mais j'ai ramené trois CZ
J'apporte mes solutions, c'est ça nan, hein?
Temps à la neige, nuancé ouais l'ciel est bas
Le froid, l'tranchant, le mistral, on passe d'XP à Vista

Je les ken et je les tej', dis-moi quelle devise a pris mon âme
Dans tes yeux, j'ai vu la flamme, j'fais un disque et je l'éteins
Elle sait qu'on finit dans l'sang, j'lui fais des bisous pour la rassurer
La rue, j'ai une vue d'ensemble, elle sait qu'on y a tous un intérêt
Tit-pe, dix g dans l'jean, des clients du soir à la matinée
On prend, on vend on s’enlise, un Glock, on fait pas des sports combinés
Tu vas plus chanter si j'ferme mes robinets

Schandmaul,"Und ich hoffe und ich lache
Und ich laufe und ich lebe,
Ich hoffe und ich lache,
Und ich laufe und bin frei.

Unbeschwert war's,
Als mein Leben begann,
Als Sohn, wohlgeboren,
Eines fürstlichen Mannes,
Hell waren die Tage
Und friedlich die Nacht,
Bevor dieser Krieg
Uns die Not hat gebracht.

Besiegt word' der Herr,
Dem wir Treue geschworen
Wir haben teils Leben,
Teils Freiheit verloren.
Als Rechtloser diente ich,
Erlitt Höllenqual
Die heimliche Flucht war die einzige Wahl.

Und ich hoffe und ich lache
Und ich laufe und ich lebe,
Ich hoffe und ich lache,
Und ich laufe und bin frei.

Denn ich bin frei
Von den Schatten dieser Welt,
Endlich frei
Von der Fessel, die mich hält
Und ich spür die große Kraft
Wenn der neue Tag erwacht...

Nun leb ich als Schatten,
Als Lufthauch I'm Nichts.
Mein Heim sind die Wälder,
Fernab jeden Lichts.
So ziehe ich weiter,
Einsam Tag für Tag
Zu sehen was das Schicksal
Mir bringen mag.

Und ich hoffe und ich lache
Und ich laufe und ich lebe,
Ich hoffe und ich lache,
Und ich laufe und bin frei.

Denn ich bin frei
Von den Schatten dieser Welt,
Endlich frei
Von der Fessel, die mich hält
Und ich spür die große Kraft
Wenn der neue Tag erwacht...

So laufe ich weiter,
Lauf ich so schnell wie der Wind
Bis Frieden ich find,
So laufe ich weiter,
Suche ich nach jenem Ort,
Wo ich verweil.

Denn ich bin frei
Von den Schatten dieser Welt,
Endlich frei
Von der Fessel, die mich hält
Und ich spür die große Kraft,
Wenn der neue Tag erwacht...

Frei!
Endlich frei!

Und ich spür die große Kraft!
Wenn der neue Tag erwacht,
Dann bin ich frei!

I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

I wait for night time to come
And bring you to me
Can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

And first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh my nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you",Ain't Nobody,1984
Schema Sextet,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2000

Instead of breaking up
Let's start some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms why don't you stay?

Baby love, my baby love, why must we separate my love?

Why you do me like you do, I guess it's me
Ooh, need to hold you once again my love, feel your warm embrace my love
Don't throw our love away, please don't do me this way

Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile

I was five and you were ten, boy
You knew that I was shy
So you teased and made me cry
But I loved you

Then one day you came
You told me you were leaving
You gave your folks the blame
And made me cry again
When you said

Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting

I'm waiting
Ooh, still waiting
I'm just a fool
Ooh, I'm a fool
To keep waiting

Then someone finally came
He told me that he loved me
I put him off with lies
He could see I had no eyes
So he left me once again alone
Like a child without her playmate
I had to face the truth
I was still in love with you
But you said:

Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting

Love has never shown his face
Since the day you walked out that door
You filled my life with empty space
Come back
Can't you see it's you I'm waiting for

Don't you know I'm waiting
I'm waiting for love
For you, I miss you
I'm waiting

I need you
I want you

",Tired of Being Alone,2005
Schiller,"Die Sonne zieht an mir vorbei, obwohl sie eigentlich steht,
während die Welt an ihr vorbei so langsam untergeht.
Und wenn es dann dämmert und die Nacht erwacht,
Beginnt ein Untergang, der jedem Tag das Leben nimmt.
Was diese Welt am Tag verneint, lädt sie des Nachts ein
Und einer ihrer Schatten wird von mir gemacht sein.
Dunkle Seiten seiner Seele bietet jeder zum Tausch
Unter Menschen, die sich suchen und nichts finden als Rausch.
Die nach mir greifen und mitunter kriegen sie mich zu fassen,
zieh'n mich runter in den Bunker voller dunkler Grimassen.
Hier kann ich Grenzen überwinden und meine Seele verwetten
Oder einen Engel finden und mich retten.

Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier...
Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.

Kann dir die Möglichkeit, die Sonne nicht mehr aufgehn zu sehn,
einem die Lust am Leben nehmen?
Ich teil' mit jedem heute Nacht den Ballast und das Elend uns'rer Not
In der Angst vor dem Leben und dem Tod.
In diesem lebenslangen Kampf, der krank macht und Kraft raubt,
Häng ich an allem, was mich schwach macht und aussaugt.
Wehr' mich dagegen, anzunehmen, was weh tat
Und niemals zuzugeben, dass ich jemals falsch lag.
Doch wenn es wahr ist, dass man erst durch Fehler vollkommen wird
Und dass wer aus Angst am Leben hängt sich vollkommen irrt,
Dann ist der Schmerz loszulassen, wohl nichts gegen den Schmerz,
Wenn einem alles genommen wird.

Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.
Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.

In einer stürmischen Nacht erlöschen Träume wie Kerzenlicht
Und wer nicht von Herzen spricht, trägt einen Schmerz in sich,
Hüttet und versteckt ihn hinter tausend Ausreden.
Ich sollte beten, aber irgendwas spricht dagegen,
Ich will vergeben, denn der Zweifel ersticht mein Leben,
Ich kann nicht glauben, meine Liebe zerbricht am Ego.
Ich will vertrauen und ich weiß nicht mehr, wie das gehen soll,
Ich seh kein Morgengraun, nein, ich seh nur dichten Nebel.
Ich bin am Boden geknebelt und fast zu Tode getreten.
Doch hab nicht vor so zu enden, ich hab nicht vor, aufzugeben.
Ich werde dieses Leben ändern und ich werd's überleben,
Ein neuer Morgen wird kommen und er bringt Hoffnung für jeden,
Der neu geboren unter Schmerzen aus dem Koma erwacht,
Damit das Feuer des Herzens auf ein Neues entfacht.
Das hat das Leben jeden Tag in diesen Händen verbracht,
Damit das Licht der Nacht ein Ende macht.

Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.
Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.
Es liegt nur an dir.",Die Nacht...du Bist Nicht Allein,2006

I search where love can grow, 
And watch where bitter flow
I am not afraid to know miles and miles ...

Schiller,"When you go through a day

They make you feel so small
They make you feel that
Your heart will just never stop aching
And when you just can`t accept the abuse you are taking

Don`t you worry I`ll see you through
You just have to reach out for me
I`ll be there and I`ll comfort you
Oh yes I will
Comfort you and love you
How I`m gonna love you

When good friends prove untrue
And the things they do to you
They make you feel so bad

Schneider TM,"The line that curves and cracks
The wall in two and points
To where your hand is stretched

My baby, you're everything to me
When you're gone, there's no one,
I'm just lonely
My baby, I never use those words,
But that's all I could call
Someone as sweet as you

Here and now
The air the light
Has burst into between
Where you and I
We rest unfold
And melt like gold",Like Gold,2003
Schnell Fenster,"I hear the distant roar
As the waves cut into the bay
Just like the hungry words
That's eaten this thing away
Whoa! I can feel it disappearing
 Underneath that cool veneer it's boiling hot
 And one day soon I know you're going to blow your top
 Like a sleeping mountain - lying there waiting to blow
And some day It'll rise up
Rise up so high
And there'll be a cloud of smoke
Across a magenta sky
Whoa! I can feel the lava flowing
 Underneath that cool veneer it's boiling hot
 And one day soon I know you're going to blow your top
 Heading down that icy slope, crystal pure
 Behind the rugged beauty of your tranquil shore
 Like a sleeping mountain - lying there just waiting to blow
 Like a sleeping mountain - lying there just ready to blow
Never seem to notice if it's dusk or dawn
Might as well be naked in a thunderstorm
 And underneath that cool veneer it's boiling hot
 One day soon I know you're going to blow your top
 Like a sleeping mountain - lying there just waiting to blow
 Like a sleeping mountain
 Come on and let me feel the lava flow.

Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'

Have our good days, have our bad

Then I want to leave
But you won't let me

Doesn't mean that we walk away
We work through our mistakes

Sometimes I don't
But I never ever, never want to let you go
The road's not easy
But the feelings strong
It's the little things that keep me holding on

We're both guilty of mistakes
Though you rarely take the blame
Are you coming through
Sometimes I hate you
But its not mistakes in life you make
It's the good you do along the way
The dues you pay

We have our highs and lows
Something everybody knows
Doesn't mean that we run away
We work through our mistakes

Scholomance,"I will hand you your heart
Which I will so gracelessly rip from your heaving chest.
I pondered in candlelit lethargy. I grieved as the wax melted,
Knowing
""Tomorrow I must hurt you, who I hold dear
As an ancient myth held true to its people.
You, who I knew but a moment. But what a moment!
As though touching the darkening hue of the night sky
And forsaken stars for the first time.
Together and alone,
We came to swim in each other's minds.
Independent, still one.
Now I must be rid of you.
Forever is a choice made by both.
Father Time is dreaming of fog rising and moonsets.
These we cannot see again through a reflective cyclopean gaze.
Nothing good.
For me
Nothing is good. But for you?
One day there will be no one at all
With whom to talk, speak or boast.
By no fault, with no blame, but with one hundred points of pain.
Don't forget. Cannot forget. Nothing was good.
No future. Smile politely at the blind.""
Have I known hate? Indifference in a skincloak of anger
Or Love in purity. Goddess, the torment! The weak talk of strength.
The strong speak with sympathy. The wise thus said nothing.
For none know the real truth the strong need and the wise know it.
When stabbed endless times all vessels are cut
And the heart will lumber with Death.
The mind becomes stricken with sickly pallor
And will usher in Hate.
Will the blade sayeth,
""Please, I wish not to dive into your flesh!""
When all are gone?
Infinite dirge, a life in Inferno's anguish.
My tears ever stream
And will they run separately from my blood?
Will it be this and Now?",End,1999

Working hard all night

That never lets things go
'Cause weeks are better flying

You have to fix things up
Where you left off
And don't look back

We're always breaking down
Sleeping on the bus
Couldn't get the heat
So we're freezing all night long

We do what we have to
I'm still making up
What I lost that job
Wasting all my time
Living with the boys
On the road all year
I'll always say that's fine

My wallet's getting light
So I'll just sleep on my friends floor
My cars been sold for about three months
I couldn't ask for more
So tell me you want to
Live life like I do

What you believe in
You have to wait for
The dream go and get it now

I did not know what to do
I think I lost myself
When I lost my motivation
Now I'm walking 'round the city
Just waiting to come to
For three strange...
For three strange days
I couldn't put a smile on my face
So they dressed me up in all of their clothes
And took me somewhere else
Johnny Clueless was there
With his simulated wood grain
So I pulled up a chair 
And started drinking by myself
For three strange...
I've got to make it through
No matter what it takes
Oh I've got to make it through
These strange days
I lay down for a while
And I woke up on the ocean
Floating on my back
And staring at the gray
It was completely still
Except the pounding of my heart
Bringing me back to life
From three strange days
Three strange...

To reappear back into your life.
When all you see and all you love is back again, under the veil;

And love was just a way to hide.
And all the pain you thought you’d lost,
You found again, in someone else…

Livin' out his backpack every night needin' a new place to sleep

Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished

To all my niggas I would die for
Load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time steppin' in the pen

I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinkin' of some bullshit to tell him, like
""It'll be okay. You'll be straight, it'll be aight""
Well, fuck that shit, whatever you need, yo, I got it! 
Whether it's money or some weed or puttin' in work, fuck it, then I'm ridin'! 
You know wassup, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved that I'd be a fuckin' fool
To be livin' by the street rules
Fuck police tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith, stay strong brah, uh
Remain' solid brah
Keep playin' ball cause it's the only way up out it brah
A nigga proud of ya'
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed, I'll have whatever he needs
We the last of a dyin' breed; live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come, but most, I'm sorry for your son

Never grow to see the pearly gates? Break
Every time a bullet detonate? Dates
Of obituary carry crates of a scary picture
With a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen expedition, play it safe
As the record spinnin' you was hearin' angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, comin' from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had moved you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read again
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't (blessed my nigga)
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed
Take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet

I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, Damn y’all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

I Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Man I’m lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I’m legally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking bucking them out here
I’m like go fuckin their tastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whippin’ but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, There’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really want a Ducati so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car, junior, problem with this geezer
Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she’s writing rhymes
I had it hella my love, tryna blow her mind

14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone
Sendin’ portions of his liquor, water in the Patron
Rather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it in the 4-2
Most of the mayonnaise, keeping the buns on ‘em
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin like we ball
Tryna fuck em all, kill the fuckin wimps
See what’s poppin’ at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my palms, you can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I’m motherfuckin’ off
Son, swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes, maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low? This shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cool with niggas, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slice off when the gas is finished, Q

Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

All a nigga had to eat was a couple of coneys
Broke as fuck and no bitch to fuck
In my basement jackin' off lonely
Used to fall off fuckin' with the work
But guess what? I'm back on ho
No more ? on that couch
Now I'm all the way in your bitch mouth

On her stomach fluid come up
I be fuckin' her face on the daily
You be kissin' that bitch in the mouth

Then land on my dick from the back

Now shut up bitch and get the Amber Rose
Come and let a young real nigga cut
But nah bitch this dick ain't free
So she copped my dick and then cuffed
Now come here chick and let me feed you nuts
Cum on her ass and have her lyin' in it
How her mouth can be wide as her legs
My dick is long as the Brooklyn bridge
Hit it raw cause I'm with the shit
Gave her the pipe said she need a fix
Gave you life, can't believe the sight
Take the wood like a termite
Made a crash up at the turnpike
But it's a rental I'll get another
Wonder if you got the gift from your mother
I used to play hoops with your brother
Even played a lil' house with your sister
She always call me daddy or mister mister
Why the ? shirts can do more than fist her
Bitch gettin' head, I ain't never kissed her
B I G never missed a beat
I was ? so I skeet skeet
Ho can make an orgasm last a week
I'mma get her deep, she a masterpiece
Hell no I don't love that bitch
Hell yeah I'm gon' enjoy that bitch

ScHoolboy Q,"For someone start with my nigga out Mack
The first real nigga I lost
Even though he used to gang bang
Whenever that he see it's chains swang
But that's that Jesus 2 slots
Cause he would have rocked it well
But instead he rocked that hair full of raze braided by his girl Lucy
With the semi on, make the head game kinda cold
Never kill the soul, so we never had a problem with thinking this [?]
Living life like it never would happen
Shit, niggas dying like life really going full circle
Thought we was gonna live to see it all
Till that day that he died on a head-on collision with a motorcycle

It's true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true

I met Jamico when I went to high-school
They stayed around the corner bur shit, I never knew
Me and Kisel Ken in the basement playing drums, making music
Watching for some yellow diamonds
Yes I'm on the phone you losers
I remember late for school every morning thirsty for that mickey d's
When I know when the death of a mother matured him very quickly
So we go fast forward school graduated
Went to college got married
They had a pretty little girl but the world couldn't make her [?]
He died from a seizure at her daughter's birthday party

It's true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true

Blue chucks, swing Glocks, they're both in my pants
I'm a gangster I can do no wrong
Fuck with the lights on tell you I love you baby
Caz tomorrow may not make it to me
I got a kilo and a seven series when a crown went crack nigga
I bet the gun sale plat, oh
ATF be on that sucker shit
They hate a black nigga with getting money's involved
Got an ounce in my draws
I just wanna live forever my nigga
Took the blue pill, crack the axillae
If Q said it then you know that shit's real
Pistol grip up on my lap all times
I used to drive a Hyundai with the dimes inside
Now drive by is by the lost that kill bay base kids
So the gun is who my role model is, the illest crip in the biz
Look, I'm never half of my steppin', I never not with my weapon
So you'll get got in a second like

Cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true

Alright man, just for a few seconds
If you got somebody that you lost it was vital to your life
And you feel like you really got a guardian angel right now
I mean, yes I say man, you mean, [?] at the same time, yeah
Get ready

Lord please forgive me for all my sins
Yeah, nigga wake up to the same shit everyday, homie
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
No rules, right

Washing my sins off in hell's water
Feel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em
Kneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me?
But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way

Uh, four corners, cat and mouse chase, got cheese to catch
High on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet
Dreaming I don't live up on the block no more
Trapping trying to make it out this obstacle
Life on the edge, hell a block away
Pretty Snow White turned eight today
Selling that base, no Dr. Dre
Uh, guess who in the building?
Bucket hat with a strap like the pilgrim uh
Kneeling down with some questions to address like
Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?
The 10 commandments, I can mark five checks
But I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats
Streets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex
Faith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet
Sewer full of drugs when the toilet digests from the cop raid
All can relate, from the streets to the wall from niggas to compadres
When the sun go down, I'm predictin' a heatwave, forecast your whole body
Heat on, room full of homi's, I just pray that the Lord got me

Uh but if God don't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way

But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way

Kill mine, kill yours, make it even

I know I only come around when it's Easter
Funerals, Thanksgiving, Christmas time

Fuck punching in, throwing rocks, no hopscotch
Bet my 9 milli hit the right spot
Bang, last night it was a dream
This morning a fantasy
Back when the only fan I had was a fiend
Meet me by the Acura cause the cops like
To get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea
But it's cool I've been catching on to they formula
See I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo'
Then rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo
The bad guy never once been a hoes hero
He get zero, I said nada
Bitch pass the cama (Uh, yeah)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga? (I'm a product of a real nigga)

I done jumped off my ass
Hit the lick and barely pass but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him

But, every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But, click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)
But, meet Glock clock familia (Boom)

Find a nigga realer than me, my socks stink
Eat so much pussy that my mustache pink
Strapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt
Gangsta lean help, hoodie on backwards with the eyes cut out
My hate felt, my .45 elder, poetry's deep
I never fail ya, Schoolboy bust flame
Orange-yellow, higher than Margiela's
Since a young nigga I admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal
From his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout
Think about it, the smoker ain't got shit and everyday he still get a hit
Whether jacking radio's or sucking dick
Sell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips
'Cause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much
To get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't fucking with work
Unless we rewind and answer my church
Times getting harder than my dick on a growth spurt
Around the same time all you niggas was on purp
My sober ass was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck freeze
Give me the keys, extra Frito's, chili and cheese
Thew some Baby Lucas in his eyes before I leave
The cops'll never get the leak, grandma taught me well
And my uncle gun was the accessories, 211 sipping plus a robbery
This little Piggy went to market, this little Piggy carry chrome

I done jumped off my ass
Hit the lick and barely pass but I quickly got to balling

Grandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more
She always got me things that we couldn't afford
The new J's and Tommy Hill in my drawers
Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, see Golden Eye was away at war
We wasn't thinking of getting money then
Nor did I wonder why my uncle done sold his Benz
'Cause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down
I also notice moms be locking doors when he around
But anyways, his wife done left him and now he living with us
My bike is missing, grandma light a hotter chick every month
My uncle's nuts, he used to give me Whisky to piss in cups
Knocking on the door telling me to hurry up, he in a rush
I gave it to him then got my ass whipped for doing it
Moms used to tell me like ""Nigga, know who you dealing with""
Them was the good days 'til I was raised the older ways
Rat-Tone my niggas' brother showed me my first K
I was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back, he called us over like ""Hey""
Yak, yak, yak, yak! We like ""Damn, nigga""
Then again, yak, yak! We like ""Damn, nigga""
Hearing him say 'cause turned us to a fan, nigga
Later on he got locked so know we're taking his fades

In order to get to the TV I had to go through the proper channels
I don't rock the flannel, I rock the Air Max, Atmos and camo
They call me the Benz owner, I put Lorenzo's on it
Then go and pick a chick up, bone it and friend zone her
Soon as I see her wake up, I be fuckin' her raw
If she a B or an A cup, make her fuck in a bra
Let's get it goin', got a dyke in the closet

Indent relationships
Shawty sexing flesh, hips, thighs and her breasts made to get ya

And she gon' make you do what you say
Licking them lips, swinging them hips as she walk your way

Better run, run for your life
You better run, run for your life

ScHoolboy Q,"Um, yeah palms sweating guess it's time for the murder
My nigga my nerve, I swerve left you dead on the curb
Tell his family get them black clothes
Any witness gets a 9 cold, could do this with a blindfold
I'm that player on the corner looking dry when it rains
Pimp a dollar out a pussy, I ain't trying to change
Far from average, I'm smoking this cabbage
Bottled teeth, joint karats, say cheese, make the cops freeze
Big cribs, four bars, living pipe dreams
You only gangsta through your bop screen
Might set the reason for the crime scene
Fill up the city with madness
We the reason the hearses left your hood and holding up traffic
Let the riddles do the scrapping, keep the gun in my fabric
Better pistol than them badges, you get dealt with the maggots
Heard drive-bys everyday
Seen homies die early age, though we still gang bang anyway
Uh, yeah, Figg side

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh

B's and them h's, tats on faces, Glocks with extendos
Chucking up the hood then throw like 80 out that window
The chopper make you limbo
Gotta keep them antennas up, moving down Central
Young niggas with skinnies, moving with them semis
Catch your ass leaving the club, murk you at Denny’s
Squeeze till it’s empty, it seems so unreal
'Til the gunfire got you using tables as a shield
East side, west side, niggas getting chastised
Dropping like fruit flies, we all know who die
We all go on Insta and get the whole rundown
A 15 second clip until he put the gun down
Know OG’s who took more shots like diabetics
Had that MAC paint on your face like cosmetics
Chucking up big ass B’s is my fetish
Type of shit that make you go brazy if I let it
Niggas got zippers, wheelchairs and prosthetics

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh

Hundred days, hundred nights, nigga
Let the K'ss scream 'til we see the red and blue lights, nigga
From the hoovers to the hundreds, nigga
From Kelly Park to Bounty hunters, nigga
(Watch out for the shooters)
Same age as the kids in Iraq now
LA Chiraq now, funerals is packed now
Preachers at the pulpit, Jesus is the background
Grandmother get shot walking out the church
How that sound?
Niggas don't really like it but we grew up in it
City of angels, belly of the beast get chewed up in it
Started as Black Panthers, everything power, everything pro black
Started off unified the FBI know that
A little coke sprinkled on tables but wasn't no crack
False imprisonment, huey P, Geronimo Pratt
Now close your eyes, listen to me, your mind'll go back
Picture us chained together under the boat, that's a Kodak
And since today is Thursday, let me hit you with a throwback
Stolen identities, God left us here without lowjack
Forced to find ourselves, forced to break up outta chains
Got tired of getting hanged so we started our own gangs
Tookie Williams (Crip), Sylvester Scott (Blood)
Seventy two Lil' Country caught a slug
And that was the first time a crip ever killed a blood
Now the shit is worldwide cause it is what it was
We know the history and we know the shit could end any day

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh",Gang Bang Anyway,2015

If they scream we got beef, he would handle with no prob
Cologne and liquor was his odor

Before ya'll knew 'bout me I was up in the D
Somewhere on Finkle with drugs in the Jeep
You don't know how it feel when you're cousin a Blood
And you can't call him cousin 'cause bousin is G

Told my daughter that I love but I go
Rather go provide then be there and broke
Life or death, the paper bringing us hope
Know these haters want me dead in the dirt
Know they hate when every day is the first
Wore it once about a thousand a shirt
Figure'd I would call a picket and skrrt
Cross me once, they have to view you in church
Niggas tough until that hot one insert
Still got that dope in my sock
Gotta go watch for the cops
Keep it Top Dawg when I flee

With a half a bag of that Sacramento
Seen cops' lights flash, threw it out the window
Right there cross the street from Allen Temple
Shit, that was my MO 'for I had a demo
And I had a Pinto but it had the tint though
Then I had a Benzo now I got a limo
Shit, I always knew a nigga had potential
Blow a bag of indo like a bad Nintendo
If I had your bimbo it was accidental
Now I'm actin nimble 'cause she actin' simple
Back to running circles round the A like an ""at"" symbol
Hamilton Holmes, to Indian Creek
I pray I'm at my home while my enemies creep
So many shots it sound like there's twenty of me

Schoolly D,"It was Saturday night and I'm feelin kinda sporty
Went to a bar and caught me a 40
Got kinda a high and a...kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came dressed, she said, ""Who the hell?""
Wait momma, wait, it's me ya little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
""I know who you are, but who the hell is that?""
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know, she got into the car
I musta picked her up when I left the bar
Ya know I'm horny homey man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, ""Hey baby is you on the pill?
'Cause, tonight I want to be your lover
Just one thing:  I forgot to buy a rubber""
Wait a little while then we snuk upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in with a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please!
Put back your gun, put down your brew
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, ""Ya come a little closer and ya will get shot,
I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock.""

Oh yeah, them wild Saturday Nights

It was Saturday Night and I was feelin kinda funny
Gold around my neck, pockets full of money
Went to the corner, man who did I see?
But the super bad bitch lookin back at me
I said, ""Fly lady man, you got a big butt""
Bitch turned around, all she said was, ""What?""
I said, ""My name is Schoolly baby, I'm down with the Shores""
Before I knew it up came my boys
Noisy as hell and drunk as shit
Sayin, ""Yo Schoolly Schooll, what time is it?""
Looked a little closer and I knew it was gag
What I thought was a girl was nothin but a fag

Smokin a J and scratchin' the itch
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
And said, ""Yo, what's up with that, bitch?""

Smokin' a Lacy in each and every hand
The poor little spider, he couldn't score any
They were 2 dollar bitches and he only had a penny

Sucka MCed, tried to cop a limp
Rode around town in a couple of cars
Got gagged by the man tryin to stick up a bar

He said, ""I had some Cheeba Cheeba, cocaine and some wine.""
The judge said, ""Boy, relax and have a beer

I sit back, I blow a kiss to my mother
Even though she old, the nigga still love her
But I never knew my daddy
Nah, all I knew was some nigga in a Caddy
Stopped by every year by Christmas
Talkin that bullshit he missed us
I don't look like my granny or my mammy
I look like a muthafucka named Sammy
My mother musta been a young slut
Always talkin about the days when she had a big fat butt
You gotta do what you gotta do what you gotta do
Yo, I drink a brew
I sit back and start thinkin
Damn, should a nigga be smokin and drinkin?

Gramps in the back, tryin to get cock
Got me a forty, balls kinda itchin
Mom in the kitchen, start the bitchin
Smokin cheeba, take another hit
Step into the bathroom and take a little shit
I start thinkin and thinkin and thinkin
My man, I wish that I was drinkin
With my niggas, all of my homies
Fuckin with the bitches, they want to blow me
Schoolly D, you know that I'm a lover

Just our eyes never found what I see now,
That my feet are on the ground.

And here comes the night pulling puppet strings on my heart again,
Shows me all of this time I've been blind to this waking life.
Now I see it everywhere.

I can't see you but I know you're here,
I, know you're here.

Hängst im Funpark, mit den anderen Alten

Schämst dich, das du mich liebst

Ob ich noch mit dir leben kann, ehrlich, ich weiß es nicht
Die Jungs sagen, ich verliere deinetwegen mein Gesicht
Doch ich mach reinen Tisch, Ewa, ich wollt Danke sagen
Du warst die Medizin für mich an all den kranken Tagen
Doch du weißt selber, dass die Straße Ohren hat
Sie fragen mich, was ich bei einer Frau wie dir verloren hab
Und ich muss dir gestehen, dafür bin ich nicht stark genug
Weißt du noch, das Rotlicht und dein Panikbuch
Mir war das egal, ich hab's mit dir immer nur ernst gemeint
Es ist ne schwere Zeit, doch ich will mit dir ehrlich sein

Rotlicht, Para, bevor ich Rapper war
Vom Rotlicht zum Blauchlicht, vom Blaulicht zu Scheinwerfern
Früher Lapdance, damit sie mit Scheinen werfen
Scheiß drauf, das war mal, ich heiz jetzt im Hummer
Von Freiburg nach Warszawa, wo ich Lines spuck für Para
Aber immernoch fick ich mein Kopf
Weil das Rotlicht nicht loslässt, check die Story
Warum man in weiter Stadt Zeit abmacht
Liegt daran, dass die Chayas hier Scheiß labern
Leyla sorgt für Hunni ohne Gummi
Ist begehrt bei Pezos, verkehrt in Ghettos
Klar wird mein Kollege Emo aktiv
Er posiert sie durch Moneten und Parties
Verkauft ihr Träume und redet vom Buis-
Zukunft, Liebe, der übliche Mist
Touchdown, Leyla beißt an und geht ackern
Tauris am Tag und die Scheine am flattern
Doch die Scheine flattern in Emo sein Tasche
Wenn Emo bock hat, kauft ihr Emo 'ne Tasche
Ah, kein Problem für Leyla
Wär nicht nur die Eifersucht, wenn Emo Weiber sucht
Von Weibern genug, kriegt Emo rieden
Er klebt an vielen Ärschen wie Hämorriden

Es geht schnell aus Nonne wird Nutte
Durch bisschen Schwanz bisschen labern mit Zunge
Pezos, passt auf, Schwesta macht schlau
Heutzutage wird das rote Licht schnell blau

Es geht schnell aus Nonne wird Nutte

Pezos, passt auf, Schwesta macht schlau

Wie gesagt, Leyla kommt gar nicht klar
Sie will Emo für sich oder Emo kriegt nix
Also sagt sie, sie will noch mehr ackern
Strich, Puff, FKK, noch mehr Para
Sodass Emo keine brauch außer Leyla
Darum tickt sie jetzt im Puff auch noch Beyda
Para läuft und Emo verspricht Leyla
Nur mit ihr zusammen zu bleiben und sonst mit keiner
Leyla ist naiv, denkt, sie ist am Ziel
Doch nach drei Wochen guckt sie in sein Handy
SMS und Fotos von anderen Schlampen
Videos, wie er sie bumst und er zieht Grimassen
Das ist der Moment, an dem der Traum platzt
Plötzlich wird aus der Liebe nur reiner Hass
Sodass sie anfängt, bei Amcas zu singen
Er wird sie vergewaltigen und zum ackern zwingen
So ist das Leben

Warum reden die Frauen nicht?
Wovor haben sie Angst
Und wie funktioniert der Menschenhandel und wer profitiert?

Sie nimmt zehn für ein Lilanen
Und sagt, dass wir uns bestimmt gleich wiedersehen
Ich nehm mein Flus und geh zu den Latinas
Im zweiten Stock und klopf bei Juanita
Die die Tür aufreißt, nen kleinen Kanack kickt
Und schreit, du Bastard-Kind, bring echtes Para mit
Wir grüßen uns und gehn rein ins Zimmer
Sie sagt der Job ist Stress, drum rockt sie Flex
Will achtzig Packs, kocht es zu Crack
Gib mir schnell die Millen, der nächste Kunde kommt jetzt
Nächstes Stockwerk, Sechs, Zigeunertreff
Kinganes geben Flex nie teuer weg, ah
Juckt mich nicht, geh mal in den Dritten
Zu Coco Yvette mit den Blas-Gut-Lippen
Magst du Ficken""fragt sie mich neben Freier
Der Taui gibt für Schoko-Vanille-Dreier

Ich war die erste Slawin im Rap-Geschäft
Mache pickos wie Kimbo platt
Denn jeder Song hat Effekt - Flip-Flop-Lack
Rapper sitzen rum bei Starbucks mit Laptop
Während meine Escort-Kahba das Crack kocht
Ah, was für Aussagepflicht?
Du hältst dicht, wenn die Slawin den Raum betritt
Milieu Kurwa, da wo Weiber blasen
Die den Fotzenumfang eines Eimers haben
Denn ich will, dass sie Batzen zähl'n
Lila Scheine, die sie für mich in' Matratzen näh'n
Regel für Nutten, ganz egal welche Hautfarbe
Wie im Studio: Rotlicht heißt Aufnahme

Meist weint er auf dei'm Schoß, wenn er keinen hochkriegt
Und wenn die Blauen wieder ballern wie drei Teile
Sprüh'n die Funken aus dem Kopf wie auf der grünen Meile
Alles abgefuckt, Stimmung auf Detroit-Niveau

Schwesta Ewa,"Das Rotlicht, dass im Mondlicht brennt
Keiner kennt es so, wie ich's kenn
Wenn ihr einschlaft, beginnen für uns die Tage
Mädchen warten vor der Tür auf der Straße
Sie war 17, von zu Hause abgehauen
Denn Mama schlug ihre Augen blau
Sieh, der Zuhälter, er hat Duldung seit 20 Jahren
Vater Staat sagt, dass er nicht arbeiten darf
Guck, der Häftling, er hat jemand umgebracht
Den, der sein Kind ohne Grund vergewaltigt hat
Und der Straßenmusikant im Rollstuhl, der im Milieu spielt
Was soll er tun?
Damals in der Jugend noch bei Eintracht gespielt
Heute querschnittsgelähmt, das ist teil dieses Spiels
Schicksale, zich male
So verbringt man hier seine Jahre

Unter all den Narben hört man es schlagen
Wir leben und es tut was es kann
Wir können alles haben, 
Nur die Zeit nicht rückwärts drehen, die Schatten nicht begraben
Können nur weitergehen

So ist das Leben, Nachtleben
Man will auf uns verabreden
Schwesta, wir befinden uns im ältesten Gewerbe
Ich weiß, ich bin Zeugin dieser Welten bis ich sterbe
Guck mal, dieser Kiffer, für den Geld einfach nichts ist
Horizontal, Schwesta, welch ein Business auf dem Schore
Junkie, er war mal ein Arzt
Auf den Tod seiner Frau kommt er aber nicht klar
Oder den Mafiosi der die menschen hier schützt, zur Polizei können sie nicht, Rotlicht
Schau mal, dieser Dealer
Ihm kamen ein paar Packs abhanden
Ruft sein Bruder aus Syrien durch Schlepperbanden
Denn sie fliehen vor dem Krieg, wie jeder vor uns
Einer stirbt, es ist Thema nur kurz, 
Denn es muss weitergehen
Brauchen essen auf dem Tisch, bis morgen Nacht
Wir treffen uns am Strich

Unter all den Narben hört man es schlagen
Wir leben und es tut was es kann
Wir können alles haben, 
Nur die Zeit nicht rückwärts drehen, die Schatten nicht begraben
Können nur weitergehen

An das Milieu, wo du eine Mille löst
Nichts ist echt, doch die Bilder sind schön
Alles Illusion, guck, der Freier bringt'n Blumenstrauß
Er denkt, ihn liebt diese Hure auch
Er kommt nicht drauf klar, dass seine Ex einen Neuen hat
Mitten in der Nacht und er läuft durch die Stadt
Guck, die Go-Go-Tänzerin, die ihr Studium finanziert
Mit ihrem Kopf war sie nie ganz hier
Und die Nutte, die ihr Para macht
Und schaut weil ihr kleiner Sohn eine Krankenkasse braucht
An alle, dies dazu zu sehen einfach leben wollen
Wir hatten lang genug nur die Nebenrollen
Was bedeutet ein Bildungsstand
Dass man nicht ne Mille haben will, auf der Bank
Der Rand der Gesellschaft, wo man anders sein Geld macht
Der Staatsanwaltschaft gefällt das

Unter all den Narben hört man es schlagen
Wir leben und es tut was es kann
Wir können alles haben, 
Nur die Zeit nicht rückwärts drehen, die Schatten nicht begraben
Können nur weitergehen",Spiegelreflex,2015

Vier bis fünf Caipirinha

Doch ist mir egal, sie gibt mir Anal
Wenn ich noch 'ne Woche lang, den Shit hier bezahl
Auch wenn 'ne Kurwa so viele Kerle hätte
Hol ich ihr die Uhr da und hol ihr die Perlenkette
Ich hab den Tunnelblick, ja, man, ich tunnel dich
Und wenn nicht, lass uns wenigstens was fummeln, Bitch
Die Caya ist schick, die Eier sind dick
Ich reib ihre Clit, alter, gleich wird gefickt
Aber sikdir, man boah, sie hat die Nase full
Gibt mir 'nen Korb, wie Chicago Bulls

Und ich hätt es nie erzielt, wenn ich nicht grade wär
Yo, Riesenfeeling heut morgen, schon als noch viele schliefen
Wurd zwar wach durch dieses Piepen aber easy peasen
Für heute gibt es wieder Frieden in den Kriegsgebieten
Alle verschieden, Krisen gehen Musik genießen
Seh alte Leute mit ihren Lieben auf Liegewiesen
Wie sie ziehen und dann liegend fliegen
Vitalisiert vom Vitamindrink, Energie ist fließend
Sogar die Zivis sind heut friedlich, laufen weiter, auch wenn sie es riechen
Heute kann meine Laune keiner von ihn' vermiesen
Fühlt sich gut an, der Familie Perspektiven bieten

Alles Negative gibt dir eine positive Sicht
Mach nicht so 'n komisches Gesicht, heute ist ein guter Tag
Sei einfach froh, dass es dich gibt, was hat Ice Cube gesagt?
Heute ist ein guter Tag, keine Idioten im Visier
Muss mein Messer nicht benutzen, denn das Brot ist schon geschmiert
Keine Lügen, keine Kritik, keine Lästereien
Heute bleiben wir clean, denn wir sind noch von gestern high

Piccos machen mir auf Psycho, machen mir auf Pezevenk

Bullen in meiner Leitung wie die NSA, fick die SEK, Digga

Im Traum erscheint mir der Teufel in Schlangenform
Sagt, „Ewa, manche Sünden sind haram, andere sind angeboren!“
In meiner Gegend kann nur Schlitzohr überleben
Zwischen Rotlicht und Moschee liegt die Schizophrenietät
Sie schmissen mich von Schule wegen Haze
Egal, ich hab' einen Doktor aus der Gossen-Universität

Geldbündel in der Bauchtasche
Besser bring ein Messer oder Knüppel zu 'nem Faustkampf mit
Sie können uns nicht verstehen und sagen, dass wir aggressiv sind

From Compton to being Dre's number one prospect so

No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because

Ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here

Now did you live your life proper did you just pretend
That you knew what you were talking about
Which side was your fence
When the hammer comes down it never makes no sense
Chaos is not a virtue, paranoia loads the bases
Just imagine giant rivers overflowing with their faces

Feeling like you didn't be done
Here it comes, strawberry sponge
Chasing away the sun

Don't let those precious moments fool you
Happiness is getting you down
A rainbow never smiles or blinks
It's just a candy colored frown

You were going on at half-past seven
Now it's going on a quarter 'til nine
All the angels want to know
Are you lost or treading water?
And you're going on your fifteenth bender
But you've only got a matter of time
Yes we've all got seeds to sow
Not everyone's got lambs to slaughter

When the night wind starts to turn
Into the ocean breeze
And the dew drops sting and burn
Like angry honey bees
That is when you hear the song falling from the sky
Happy yesterday to all
We were born to die

Sometimes you're filled with the notion
The afterlife's a moment away
You want to tell someone the way that you feel
But then you ain't got nothing to say
You fight for freedom from devotion
A battle that will always begin
With somebody giving you a piece of advice;
By the way you're living in sin

Now there's never gonna' be an intermission
But there'll always be a closing night
Never entertain those visions
Lest you may have packed your baggages
First impressions are cheap ambitions
Sometimes are long goodbyes
Truth so often to living dormant
Good luck walks and bullshit flies

When the headlights guide your way
You know the place is right
When the treetops sing and sway
Don't go to sleep tonight
That is when you see the sign
Luminous and high:
Tomorrow's not what it used to be
We were born to die
Happy yesterday to all
We were born to die",Intermission,2006

Kiss you off my lips

Well I think I'm gonna buy me a brand new shade of man
Kiss you off my lips
It's standing room only for a piece of my pigment
So excuse me a minute while I supply demand
Kiss you off these lips of mine
Kiss you off for a custom shine
Pissed yours truly off this time
It's why I ain't just kissin' you I'm kissin' you off

Some blue broad will spoil your rod

Dodging alley cats and whiskers

Is it painful hearing voices ring
So early in the morning?

When I can throw away these numbers
That line my dresser drawers and cupboards
Start me over
Life seems so much slower
With your toothbrush by the mirror
Can I make it any clearer?

And I just might say it tonight
I just might say it tonight
And I just might tell you tonight
That I love you
And you should stay all my life

They'll tell you that you'll maybe make it
If you just cut your clothes and change your hair
But I won't fuss and moan
'bout what you wear
I feel so much better
When I read your dirty letters
Just wear your sweaters in the winter
'Cause I wouldn't want you to get cold
I hope that we're together when we're old

Never took piano lessons

And I will learn to play the good notes

It's all mine
Do we dream about each other at the same time?
All night
This might be the only way to talk to you
That's right
It's your ears with the sound that I walk into
Your mind

Is it the party that ain't over 'til it's through?
Is it the wiring that's suddenly blown a fuse?
Is it a chemical that makes this moment true?
Is it the music that connects me to you?

There's a way to get together then I'm gone away
One day
It's a place that all that matters are the notes you play
I say
Simple pleasures when I'm listening it gets me by
Won't lie

Here I was awaiting
Praying for the muse
I'm finally awake and you have
Left me less confused
Maybe now
You will hear me now

With dust and rusty razor blades

I wanna tell her that I love it

Backseat of her riverboat 'cause

Hiding out between the lines

I be the cruddy one that they call the DJ Mister Cee, 
With the whole Wolf Pack in the place to be. 
Better known as the Chocolate City. 
So Scoob Lover, huh, are ya with me...? 


[Scoob Lover:]
Yo, I break punks up like a fight. Give me the mic, I'm hype. 
(Damn kid, you're starvin' for life) 
'Cause people be tellin' me, brothers be gellin' me, 
Tryin' to get fame from my name but they chumps and they but soft. 
They know I'm wilder than a dog with hot sauce. 
A mic, a stage, a crowd, and I won't stop: 
I set it off and get live like an alarm clock. 
People thought Scoob and Scrap was just a nickname; 
Now that we rap, we sell more records than cocaine. 
Awww, shucks, now I'm back from the down-low, 
Here comes Scoob with the curly afro. 
No chemical reaction, no need for askin', pure satisfaction, 
My last name's Jackson. 
You slip up, I get ill - my boot to your grill, 
My nine kills, I'm Big Scoob from Brownsville. 
The world's greatest lover, the chocolate brother...

Who's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!)
Who's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!)

Scrap Lover are ya with me? 

[Scrap Lover:]
Yo, I drop science kinda like a pigeon
Over rough tracks I tax any midget with a small digit. 
Smooth and mild but complicated, 
I put the crowd to to smashed like a driver that's intoxicated. 
Rappers write rhymes, and talk about guns and jail, 
But wouldn't squeeze a lemon in a cocktail. 
Don't say ""huh?"" or ""what?"", and don't ask who, 
'Cause if you hear me, I must be talkin' to you. 
You probably thought I couldn't steal it, 'cause I was a dancer, 
I didn't have a chance, but ya'll can kill it. 
You gotta be off your rocker, 
I'm lettin' suckers know that Scrap got more soul than Foot Locker. 
And if you heard I got skills, believe it's true; 
Suggest for Pete Rock, for reminiscin' over you. 
It's not a threat, it's a bet, 'cause hey, 
The last sucker who tried woulda been 25 today. 

[Chorus x3] 

Big Daddy are ya with me? 

[Big Daddy Kane:]
Yo-yo-yo-yo, look out, get out the way! 
Here comes the K the A the N the E - huh, ya better flee. 
'Cause I don't need no hoodie to be hard, shoot: 
I'll kill a nigga in a three-piece suit. 
I don't be havin' it so the rear I'll attack, 
A size-15 to the buttocks, a-matter-fact. 
A hard-core blow to the face I'll provide, 
To give you a Crooked eye, just like St. Ides. 
Leave you home and you must be screamin' and yellin'; 
Not even cool Moe Dee shades can hide your swellin'. 
I bring it rough, tough; 
I said that I was Browner than Bobby, so you know that it's good enough. 
I'm untouchable to rappers my size. 
You dreamed of beatin' me, you better wake up an apologize. 
Some claim to be a Daddy or Poppa, 
But with me, you'd have no Ranks if your name was Shabba.

Now you know you'd too like to be with it...

Shane, I cause pain, I make it rain. 
I'm wearin' and tearin' down to the last grain. 
Ha, I'm not a chocolate brother, but I don't' mourn, 
'Cause I swear this vanilla kid got it goin' on. 
So don't even step to me if you're worth nothin', 
Because I just might hurt somethin'. 
My competition thinks twice, 'cause yo, for a young nigga, I'm kinda nice...

Maybe slightly, I’m crazy might be
Really shady, sheisty not like this though
I’m sleepin' again, this dude breaks in with a pistol
I heard his bullet whistle, so I had to roll of on this flo'
Heard a struggle then my auntie scream, I’m feelin' for my piece
Then, just my luck, my birthday gift that I got wasn't in my reach
The gunman busted in my room lookin' for somethin'
Found me hidin', pointed the gun right at my head, my heart was pumpin'
Then he turned and ran away then with a blink of an eye
He was gone, I found my auntie shakin', hidin' in the closet, I’m thinkin' ""Why?""

But still, a lot of things you showed this kid was so wrong
But what's so right, this pain and strife that I go write
People go buy it, they think that my flow's tight
Got a cold mic, they got me a million sold twice
Not a low-life anymore it’s always sold-out show nights
After K.O.D. you scared me, so I ran from you
Then accepted you on Seepage, then saw the fans come through
Just when I thought I took everything I can stand from you
I kept writing and then we watched the Strangeland come true
So now I see, these stories in my life
I was meant to share my darkness within my light
People say it helps them to see me fly
From the bottom, that’s motivation for them all, now I see exactly why

Things getting strange like up an down 
If you could read my mind it's hard to find
I said I want you back but this is no regret 

It's my point of view and I'm going through 
So take me away just for one day
I've never seen someone like you before
In my dreams I saw you standing there

I'm going out no more since I heard the news
There's someone you choose 
I can't believe what they said
That's why I feel so bad 

Morning, noon and night 
My thoughts run circles without any purpose
I can't stand no more - it's like circus
I want to repeat, there's nothing wrong I've done

She's the sun 

If I think of the past life is so fast
Those memories keep me alive and I will survive 
Even if I'm here and left without 
Is there any secret? do you think we'll keep it?

Life's so strange if you know what I mean
There's no one I've seen before like you
To be honest, I didn't expect something like this
It's you I miss now and forever

You and me together 
That's what we thought our life should be
I never could imagine this would happen to me
You feel better now you said it's what I cannot belive

Coffee isn't my cup of tea",And No Matches,2007
Scooter,"Jumping is an ability that most humans and many animals share to some degree.
It is the process of getting ones body off the ground for a short time using only ones own power
Usually by propelling oneself upwards by contraction and then forceful extension of the legs
In some cases the height of a jump may be increased by using a trampoline
Or by pushing down with the arms whilst playing leapfrog
One can jump up to reach something high
Or jump over a fence or ditch
Or jump down and one can jump whilst dancing
And as a sport
But jump also is the synonym for an exciting style of dancing just to freak out for sometime
Now listen to the sounds of Michael, Rick and the Chicks Terminator.
Please Jump

Bust in tight, front to back

Filled with options so don't ask

That these bad bitches on us
Ah! Killing y'all, pow!

Take ‘em home and let them hoes
Go live out their fantasies
They're popping pills, I'm rolling weed
Even got a couple bad bitches overseas (seas, seas, seas, seas)

You can call it pro flow
Every shot a straight flush

To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings.
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control.

Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear.

""To the ba with the ba"", that street-talk game,

If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here,

With another wack rapper tied to your back,
And if you want to hang yourself out to dry,
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky.

I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock.
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,
But I carry out orders from no man,

'Cause anything you want to do, I already did.

When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind

And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash.
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away.
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away.

You're right.
There is no diff between me and you
Except I look good and you look through.
Take that.

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene.
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards,
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds,

But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone.
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone,
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight,

And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss,
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us.
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you,

But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive.
For eternity, the source is alive.

You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator, 
Forever in a world of you and a girl,
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl.

You must spread the words of the master teacher.
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you.
The words are a gift we will never flaunt.
That's why we're gonna get everything we want.

Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme,
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense,

See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show.
With King Lu, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio,
Kamikaze Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night,

So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave.
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh.

I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess.
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die,

So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop.

And not only that,

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory,
How I rocked the children and the young ladies.
I even rocked the country that was overseas

'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew.
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you.
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, why'all, all night long,
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said,

""Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said, 
""Let me rock you, that's all I want to do. 
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said.
""Let me me rock you 'cause I feel for you.

Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you want to do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I want to do.
I want to love you, want to hug you, want to squeeze you too,

So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka.
I'll make you more than just a physical spell.
I want to rock you, Chaka baby, 'cause my name is Mellie Mel.""

I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme.
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy.

I was born to be the king of the be-bop swing,
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings.
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control.

I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear.
See, before my reign, it was the same old same,
""To the ba with the ba"", that street-talk game,

So if you ever, let me make this clear,
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here,
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in,
Huh huh, you better think again, my friend

Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down!

Step, step, step, step, step off.)

Well, I'm Kieth Cowboy and you're my cow,
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan.
You won't even get bread and butter, my man.

Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back,
And if you want to hang yourself out to dry,
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky.

I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock.
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock.
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,
But I carry out orders from no man,

'Cause anything you want to do, I already did.
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid,
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And tricks are for kids so I left your ass back.

The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another.
I buy a mansion for my mother.
The 24/7, the cool-Aid smile,
Say, ""Hey, crack a lemon and look at my pile.""

[Chorus]

Come on.
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand,
Because I look good.

Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand.
One girl at a time get an MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?

If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind

And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash.
You need to go to the bank and get some cash

A nauseating way to say goodbye 
Autumn eye come and shift the winter seesaw 
Dark high I can't side with another lifestyle 

C'mon now 
Remember every day 
It never went away 

I been burnin' the candle at both ends sober 
With an over-intoxicated mind 
Lend me just one reason to live life solo 
Oh no I can't side without you in my lifetime

Rest my head in a better place I call home 
Up high I can't side without you in my lifeline

Scorpions,"I remember when my teacher said,
""How you want to make your life?""
I said, ""I can play guitar
And it will be alright   listen!""

When I came out of school
They said, ""Which way you want to go?""
But there was no way strong enough
Compared with rock 'n roll
To get the same thrill

Anyhow I've found a job
They tried to break me with their rules
But they had no chance at all
'Cause I knew what to do
To get the same thrill like rock 'n roll

I had a feeling they couldn't buy
Still got that feeling they still can't buy,
They still can't buy,
They still can't buy

Tell me the alternative
To what I'm doing, but I guess
There's no other way of life
Which is strong like this
To get the same thrill like rock 'n roll",The Same Thrill,1984
Scorpions,"Arrive at seven the place feels good
No time to call you today
Encores till eleven then Chinese food
Back to the hotel again

I call your number the line ain't free
I like to tell you come to me
A night without you seems like a lost dream
Love I can't tell you how I feel

Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again

Another morning another place
The only day off is far away
But every city has seen me in the end
And brings me to you again

Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again",Always Somewhere,1984
