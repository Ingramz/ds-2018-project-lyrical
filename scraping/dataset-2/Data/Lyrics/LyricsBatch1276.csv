Willie Nelson & Friends,"Well it's cloudy in the morning gonna be raining in the afternoon
Cloudy in the morning and it's gonna be raining in the afternoon
If you don't like this rainy weather you better pack your bags and move
But if you're running from it brother the only road that I can see
If you're running from it brother the only road that I can see
Is the road that leads to nowhere and nowhere is a fool like me
Rain keep a falling falling round my window pane
Rain keep a falling falling round my window pane
Ain't never seen so much rainy weather guess I'll never see the sun again

Save those dimes and nickels save 'em for a rainy day
Save your dimes and nickels save 'em for a rainy day
It ain't gonna keep the rain from coming but at least you know you've paid your way
Rain rain rain keep a falling...",Rainy Day Blues,
Willie Nelson & Friends,"Now I lay me down to sleep
And if I sleep, perhaps I'll dream.
If I dream, I'll be with you,
In the shelter of your arms.
I pray that god will lengthen night,
And grant me time before the light.
For the light of day will take me
From the shelter of your arms.

And though I know it's just a dream,
A dream that soon must end,
The arms I feel, I know are real,
And I'm happy, once again.

If I die, while I am asleep,
I pray my dreams he'll let me keep,
And carry me through eternity
In the shelter of your arms.

And though I know it's just a dream,
A dream that soon must end,
The arms I feel, I know are real
And I'm happy, once again.

And if I die while I am asleep,
I pray my dreams he'll let me keep,
And carry me through eternity
In the shelter of your arms",Shelter of Your Arms,
Willie Nelson & Friends,"Slow down slow down old world 
There's no hurry cause 
My life ain't mine anymore
I lived too fast 
Now it's too late to worry 
And I'm too blue to cry anymore
I once was a fool for the women 
Now I'm just a fool nothing more

The toast is burning

There's just so much to do 
Since you've gone
Too much to do all alone
My tie's lost 

I can't find the sweater 
There's the doorbell 
I hope that's your letter
My head aches 

I hope I feel better

Since you've gone
Too much to do all alone

Your problem is clear now to me.
You think that the whole world's against you,

Though trouble surrounds you, an' you long to be heard,
Just suffer in silence, like me. 

I'll give you a lesson in living,
And I hope it stays with you a while.
You're the reason for all of your sorrows,

With the day that we met
The day that we parted

How it feels when you lose

But wrong when you held another tight
So before you go away and leave me lonely
If you can't undo the wrong undo the right

You can't undo what's done why do you try
So please help me to face the new tomorrows

While you make up your mind just what you want to do
They say that things worthwhile are worth waiting for
And you're worth so much to me, I'll wait for ever more

Then came the parting time, I watched you go
But you said perhaps, in time, our love could still be
So this is the waiting time, and I'll just wait and see

No crib for His bed

The cattle are lowing
The poor Baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes

I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my side
'Til morning is nigh

Be near me, Lord Jesus

Willie Nelson & Friends,"The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep.

Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came
From the country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went.

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Let men their songs employ
While fields and rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy

And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders, of His love

Willie Nelson & Friends,"Well a man come on the 6 o'clock news
Said somebody's been shot, somebody's been abused
Somebody blew up a building, somebody stole a car
Somebody got away, somebody didn't get too far yeah
They didn't get too far

Grandpappy told my pappy, back in my day, son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas find a tall oak tree,
Round up all them bad boys hang them high in the street
For all the people to see

That justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces singing
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
Too much corruption, and crime in the streets
It's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send 'em all to their maker and he'll settle 'em down
You can bet he'll set 'em down

'Cause justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
We'll all meet back at the local saloon
And we'll raise up our glasses against evil forces singing
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

You know justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line

Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted

Through the ages I'll remember

Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again

Willie Nelson & Friends,"I'm sitting in the railway station.
Got a ticket for my destination.
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.

Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, 
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

And I knocked on my door
And I called to my love 
As I often had before

No voice called my name
And I couldn't believe it was true 
Oh Lord, I couldn't believe it was true
And my eyes filled with tears 
And I must have aged ten years
And I couldn't believe it was true

I am quivering yet 
I'll try to forgive 
But I cannot forget

Is another man's gain
And her happiness always

And you fill such a big empty space

In my old sharecropper's one room country shack
They said my mommie left me the day before she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back

And I just like to mention that my grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why I'm standing here today
I got all my country learning and a milking and a churning
Picking cotton raisin' hell and baling hay

I been to Georgia on a fast train honey
I wouldn't born no yesterday
I got a good Christian raisin' and an eight grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

And now sweet Carolina, I don't guess
I'll ever find another woman put together like you are
With your wiggle and you're walking and your big city talking
And your brand new shiny Plymouth rag top car

Hey, let's hurry up and wait in this world of give and take
It seems like haste it makes me waste every time
I declare to my soul when you hear those ages roll
You better know I get my share of mine

Willie Nelson & Friends,"I'd have to be crazy
To stop all my singing
And never play music again

You'd call me a fool
If I grabbed up a top hat
And ran out to flag down the wind

I'd have to be weird
To grow me a beard
Just to see what the rednecks would do

But I'd have to be crazy
Plum out of my mind
To fall out of love with you

Now I know I've done weird things
I told people I heard things
When silence was all that abounds

Been days when it pleased me
To be on my knees
Following ants, as they crawled across the ground

I've been insane on a train
But I'm still me again
The place where I hold you is true

So I know I'm alright
'Cause I'd have to be crazy
To fall out of love with you

Now I don't intend to
But should there come a day
When I say that I don't love you
You can love me away

I sure would be dingy
To live in an envelope
Waiting alone for a stamp

You'd swear I was loco
To rub for a genie
While burning my hand on the lamp

And I may not be normal
But nobody is

Willie Nelson & Friends,"The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a ragin' black stallion
And walkin' behind was a bay
The red-headed stranger had eyes like the thunder
And his lips, they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
An' watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancin' bay pony
Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse that his little lost darlin'
Had ridden when she was his wife

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern
An' looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink, an' he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
An' laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free, of course
For you can't hang a man for killin' a woman
Who's tryin' to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the ragin' black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay

Don't cross him, don't boss him

We knew they would cry when we said goodbye 
And I'd rather leave quietly instead
We can never be happy 
We both know it's true
We've quarrelled from the day that we met
Our love was too weak to pull our dreams through 
But too strong to let us forget
I hope we can salvage a few memories 
To carry us through the long nights
The clock's striking midnight 
Yesterday's gone and there's no tomorrow in sight

With harsh words that burned to the core

And strengthened the walls even more

A maze made of iron and stone.
A labyrinth complete, 
With edges that cut through the bone.

They come by the millions, 
The hipster, the prince and the clown.
They come ?cause they know that
Something?s going down?
On the streets of New York.

The streets of New York
Wind and turn in their own crooked way.
A motherless child, 
So reckless at work and at play.

Still-born buildings abound, 
Corporations of steel, 
Long lines at the lost and found
All serve to reveal?

The streets of New York
Have faces only mothers could love.
From rich boys in silk, 
To panhandlers who can?t get enough.

Drifters ride on the subways, 
Hustlers roam through the night.
Tourists come back again and again
Until they get it right?
On the streets of New York.

The streets of New York
Unfold like a matchmaker?s dream.
Day becomes night, 
Through canyons of concrete and steam.

Juliet on the rooftops, 
Romeo underground.
Late at night when their lips meet, 
You can?t hear a sound?
On the streets of New York.

The streets of New York
Have places where two hearts can meet.

Or down here on Revington Street.

Meet me in Washington Square.

And I?ll hold you in the air?

Willie Smith,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Good always overpowered the evils 
Of all man's sins...

And our cities fell to slums 
While evil stood strong 
In the dusts of hell 
Lurked the blackest of hates 
For he whom they feared 
Awaited them... 
Now many many life times later 
Lay destroyed beaten beaten down 
Only corpses of rebels 
Ashes of dreams 
And blood stained streets...

Willie Tee,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love [#][*],2005

Willie the Kid,"Alright Mr. Thanksgiving
It's for the money this time (Drama)

Howdy do motherfuckers, it's Weezy Baby
Niggas bitchin' and I gotta tote the cannon
Listen close I got duct tape and rope
I'll leave you missin' like the fuckin' O'Bannons
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin'
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit
Got it?
One egg short of the omelet
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it
Bet that baby
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes
Get back get back boy this a set back
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it comes to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap
You're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga fee
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again

Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for ya
Nigga talk to the (cannon)
Have a few words with the (cannon)
Tell it to my mother fuckin' (cannon)

Ayo
I make it hard for rap niggas I'm peer pressure
Matter fact I'm motivation to rap better
I show niggas how to act how to dress better
I stay fresh more fitted caps than bat catchers
I'm the crack 
The smack 
The gun 
The rule 
The gat 
The strap 
The gun 
The tool 
The motherfuckin' (cannon)
Other words I'm the real, for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill
The deal is sealed
Niggas ain't real as Will cause I'm a (cannon)
And I handle well pedal like Cannondale
And I got the fifty cal mag its a hand-held
I'm tellin' you niggas I pop put a shell in you niggas
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas
I got whores in the cannon camcorder bendin' over
Blowin' game by the quarter weed over in the Rover nigga

From Philly to where I'm landin I'm a cannon
And I'm on that Philly fire shit
Then I come fully equipped
You try me get bodied keep the shawty in the whip
If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him
Sing a long da da da di I'm free got the butters 
Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada
Homie know I'm inside of your house
Tie up your brother
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will
Roll over ya squad like I'm a one punch card
You chumps, you best call General Motors
I will, take control of your soldiers
You wont listen till I toss them in the wok like chicken
General toaster

This rap shit like diggin' in the register, dealin' with big embezzlers
Get it right, I'm better and better than my competitors
Ahead, another level up, me, I'm worth eleven plugs
I can stop rappin', ain't I already said enough?
The whole motherfuckin' game owe me, time to settle up
If I move forward a little slower, you'll be catching up
Man that's the shit you need to listen for
'Cause where I'm from niggas dumb, they'll give you what you're itching for
It's a issue with you, best to handle your business, bro
'Cause ain't no politicking when killas comin' to get you, bro
Hey, although, they don't know the whole fire
In the dark, shoot sparks like rim with no tire
I don't deal with the lames, I'd much rather blow by ya
They known to spit a lot of hot air like blow dryers
And I'm really off the wire, look at me, I'm on fire
Here's some useful information if you don't know sire
Snort that cake (cake), and I'm not fake (fake)
So you should strongly consider doin' an about-face
And if not all you gotta say is you wanna get busy
And I'm down, get wit' me, any time, pick a city

Willie the Kid,"Yeah, Willie The Kid
Bright lights, street lights

Summertime in apartment 409,
Had to clean up the kitchen with 409,
It Was cookin' up work, while my granny at work
My big cause he ain't understand me at first,
He said, the court room or the casket,
I'm like dude, either way you need cash and a nice suit,
The street lights where I found my strength
Be with four rich men, and you bound to be the fifth
Let's go

I lost my daddy at a early age,
Told my mama don't cry for me,
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, oh how much different my life would be,
But that's in my dreams, back to reality,
Tryna get outta these street lights, so I won't have to live this street life,

No more, no more 
No more, no more no

Just gotta learn to deal with problems,
If you're young and from slum with no father,
Got killed when you was little, still got mama,
She try to tell him go to school, but why bother
When gettin' paid is the only way to solve 'em
Seems the stars get farther and farther
Out of my reach, out of these streets,
Will they ever make it big

Cause I lost my daddy at a early age,
Told my mama don't cry for me,
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, 
Oh how much different my life would be,
But that's in my dreams, back to reality,
Tryna get outta these street lights, 
So I won't have to live this street life,

No more, no more 
No more, no more no

I ain't ashamed to say that I shed a tear
Thinkin bout my dad I wish I had him back,
I'd give up everything just to have him here,
After this storm and rain I have no fear,
Gotta keep holdin on, hold my head up strong,
I know it won't be long until we'll be together again, foreal

I'm livin' for the moment
If I could turn back the days
Sure, you could turn this back
Hey, I was born with the hustle, never been a sucker
Daddy wasn't in the crib, dat made me tougher
Momma struggled with the bills, dat made me stuff up
Powder in a sack, which made me dumber
Now I'm standin' on the corner, bag full of Marijuana, Crack
Pistol my pocket for anybody who disrespect
In the trap chillin' where robbers and killers, kick it at
My arms up in the feds for ten, they say I'm goin' in
Ha, bet dat I'm a stretch that, backish to this rappers
Show these niggas what I'm best at
Get a lil' check, flip it and invest that
Years later, oh now you see what my heads at
Like meals chasers, we be everywhere the bread at
You keep on hatin', you'll be layin' where the dead at
You rappers suckers, you can tell them that I said that
If nothin' else but the hustle, you gon respect that

Oh yeah
I lost my daddy at a early age,
Told my mama don't cry for me,
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, 
Oh how much different my life would be,
But that's in my dreams, back to reality,
Tryna get outta these street lights, 
So I won't have to live this street life,
No more, no more
No more, no more
No

Guess, this is my life
And I wanna live it right

It might just make him wanna' act up a little bit

""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

Willie Torres,"You came, I was alone
I should have known you were temptation
You smiled, luring me on
My heart was gone, you were temptation
It would be thrilling 
If you were willing
If it can never be
Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours

Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation
You were born to be kissed
I can't resist.

You are temptation and I am yours
Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part

Willie Weeks,"I took a long, long trip to the city
I was determined to get somewhere
I spent all my hard earned money

Big bayou where did you go
To the river that's running slow
And to the Gulf of Mexico

I took a cotton picking job in Memphis
And the people there treated me good
But my luck run bad in Nashville

Gotta find a way

Now that we've laid it on the line
Linger a while and the truth
Linger a while on the lies
Won't you come and see me in my dreams?

Oh why lead me on?

Willie Weeks,"I got lost when I found you
Chained and bound and loving it too
Change [Incomprehensible] is what made that stormy day
You change my ways

Now my love is all about give and take
It's all about accepting what you need out of life
So you pay the price, if the price is right

You need me just as bad as I need you
We both playing games, but who's fooling whom?
Breaking up and starting all over again
Is a waste of time if we're gonna hold our feelings in

What you need out of life
So you pay the price, if the price is right
It's all about accepting what you need
What you need out of life, what you need
So you give a little for what you like, what you like

Fall down, accepting what you need out of life
So you give in a little for what you like

How you do it, you'll do it right

Willie Weeks,"This is a strange affair
The time has come to travel 
But the road is filled with fear
This is a strange affair
My youth has all been wasted 
And I'm bent and grey with years
And all my companions are taken away
And who will provide for me 
Against my dying day
I took my own provision, 
But it fooled me and wasted away

Oh where are my companions?
My mother, father, lover, friend, and enemy
Where are my companions?
They're prisoners of death now, 
And taken far from me
And where are the dreams I dreamed 
In the days of my youth
They took me to illusion when they 
Promised me the truth
And what do sleepers need to make them listen,
Why do they need more proof?
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Won't you give me an answer?
Why is your heart so hard 
Towards the one who loves you best?
When the man with the answer
Has wakened you, and warned you, 
And called you to the test
Wake up from your sleep that builds 
Like clouds upon your eyes
And win back the life you had 
That's now a dream of lies
Turn your back on yourself and if you follow,
You'll win the lover's prize
This is a strange, this is a strange affair",Strange Affair,1993
Willie Williams,"That big eight wheeler rolling down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't coming back
I'm movin' on I'll soon be gone
You were flying too high for my little old sky so I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the Southland we're coming to you
We're movin' on oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me so I've set you free and I'm movin' on

Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
I've got a pretty woman in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal let the black smoke roll keep rollin' me on

I warned you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
I'm movin' on I'm rollin' on
You broken your vow and it's all over now so I'm movin' on

But some day baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on stayed away too long
I'm through with you too bad you're blue so keep movin' on

A suitcase of heartache
Another sad scene on the way

A string of bright trophies
Throwing a new love away every day

It must be the angel in her kiss
That makes him the devil in her arms

The winter took her baby away
Stitched up her dreams
With Italian seams
And buried the needle away

Willing Sinners,"Way back then I was a champion
A fighter in the ring
And all the crowds would cheer
My praises they would sing
Now I am a forgotten man
A hobo out alone
No champ to push me on
Nothing, no-one to call my own

I was a dark eyed boy
Stars in his eyes
Promises made flesh and blood
Grip of arm
And granite charm
Oh, times were golden
Times were good
Sinew young
And skin of ore
Molten and streaming with dreams
Now I nod away the days
Barely remembering names it seems

Oh, I would smile
To hear the bell
Ringing out my glory
Like a bull I paced the ring
My bloody territory

I held on high
The fist in glove
The symbol of my power
Now I wait
A punch drunk fool
To fade away forever

Broken noses
Broken jaws
And many broken hearts
An idol
And a hero
Till my courage fell apart
And now my brain a-ringing
With the final bell and count
They hold my hand up limply
Told the world
That I was OUT!
I didn't mind the scars
The blood
The crushing of the hand
But to lose a nation's
Love, respect
Is something I'll never understand

Willing Sinners,"Over there
In the cold
Stands the Hustler
His eyes are old
He has seen a million ugly scenes
Places where men droop with mould
The backrooms
Where soiled goods are sold
Seen with opened eyes since frail fifteen
He has found it hard at first
But on his brow there sits a curse
For when the young must suffer
At the hands of men

Memories of Christmas past
Were never there to ever last
Things as were can never
Be again

Over there
By the wall
Stands the Hustler
He's not very tall
He's trampled by the jaded by the sly

He's seen the darker side of men
First fascinated and then
He found his urge to laugh
An urge to cry

He'll find close friends
No friend at all
He feels so lonely, tired and small
How few are chosen from
The golden call

There's something in us all it seems
To crave adventure
Hunt for dreams
But corruption the seducer spoils our schemes
And surely as the snow will melt

Grabs his soul and heads for home
With lessons learnt under his belt

Over there

Leaving red sunsets
To end our passion play
Bitter allows

Oh Melancholy Rose

Always running away

Turning cigarette ash grey
Sprawled across troubled beds
Hands outstretched
Reaching for the pills
In lonely rundown motels

Dust to dust
Disaster after disaster
Must be some dark kiss on your lips
A promise of heaven or hell in your song
Tomorrow it'll all be gone be gone

In search of his heaven now
Heaven knows why

On my wings I made
Out of sorrows I threw away, away
Maybe, I'll be back one day

I built my wings today
So I say
Please wait for me

Is something nobody can take away

Framed in candles
And white white light

To love again
But sorrow always comes
To those with fickle fame

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

We are consumed by corruption
Old before our time
Hurt by others' hunger
Scarred by love as greed (how I need)
How cruel the birthday of 17
Youth behind you
The long years ahead
Showing you what you might have been
Instead of drifting, drifting, drifting

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

Foundations crumble
Walls subside
We all break apart
When there's heartache inside
Hold back those years
Those tears
With a futile pride (we're gonna come clean)
Beware of love
And of dark-eyed men
They're sweet and they're tender
But they have no hearts
Just long smashed
Cruel shards of broken glass

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

And all those songs
That made me cry
Keep flooding back
And years of new discovery and you
Disturbing my dreams
Now we're flowing down that river
Heading for the delta
I don't know which way to flow
But my heart's a forest fire
And yours a field of snow

Don't know which way
Don't know which way
To flow",The River,1987

She sings my sad then happy heart
How I loved any kind of love
And you the love of art

I painted walls flamenco orange
You painted me in greys and charcoals

I was happy, but then I had you

I saw it once so I know it's true
You let it out on Sundays when
You let it beat me black and blue
When you went and stole my heart
I saw it go so I know it's true
It was a ruby, ruby, ruby red
It was the most precious gift I could give to you

It was as red as the sun in the evening sky
It was as red as the fire in a panther's eye
It was as red as the rose under the summer sun
Like a fire from a killer's gun

Ruby, ruby red
Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head
Oh, Ruby, ruby, ruby red

You let it go so I know it's true
It was a ruby, ruby, ruby red
It keeps me warm when I'm feeling sad and blue

It was the most precious jewel
I could give to you
Colour me red when I'm feeling blue
The colour of a kiss
In a young girl's dream
The mark of a guillotine
A drop of blood from a single thorn
Red wet sheets in the afternoon
A red light leading to my tomb
Ruby red all around my room

Curtains closed
And a bolted door
Breaking every law

The dress will be just fine

To think about the road I've run the miles I've come
There is a bed where troubles melt away
My lonely hours or hours with you
The times that we've come through

There is a bed where we shared times of love
And out of love those nights are memories best forgot
We argued about trivial things
And slept apart a wall we built among the sheets

There is a bed where sickness left its touch
And fever damp the sheets where I would shake all night
Cold burning on my brow
Hallucinations here and now
A fight to live or die

There is a bed where first we both made love
And left the marks, reminders of how good it felt
The hard, the soft, the sweat in midnight's hour
We built the fort, we climbed the tower

There is a bed where years will make us wise
Truth and lies defeat, despise and forgiving
The sheets our cradle birth to death
The twists and turns of love, the life we're living

There is bed where nights I lay awake
To think about my future to forget my past
My bed a boat to sail the seas
To land where safety finds me gripping to the mast

And though I feel the years slip through my fingers
Sorrow lingers and won't go away
There is a bed that is my sanctuary
A bed where I can end my days

I use to sit and watch the Flinstones, Gucci rolls and herringbones
Bezel sets and baguettes, while talking on my cell phone
From Bo-Bo's to Air Macs, low cars to horse backs
Hoopties to Cadillacs, water guns to chrome gats
Levis to Guess jeans, black and white to big screens
Six by nine to 18's, Bumsalack to sipping lean
Regals with white walls, 20 inch with screens fall
Michael Jackson off the wall, to MJG and 8Ball
Screw house to wrecking flows, to BET on videos
Zig-zags and yellow bags, to Glad sacks and optimos
Fist fight to gun play, sawed-offs to a.k.'s
Spitting flows at talent shows, as the H-A-W-K
Riding on the Metros, pushing a six double O
Smoking cess to endo, fill it up with petro
Fixing on my lego, let go of my ego
Get in with my little bro, getting up when the rooster blow

I remember Kangaroos and afro curls, always running after girls
Trying to sneak in Natural World, BB gun shooting at the squirrels

Roller skate now roller blades, Ivy Leagues to holding fades
Blow-Pop rings and diamond things, herringbones to bezeltines
Cadillacs to limousines, ironing jeans to being clean
GI Joes to Tonka toys, eating Willy Wonka boy
Riding in my uncle's car, wanting to become a star
Having dreams to be like Mike, hooping in my all black Nikes
Flying kites and shooting dice, sneaking in the movies twice
Staying up and watching Cops, walking outside in Michael socks
Being afraid of chicken pox, check my bowl on Magnavox
Running up and down my block, sweating cause the sun is hot
I use to ride the city bus, now I'm pulling Hummers out

I remember brothers getting dumped off, in ditches and bayous
Boys gave head jobs, and all I saw was hairdo's
Pimps drove Lacs and dob hats, with chrome gats
Hustlers stack paper, with the players and macs
Police burns in the hood, because somebody just got jacked
Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back
Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack
Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors
Ballers went from stabs, to buying more of consumers
I use to eat on tuna, now it's shrimp and caviar
I use to be a virgin, now I have menage tois
I use to drink on soda, now I'm sipping mixed with bar
I use to stay in the ghetto, now I'm a ghetto superstar

Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off
Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off
Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up
Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up
We had ice on us, merchandise on us
Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us
Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it
Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded
From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block
When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block
Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty
Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty

Willy Chirino,"Cuando la tarde se pone en el malecón
Eva se está preparando para la acción
Acechando a los turistas que hay en La Havana
Por unos dolares, les vende su manzana
La minifalda te enseña hasta el infinito
Mientras se va caminando por el circuito
Donde los fulas te compran lo que tu quieras
Ábranle paso a Eva, La Jinetera

Tiene sólo 17 primaveras
Y más aventuras que Tarzán
Detrás de la risa de la Jinetera
Eva está llorando por su Adan

Tiene un cuartito pequeño por Lujanor
Donde esta noche se lleva lo que ganó
Así alimenta a su hijita de 7 meses
Las apariencias nunca son lo que parecen
Su novio era un estudiante que militaba
En el partido que parte a quien no lo alaba
Después de ver la mentira se convenció
Y en 4 tablas y un remo, a la Yuma huyo

Tiene sólo 17 primaveras
Y más aventuras que Batmán
Detrás de la risa de la Jinetera
Eva sigue llorando por su Adan

Y cuando el sol reaparece en el malecón
Vuelve la misma rutina y la situación
De vivir en una tierra, donde el futuro
Salió nadando después de brincar el muro
No quiero que mi canción te traiga tristezas
Y toma lo que te digo como promesa
Que pronto, pronto en mi tierra estaré cantando
Porqué yo se que La Havana me está esperando

Porque yo se que La Havana me está esperando
Todos juntos cantaremos
Nuestro día viene llegando
Porque yo se que La Havana me está esperando
Beny sonreirá, lo estaremos recordando
Porque yo se que La Havana me está esperando
Todos los cubanos alzen la bandera, La Havana espera
Porque yo se que La Havana me está esperando
Yo me voy a pie, yo me voy nadando
Porque yo se que La Havana me está esperando
Mambo

Canten todos, pero canten con ganas, mi coro
Oh Havana,Oh Havana
Ya está llegando la hora de que suenen tus campanas
Oh Havana,Oh Havana

Toda la gente irá llegando, mi pueblo estará cantando
Y los vecinos asomándose por la ventana

Comenzará un nuevo día, Cuba Libre y soberana

Para bañarme en tus aguas, para sentir tu calor
Yo voy soñando despierto, voy sintiendo la emoción
Con tu recuerdo se enciende la llama en mi corazón

Si no tengo tu presencia, ay
Yo me quisiera morir, cuando llega la mañana
Siento miedo de que todo fuera un sueño
Y no te encuentre junto a mí

Mía por siempre, mía tu eres
Porque te quiero, porque me quiere
Mía por dentro, mía por fuera
Mi sentimiento, mi compañera

Yo te encomiendo mi alma envuelta en una canción
La sangre quema en mis venas el rojo de esta pasión
Es puro el sencillo que traigo en este canto de amor
Querida, nunca te alejes, no me desprecies, por Dios

Si no tengo tu presencia, ay, yo me quisiera morir
Cuando llega la mañana
Siento miedo de que todo fuera un sueño
Y no te encuentre junto a mí

Mía por fuera

Tú y yo nacimos para besarnos
Para querernos, para vivir la vida juntos
Y no ha existido quien te ha querido como te quiero
Yo no me digas que no

Quiéreme por favor que si no me muero
Quiéreme por favor que si no me muero

Lo mismo te canto un son
Que te dedico un bolero
Quiéreme por favor
(Quiéreme)

Que si no me muero
Desde el momento en que te vi
Yo te he soñado para mí

Quiéreme por favor, quiéreme, quiéreme, quiéreme
Quiéreme por favor, quiéreme, quiéreme, quiéreme
Yo quiero tener primero, que si no me muero

¡Ay, bésame de enero a enero!, que si no me muero
Dame tu pasión y todito el corazón, que si no me muero
Quiero entregarte mi amor sincero, que si no me muero

Willy DeVille,"Well they all said Louise was not half bad
It was written on the walls and window shades
And how she'd act a little girl
A deceiver, don't believe her, that's her trade
Sometimes a bottle of perfume
Flowers and maybe some lace
Men brought Louise ten cent trinkets
Their intentions were easily traced
Yes and everybody knew at times she cried
Ah but women like Louise well they get by

Yes and everybody thought it kinda sad
When they found Louise in her room
They'd always put her down below their kind
Still some cried when she died this afternoon

Louise rode home on the mail train
Somewhere to the south I heard her say
Too bad it ended so ugly
Too bad she had to go this way

Ah but the wind is blowing cold tonight
Well goodnight Louise goodnight

Willy DeVille,"[Chorus:]
Oh Louise, yes you're the sweetest girl I know.
Don't you know now Louise, you are the sweetest girl that I know.
You made me run from Chicago
Oh, to the Gulf of Mexico.

Now you know Louise,
She's like a rolling stone.
Every time she leave a man,
He has to grieve alone.

Oh Louise, why don't you hurry home?
You know, I never had no good loving,
Oh Louise, since you've been gone.

Got a girl called Mamie,
Treat me nice and kind.
I don't care what she do
Because Louise is on my mind.

Louise ain't so good looking
And her hair ain't red,
But she cooks my breakfast
And I bring it to my bed.

'Cause when I sleep
I dream of places I would be
If I weren’t here right now

When they have things
That they cannot talk about

So they blow horns
In little clubs
With wine and cigarettes
That serve to hide the dirty forks

Willy Mason,"Look him in the eyes
There's no need to be scared
He's as powerless as you and me,
Though his face is well worn
And his clothes a bit torn
That don't mean that you shouldn't believe,
When he asks you your name
Says 'brother we're all here in the same game'
But you shrink back like he's a disease,
Yeah you shake and you moan
You say 'oh please take me home'
And the homeless all sing the reprise.

It's a hard hand to hold
That is looking for control
It is tempting to fight
When you know that you're right,
It's hard to lie down
When you don't trust the ground
It's hard to hold on,
It's hard to hold on.

Walking home again
There comes a battle with the wind
As it teases your previsions against shame,
Like all that wax in your hair
It becomes painfully clear
That as long as it's a fight, you'll never win,
And when you get to the door
You're still so busy fighting wars
That you can't look upon your lady as a friend,
You're trying so hard to be right
You miss the love in that first sight
And your lover feels alone once again.

It's a hard hand to hold
That is looking for control

It's hard to hold on.

Entering the liquor store
You try your hardest to ignore
That street sleeper on your left there all alone,
And the young man on your right
With unchained souls and love of night
You look so scared they laugh and wonder if your stoned,
But somewhere deep inside
They feel the pain they've learned to hide
Because that same fear has brought much trouble on their homes,
And they know you won't feel safe
Until that cop car wins its race
And another life is driven off its road.",Hard Hand to Hold,2004
Willy Mason,"The sun don't set in Gettysville
The place that I call home,
A thousand people walk these streets

To my mother's place.

She's got a thousand friends

Bitter and blind to all,
Shadows beneath his sunken eyes

Like burned and blackened photographs
Life's easier a dream,
He settles for a cheap escape
Forgets all he believed.

Things haven't always been this way.

I watched my whole world crumble
As I dried my mother's tears,
And learned to never stumble 
As I calmed my father's fears,

They say I've seen a lot
They say I'm wise beyond my years,
Though my castle may have crumbled
I won't face the world alone,

The youth has seen the rubble
And we're ready for the load,
As this city burns
My generation's shouting in the roads.

Willy Mason,"I will walk the road as long as the road goes
I will try to dodge the rock the valley throws
Revealer, caught a fever
We all have a sinking stone

And when the road presents a twisting case of fate
A meaner eye you need to contemplate
The season comes with a reason
We all have a setting sun

Distance, mark of distance
Your burden is your brilliance
There's a vessel, a hidden vessel in the stone

Difference, not indifference
Your passion marks you different
And you wrestle, and how you wrestle to come to know

The whispering light
The truth is awful quiet
Like it's whispering at night
Can tell you how to
Break the fever
With light
The truth is awful quiet
Like whispering in light
Can tell you how to

And light is less and light is more in some
For don't confuse the weather for the sun
Revealer, magic healer
And when will your vision come

And lightning rods will guide your journey home
And revelations from a fist of bones
And when the rock weighs heavy in your soul
Just tell her that you have earned the right to know

Revealer, how to break the fever
You carried in, like these demons your kin
And you'll render it secret then

Distance, mark of distance
Your burden is your brilliance
There's a vessel, a hidden vessel in the stone

Difference, not indifference
Your passion sparks resilience
And you wrestle, and how you wrestle to come to know

The whispering light
The truth is awful quiet
Like it's whispering at night
Can tell you how to
Break the fever
With light
The truth is awful quiet
Whispering at light
Can tell you how to
Break the fever
With light
The truth is awful quiet
Whispering at light

I just touched down in killa Cali,
Strapped up my boots,
Got scooped up by Game,
So I hopped up in the coupe,
Gaah, What up nigga
What the hell is goin on,
I'm tryin to ease back,
And get my head in the zone,
Where the fuck you tryin to go,
Nigga this yo city,
Anywhere, I'm just tryin to see some ass and titties,
So full mash the gas,
The night is young,
All bull shit aside,
I'm tryin to have some fun,
Hit the hop in Lakewood,
Or ride down Slawson,
Or to Casino,
they say it's just like Compton,
Really doesn't matter,
Long as shots don't ring out,
Nigga I stay strapped,
I don't wanna pull the thing out,
Well keep the heat heat,
right up under the seat,
and let's roll to Roscoe's,
And grab somethin to eat,
But check ya rear view mirror,
I swear somebody's following,
Rollin in that dark blue,
SS Impala and,
All up on tha bumpa,
Man I'm just sayin,
Tell me you know this nigga,
Naw they betta stop playin,
He sped up around,
And drove right in front of us,
Could be one time,
Just tryin to bust one of us,
Till he smashed the brakes,
And we almost hit him,
Throwin signs out the window,
like something was wrong with him,
Before we jump out,
And get ready to clown,
Nigga call up the homies,
It's about to go down

(Chorus)
Keep one eye open,
Cause the streets don't sleep,
If the streets get hungry,
Then the streets gon eat,
That's why I keep some heat,
And a couple of rounds,

And you know where I'm headed,
To the Lennox Mall,
To get it done head to toe,

Do it then, Keep it gangsta,
From the waist down,
And this chrome tre pound,
Got me feelin,
Atlanta brave now,
Right, disturbin the peace,
I'll let the lead spray,
I'm startin to love this place,
They even got red clay,
Okay, hit a different,
Strip club everyday,
And I don't make it rain,
It's a hurricane on the way,
And I got,
The A-town pump,
It'll make ya whole body,
Do the A-town stomp,
Then it's off,
To the waffle house,
And pancake mix,
Ain't the only thing,
coming out of mouth,
And the 42 D's,
Coming out her blouse,
So baby, daddy coming in,

And I really wanna pop em,

Then the streets gon eat,

Rien que dans la caisse, des basses

Une odeur de mort qu finit coup de cross,
Temps gris, dehors, mcoeure, sale dcor
Mon coeur, na plus le temps dtre triste ou dtre moqueur,
Le quart de notre vie, gaspille en fume,
Des envies de fou, sur le coup, viennent nous ronger,
Certains craquent, la pomme croque,

Saigne ce quon leur enseigne, ils sen foutent, 
Veulent la belle vie comme un joueur de foot

Willy Porter,"It was late one night on a Kentucky highway
Up ahead on the horizon
It was there before my eyes
I saw the glowing cross of Jesus Christ

I saw Jesus on the grille
Of a south bound Peterbilt
Catching bugs between his teeth
And glowing for everyone to see

He don't stop at those toll booths
The state troopers let him roll on through
Folks stop and stare at his long flowing hair
And his gold-capped tooth

I saw Jesus on the Grille
Rollin' down the interstate
And I know we won't be late, no, darling
With the potentate of hauling freight

Talking Jesus, riding on the Grille
Talking Jesus blessing every road kill
Talking Jesus giving points for good behavior
I've been redeemed by the 75 mph Savior
Tell it, mommy now

I saw him down at a roadside diner
With a soybean burger and a side of fries
A big old glass of chocolate milk
And a slice of apple pie

I saw Jesus, riding on the grille
I saw Jesus blessing every road kill
I saw Jesus giving points for good behavior
We've been redeemed by the 75 mph Savior
Tell it, baby, now, yeah

I saw Jesus on the grille
Rollin' through the cold Kentucky night
And I know we won't be late, no, darling
He's the potentate of hauling freight
He's the potentate of hauling freight

You know with Jesus we won't be late
Man, where's Moses?

Willy Porter,"Well, she hobbled up the porch steps
With her crutches and her broken leg
She missed me with a smile
Walked straight across my heart
And right on over to him

I said, ""Rita, I tried to call you""
Tim looked at me and he said, good night
I couldn't hold my tears as I stared up at the stars
In the August sky

I said, ""Rita, won't you come on in?
Hey, Rita, child, now, where ya been?""

She looked out into the night
Through the broken porch screen
She said she thought that we were closer
She expected more from me

I said, ""Now, honey, I thought about you
And all that you'd been through
But the day your daddy died
I just didn't know what to do""

""Rita, I see our trust is gone
How long do we have to pay
For what's been left undone?""

Rita takes her sandals off
And walks barefoot in the grass
With one arm around my shoulder
As if she were using me for balance

I said, ""Rita, I'd like to see you
Even if we're only friends
I know if you forgive me, Rita
I'll forget and you'll remember
You always remember""

",Rita,1995
Willy Porter,"She, she really loves simple things
Can't afford no diamond rings
And wouldn't wear 'em if she could
She, she hits me like a cool summer rain

Then she's gone on the wind
I can hear her whisper in the wood
I can hear the ocean
When I look into her eyes

My heart is swept away
Like a paper boat on the tide
I'm destined to run aground
With her by my side
Together we'll wake up
To a watercolor sunrise

She, she's been running in the rain
She's like whiskey on my brain
She makes me feel so high
She, she's got holes in her stockings
Now she's up and unlocking the door for me

No one really knows where she's from
She comes and she goes
Like a watercolor bleeds and runs away
What am I afraid of? Here she comes

She, she really loves simple things
Can't afford no diamond rings
And wouldn't wear them if she could
She, she's got holes in her stockings
Now she's on the back porch rocking
The baby to sleep

Across the foot of my bed
Crumpled sheets, two tired bodies
Sins I commit now in my head

I have cursed your name a thousand times or more
Your photograph lies deep at the bottom of my drawer
But when I looked at it this morning
I had no angry words to say, no angry words to say

The coffee maker that you gave me it finally broke down
It up and died this morning with a groaning sound
All these ghosts I have driven out, driven them from my house
It's a simple life I lead still got a lot to learn about

Yeah, but I'm finally getting over
Yes, I'm finally getting over yeah, I'm finally getting over
The sad part of yesterday no angry words to say

I learned a little 'bout forgiveness, learned a little 'bout sin
A little 'bout the soul of a man living within this skin
I ain't afraid of a new love that could be starting
And I don't wear a face that says I'm weary-broken-hearted
I don't need someone to smother with the love that you discarded

Such a welcome sight
I've got nothing in my pockets
Walk with me tonight

Old cars in the tall grass
Broken glass and chrome
Down along the railway
Behind my parent's home

Hiding in the sumac
Waiting for a train
Got a penny on the railway

Hello little moonbeam
I forgot your song
Every cross tie tells me
I've been gone too long

Seems to me
That you give your light so freely
Won't you shed your beams on me
I need you, little moonbeam

When I was a young boy
Balanced on this rails
I'd hold my jacket high, lord
Wind would fill my sail

Son besos a su orilla
Una mujer de Aguadilla
Vino a New York a cantar
Pero no solo a llorar
Un largo llanto y morir
De ese llanto yo nací
Como en la lluvia una fiera
Y vivo en la larga espera
De cobrar lo que perdí

Con un cielo que se hacía
Más feo mas mas volaba
A Nueva York se acercaba un peón de Las Marías
Con la esperanza decía
De un largo día volver
Pero antes me hizo nacer
Y de tanto trabajar se quedó sin regresar
Reventó en un taller

Y de una lágrima soy hijo
Y soy hijo del sudor
Y fue mi abuelo el amor único en mi regocijo
Del recuerdo siempre fijo
En aquel cristal de llanto
Como quimera en el canto
De un Puerto Rico de ensueño 
Y yo soy puertorriqueño sin na', pero sin quebranto

Y al echón que me desmienta
Que se ande muy derecho
No sea en lo mas estrecho de un zaguán
Pague la afrenta
Pues según alguien me cuenta
Dicen que la luna es una 
Sea del mar o sea montuna

She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

And with that, she watched her imprint grow
As seven bright stars lined up all in a row

""See, they were once like you
They climbed the valley walls
To hear the mountains' tales of unheard truths
But no one could have known
That they'd be taken one by one
By force of greatness all
They're just a moment too soon
Or a second too late
They were nothing more than a moment too soon""

""But what of fate?"" she cried
""Surely there is one who decides
Which way the wind turns in the morn?""
""My darling girl,"" he said
""There is no reason and no rhyme 
For those we love and those we bid goodbye
There is no reason and no rhyme
There is no reason, no alibi
For those we love and those we must bid goodbye

Whistling air
Whispering in my ear 
Boy Mercury shootin' through every degree
Ooo girl dancin' down those dirty and dusty trails
Take it hip to hip rocket through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss 
Roam if you want to
Roam around the world
Roam if you want to
Without wings, without wheels
Roam if you want to
Without anything but the love we feel 
Skip the air-strip for the sunset
Ride the arrow for the target---One
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss 
Fly the great big sky
See the great big sea
Kick through continents
Bustin' boundaries

Burned to the ground and left for dead
Only the darkness knows our names
Covered in black we walk thru flames

The bite from the dog that won’t back down

It’s time to raise your fists

I pop the clutch, drop the top on the benz
Roll around the block, cranking up The Weeknd
I see one in a Hummer and one in a rover
Their looking straight at me like ""Baby come over""

Yelling ""Cut the shit kid! I got somewhere to be!""

The winds that ride
On the high tide

And that's how the

You wanna pat your feet
And you've gotta move cause

Will it move you

It can groove, you, baby

You wore your mysterious cloak just like a child
No careless words were said

You said the ice would kill
But you would not be caught

My heart felt cold as a cowards 
You sent a southern breeze like forest fire
I heard those voices too
I dreamed each dream with you
We breathe as one together and shed our tears
But then I woke with you
And my dream came true
I'll never hold you here
I know when winter comes that you will disappear

She'll find the light and run all the way back home

From mystic eyes she looks at you if she wants to
But never will they tell you what's ahead
And though she may be cold, she doesn't want to hurt anyone
She just wants to live a life of her own

And she doesn't want to be alone
But she only wants to be at home
So it's better if she lives unknown, unknown
The voice inside her sings a different tone
Alone, 'cause no one understands her

Once the night's getting old and you think you're getting closer
You'll be the fool 'cause she's never gonna let you in

From mystic skies (mystic skies) the rains will fall when they want to
Sometimes it happens every single day (What will the moon say?)
Does she wanna spend the rest of her life just hiding out and hurting herself
When they come to the door now is she gonna let them in?

And she doesn't want to be alone
But she only wants to be at home
So it's better if she stays unknown (it's better) unknown
The voice inside her says she couldn't be wrong
She's alone, 'cause no one reprimands her

Try to look her in the eye
Try to look her in the eye
Try and look her in the eye
Try and look her in the eye
No, no, no, no, oh no

And she only wants to be at home
So it's better if she lives, unknown

cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, 
rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, 
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
'This could be Heaven and this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle 
and she showed me the way
There were voices down that corridor,
I thought I heard them say...

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
There's plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
you can find us here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, 
she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, 
that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, 
sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember, 
some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said,'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said 
'We are all just prisoners here of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, 
I was Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
'Relax,'said the night man,
We are programmed to receive.
And you can checkout any time you like,
but you can never leave!

So welcome to the Hotel California

The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why

Reading the news and it sure looks bad
They won't give peace a chance
That was just a dream some of us had
Still a lot are left to see
But I wouldn't want to stay here
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here
Oh, but California
California I'm coming home
I'm going to see the folks I dig
I'll even kiss a sunset pig
California I'm coming home

I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
Who did the goat dance very well
He gave me back my smile
But he kept my camera to sell
Oh the rogue, the red red rogue
He cooked good omelettes and stews
And I might have stayed on with him there
But my heart cried out for you, California
California I'm coming home
Oh make me feel good rock 'n roll band
I'm your biggest fan
California, I'm coming home

When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
Just gives you the blues
Just gives you the blues

So I bought me a ticket
I caught a plane to Spain
Went to a party down a red dirt road
There were lots of pretty people there
Reading rolling stone, reading vogue
They said, how long can you hang around? 
I said a week, maybe two,
Just until my skin turns brown
Then I'm going home to California
California I'm coming home
Will you take me as I am

Returns for us at last

Wilson Phillips,"I used to live in New York City;
Everything there was dark and dirty.
Outside my window was a steeple
With a clock that always said twelve-thirty.

Young girls are coming to the canyon,
And in the mornings I can see them walking.
I can no longer keep my blinds drawn,
And I can't keep myself from talking.

At first so strange to feel so friendly 
To say good morning and really mean it 
To feel these changes happening in me,
But not to notice till I feel it.

Young girls are coming to the canyon,
And in the mornings I can see them walking.
I can no longer keep my blinds drawn,

Vibrations bounce in no direction,
And lie there shattered into fragments.

Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

You know its gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
And then we'd be happy

Well I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same

And the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barkin' at the two men who were gamblin'
In the dark

It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven
Billy swore that he threw eight
Stagger Lee told Billy
I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money and my brand new
Stetson hat

Stagger Lee went home
And he got his forty-four
Said, I'm goin' to the barroom just to pay that
Debt I owe

Stagger Lee went to the barroom
And he stood across the barroom door
He said, nobody move and he pulled his
Forty-four

Wilton Felder,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1992
