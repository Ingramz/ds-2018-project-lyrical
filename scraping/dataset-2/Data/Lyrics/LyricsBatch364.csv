Holly Brook,"You want to catch your breath you want to get out
But as you surface you don't really know how
How to live upon the solid ground
Sometimes it's easier to let yourself drown

LOVE IS
THICK LIKE
BLOOD LIKE
HONEY

You cannot spell it out there are no words
Mrs Johnson never taught me those verbs
On how to give myself and how to receive
It is something that's inside of you and me

LOVE IS
THICK LIKE
BLOOD LIKE
HONEY

Forget everything you ever learned
No one listens when you want to be heard
Just bleed the bittersweet

Seven sunrises and seven more nights
You'd think that we could learn to do it right
If nothing changes then I'm gonna stop
But do I really have a choice?
I think not",Like Blood Like Honey,2006
Holly Brook,"Saturday what a day what a silly little day
Time to kill take a pill as I sit and contemplate
How I'd like to be around all the people in the town
With their fancy cars and things
And I have got time

Stop pushing all your tragedies away
Each moment has got a lesson for the day
Take something with you
We can't drag our heels in yesterdays
Oh these Saturdays

In the haste in the grace I've had up to my waist
It isn't real what you feel when you find love in a chase
I've been waiting for the day when someone takes me away
And I'd never get replaced
But I have got time

Stop pushing all your tragedies away
Each moment has got a lesson for the day
Take something with you
We can't drag our heels in yesterdays
Oh these Saturdays
These Saturdays, oh

As I sink one more drink I am running out of ink
I'm feeling void paranoid about every little thing
And I wonder if I tried to give up and say goodbye
If I'll have the strength to leave
Cause I don't have much time anymore

Stop pushing all your tragedies away
Each moment has got a lesson for the day
Take something with you
We can't drag our heels in yesterdays

Oh these Saturdays
These Saturdays, now
These Saturdays now, baby",Saturdays,2006
Holly Brook,"You drank a bit down, spilled the rest of it in me
And that's the minute, I let go
Your direction with the bending of the light
If I remember it right

It carried on just fine
But tonight I will cry myself to sleep

Every rain makes its way into somebody's song
As a way to relieve the pain
This one is calling me out of my shelter
To face the truth but I still love

More than one time this color has been mine
To consume the energy
To be a painter and cover all the blue
I would give up wanting you

But still the morning sun, yeah
Will leak into my window when I'm done

Every rain makes its way into somebody's song
As a way to relieve the pain
This one is calling me out of my shelter
To face the truth but I'm still

Searching for my intuition
Even though I recognize
Myself in all these silver walls
But as I stare they all break me down

Every rain makes its way into somebody's song
As a way to relieve a pain
This one is calling me out of my shelter
To face the truth but I still love

I still love
",Still Love,2006
Holly Brook,"Painted eyes and empty streets
Taking it down
Selling perfect tragedies
Without a sound
Faded roses scattered on the ground

I will be wanted
I will not fall from grace
Daylight has waited
Just to live upon your face
I won't be haunted
I will not sleep to dream
All that I wanted
Has been right in front of me

I won't be haunted
I will not sleep to bleed
All that I wanted
Has been right in front of me

Now that I am coming to
Black from the fight
Shaking out the dusty blue
Into the night
And there will be no waving of the white

I will be wanted
I will not fall from grace
Daylight has waited
Just to live upon your face
I won't be haunted
I will not sleep to dream
All that I wanted
Has been right in front of me

All the hell just gets me higher than before
Now an angel has come knocking on my door
To tell me I can fly",Wanted,2006
Holly Brook,"Feeling like I can't forgive
But I want to
It's like I don't know how to live
I'm afraid to
I used to think, take them as they come
Without hesitation, no
Now it's like my head is filled with lies
And persuasions
As the sun begins to fall
I hear her calling out to me
She's saying, hurry it's one more day gone

What I wouldn't give just to forget
So I can remember how to live again
I want to live again

I'm feeling dissonant
And distracted
Toxic chemicals are spilling in my head
And they're bleeding deadly reactions
As the moon begins to rise
It shows me all the colours
That I'm hiding, I'm hiding myself

What I wouldn't give just to forget
What I wouldn't give to get some rest
So I can remember how to live again
I want to live again

Am I desperately losing this fight
When I should really be choosing my flight
Take me, take me, take me now

What I wouldn't give just to forget
What I wouldn't give to get some rest
So I can remember how to live again
I want to live again

What I wouldn't give just to forget
What I wouldn't give to get some rest
What I wouldn't give just to forget
So I can remember how to live",What I Wouldn't Give,2006
Holly Brook,"It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I can't take back the words I never said

I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip
Nine eleven building seven did they really pull it?
Uh, and a bunch of other cover ups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts then, wait here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it then they move you so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV all you see's a bunch of ""what the fucks""
Dude is dating so and so blabbering bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie that's the news
And these the same people that supposed to be telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either
I'ma part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful
And I believe in the people
Yeah

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said!
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I can't take back the words I never said

Now you can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better than we probably deserve it
Jihad is not a holy war, wheres that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam!
And you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the Kush went
Complain about the liquor store but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gone make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts, ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become an actor you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects
Take 'em when the pains felt
Wash them down with diet soda
Killin' off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the World
Would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment
They can take your home away

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said!
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said, never said
I can't take back the words I never said

I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said",Words I Never Said,2011
Holly Brook,"A man in my shoes runs a liar
All the papers lie tonight, 
That falling over you is the news of the day.
Aw angels fall like rain, 
And your love, is all of heaven away.
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade, 
The ghost in you, she don't fade.

The race is on I'm on your side, 
But hearing you my engines die, 
I'm in the mood for you, or for running away.
Oh the stars come down in you
And love, love, love, you can't give it away.
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade away
The ghost in you, she don't fade.
Inside you time moves and she don't fade away
Don't you know she don't fade away.

So don't you go, cause it makes no sense
That all these talking supermen
Just take away the time, just to get it away.
Ain't it just like the rain
Cause love, love, love, love, love, is only heaven away.
Inside you the time moves, and she don't fade
The ghost in you, she don't fade away.
Inside you time moves, and she don't fade
The ghost in you, she don't fade.

The man in my shoes runs a liar, 
All the papers lie tonight
That falling over you is the news of the day.
And love, will not fade away.
And love, love, love, will not fade away.",The Ghost in You,2012
Holly Cole,"Honey, honey, 
Oh, honey, listen to my plea: 

Every honeybee 
Fills with jealousy, 
When they see you out with me! 
I don't blame them, goodness knows, 
Oh, honey! suckle rose! 

When you're passin' by, 
Flowers droop and sigh 
And I know the reason why, 
You're my sweety, goodness knows, 
Oh, honey! suckle rose! 

I don't buy sugar, 
You just have to touch my cup; 
I don't need sugar, 
It's sweet enough when you stir it up! 
When I'm taking sips 
From your dainty lips, 
Seems the honey fairly drips, 
You're confection, goodness knows, 
Oh, honey! suckle rose.

Holly Cole,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, the chestnut trees, the wishing well
I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,1992
Holly Cole,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,1992
Holly Cole,"I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live
Are there lilac trees in the heart of town
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town
Does enchantment pour out of every door
No, it's just on the street where you live
And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The over powering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear
People stop and stare. They don't bother me
For there's no-where else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by; I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live
Can be here on the street where you live
Can be here on the street where you live",On the Street Where You Live,1992
Holly Cole,"I slow down, Purple Avenue
To march around in April's shoes
Weathervanes remind
Of the summertimes that I've left behind

Money's gone, for Auld Lang Syne
I spent on eastern standard time
Whatever happened to my roll
September fell right through the hole
All I've got is empty pockets now

Why does August try so hard
To hoist me on my own petard
I've learned one thing from how we were
That an ounce of prevention's worth a pound of cure

The shadows fall but I cannot thread
The tenor of the things you said
All that's left is flesh and bone
Lights are on but no one's home
All I've got is empty pockets now

I spill myself another drink
I count the silver in the sink
The orchestra is blind
But I've never been the worrying kind

Subsequently and furthermore
I'll sleep right here on the draining board
I'll never be paroled
I like to drink them while they're cold
All I've got is empty pockets now",Purple Avenue,1992
Holly Cole,"I left a note on his dresser
And my old wedding ring
With these few goodbye words
How can I sing
Goodbye old sleepy head
I'm packing you in like I said

Take care of everything
I'm leaving my wedding ring
Don't look for me
I'll get a hand
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed

When my baby, when my baby comes home

Now she's been gone
For such a long time
Ever since she's been gone,
She been on my mind

I got a letter today,
Just about noon
She said, ""Don't worry, I'll be home soon""

Everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby, when my baby comes home

I'll never have to worry
About sitting by the phone
When she gets here

Holly Cole,"Oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl.
And with the way you look I understand
That you are not impressed.
But I heard you let that little friend of mine
Take off your party dress.
I'm not going to get too sentimental
Like those other sticky valentines,
Cause I don't know if you've been loving somebody.
I only know it isn't mine.
Alison, I know this world is killing you.
Oh, Alison, my aim is true.

Well I see you've got a husband now.
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying
In the wedding cake?
You used to hold him right in your hand.
I'll bet he took all he could take.
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking
When I hear the silly things that you say.
I think somebody better put out the big light,
Cause I can't stand to see you this way.

Alison, I know this world is killing you.
Oh, Alison, my aim is true.
My aim is true.",Alison,1994
Holly Cole,"If I expected love when first we kissed
Blame it on my youth
If only for you I did exist
Blame it on my youth

I believed in everything
Like a child of three
You meant more than anything
All the world to me

If you were on my mind all night and day
Blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray
Blame it on my youth

If I cried a little bit
When first I learned the truth
Don't blame it on my heart
Blame it on my youth

If I cried a little bit
When first I learned the truth

Holly Cole,"Cry if you want
I won't tell you not to
I won't try to cheer you up
I'll just be here if you want me

It's no use in keeping a stiff upper lip
You can weep you can sleep you can loosen your grip
You can frown you can drown and go down with the ship
You cry if you want to
don't ever apologize venting your pain
Its something to me you don't need to explain
I don't need to know why
I don't think it's insane
You can cry if you want to

The windows are closed
The neighbors aren't home
If it's better with me than to do it alone
I'll draw all the curtains and unplug the phone
You can cry if you want

You can stare at the ceiling and tear at your hair
Swallow your feelings and stagger and swear
You could show things and throw things and I wouldn't care
You can cry if you want to

I won't make fun of you
I won't tell any one
I won't analyze what you do or you should have done
I won't advise you to go and have fun
You can cry if you want to

Well it's empty and ugly and terribly sad
I can't feel what you feel but I no it feel bad
I no that its real and it makes you so mad
You could cry

You can always go - downtown.
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty.
How can you lose?

The lights are much brighter there,

Forget all your cares.

No finer place for sure - down town,

Where they never close. - down town.

You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over.

They chew the fat about their tresses and the neighbors' fight
Inconsequential things that men don't really care to know
Become essential things that women find so apropos

They're all the same
It's just a game
They call it girl talk, girl talk

They all me-ouw about the ups and downs of all their friends

But though we joke, we wouldn't trade you for a ton of gold

When you've been cheating
Spending your nights on the town

Who keeps on saying
That she still wants you
When you're through running around

And who keeps on loving you
When you've been lying
Saying things ain't what they seem

Well God does but I don't
And God will but I won't
That's the difference between God and me

God does but I don't
And God will but I won't
That's the difference between God and me

So, who says she'll forgive you
Says that she'll miss you
And dream of your sweet memory

Well God does but I don't

And God will but I won't

Holly Cole,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm

And when you are near,
Close to me dear,
We touch too much!

I talk to friends
I think about you

And do they know? It's like I'm losing my mind.

All afternoon
Doing every little chore

The thought of you stays bright.
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor

Not going left
Not going right.

I dim the lights and think about you

Spend sleepless nights to think about you.
You said you loved me
Or were you just being kind?
Or am I losing

The streets are white with snow
The happy crowds are mingling
But there's no one that I know

I'm sure that you'll forgive me
If I don't enthuse
I guess I've got the Christmas blues

I've done my window shopping
There's not a store I've missed
But what's the use of stopping
When there's no one on your list
You'll know the way I'm feeling
When you love and you lose
I guess I've got the Christmas blues

When somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Christmas is a joy of joy
But friends when you're lonely
You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls and little boys

May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But 'til it's January
I'll just go and disappear
Oh Santa may have brought you some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues
Those brightly packaged tinsel covered Christmas blues

Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of saturday night

And you got paid on friday
And your pockets are jinglin'
And you see the lights
You get all tinglin' cause you're cruisin' with a 6
And you're looking for the heart of saturday night

Then you comb your hair
Shave your face
Tryin' to wipe out ev'ry trace
All the other days
In the week you know that this'll be the saturday
You're reachin' your peak

Stoppin' on the red
You're goin' on the green
'cause tonight'll be like nothin'
You've ever seen
And you're barrelin' down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of saturday night

Tell me is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin? 
Telephone's ringin'; it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye? 
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.

Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
'cause you're dreamin' of them saturdays that came before
And now you're stumblin'
You're stumblin' onto the heart of saturday night

Holly Cole,"Well she's up against the register with an apron and a spatula,
Yesterday's deliveries, tickets for the bachelors
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes,
Well, it's just an invitation to the blues

And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore
You wonder if she might be single, she's a loner and likes to mingle
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue

She said ""How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled?"",
You say ""Anyway's the only way"", be careful not to gamble
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting out of here
It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues

But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java,
It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers
Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey
But a broken-down jalopy of a man I left behind
And the dream that I was chasing, and a battle with booze
And an open invitation to the blues

But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candy-apple Caddy,
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things
He probably left her for a socialite, and he didn't 'cept at night,
And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared
So they took the registration, and the car-keys and her shoes
And left her with an invitation to the blues

'Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening
You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while
Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring,
And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose?
Got a crazy sensation, go or stay? now I gotta choose,
And I'll accept your invitation to the blues

Take my baby to the carnival

With a steeple full of swallows

Is all that horse can do 
He does one trick only 
It's the principal source of his revenue
Steps in the spotlight feel the heat 
Of his heart come rising through
See how he dances 
See how he loops from side to side
See how he prances
The way his hoofs just seem to glide
He's just, just a one trick pony that's how he is
But he turns that trick with pride

He makes it look so easy 
He looks so clean 
He moves like one of the gods
Immaculate machines
He makes me think about 
All these extra moves I make
All of the herky jerky motion
And the bag of tricks it takes
To get me through my working day
He's a one trick pony

He's a one trick pony 
He either fails or he succeeds
He gives his testimony 
Then he relaxes in the week
He's got one trick to last a lifetime.

That you are not impressed.

Take off your party dress.

Did he leave your pretty fingers lying
In the wedding cake?
You used to hold him right in your hand.

When I hear the silly things that you say.

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!

Finding another world.

Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow

We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow

Holly Cole Trio,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome

And with the way you look I understand
That you are not impressed.
But I heard you let that little friend of mine
Take off your party dress.
I'm not going to get too sentimental
Like those other sticky valentines,
Cause I don't know if you've been loving somebody.
I only know it isn't mine.
Alison, I know this world is killing you.
Oh, Alison, my aim is true.

Well I see you've got a husband now.
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying
In the wedding cake?
You used to hold him right in your hand.
I'll bet he took all he could take.
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking
When I hear the silly things that you say.
I think somebody better put out the big light,
Cause I can't stand to see you this way.

Holly Dale Spencer,"Well, that was some performance you gave at the Albert's Dam
Oh Sri Lanka, hilarious 
And by the way you missed nothing after leaving

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
Spend my life in the shade of the morning sun

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty

And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow

Of the things that cost you too much",True Faith,2016

And you get a heart full of being alone
You better leave one bridge standing
So you'll have a way back home

Growing high on the other side
There's a lot of fools out there lovers who just don't care
They're gonna take you for a ride
So go on and go your way...

Holly Dunn,"I heard you saying you're thinking bout getting out
Leaving him and your old life behind
Well if you want to go without any doubts
You'd better know what you're talking about
You're talking tears you're talking cold and lonely nights
Where the heartaches don't leave when morning comes
You're talking losing what you never thought you'd find
You're talking bad times when you're talking goodbye
You feel like you're living somebody else's dream
And all that's gold has turned into rust
But when you're talking about tossing that ring
You'd better know just what that means
You're talking tears

There was a time when I had a choice to make
I let love slip through my hands
So if you want to talk about making mistakes
That's one thing I understand
You're talking tears",Talking Goodbye,1997
Holly Dunn,"Here's where I should say goodnight call me up some other time
A little kiss by the front porch light that's what I should do
Anyone with sense at all knows how far and fast to fall
The world is full of brokenhearted fools
That never stopped me no I never hold back
I go playing on the railroad track
Even though there's a good chance that a freight train is bearing down
That never stopped me from falling in love
Knowing better ain't good enough
I see the light but my eyes are shut when a boy like you's around
Never stopped me before it won't stop me now
When I look into your eyes I see all the warning signs
It's too soon to cross that line I will anyway
Fools rush in where angels stop guess which one of them I'm not
Even though I know I'm tempting fate
That never stopped me...

Don't lose your heart use your head
That's what everybody says
That never stopped me...",That Never Stopped Me,1997
Holly Dunn,"Some never take the chance some never even try
The odds are so against love in these times
But when it comes to us our hearts won't let it go
We're gonna put our trust in what we know

We've got the love to make it
We've got the love to take it all the way
If we got us to lean on
We've got enough to keep on we're here to stay

We've got the love
I don't know anyone who knows what's down the road
But when the hard times come our love won't go
The only thing we need for us to see it through

Is knowing you've got me and I've got you
And we've got the love to make it...
We've got the love we've got the love",We've Got the Love,1997
Holly Dunn,"He walked up to me at the honky tonk
Asked me how I'd been since he'd been gone
And had I found the strength to carry on

And could we still be friends I said you bet
While I wondered where and when we'd met
I hope that I once loved him like he claims
Yeah I never will forget whats his name
Whats his name
It's right on the tip of my tongue and the edge of my brain
Whats his name
Wish I could feel the flicker of that old flame
He's awful cute he must've been worth the pain
Oh I never will forget whats his name
As the waitress looked at his ID
I nearly broke my neck to sneak a peek
I kinda think his first name starts with be

I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me
In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude 
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me",In a Sentimental Mood,2000
Holly Hofmann,"Rua espada nua
Bia no see you imensa e amarela
To redonda a lua
Como flutua
Vem navegando o azul do firmamento
E num silncio lento
Um trovador, cheio de estrelas
Escuta agora a cano que eu fiz
Pra te esquecer Luza
Eu sou apenas um pobre amador
Apaixonado
Um aprendiz do teu amor
Acorda, amor 

Que eu sei que embaixo desta neve
mora um corao
Vem see, Luza, me d tua mo
O teu desejo sempre o meu desejo
Vem, me exorciza
D-me tua boca e a rosa louca
Vem me dar um beijo
E um raio de sol nos teus cabelos
Como um brilhante que partindo a luz
Explode em sete cores
Revelando ento os sete mil amores
Que eu guardei somente
Pra te dar, Luza",Luiza,2000
Holly Hofmann,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die.

Holly Hofmann,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Holly Holmes,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars

Slowly rises and kisses you awake
Your smile is soft and fuzzy
As you let it play upon your face
Oh, how I dream
I might be like the morning sun to you

Like a lover, the river wind
Sighs and ripples its fingers through your hair
Upon your cheek it lingers
Never having known a sweeter place
Oh, how I dream
I might be like the river wind to you

How I envy a cup that knows your lips
Let it be me, my love
And a table that feels your fingertips
Let it be me, let me be your love
Bring an end to the endless days and nights
Without you

Like a lover, the velvet moon
Shares your pillow and watches while you sleep
Its light arrives on tiptoe
Gently taking you in its embrace
Oh, how I dream

Told to cry or cum 
I'll lick your heals till my mouth bleeds 
Maybe you'll kick me some

For the hate I hold will knock you
Over, burn up your face
And I take over this hurtful place

In the heart of the city at a bistro scene
A long story short, she come up north turned our house to the port
We took a trip down Mexico, and I nearly shout myself like plexico
But with a mouth so fast she was technical
And don't turn to a vegetable

Hey, you walk to the sun, I sleep through the day
But nothing more
The sky lit up the stars, we're miles apart
Look up where you are
Is that what you want, 'cause love is real
Just have a good time
Is that what you want, 'cause love is real
Just have a good time

Catch rest in the motel room
When the roosters call I escape this doom
The humming bird is the humming man
Six years later you will understand
I spoke four words from the last night, night, yikes
In the mother land for another life for another man

Damn, you walk to the sun, I sleep through the day
But nothing more

Look up where you are
Is that what you want, 'cause love is real
Just have a good time

Try make the most of this
Don't throw it all away

And no time to count the days
She the disco queen, party all night like her shit's so clean
If you look those eyes, it might be me in the deep skies

Can make those freedom bells go on ringing

Until we have no more to give

Hand the old banjo to the young ones stronger

We still can have singing tomorrows

Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Holly Palmer,"When you went away I cried for so long 
I wanted you to stay but that was all wrong 
The pain you left behind has become a part of me 
And it's burnin' out a hole where my love used to be 

But it's not losin' you 
That's got me down so low 
I just can't find another man 
To take your place 

Now you know I love you but that wasn't enough 
We both fell apart when things got too rough 
I've learned how to give now, but what good does it do? 
When no one can touch me the way you used to do 

But it's not losin' you 
That's got me down so low 
I just can't find another man 
To take your place 

Now I know that your opinion of me isn't too good 
But please try to understand I would change if I could 
And now this coldness inside is starting to build 
A woman can't be a woman unless she's fulfilled 

But it's not losin' you 
That's got me down so low 
I just can't find another man 
To take your place 

'Cause no one can",Down So Low,2004
Holly Palmer,"I've been really really bad 
I said mean things just to get you mad 
I've been really really glad 
To see you fight for me 
I've been carrying around 
An awful lot of weight that holds me down 
I've got a heavy, heavy heart 
That's making me too crazy 

I might explode or melt down from distress 
I'll never know 'til it gets off my chest 

I confess to loving you too much 
Dying for your touch 
That never is enough to hold me 
Driving way too fast 
Living in the past 
And never knowing that I'm happy 

I've been really, really bad 
I keep shutting down when you get sad 
I don't really understand how to give to you 
I've been known to jump the gun 
I'm the first to leave if it's not fun 
My heart is always on the run 
As soon as I'm confused 

It can't be good to make life the enemy 
If I could I'd tame what's inside me 

I confess I give you little tests 
I do not do my best 
Forgetting that I'm blessed and lucky 
Wasting too much time 
Pouring too much wine 
And tuning out sometimes when you fuck me 
Being self obsessed 
Too long getting dressed 
Take your tenderness for granted 
Getting negative 
I'm hyper-sensitive 
I come down on you heavy handed 

They say that all things heal faster with the truth 
And confession is the way a soul finds its groove 

Oh I know I gotta confess to 
Loving you too much 
Dying for your touch 
That never is enough to hold me 
Driving way too fast 
Living in the past 
And never knowing that I'm happy 
I give you little tests 
I do not do my best 
Forgetting that I'm blessed and lucky 
Wasting too much time 
Pouring too much wine 
And tuning out sometimes when you fuck me 

But I do love you",I Confess,2004

And phone bills and kisses on other girls lipses 
Don't scare me 
I don't care 
Listen I glisten I glow when you call
I'm not small when you call 
Without you baby 
I am no one at all 

Second chances are what this romance is
You can't turn me down 'cause 

Everybody's got a superjones 
Everybody's looking for something 
A super high super sly super zone 
You can turn me down 
But I'll keep trying 

And these other hours of quiet and empty 
Before love is ours 
Are wild and wide 
And turned on their side 
Shadows and voices 
And too many choices 
They fill me and kill me most every night 
Come on home baby 
I've learned my lesson right 

I don't know where you think you're going 
You can't turn me down 'cause 

Everybody's got a superjones

Now maybe you think I'll change my mind 
Maybe you think I'll not have so much time on my hands
But it's you on my hands that I knew on my hands 
That I'd find you again

Now baby baby don't see the clock behind me

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,1998
Holly Slater,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me
For me",It's You or No One,1997
Holly Stell,"I can fly in my mind
To a place peaceful and
Full of grace come with me
You will see love is there

To make us whole again
A love that only love knows

Go where love goes
Go where your heart leads
Angels are pleading with you
Go there, go where love dares

Gather me in your arms
Hold me close like Lazarus
To rise again like a bird
To fly again in flowers dreams

So love can feed your soul
Love will make you whole, so

Go where love goes
Go where your heart leads
Angels are pleading with you
Go there, go where love dares to go

Love makes the rainbow
Love is the dawn’s glow
Love makes the rose grow
Reaching for Heaven so

Go where love goes
Go where your heart leads
Angels are pleading with you
Go there, go where love dares

Dream how love dreams
Love feeds the dreamers
Angels are calling you to go there
Go where love dares, go

",Go Where Love Goes (for the film The Lazarus Child) [*],2004
Holly Tashian,"More and more
I'm forgetting the past
More and more I'm livin' at last
Day by day I'm losin' my blues 
More and more I'm forgettin' 'bout you
 
You know how I tried to keep you by my side
And oh how I cried when you said ""goodbye""
Day by day I'm losin' my blues 
More and more I'm forgettin' 'bout you 
 
But oh how I tried to keep you by my side
And oh how I cried when you said goodbye
Day by day I'm losin' my blues
More and more I'm forgettin' 'bout you

Day by day I'm losin' my blues
More and more I'm forgettin' 'bout you",More and More,2002
Holly Tashian,"My window faces the South
I'm almost halfway to heaven
Snow is falling, still I can see 
Fields of cotton calling to me
My window faces the South
And though I am far from the Swanee
I'm never frownin' or down in the mouth,
My window faces the South

My window faces the South, 
I'm almost halfway to heaven
Snow is falling, still I can see 
Fields of cotton calling to me
My window faces the South
Though I am far from the Swanee
I'm never frownin' or down in the mouth,
My window faces the South

My window faces the South
My window faces the South",My Window Faces the South,2002
