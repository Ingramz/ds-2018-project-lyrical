Se non riesci a scegliere tra vodka e scotch
Questa sera sarò il tuo vodkal coach
Ti incollo allo schermo tipo bodibibidi
Sono il Messia trasformo l’acqua in Vinavil
Che passi da gigante ha fatto la mediocrità
L’unica cosa grande è il culo di Nicki Minaj
Ti porto una spina ma senza la rosa
Tu sei un’aspirina vestita da sposa
Stammi lontana che qua non è cosa
Forse non lo sai la pazzia è contagiosa
Al distributore senza codice fiscale
Mi sento vuoto come questo pacchetto di Camel
Siamo a fine serata, aspettative poche

Tra pacchi di paglie e di Red Bull vuote
Di ibuprofene sei avida
L'oki è davvero lo specchio dell'anima
Cuori in ceramica e pietra vulcanica
La nostra chimica è materia organica
Ready or not we’ll be on our way

Fedez,"E gli anni passano e non ci cambiano
Davvero trovi che sia diverso?
Guardami in faccia I miei occhi parlano
E tu dovresti ascoltarli un po' più spesso
Sorridi quando piove, sei triste quando c'è il sole
Devi smetterla di piangere fuori stagione
Dai proviamo e poi vediamo che succede
Per ogni mia parte che ti vuole, c'è un'altra che retrocede
Sapessi quante ne ho viste di scalatrici sociali
Regalano due di picche aspettando il Re di denari
Quante volte ad un ""Ti Amo"" hai risposto ""No, non posso""
Hai provato dei sentimenti e non ti stanno bene addosso
Parliamo allo stesso modo ma con diversi argomenti
Siamo nello stesso Hotel ma con due viste differenti
L'Amore è un punto di arrivo, una conquista
Ma non esiste prospettiva senza due punti di vista

Anche se poi tutto è magnifico
Non lo prenderò come un rimprovero
È possibile abbia sogni sbagliati, un po' illusi al momento
Mi appartengono

Fuori è magnifico
Si ma tu un po' di più
Sei la bellezza a due passi
A portata di manicure
Ma so che quando troveranno il centro dell'universo
Rimarrai delusa a scoprire che non sei tu
Ognuno coi suoi pensieri e I suoi segreti
Lo so siamo divisi dalla spazio senza essere pianeti
L'Amore rende ciechi devo dirtelo
E io devo smettere di cercare le scarpe nel frigorifero
Ma tu non guardi me continui a guardare fuori
Ti ho dato I giorni migliori dei miei anni peggiori
Contraddizioni e vizi, a ognuno il suo
Ma questa notte dormo sul mio fianco preferito, il tuo

Anche se poi tutto è magnifico
Non lo prenderò come un rimprovero
È possibile abbia sogni sbagliati, un po' illusi al momento
Mi appartengono

Anche se poi tutto è realistico
Non lo prenderò come un rammarico
È possibile abbia sogni sbagliati, un po' illusi al momento
Mi appartengono

Fuori è magnifico, fuori tutto è magnifico. (fuori è magnifico, si ma tu sei di più)
Fuori è magnifico, fuori tutto è magnifico. (fuori è magnifico, si ma tu sei di più)

Quando sto all'Esselunga le signore non mi cagano
Ma quando arriva al sabato sapessi quanto pagano
La mia presenza con un po' di frutta al tavolo
Insieme a dei flute di plastica che poi nemmeno lavano
All'Esselunga costo poco come un doccia shampoo
Ma dentro al locale valgo almeno trenta volte tanto
Mi fanno le foto mentre fanno sorsi piccoli
In posa con le mani fanno degli strani simboli
Il soprammobile perfetto per una Jacuzzi
Accompagnato da un piattino di more e lamponi
Se vuoi far sapere a tutti che la tua cintura è Gucci
Sistema sempre la maglietta dentro i pantaloni
Ordinane un paio, ordinane un camion
Se vuoi sembrare ricco allora ordina la magnum
Se chi trova un Moet trova un tesoro
Tu hai trovato una collana d'oro fatta di polistirolo

Nel locale costo 400 euro,
Al minimarket costo mille volte meno
Può capitare di essere uno scemo
Almeno non gridarlo al mondo intero

Ne vorresti una marea
Ti blocco la trachea
Ti giuro non ne ho idea
Ho fatto più tavoli dell'Ikea
L'estate in capannina l'eleganza porta i sandali
Gente che si ubriaca pure coi cocktail di gamberi
È da un po' che rum e pera fanno hating da tastiera
Perchè ogni sera sboccio più dei fiori a primavera
Quello dei Club Dogo fa le felpe col mio logo
Adesso aspetto solo che mi fanno fare il videogioco
Non devi essere dell'arma per avere una divisa
Ma se vuoi venire armato allora armati di Visa
Quelli che si tatuano una lacrima sul viso
Hanno ucciso della gente vogliono prenderne il merito
Io invece tatuo lacrime sopra la carta Visa
Per quante volte ho ucciso le vostre carte di credito

Nel locale costo quattrocento euro
Al minimarket costo mille volte meno

Siamo così intimi che siamo Tezenis
Viviamo sempre il bilico ci serve un treppiedi

Proprio come Daredevil
Io un capitale sporco tu una società offshore
Ti voglio più Catwoman meno Pussycatdoll
Facciamo cose spinte tipo spot di Chadore
Come Miley Cyrus con martello di Thor
Mi scaldi perché sei più underground dei Velvet
Io la Torcia Umana tu una giacca in pellet
Genetica mutata per le radiazioni
Mettono in risalto tutte le contraddizioni
Tu hai la pelle marrone e pure i denti bianchi
Io ho la pelle bianca e i denti marroni
Fa male sai mostrare le emozioni
Come quando Wolverine s’incazza mentre si gratta i coglioni

Invidio Paperone ha una piscina piena d’oro
Non tanto per I soldi ma perché non amo il cloro
In fondo tu mi amavi anche con il vecchio look
Una camicia mezza rotta ed ero al verde come Hulk
La mia Bat caverna è un piano bar taverna
Oltre che di cuore ho dei seri problemi con l’Averna
Colleziono sempre figuracce a targa alterna
Mi servirebbe una controfigura di merda
Lo sai che la formica solleva 30 volte 
Quello che è il suo peso senza fare molta fatica?
Non voglio fare il figo ma non mi sorprendo mica
Io sollevo 100 volte il peso di una formica
Vita migliore o passare a miglior vita
Io sono il tuo Magneto tu sei la mia calamita
Per te ho perso la testa allora vestiti da boia
Tanto ad essere immortali dopo si muore di noia, no?

Fedez,"L’italiano è così individualista che sta diventando come un attaccante del calcio balilla che non ha mai visto in faccia i suoi compagni di squadra
Ma in fondo per noi l’importante è precipitare
L’italiano batte le mani quando il suo aereo atterra
Ma non batte ciglio quando il Paese affonda
L’italiano fa casino durante il minuto di silenzio
E poi sta il silenzio per anni quando dovrebbe fare casino
L’italiano per protestare in piazza aspetta che ci sia il sole
Il bollettino meteo guiderà la rivoluzione
Le Poste entreranno in Alitalia e mia nonna che ha paura di volare
Penso non andrà più a ritirare la pensione, sai che danno
Se fossi il fidanzato di Trenitalia sarei stufo di comprare test di gravidanza per ogni suo ritardo
Il sindacato è caldo ma poi tutto è troppo calmo tra chi incrocia le braccia e chi incrocia uno sguardo
E in Italia le mamme fanno le raccomandazioni mentre i figli di papà si fanno le raccomandate
L’italiano è scaltro, l’italiano è furbo, l’italiano è contro le unioni gay ma poi si fa inculare dal politico di turno

Si smette di dire ormai e si trova il tempo
Allora non dire più: tanto è solo un sogno
E tu cos’hai da perdere se hai già toccato il fondo?

Nelle foto segnaletiche dei fuorilegge una volta c’era scritto wanted
Ora sotto quelle foto ci trovi scritto “Votami”
Il tuo Paese ti ha allattato fin da quando eri neonato
Ma poi ti ha lasciato in strada parzialmente stremato
E il senso del ridicolo che continua a fare danni
In un Paese senza tempo ormai fermo agli anni ‘80
Qui dove il giovane regista ha appena compiuto 40 anni e il giovane architetto invece ne ha 50
E l’italiano che allo stadio urla negro a Balotelli e poi dal parrucchiere gli copia il taglio di capelli
L’italiano va allo stadio come se stesse andando in guerra
E poi se ne va in guerra come se andasse allo stadio

Si esce dal buio sai ma ci si passa dentro
Si smette di dire ormai e si trova il tempo
Allora non dire più: è solo un sogno
E tu cos’hai da perdere se hai già toccato il fondo?

Noi contro loro, noi contro loro
Siamo così senza futuro che pure i veggenti perdono il lavoro
Ci apriranno il culo come il tetto di una spider
Guidano il Paese alla rovina

Fedez,"Il loro canto tiene sveglia la città, ugole di prexiglass
Stelle in intermittenza sulla boulevard
Arcobaleni in plastica
Stanno arrivando, e sono per te
Ti stanno chiamando, e vogliono te
Senti, stan cantando solo per te
Si stanno avvicinando

Il sogno più grande è permettersi di camminare sulle proprie gambe, come le sirene
Iniezioni di fiducia, ma non trovano le vene, coperte dalle squame, come le sirene
Mi devo rianimare in un paese non cosciente, voglia di mal di mare, perchè non si muove niente
Bere come le sirene, come l’etilene, se conviene bene, sennò come viene, viene

Guardando l’aurora con le facce stanche, con l’acqua alla gola sognando le branchie
Siamo soggetti all’usura del tempo, ma ancora di più a quella delle banche
Se tocchi il fondo per forza risali, ma spesso le perle son giù nei fondali
Davanti alla sfiga, apparire cordiali, mai sanguinare davanti agli squali
Sono pesci grossi con palati fini, la realtà nuda e cruda, bikini e sashimi
Col mare, le falle, con i polpi vivi, calmare le acque con i sedativi
E’ un circolo vizioso, non un circolo polare, con più S35 che in battaglia navale
Più cerchi di nuotare, più ti vogliono affogare
Ti diranno mani in alto quando tu sei in alto mare

Stanno arrivando, e sono per te
Ti stanno chiamando, e vogliono te
Senti, stan cantando solo per te
Si stanno avvicinando

Ulisse si è legato per resistere, tu devi resistere per non farti legare
Non devi annegare, ma ti devi allenare. Gare di resistenza, pubblico ufficiale
Posti di blocco posti al confine, barricate, barriere coralline
Con gli sguardi bassi su un gelo di sassi, ti porta a guardare le stelle marine

Il loro canto tiene sveglia la città, ugole di plexiglass
Stelle in intermittenza sulla boulevard
Arcobaleni in plastica
Stanno arrivando, e sono per te
Ti stanno chiamando, e vogliono te
Senti, stan cantando solo per te

Lei più che l’antiquariato vuole un uomo all’antica

Chi non ha l’iPhone dice bello ma si riga
Io ogni volta che qualcuno dice bello ma si riga
Inevitabilmente pensi sì ma bello porti sfiga

Tira più un pixel di figa che un carro di buoi

Di felicità
Per uso personale

Noi che non abbiamo dato il massimo
Noi che non abbiamo fatto il classico
Noi fotocopie tutte uguali illuse di essere speciali
E non ci sono le stelle

Con più inchiostro sottopelle
Che sul libretto degli assegni

Noi che in mezzo a queste vipere
Ormai ci si può convivere

Per uso personale
Per andare via di qua
Senza più limiti

Un po' più liberi

Per sognare a occhi aperti come anni fa
Quando anche se non c'era niente ne bastava la metà
21 Grammi di felicità

Loro con i paraocchi lei con i paradenti
E le lezioni di vita
Segnateci assenti
Ci hanno sciolto le certezze dentro al bicchiere
Ora ho più ghiaccio nel cuore che dentro al Jack Daniels
Cuori meccanici per noi sociopatici
Vite noiose, parchi monotematici
Amiamoci, perdiamoci, faranno delle indagini
Finché le nostre lacrime non romperanno gli argini
Teniamoci stretti, lacci emostatici
Siamo letargici, siamo crisalidi
Siamo romantici , siamo dei sadici
Se il mondo è malato aspettiamo le analisi
Più fradici, più fragili
Prima che il sole spunti, liberiamoci dal freddo
Copriamoci di insulti

Non ci sono le stelle

Fedez,"Chi è che mi muove verso i sogni e il futuro?
Oggi non voglio vedere nessuno
Tu mi lasci e mi prendi
Esplosivi deserti
Il suono della primavera che dura di meno di uno starnuto

Allergico a chi i soldi non li ha mai sudati
È uno scherzo candid camera dei deputati
E come stiamo ce lo leggi in faccia
Cittadini dello stato d’ansia
Le lacrime che bruciano quando escono dai pulpiti
Non hai spina dorsale sono allergico ai molluschi
La testa in multisala io mi faccio i film
Perché è molto meglio che restare qui
La vita che ti viene incontro corre a fari spenti
Devi saper fare affari insieme ad affaristi esperti
Con esperimenti fatti solo sopra a un certo rango
La gente terra terra quando piove si fa fango
La luna ha mille facce ma ne mostra solo una
Vado in shock anafilattico pizzico di sfortuna
Mentono da tempo immemore addestrati per dividere
Ci dettano le regole perché non sanno scrivere

È l’allergia che mi muove verso i sogni e il futuro
Oggi non voglio vedere nessuno
Tu mi lasci e mi prendi
Esplosivi deserti
Il suono della primavera che dura di meno di uno starnuto
È l’allergia che mi sposta
Che mi muove le ossa
Che mi prende la mano con forza
E qualche volta anche per i piedi
Per fare sì che io non anneghi
O che ritorni quello di una volta

Da ragazzo mi chiedevi se stavo bene
Così secco mi si vedevano le vene
Il dottore perché non mangiavo ed ero blu
Mi diede il tavor e io pazzo ci ho bevuto su
Ci stavo dentro solo quando ero fuori perché
Per distruggere il mondo partivo da me
L’alcol come medicina per la noia poi alla fine della storia sulla schiena 
Senti il peso dello scimpanzé
Ma la musica ribelle prude sulla pelle
Sono allergico al contatto con la polvere di stelle
Non so pensare in piccolo allergico al compatto
Meglio precipitare spesso che volare basso
Da ragazzi soffrivamo una fame diventata bulimia
E poi allergia alimentare
Ma per scrivere io devo alimentare l’allergia

È l’allergia che mi muove verso i sogni e il futuro
Oggi non voglio vedere nessuno
Tu mi lasci e mi prendi
Esplosivi deserti
Il suono della primavera che dura di meno di uno starnuto

Che mi muove le ossa
Che mi prende la mano con forza
E qualche volta anche per i piedi
Per fare sì che io non anneghi
O che ritorni quello di una volta

Non riesco a trovare una strada

Venivamo bene solo in foto
Fermi a fissare il cielo e l’orologio
Il tempo non è bello è solo poco

Chiunque verrà dopo di te forse non durerà una sera
Perché chi tardi arriva quasi sempre prima sloggia
Una lacrima che evapora e sale nell’atmosfera
Forse ti raggiungerà
Sotto forma di pioggia
Sguardi persi, sentimenti fuori fuoco
Venivamo bene solamente in foto
Fissare il cielo e non guardare l’orologio
Il tempo non è bello è solamente poco

Bevo vodka liscia come la tua pelle
Ci abbiamo dato un taglio come lamine gemelle

Ma tu com’è che sei indifferente da sempre alle lacrime
E scusami se nego
Ora come te lo spiego
Che da quando non ci sei mi manca l’aria e non riesco più a parlare
Se non di te
Se non di te
Che non ci sei
Tutta la vita in un istante per me
Anni luce distante da me

Quando sei lunatica
Sono io la pioggia acida
Qui di pesce è pieno il mare
Ma senza te sto su una zattera
Amore bipolare come il clima
Prima sembra un film è tutto perfetto poi piove
Tu sei Katrina e io divento la tua New Orleans
Sì, è un temporale fuori stagione
È l’aria calda del mio stress contro il tuo anticiclone
Faccio da parafulmine e cado nelle pozzanghere

Fedez,"Una storia è una salita
Una strada, una matita
Un microfono, una stretta con il sangue fra le dita
Che Dio ci maledica sento le sue impronte di una croce incisa
Con l’olio bollente sulla fronte
Un animo bastardo, una cieca convinzione
Un rifugio, uno sguardo, una ricerca di attenzione
In bilico fra l’odio profondo e la redenzione
Ho scelto la beatitudine dell’eterna dannazione

Hey, lo sai che ho perso troppo tempo
Il sasso e tu l’hai ritrovato
Chi dice marchiato, chi dice macchiato
Di indelebile c'è solo un destino segnato
Cercavi conforto in un uomo contorto
Ma il fato beffardo è del fiato e già corto
Per noi non c’è cura non c’è medicina
Se poi mi sento solo quando mi sei vicina

Coscienza lava a secco
Una doccia di sangue freddo
Sono talmente perso che non trovo più me stesso
Nulla accade dal nulla ne son certo
La mia ambizione ha superato di gran lunga il mio talento

Si potesse cancellare tutto il male
Lo berrei come assenzio stanotte
E quante volte avrei voluto urlare ma sono rimasto in silenzio
A pensare alle cose che ho perso
Ad immaginare fosse diverso
Non mi guardo da mesi allo specchio
È da un po’ che sospetto che dentro al riflesso 
Ci sia quella maschera che mi hanno messo

Eh, come un alieno per tornare a casa
Punto alle stelle sono a metà strada
Da bambino ero felice quando nevicava
Adesso blocca il traffico rovina la giornata
In mezzo a una folla di voci che acclama
Avere un radar e sentire solo quella solitaria che infama
Che poi la fama non ha utilità né importanza
Quando vedi chi ami andare via sull’ambulanza
E allora ho chiesto scusa al cielo
Per la mia vita intera
Mentre l’infermiera le infilava i tubi nelle braccia
Ho pregato dio ""prenditi i soldi, la mia moto e la carriera""
Ma non portarti via la mia ragazza
In un attimo solo capire veramente quello che conta
Realizzare per tempo che nessuno vive per sempre
Quante domeniche a casa in hangover
Invece che andare a trovare la nonna
Adesso mi manca della dolce vita
Me ne pento ora me ne pento amaramente
Perché quando corri per vincere non vedi quello che perdi
Tua mamma chiama in ufficio
Tu rispondi in fretta e coi nervi
Tra chi è troppo avanti e chi arriva in ritardo, comunque nessuno è in orario
Io voglio tagliare la corda più che tagliare il traguardo

Se siamo sulla Terra sprechiamo gli anni luce

O per disinfettare, la vodka è il mio sciroppo
Penso che amarmi gratis forse ti costava troppo
E anche ora che ti guardo e non capisco più chi sei
Sei la più bella fra le cose che non rifarei
Io resto dove sono e tu vai dove vuoi

Secondo un vecchio detto in amore vince chi fugge
Nulla si crea, ma qualcosa si distrugge
Io non volevo vincere, volevo perderti
Quando ho capito che era più facile amarti che crederti
E non so se nel tuo armadio hai più scarpe che scheletri
Vado dietro le tue storie come fossero feretri
Il nostro umore nero era il nostro fil rouge
Ognuno ha i suoi fantasmi proprio come Scrooge
Siamo due persone ma per molti siamo solo titoli
Ero dentro la tua sfera poi ho sbattuto sui tuoi spigoli
I nostri sentimenti sono geometrie imperfette
Due galassie parallele, col destino delle rette
Mi scopro più vecchio, ma mi sento più nuovo
Volevi cambiare il mondo, hai cambiato solo un uomo
Dalla fame alla fama, hai raggiunto i tuoi scopi
Ma non cambio idea: l’amore andava prima testato sui giochi

Regalerei ogni cosa che hai lasciato qui a casa
Il tuo ricordo, quello no, non so a chi darlo
E vorrei cancellarti dalla pelle
Spalancare le finestre
Fare come se non fossi mai passato di qui

E anche nel starsi vicini poi eravamo ormai distanti
Gli amanti e frasi fatte di rimpianti
Fra i tanti hai scelto uno, ma non uno dei tanti
Inseguiti dalla gente
Viviamo sotto scorta di calmanti
Che non ha senso interrogarsi su quel che pensavo giusto
Abbiamo un problema
Dove sei Houston?
In fondo onestamente sai che cosa ce ne fotte?
Barcolleremo a casa verso la mezzanotte

(Feeling so good)

Regalerei ogni cosa che hai lasciato qui a casa

Fedez,"Ho aria condizionata e moriamo di caldo
Diamanti veri ma sorriso falso
Ormai reggo meno la gente che l’alcol
Odio le feste
Indosso il VR
Non guardo modelle
Non mangio la carne ma ho sedili in pelle
A casa del magnate russo vado in panico di brutto
Tutti nudi come Woodstock desolattico di lusso
A metà tra un lager e un castello delle fiabe
Tu sei collassata, bella addormentata nel bosco verticale
Principessa da svegliare con un bacio
Ma forse chiuso in questa torre sono diventato il drago
Quindi ignoro lo skyline guardo l’America in tv
Più che non dormire mai la mia città non sogna più

Se non ci danno da bere qua e nemmeno al bar
Vorrei guardarti ancora ballare se lo stereo è spento

E mentre passa già la prima metro sotto il pavimento
Sopra ci sei te e tutta Milano intorno

Eh sì, ho il cane è di razza ma sono un bastardo
Vite che passano sempre in ritardo
Se bevo non devo se bevo straparlo
Che basa, il cervello s’intasa la testa
Che sfasa, e ho perso più chance che chiavi di casa
Il tempo che scorre dentro le mie vene con donne più condivise di un Meme
Chiedere scusa non sempre conviene ho tanti difetti ma li porto bene
Mentre la mattina aspetta un’altra birra e sigaretta
Non andiamo da nessuna parte ma siamo di fretta
Le nostre vite semplici senza salsa piccante
Io credo nella gente ma non sono praticante
Geloso anche del vento che ti accarezza
Se vieni dal basso hai sempre paura di non essere all’altezza

Quello che si dice convivere con l’ansia
Dalla cameretta al camerino
Tutti ti stanno accanto, nessuno ti sta vicino
Il cuore come un iceberg circondato dalle navi
La paura di affondare, scontro fra Titanic

Che non ci danno l’emozione della prima bici
Quanti hotel con la piscina e la palestra, doccia iper moderna

Vuoi distruggere la stanza, Breaking Bad and breakfast
Quanta fatica per salire in cima
Per poi scoprire che c’è poco ossigeno e non si respira
Per riempire buchi, riscattare amori mai compiuti
Ci nutriamo dei “mi piace” degli sconosciuti
Con milioni di canzoni in streaming

E prima d’ordinare controllare il portafogli
Guardavamo le vetrine con occhi enormi

Io con la testa in aria ero un asino che vola
Poi sarà il mondo del lavoro che ha mentito alla tua laurea

Senza gli abiti di marca con due cuori e un mutuo in banca
E invece adesso l’alcol scorre a fiumi
E solo donne di facili consumi
È un museo dell’ostentazione
Colleziono quadri della situazione
I ricchi all’ingrasso
Le fighe all’ingrosso
Selezione all’ingresso

Feel my hands getting cold
Sat in a boat on a lake

Climbing up trying my best
As I sink
Climbing up trying my best
As I sink again

Lying back on the floor
Reaching up high into space
See myself in a glass

Don't Let Me Fall

If you should go
We'll never know
We can try a little harder
We can let the eagle fly away

[Chorus:]
Don't let me fall
I need you in my life
To take me through
Don't let me go
Try it one more time

Hide from today
We tried, we gave
Couldn't see that things were changing
Till the changes came to tear us down

[Chorus:]
Don't let me fall
I need you in my life
To take me through
Don't let me go
Try it one more time

Is it snowing where you are
Guess it must be getting dark
And the quite streets of home
Are weakful
They never leave me alone

You say we're fine
As if I'm blind
Tell the weight upon your shoulders
And the pain behind your drying eyes
Lets try it one more time

I need you in my life
To take me through
Don't let me go
Try it one more time

Into her sick abusive lies
All the poison tears
And rips away at her

Va nuestra canción como un saludo
Para los que defienden su derecho
A libertad y usan la razón como su escudo

No hay bala que mate a la verdad
Cuando la defiende la razón
Reunámonos todos para acabar con la maldad
Muévete y pon todo el corazón

Casi todos buscamos siempre la comodidad
Esto ha sido así toda la vida
El que va adelante casi nunca
Mira atrás para ayudar al que lo pida

Pero hay día llegó la necesidad
De seguir un rumbo diferente
En darnos la mano para cambiar la realidad
Depende el futuro de la gente
Allá y aquí, aquí y allá

Si no hacemos algo el mundo, se va a acabar
Muévete mi gente, mueve Panamá
Muévete Puerto Rico, con seguridad
No hay bala que pueda matar la verdad

Para acabar el racismo en Sur África
Lo cantan los niños, y mamá y papá
Para salvar el mundo de tanta maldad
Lo pide la gente en todas las esquinas

Muévete Colombia, Méjico, Argentina
Cuba, Guatemala, oye Costa Rica, Perú y Nicaragua
Que hoy te necesita, Brasil y Bolivia, Chile y Paraguay

¡Ay! Canta Venezuela, canta el Uruguay, Jamaica
Trinidad, Guadalupe, vamos Salvador, ven Martinique
República Dominicana, avanza Ecuador

Took a step back cuz it could get dangerous

Please don't shoot its just me, Thug Queen, a horse stealer

For armed robbery
Killed 2 sheriffs, 6 of his best men with my hands
Stole 2 horses

But I could use her for the job

Felecia,"Lil' Lay, hey (Yeah, yeah)
What's up playas (What's happenin' out there?)
Thugstas, and hustlas?
(Yeah, yeah, it's all real, yeah)

And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Oh, you know it ain't easy
Yeah, you know it ain't easy)

I won't blame it on the rain
(Don't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game

I lived in darkness for years
And barely can see through the smoke
At the end of my rope from sellin' that dope
Been makin' them dumb-dums out of soap
And I hope to be a better man
Never did I understand what I had
My attitude mad, young and bad
Fila, Levis still sportin' the sag
Walkin' the streets, lightweight thinkin'
Plottin', worryin' my Mama to death
Want to go home, but somethin' won't let me
'Cause I know she got problems her chest
It's a struggle, a puzzle the pieces so scattered
We find 'em, take your time and put it together
Nigga, quit walkin' around like you're blinded
Put your mind on your money, thug
Don't worry about what you got
Open your eyes, and peep the plot
Say your prayers, achieve a lot
Nigga, don't stop 'til you drop
Somewhere in a box, locked and buried
Other than that, my nigga, just smile
And don't worry (don't worry)

And I want you to know (I want you know, yeah)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(You know it ain't easy, you know it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks

Bow my head, askin' the Lord for change
Since I started sellin' 'cane
Shit ain't been the same
Began to acknowledge my bang ways
Who can I blame?
Maybe my pain, dealin' with it by callin' it a phase
These are the last days
Carry no shame, everyday thangs
Went from sellin' cocaine to rockin' the stage
The otherside of the game
Where you're rich, my aim to fame
Strange tradin' places, you're dealin' with races
Just wouldn't it be fate
Runnin' with thug, me never replace this
The Lord, I'd like to thank you for my Mo Thug family
Sincerely yours, Thug Queen (Thug Queen)

I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all, it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, ""What you gonna do? What you gonna do?""
I said, ""I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know.""
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me
Through the stormy weather
Our families got together and stay strong
But you gotta keep your head up high
'Cause there ain't no reason
Why you got to let it down
Just look around, we platinum bound (bound, bound)

And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(It ain't easy, you know, you know ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain to the otherside of the game

Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
'Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors.

I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hard times
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they want to ask me,
""Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?""
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game.

Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battle scars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

And I want you to know (to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Through the rain, through the clouds
Through the thunderbolts)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(And we can't blame it on the rain, no)
I can make it through the pain

I won't blame it on the rain

Felecia,"Yeah, what's happening my peoples
That's how we're struggling
Yeah, I know it's hard out here man
But ain't nobody said it was gonna be easy
You know what I mean?
Together we stand
That's how we're struggling
Divided we fall
What's happenin ya'll?
What's crackin?

Ain't nothing changed since I was a kid
Nothing but the days, months and the years
Putting it down and keeping it serious
Trying to keep from shedding these tears
You would have thought that it would have got better
Making that rapping and doing these shows
But to me it only got worse
Close to (?) nobody knows
The real steam, the reason why, I do the things that I do
Getting so high, drinking these brews
Feeling like I've got nothing to lose
I payed my dues and the Lord blessed me
But now I pray to save my mother, and my brother
Lord please help me
Heavy loads should be for heavy people
But niggas just trying to provide for their family
Facing cops and evil
And we need our higher powers
So what I'm going to do is keep my prayers to the sky for you
Won't tell no lie for you, but nigga I'm willing to die for you
Undivided, reunited
With the fist in the pyramid
Right about now I'm about to tip my lid
Somebody tell me what this is
A dream, a reality, my sanity about to give in
Got the fame and the fortune but this ain't living

This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road
This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road

From the past, the present through, I'm talking about the struggle
The shit hit me so hard I be swearing I'm seeing devils
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I hold and maintain
No matter which direction always seems against the grain
What to do, what to do? I'm praying for solution
In the course that I be kicking have me in a institution
Trying to rid this life, of one I didn't chose
How you gonna fuck me, I payed my dues
Every minute of my life I be trying to focus
Just when I think I got it someone make me know it
Ain't the way I need to be
And my eyes way heavy but 
I keep on pushing 'cause I ain't livin' for nothing

This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road
This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road

On a quest for peace, on a quest for peace
But I can't escape these wicked streets 
Got me to realise that I could jeopardize
A chance for my kids to be
What they want to be and what they could be
And I ain't trying to be that hoody 
But I wish somebody understood me so they could see the good in me
Trying to do thangs to make the world better
And everybody hittin' me to be doing what I'm doing
Strickly out here chasin this cheddar
Ain't nothin' free ain't nothin' fair to me
So all in all it's only me 
Take care of me and you should be doing the same thang
My niggas complain'
Trying to do to much explainin'
When the key is really maintainin'
Waitin' for the Lord to stop the rainin'
Playing it safe we got to check ourselves
Before we wreck ourselves
First we got to respect ourselves
'Cause a nigga won't give us nothin' else
Don't sit there and talk me to death
Go and get off your thang
I'm a see a change when you make a change
I believe I know the game 
Enduring our pain 'cause you got to take it
And if you want it you'll make it
See the drama and shake it
Get your mind right 

This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road
This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road

He's on drugs 'cause he's unhealthy
Family's splitting up 'cause they're struggling
Somebody out there, don't you feel the need?
Feeling hopeless 'cause I'm in (?slowly?)
I'm lookin' for a better day
I be praying for a better day
I've been lookin' for a better way

Shit hurt, Bone Brothers did it with Bizzy
Supposed to be a new beginning
But, I'm screaming out, ""Where is he?""
Yes, I miss him - how could I not?
When I know Bone is all he got
One day, we might get it together - fulfill the whole plot
I ain't gotta mention how I feel about that other thug

Number one in your life so I
Gave you everything I could

My life meant nothing to me
If that day you were unhappy
I did more than a woman should

But now it seems that it was all
Just a waste of time 'cause
'cause you just up and walked away

Now all I do is sit and cry

Know I believed every word you said

I guess I was a fool to be
So in love with you 'cause
Everybody said you were no good

Every since the day that you walked
All I do is sing a sad song
Of how I wish that you'd come back

But my daddy said that it'd be ok
Baby girl the rain will pass away
Then there will be brighter days

It would soon pass away
And the loneliness I feel
Will be just a memory

It's gonna be brighter days ahead
All of the pain that I've gone through
It wasn't worth the tears I cried for you

It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,2006
Felicia Sanders,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?
",The Song from Moulin Rouge (Where Is Your Heart),2006
Felicia Sanders,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today

Felicia Sorensen,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

Can't think of anything I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read
Making love with you 
Has left me peaceful warm and tired
What more could I ask 
There's nothing left to be desired
Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
Sleep, silent angel go to sleep

Mientras me castigo con la soledad, 
Juegas a vestirte de felicidad, 
Y aunque a tus amigas no les digas nada, 
Hoy también se ve en tu mirada aunque sigas callada. 
Oh wow

Haré lo necesario para olvidarte,
Aunque me toque cambiar y no se
Nunca más lo que fui ya no me importa igual no volverá,
Haré lo necesario para no pensarte
La vida pasa y tu igual y aunque voy a llorar,
Poco a poco entenderé que nunca volverás
Poco a poco entenderé que nunca volverás.

Pido llorando al cielo un poco de razón 
Pido que vuelvas con mi corazón 
Entiende si te ofendo que no es mi intención es que 
Lo que duele es que te hallas ido 
Mas que no tenerte me duele tu olvido 
Que sepas que te quiero y es lo único que pido 

Haré lo necesario para olvidarte,

Te confieso que ni el ego me dejo cantarte 
Ni el tiempo olvidarte 

No es que no te quiera es que ni pude hablarte 
Guardo en mi cabeza lo bueno ya me olvide de lo malo 
Y aprendí que la tristeza me hace mejor ser humano 
Ahora soy un hombre nuevo 
Y soy mejor y aunque me prometa olvidarte 
Por ti aprendí lo que es amor 

Girasoles, once meses, mis canciones, tus mirada 
Yo se que también te acuerda y no es malo eres humana 
No te escribo para nada diferente a recordarte. 
Y a pesar de los seis meses sin hablar y no mirarte

Te quiero por que parte tuya me a enseñado 
Que es amar y que es crecer,

Comme un enfant qui se perd
J'étais comme ça devant elle
Elle était tellement belle
Elle était tellement pour moi
Que je ne sais même pas
Si j'ai vu trembler mes doigts
Quand elle était là!

Prêt à oublier ma peine
Prêt à me couper les veines
Prêt à refaire la vie
Prêt à refaire ma vie
Prêt à tuer les démons
Qui m'empêchent de la revoir
Et prêt à crier son nom
Toute ma vie dans le noir.

Un coup de tambour qui éclate
Un fou qui fait n'importe quoi
Qu'elle ne soit rien que pour moi
Pour qu'elle m'aime

Je ferais n'importe quoi

Un coup de tambour qui éclate
Je veux qu'elle devienne ma loi
Je serais le mendiant, le roi
Pour qu'elle m'aime, pour qu'elle m'aime!

Prêt à casser des montagnes
A brûler la Terre entière
A faire dix mille ans de bagne
A vider l'eau de la mer
Pour la serrer contre moi
Et sentir trembler ses doigts
Au bout du souffle de sa voix
Entendre qu'elle m'aimera

Comme un piano qui se casse
Ses notes écrasées par terre
Comme le feu sur la glace
L'avion qui explose en l'air
Je vendrais mon âme au diable
Je viderais l'eau des rivières
Pour être seul à la table
De l'amour qu'elle préfère.

Felix Jaehn,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Love can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier,
Remember that with every piece of you
Hm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

You can fit me inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

(Wait for me to come home)

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone,
""Wait for me to come home""",Photograph,2018

Que j’avais ramassé
Il était tout en pleurs
Sur le bord d’un fossé
Quand il m’a vu passer
Il s’est mis à crier:
""Monsieur, ramassez-moi
Chez vous amenez-moi"".
Mes frères m’ont oublié, je suis tombé, je suis malade
Si vous n’me cueillez point, je vais mourir, quelle ballade !
Je me ferai petit, tendre et soumis, je vous le jure
Monsieur, je vous en prie, délivrez-moi de ma torture"".

L’ai mis sous mes haillons
J’ai dit: "" Faut pas qu’il meure,
Viens-t’en dans ma maison"".
Alors le p’tit bonheur
A fait sa guérison
Sur le bord de mon coeur
Y avait une chanson.
Mes jours, mes nuits, mes peines, mes deuils, mon mal, tout fut oublié;
Ma vie de désoeuvré, j’avais dégoût d’la r’commencer,
Quand il pleuvait dehors ou qu’mes amis m’faisaient des peines,
J’prenais mon p’tit bonheur et j’lui disais: ""C’est toi ma reine"".

3.Mon bonheur a fleuri,
Il a fait des bourgeons.
C’était le paradis,
Ça s’voyait sur mon front.
Or un matin joli
Que j’sifflais ce refrain,
Mon bonheur est parti
Sans me donner la main.
J’eus beau le supplier, le cajoler, lui faire des scènes,
Lui montrer le grand trou qu’il me faisait au fond du coeur,
Il s’en allait toujours, la tête haute, sans joie, sans haine,
Comme s’il ne pouvait plus voir le soleil dans ma demeure.

4.
J’ai bien pensé mourir
De chagrin et d’ennui,
J’avais cessé de rire
C’était toujours la nuit.
Il me restait l’oubli,
Il me restait l’mépris,

""Il me reste la vie"".

Félix Leclerc,"Mr. Irving Berlin
Often emphasizes sin
In a charming way.
Mr. Coward we know
Wrote a song or two to show
Sex was here to stay.
Richard Rodgers it's true
Took a more romantic view
Of this sly biological urge.
But it really was Cole
Who contrived to make the whole
Thing merge.

He said the Belgians and Greeks do it
Nice young men who sell antiques do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Monkeys whenever you look do it,
Aly Khan and King Farouk do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Louella Parsons can't quite do it,
For she's so highly strung,
Marlene might do it,
But she looks far too young.
Each man out there shooting crap does it,
Davy Crockett in that dreadful cap does it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

Our famous writers in swarms do it,
Somerset and all the Maughams do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
The Brontes felt that they must do it,
Ernest Hemingway could-just-do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
E. Allan Poe-ho! ho! ho!-did it,
But he did it in verse.
H. Beecher Stowe did it,
But she had to rehearse.
Tennessee Williams self-taught does it,
Kinsey with a deafening report does it.
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

In the Spring of the year
Inhibitions disappear
And our hearts beat high,
We had better face facts
Every gland that overacts
Has an alibi
For each bird and each bee,
Each slap-happy sappy tree,
Each temptation that lures us along
Is just Nature elle-meme
Merely singing us the same
Old song.

In Texas some of the men do it
Others drill a hole-and then do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love
West Point cadets forming fours do it,
People say all those Gabors do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
My kith and kin, more or less, do it,
Every uncle and aunt,
But I confess to it-
I've one cousin that can't.
Teenagers squeezed into jeans do it,
Probably we'll live to see machines do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

Each baby bat after dark does it,
In the desert Wilbur Clark does it
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
We're told that every hormone does it,
Victor Borge all alone does it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Each tiny clam you consume does it,
Even Liberace-we assume-does it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love!",Let's Fall in Love,2001

My answer is always the same.
That unless men put an end to all of this,
Hate will put the world in a flame, (oh) what a shame.

Just send me someone to love.

Un enfant sous la pluie
Des messieurs sans esprit
Des maisons qui s'ennuient

En passant par ici

Autrefois par ici
Montaient des mélodies
Les fleurs avaient la vie
Les rues étaient jolies
Maintenant c'est fini
Les cloches sont parties
Depuis que mon amie
A quitté le pays

Au trottoir dans la nuit

Que sont mes naufrages
Quand je rentrerai dans ce pays neuf
Qui est ton visage
Alors, je fermerai les yeux
Et je réveillerai
Mes équipages
Mes longs voyages

Quand j'étais fils de loup
Pieds nus, sans corde au cou
Quand j'étais fils du vent
Étudiant, trafiquant
Quand j'étais chez les filles
Prince fou, sans famille
Quand on m'a brisé l'os
De la mâchoire
Et quand j'ai fui avec mes bosses
Au fond du continent
Pour éviter les fers
De mes frères les hommes

Je te raconterai
Que j'étais héritier
Du château du roi sourd
Qui, au fond de sa cour
Pleurait pour que je chante
Pleurait pour que je vante
Ses rimes et ses crimes
Après, me torturait
Après, me médaillait

Toute ma vie durant, vivant
Dans l'irréel, mam'zelle
Avec mes ailes frêles
Fortes comme cerf-volant
Je fus pan de nuage
La voile bleue, au large
Qu'on ne peut mettre en cage
Qu'on harponne en riant

Les lettres et les livres
Les fuites, les écritures
Les grimoires, les Jésuites
Les foires, les poires, les huîtres
Les gloires et toute la suite
Le larron parasite
Collés sur mes talons
Collés sur mes talents
Crevant mes réussites
À grands coups de crayon
Me haïssant d'aimer
Me cernant, me jugeant
Me piégeant, me blessant
Me tuant

Mais là-haut, au-dessus d'eux
J'étais là-haut, dans une étoile rouge
Leur faisant des grimaces
Et l'étoile était rouge
Parce que c'était du sang, le mien
Et le tien est venu
Tous ces cheminements
Pour arriver à toi
Pour arriver souffrant
Où étais-tu, mon âme
Pendant cet heureux temps de misère
Et de vent?

Maintenant, je m'assois
Et je vis avec toi
Qui as daigné mêler ton âge
Avec le mien
En sortira un lien
Qui me vengera bien
En se tenant très près des hommes
Faux ou vrais
Ce que je n'ai pas fait

En se tenant très près surtout de sa mère
Ce que j'aurais dû faire depuis que tu m'attends
Maintenant je suis là
Si demain je m'en vas, retiens-moi
Rejoins-moi, si je meurs
Nous irons vivre ailleurs",Mes Longs Voyages,2006
Felix Leiter,"And you asked me what I want this year

And designer love and empty things
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

So take these words and sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

And something only you can give
And that's faith and trust and peace while we're alive
And the one poor child who saved this world
And there's ten million more who probably could
If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them

Felix Pappalardi,"Once upon a time 
She was the virgin of a million lonely minds
And now it's such a crying shame 
She does not even know her name
No-one ever knew 
All the heavy changes she's been going through
All the sons and lovers on her mind
Cause easy money's hard to find

I've been searching
All night long
You know, she's been searching all night long

[Chorus]
Easy money
She gets down on her knees
She's begging you please
Cause she needs
Easy money
She's out on a run
She needs someone can she please

Nightmare rides
A shadow limps across the great sunrise
And steals the hope that lies behind her eyes
In a sense it's hard to find

I've been searching
All Night long
You know, she's been searching all night long

[Chorus]

Easy money

Easy money
She ain't no fool
She's breaking her rule
And she knows
Easy money
She's out on a run
She's looking for someone who shows
Easy money
She's out on her own
She's looking for someone to plead
Easy money",Easy Money,1999
Felix Pappalardi,"I told my baby girl
That I live by all the rules
She laughed and said to me
Don't you take me for a fool
Then she ran me down
People saw me over town
Then word got back to her
That I was fooling round

[Chorus]
I, I ain't no angel
I, I ain't no angel
So good, goodbye love
Good, goodbye love

Now I'm living on my own
Since my baby set me free
Seems I hurt her pride
And caused her misery
She never understands
To keep me satisfied
I got to live this life
The only way I can

[Chorus]

All right then, come on

[Chorus]

Now they say there is no doubt
That the question in their minds
That I'll be down and out
And the days I'll never find
But you'll never understand
To keep me satisfied
I got to live my life
The only way I can

Felix Pappalardi,"Long haired young girl, here beside me
Fit my body, warm my mind
Sleeping quiet, never knowing
By tomorrow she'll be one more thing I'm gonna leave behind

Cause I'd rather leave here knowing
That I made a fool of love before it made a fool of me

Wrap them warm arms around me
Tell me why I'm gonna leave when I don't really want to go

Felix Pappalardi,"Death be my mistress, guns be my wife
Breath is my witness and roads are my life
Just give my future's clean as a knife
Far on the way from L.A.

The sun heats the saddle, sand in my hair
Looking for water and there's sweat everywhere
Know that I'm nearer I smell damp air
I ain't tasted coffee for days

When the leaves are down I'll be southward bound
Hunters hunt the outsider.
When the wind grows cold, when the sun grows old,
Nothing holds the outsider

Just killed a man in a town called Nightfall
Damned if I can't remember it all
My hand it was shaking but his talk it was tall
I paid for the funeral crew
And it seems like I never reach Mexico
They're heading me off every place that I go
I'm sick of the fact that I've got to lay low
What else can an outsider do

I know they're near to me, I don't have to see
Just let me be the outsider
They ain't far behind, they're always on my mind
They won't find the outsider
The outsider

When the leaves are down I'll be southward bound
Hunter's haunt the outsider.
When the wind grows cold, when the sun grows old,
Nothing holds the outsider
The outsider. The outsider.",The Outsider,1999

You really want to know about a day in that shit,
Go ahead and tell the dj to play swizz,
So I ain't gotta tell these hoes who I is,
Bitches hating again that's music too me ears,
What's you think my fuel was for all of the years?
Im inspired when people don't like me,
They keep me writing so exciting,
Man, the drama is so enticing,
I might just bite ''a'' motherfucker like tyson,
Just too fly'ed a motherfucker so change,
Trow your cash, that's cake and ice'in,
I ask'd her you buying?
She said no just sight-seeing,
Maybe that's just because you ain't found the right thing? yeah!

Keep tellin' me you got a man,
But he can't do what I can,
Let me, show you what you been missin',
Keep show'in you the minor thing,
Let me, show you the finer thing,
Let me, show you what your missin',

Let me show you what is like too be the wife
Of a nigga with a life,
That make your head spin around,
See it's funny because I know what you like,
But I be see'in you with nigga's that ain't right, round hard top,
Know'in that you really, really want's your top down,
Know'in it is really time too stop running around,
We don't live twice, only life once,
And I know you like nice,
So how you gone front on me?
Baby, im the boss jd,

With me it's a spree,
He buy car's,

Like ye, say, heaven is anything that heaven ain't is,
And yes, I guess, I'm into trick'in of buiss,
But shit, if you had it like I got it,
The you got it as a kid,
You say the same thing to a girl,
That I just said

Keep tellin' me you got a man,

Let me, show you what you been missin',
Keep show'in you the minor thing,
Let me, show you the finer thing,
Let me, show you what you been missin',

The life I live, fit for a king,
Now all I need fine little dime that's sharin my shine you sit back and watch the haters go blind,

I'm not tryin' to keep it lost too a minimum,
If you associating been in em winning em, then I say I was nine out of ten of them,
Frankly I know been and them I like spending them,
You like the smooth and can white lend'in them,
You wan't a thug, hey I look good in a timb,
You might win some, but everybody lost one,
I put a check on that like air force one's,
It's easier to lose her then to find her, so wine her and dine her, and treat her to the finer,
Things, lines, from the top designers,
Bling, shine, like you tryin' to blind her,
These are just reminders,
Just too sign ''her'',
Show her you find ''her'',
Eight, one of a kind ''her'',
See alote of ass, and that one behind her!
Let's just say that im diggin that like a miner, ya digg

Keep tellin' me you got a man,

Love comes, it goes, and it’s high, and it’s low, it’s too fast, too slow. It’s any way the wind blows
I’d of given you the sun the moon the stars, to be right where you are, but God knows you can’t change
I’d of left it all, and I’d of changed my name, just to run away, and know you felt the same

Only God knows why, I always come up dry
“Hold on tight,” she said. “it’s gonna be a bumpy ride.”
You gotta learn, to love yourself again - I’m trying to learn, to chase my dreams again
 
There’s a thousand things that I knew you would’ve seen, and one million more if you left them out of me
And I kept praying that you would change your mind, cross that line and set me free, but time ain't really that kind
cause I’d of spent my whole damn life, and every night, chasing all those dreams I would never find, I’d of wasted all my time
Now I see that sunset, and I look for rest, there’s nothing left, the only way out is through, she said.
 
And God knows why, I always come up dry

""Hold on tight,"" she said, ""it's gonna be a bumpy ride."" ""You gotta learn, to love yourself again.""
I'm trying to learn to chase my dreams again

And God knows why, I always come up dry
""Hold on tight,"" she said, ""it's gonna be a bumpy ride.""
""You don't love me my friend, and believe me, this has to end""

She got a story for everyone of them tattoos
She knows everything that you gotta do

But it don't matter now you're gone
Just like all the rest you up and you gone
I ain't gotta sit here, and cry all night long
It don't matter cause you're gone

She got a way, a way of standing up real tall
She got a way, a way of saying nothing at all
She knows how to make everything all your fault

But it don't matter now you're gone
Just like all the rest you up and you gone
And I ain't gotta sit here, and cry all night long
It don't matter you're gone

She got the face, the face I saw in my dreams
She walk the walk, and she talk the talk, good Lord
she's so, so serene
She's got everything I thought I would ever need

I don't need you to be strong

Fellowcraft,"I, I remember all of the times I couldn't sleep
And I, I recall all the times I couldn't eat
And I, I remember when all the times I couldn't breathe

Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you

And here I stand and we're sharing a common last name
And though your tears of joy are many, I know that you feel the same
Will you hold my hand, and take me to the promised land
Will you stay by my side, Hold me and say it will be alright

Is life, is really life, is love, is it really love, is it really love
Does my heart beat, oh lord, does it beat, if It's not at the same time as you, as you

And here I lie, wide awake in my bed, is it all in my head
Because No, I can't die, if it's not at the same time as you
Ohhhhhh, ohhhhhhh ohhhhhhhh",Wedding Song,2016
Fellowcraft,"There's a Tumbleweed a blowin' down Ol' Christoval Road
Mesquite trees on the hillside and rattlesnakes on the road
And they tell me Father Time he waits for no man, and nobody tells him when and where to go

But that old man seems to takes his sweet ass time, out here in San Angelo

We're sittin' in busted lawn chairs, drinkin' and playin' cards
And all them stars are out tonight, you can see ‘em it ain't that hard
I swear there's so many places you can go, when you ain't got better places to go
I keep praying every night, Dear Lord; get me far away from San Angelo

I'm sittin' back in the city, in this town with all its blocks
And I look back on my life and I wonder what I have lost.
Damn, I miss that little town. Good Lord I miss her so.
I think it's time to saddle up my horse and chase the sunset back to San Angelo

I'm sitting back in the Concho, the Arroyo with all my friends
Where the road goes on forever, and the party never ends!
Where the Twin Buttes Block the sun, it's as as hot as Mexico

Damn it feels good
Damn it feels good to be back
Damn it feels good to back in San Angelo",West Texas Blues,2016

Féloche,"Il existe un endroit
Où les hommes parlent comme les oiseaux.
Sur l'île de La Gomera,
On entend el Silbo en écho.

Entre deux montagnes amarrées aux nuages,
Un Guanche siffle pour s'inviter à dîner.

Au menu un Mojo piquant qui monte aux yeux.
Et, à nouveau, un sifflement pour se dire adieu.

À le voir crapahuter, le pied agile, les jambes arquées,
On ne le distingue dans l'argile que par le son de son sifflet.

La Lucha Canaria pour protéger son île,
El Silbo pour braver la Guardia Civil.

C'est une île au paradis
Où les humains sifflent aussi.
Le plus beau chant du plus bel oiseau,
C'est le Silbo Gomero.
C'est le Silbo Gomero.

La Guagua escalade les jardins en escalier.
Sous le volcan de la ballade, el Silbo perce la fumée.

Et me voilà, petit géant, prêt à siffler dans le vent,

They've got a box full of secrets
That they're giving away
I received a tape
And I heard it play

Trails of colour dissolve
In your mind
The gates of evil
The paths we find
You're so self assured
It's just a game you play
And we're not gonna do a thing that they say

Kind of strange
Kind of crazy
Kind of out of touch
Into something that's nothing
If nothing's that much
Oh if nothing's that much
To you
Why try to hide
The things that are true
Wouldn't it be
Fair to say
That you're not gonna do a thing that they say
I know a man and his friend
And I know them well
I think they're kind of strange
But it's hard to tell

Trails of colour dissolve
In your mind
The gates of evil
The paths we find
You're so self assured
It's just a game you play
And we're not gonna do a thing that they say",Trails of Colour Dissolve,1992
Felt,"Where you been? Ain't you for weeks
You been hanging out with all those jesus freaks
Oh yeah and I feel like giving in
And where were you, when I wanted to work? You were still
In bed
You're a total jerk

There's a place for abstract and there's a place for
Noise and there's a place for every kind of sound so come

On now and tell me why there's a void
It's all my fault, yes I'm to blame
Ain't got no money, ain't got no fame
And that's why, I feel like giving in
And all those songs, like crystal ball, dismantled king
You know I love them all
But oh, I still feel like giving in.",Ballad of the Band,1994
