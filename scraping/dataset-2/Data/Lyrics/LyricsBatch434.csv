Y se renueva si estás aquí
Y mi corazón vela por ti 
Porque te espera, vuelve a venir

Como lluvia que tardó
Y al desierto vida dio 
Desciende sobre mí como la brisa 
Que destile sobre mí

Jesús Adrián Romero,"Tu ojos revelan que yo
Nada puedo esconder
Que no soy nada sin ti
Oh fiel Señor
Todo lo sabes de mí
Cuando miras el corazón
Todo lo puedes ver
Muy dentro de mi
Lleva mi vida

A una sola verdad
Que cuando me miras
Nada puedo ocultar

Que lleva mi vida más allá

Sé que no puedo negar

Me llena de tu paz",Tu Mirada,2011

Piensa en mí­;  
Si tienes ganas de llorar

Que siendo tan niña,  
Me enseñó a besar

My mind is clearer now
At last
All too well
I can see
Where we all
Soon will be
If you strip away
The myth
From the man
You will see
Where we all
Soon will be

Jesus!
You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good you've doneWill soon get swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

Nazareth
Your famous son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
He'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with ev'ry hour
All your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful, but now it's sour
Yes it's all gone sour
Ah --- ah ah ah --- ah
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
So come on, come on, listen to me.
Ah --- ah
Come on, listen, listen to me.
Come on and listen to me.

What to do, how to move him

I don't see why he moves me

He's a man
He's just a man
And I've had so many
Men before

In very many ways
He's just one more

Should I scream and shout
Should I speak of love

Let my feelings out?

What's it all about? 
Don't you think it's rather funny

I should be in this position?

Who's always been
So calm so cool

No lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so 
I never thought I'd come to this

I'd be lost

I'd be frightened

The end . . .
Is just a little harder when brought about by friends
For all you care this wine could be my blood
For all you care this bread could be my body
The end!
This is my blood you drink
This is my body you eat
If you would remember me when you eat and drink . . .
I must be mad thinking I'll be remembered - yes
I must be out of my head!

Ten minutes after I'm dead!
One of you denies me
One of you betrays me

Not I! Who would? Impossible!

You sad pathetic man - see where you've brought us to
Our ideals die around us and all because of you

Someone has to turn you in

I only want to say
If there is a way
Take this cup away from me
For I don't want to taste its poison
Feel it burn me
I have changed

I'm not as sure, as when we started
Then, I was inspired
Now, I'm sad and tired
Listen, surely I've exceeded expectations
Tried for three years, seems like thirty
Could you ask as much from any other man?

But if I die
See the saga through and do the things you ask of me,
Let them hate me, hit me, hurt me, nail me to their tree
I'd want to know, I'd want to know, my God
I'd want to know, I'd want to know, my God
Want to see, I'd want to see, my God
Want to see, I'd want to see, my God

Why I should die
Would I be more noticed than I ever was before?
Would the things I've said and done matter any more?
I'd have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord
Have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord
Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord
Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord

Why should I die? Oh why should I die?
Can you show me now that I would not be killed in vain?
Show me just a little of your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason for your wanting me to die
You're far to keen and where and how, but not so hot on why

Alright, I'll die!
Just watch me die!
See how I die!

We turned to Rome to sentence Nazareth
We have no law to put a man to death
We need Him crucified

You have been brought here
Manacled, beaten by Your own people
Do You have the first idea

Why You deserve it?
Listen, King of the Jews
Where is Your kingdom?
Look at me, am I a Jew?

I have got no kingdom in this world
I'm through, through, through
There may be a kingdom for me
Somewhere if I only knew

You're a king
Yes You can see I am
I look for truth
And find that I get damned

What is truth?
Is truth unchanging law?
We both have truths
Are mine the same as Yours?

Crucify Him, crucify Him
What do you mean
You'd crucify your king?
We have no king but Caesar

He's done no wrong
No, not the slightest thing
We have no king but Caesar

This Man is harmless so why does he upset you?
He's just misguided thinks He's important

What do You want Jesus? Tell me
You've got to be careful
You could be dead soon, could well be

Why do you not speak
When I have your life in my hands?
How can You stay quiet?
I don't believe You understand

You have nothing in Your hands
Any power You have
Comes to You from far beyond
Everything is fixed and You can't change it

You're a fool, Jesus Christ
How can I help You?

Crucify Him, crucify Him, remember Caesar
You have a duty to keep the peace
So crucify Him, You'll be demoted
You'll be deported so crucify him

Don't let me stop, Your great self-destruction
Die if you want to, You misguided martyr
I wash my hands of Your demolition
Die if You want to, You innocent puppet

Jesus Jorge,"Ocultando tu mirada
de tristeza abandonada
en la soledad?

Esperanza, créeme:
yo no quise hacerte mal.
Te suplico me comprendas
si te defraudé.

Esperanza te aseguro
que sin tí hoy nada tengo,
que serás por siempre el ángel
de mis sueños.

Aquí estoy, ya me ves,
suplicándote perdón.
Si en verdad te fallé,
no fué esa mi intención.
Cúlpame y entiérrame
en el pecho tu dolor,
pero no te vayas nunca,
no me ignores, por favor.

Que difícil descubrir
el vacío en tu mirar
donde ardía aquel incendio
sobrenatural.

Escondida en un rincón
con el mundo del revés,
y que todo sea culpa
de mi estupidez.

Aquí estoy, ya me ves,
suplicándote perdón.
Si en verdad te fallé,
no fué esa mi intención.
Cúlpame y entiérrame
en el pecho tu dolor,
pero no te vayas nunca,
no me ignores, por favor.

Walked in and took your love away
But when bad times come a-haunting you, yeah
Will she stick around or walk away?

You couldn't stand up to the promises you made
Just like a Judas you took my love and ran
But could you love somebody one on one?

Keep your love away from me, I can't take no more
One and one is two, two and three is five
Keep your love away from me if you wanna stay alive

Como ayer decías que iba a ser,
La vida es tan simple ahora sin tenerte.

Y sigo así,
Palabras que me desnudan,
Me envuelven tanto las dudas,
La historia siempre continua.

Y no puedo dejarte de amar,
No puedo dejar de esperar,
No puedo perderte al final,
Y no te puedo olvidar,
No se luchar si no estas

Y es así,
Yo ya no creo en milagros,
Si tu no estas a mi lado,
Soy un velero en el mar del pasado.

Y sigo así,
Un soñador sin noches,
Un alma sin destino,
Que paga por sus errores.

Y no puedo dejarte de amar,
No puedo dejar de esperar,
No puedo perderte al final,
Y no te puedo olvidar,
No se vivir si no estas

Si no estas,contigo aquí,
El mundo me abre sus brazos,
El tiempo gira despacio,
Soy el guardián del calor de tus labios.

Si vuelvo a ti,
Ser quien guie tu norte,
El faro de tus sentidos,
Que te querré para siempre.

Y no puedo dejarte de amar,
No puedo dejar de esperar,
No quiero perderte al final,
Y no te puedo olvidar,
No es luchar si no estas.",No Puedo Dejarte de Amar [Versión Española],2007

Jesus Ojeda Y Sus Parientes,"Sigue la descendencia, sigue la tradición 
De seguir en la mafia, desde que era un chavo 
Así lo enseñaron, nunca se rajo 
Hoy esta felix, de seguir el camino 
Que un dia su padre, a el le heredo 

Se respeta el viejo, aunque se aye preso 
Este donde este, los negocios siguen 
Y si hay un problema, hacemos un panchon 
Todos lo recuerdan, por ser tan derecho 
También esperamos, salgas de prisión 

Aquí en culiacan, los que ami me respaldan 
Gerencia mz, nunca me an fallado 
Y estoy pa servirles, también brinco yo 
Puedo asegurarles, soy todo terreno 
Soy el chavo felix, el hijo de panchon 

Si estoy trabajando, si estoy comerciando 
Siempre bien pendiente, de todos los jales 
Que todo resulte, a la perfección 
Que vengan las chavas, que empieze el relajo 
Que suenen guitarras y el acordeón 

A toda mi gente, le mando un saludo 
En particular, a todos mis compadres 
Al güero mi hermano y a un tal samuelon 
A todos los ántrax y pa' mi cuñado 
El mayito gordo, somos un clicon 

El luto lo llevo, aquí dentro en mi pecho 
Por varios amigos, que ya se me han ido 
También les dedico, mi humilde canción 
Recuerden que el chavo, es alegre y tranquilo 
Y muy divertido y felix el amigo",El Chavo Félix,2012
Jesuton,"Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one horse sleigh
Giddy up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Oh what a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away

Timothy, we found your spaceship
Timothy, it's the farthest you've ever flown-own-own
Own-own-own-own-own

Hey! Put your lighters up
Put your lighters up y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all
Y'all put your lighters up
This the Timothy song if you don't know about me

Yeah they call me Tim, V-A's phenomenon
I kill 'em all winter, until the summer come
From just another name, all the way to number one
And I'm simply the best when it's all said and done
Remember when me and Magoo was tryin to make a mill'?
Well we did and years later we got it still
Gave you my bio, ""Under Construction 1 and 2""
Hundred percent, Ginuwine, that was from me to you
I'm makin moves while they ridicule
I'm like a warm summer breeze in the swimmin pool - I'm cool
I never kept it basic, I been so many places
Been gettin money since them honies had them small faces
So many little me's, I can hear small traces
But I just ignore it, cause I'm too big for it
And I can hear 'em screamin {*echoes*}

Timothy, where have you been?
It's not what it seems but it is
Timothy, where have you been?
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy, where have you been?

I been in Athens, Georgia by way of Bubba Sparxxx
When the +Nights+ were +Bright+ and all the +Days+ was +Dark+
But now they all bright, everything is all right
If you assume my life is wonderful then y'all right
I got a bad wife, three beautiful kids
I make the world dance, yeah look what I done did
Hits for Jay-Z, Nelly Furtado
Catch up, y'all slow, escargot
Nelly did fourteen mill', where's Fargo?
I brought a airplane, fuck I need a car fo'?
Ask Justin Timberlake is Timbaland great?
Y'all gotta deal with me, no handshake
Stand up nigga, rather have a stand off
With the law before I let 'em say I ran off
And I can hear 'em screamin'

Timothy, where have you been?
It's not what it seems but it is
Timothy, where have you been?
She cried in the kitchen to let you go
Timothy, where have you been?

Ay, some say I went away but really I never left
They wonder where I been, but they can never guess
I been around the world here to the other side
And I successfully achieved what all those others tried
Carry my city on my back like a crucifix
For more than a decade cause I can do this shit
A lot of people want my spot but I don't hesitate
The track label my legacy won't appreciate
I stand strong, everything I put my hands on
Me and Mr. I be, cause ain't no I in team
Cause I can hear 'em sayin'

Jet,"﻿첫 번째 앨범은 시큰둥
두 번째는 대중들의 작은 집중 뿐
세 네 번째 부터
이 썩은 scene의 귀중품
새빨간 19금 딱지가 붙었지만
still 진실만을 썼다
음악은 나의 길
심의실에서 평가 불능한 appeal
득과 실 벌써 decade
Still mic를 check 해
Like JK형 밝은 미래 in my arms
실낱 꿈 풍파와 입맞춤
가사를 쓸 때마다
혼자가 아니야 in my room
내게 숨 같던
친구들의 반이 하늘나라
내가 대신 꾸는 꿈 속에서
편히 잠을 자라
맺힌 내 땀을 봐라
I\'m a damn 괴물
Made an independent label
cause I won\'t ever settle
at your level
Like Bob Dylan
I\'m Not There\' in this 폐허
레어 성서
in your eyePod 플레이어
Till I see God up there
높이 솟아올라
세상은 유대자본이 지속한
몰락 속에 피로 차올라
But 징조가 좋다
To the free mountaintop

처음엔 지루한
학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다
모든 걸 고통 없이
원한다면 해답은 없다
내가 해냈으면 너도
충분히 할 수 있으니 believe
내가 해냈으면 너도
충분히 할 수 있으니 believe
If I can you can
If I can you can
If I can you can
Never once did I stutter
한 계단씩 걸어
from the gutter to the top
Never 떨어
\'cause we hot like summer
서러웠던 날의 어깨의 먼지 털어
정승처럼 쓰면서 미친 개처럼 벌어
Like I\'m Lil Wayne
made a few milli still
I\'m insane in the brain
like I\'m Cypress Hill
Cypher\'s killed when I rap
얼굴 찌푸리면서
Like a drummer in the back
너넨 뒷북이나 쳐
마음이 뒤틀린
낙서 가득 기운이 앞서
누구나 깎아내는
조각가들 신물이 났어
차라리 신문이나 펴
요즘의 경제면처럼 마땅한
대안 없는 음악 믿음이 안 서
착실한 기반 닦은 확실한 상품
어설픈 화가들의 막 칠한 작품
둘 중 하나를 분명히 해
이력서를 써
결과야 뭐 어떻던 미련은 못써
If I can you can
If I can you can
If I can you can
오늘도 천천히 걸어
걸어 정상으로 가

She knocks, he lets her in
The flame that flickered long before
When they were only kids

Just one thing
The thought inside her head
She turns to him
And looks at her and says

Every moment in your life
Comes down to what you hold inside
Looking back on days gone by
I'd always think of you

Take a picture from the past
And try to make the moment last
I wish I would have told you

I just wanna hold you tonight
(Tonight)
I just wanna hold you tonight
(Tonight)

The living room they start to talk
The memories flooding in
Of drinking in the parking lot
And dances in the gym

Just one thing
The thought inside her head
She turns to him
And looks at her and says

Every moment in your life
Comes down to what you hold inside
Looking back on days gone by
I'd always think of you

Take a picture from the past
And try to make the moment last

Many nights he lied awake thinking
The moments passed him by
But they hold on to the memories
It's so hard

Every moment in our lives
Comes down to what we hold inside
Looking back on days gone by
I'd always think of you

Every moment in your life
Comes down to what you hold inside
Looking back on days gone by
I'd always think of you

Jet Black Stare,"When the weather is cold
When money is low
It's better with someone to hold
And when the road up ahead
Is so unclear 
I'd rather be together not hear
When the circle life throws you a curve
There's someone of better or worse
And when you pick up the pace
But loosing the race
A friendly and familiar face

Everyone wants to be kissing on new years eve
Underneath the mistletoe 
While it's snowing outside
Making fireworks like it's the forth of July

Sometimes it's gotta be a no show
Probably end your heart though
Better to learn crashing by
Then never to fly at all
The chances are it falls apart
Sometimes it's over before it starts
Better to know crashing but 
Then never to fly at all

The ship doesn't sail
You try but you fail
Your lover keeps checking the mail
And whenever your down
From crying out loud
You'd rather see his face in the crowd
If you see the top 
You know it's making it there
Or if you didn't bring somebody who cares
Your a day to late or a minute to soon
Your stealing the stars

Everyone wants to be kissing on new years eve
Underneath the mistletoe 
While it's snowing outside 
Fireworks light up the sky

Sometimes it's gotta be a no show
Probably end your heart though

Jet by Day,"It's like the sick leading the blind, a trail leading kids to cliffs,
An infecting sound that won't comply, and a strangled girl who's losing feeling. 
The world around is basking her in baths of misdirected hurt. 
She never seems to fight her pain, as it seeps into the picture's frame. 
Passages read day and night, a holy focus not her sight. 
These people shelter,(language faults) and move with calculated tact,
But she keeps thinking the worst is coming.
The only problem with colder weather is the fatigue it leaves until spring. 
A tired face, with tired eyes complete with tired desires for any more fires to take the burn away. The damage has won, moreover she's gone. 
The past has marred her sweet heart.
Home's a place to go when people cross you, 
But home's a place too cold, where the road seems too long.
She's only dreaming in black and gray. 
Summer's past and with it her hopes. 
Anchors aren't lifting! Is nothing sacred,
Or needed? Chemicals turned catalysts. 
Her fears are choking her. Please girl wake up!
Where's your desire to fight this? The never-ending fever defeats her.",Framed,2002
Jet Harris,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1996
Jet Harris,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

By the time it's over, no snakes alive
Take the dive, I'm tellin' you, you better off
Then up against a flow to make her, take her sweater off

From the set off when it came to scripts he could hardly brag
It's the result of concentration and lolly-gag
I said, ""Yeah right"" he pulled the mic out a snotty rag
Sealed up air-tight and wrapped up in a body bag

Get a advance and catch chance writer's block
After spendin' the first and last penny
My own worst enemy tell me if I'm OD and usual flow
And made deals with these cats who keep sending dough, so

The Three Headed said it, never get busted
He's a man of his word who's not to be trusted
Beats encrypted, multi-faceted encrusted
Shorty pawn, keep mic rusted

Sort of mellow type of fellow
Who sometimes spaz on wife like Othello
Hell no he won't use words like illuminati
Or Gotti all shotty might use karate

Azar the Gaza cut I'll ask why a mask
With the gall style caps say nice fly
Exact dough till it stack high, white ho, black
Guy the rap game, black eye

Exhiliration, Jet Jag's accelerations
Touch speeds minds can't concieve
Achieve altered, attitudes and angles, angels answer
Aura, illumilation, awesome interperation

Awkward alarm, ankle house arrest and who's best?
Monster Island Czars crush pawn dreams to be king
A frank reality calculation could never be
Quest destined, distant competition dusted

Disgusted raise for second, crowded
Clouded confusion, conclusion simple, plain
Self education, self made millionaires
Serpents slitherin', sidewind searchin'

Stalkin', heat sensin' can't have me Jet Jag's riki tiki tavi
Superhero hit zero to sixty hot pursuit, pedal to the floor
Handlin' lyrics, traction swervin' left right makin' head fix
Layin' high stakes levitates, quick hit breaks
They fly past hit war parts fly loose, kill a mongoose

Fake niggaz contiue to practice the art of intimidation
Sterile minds concieve and threw up all artificial insemination
Syntax a sequential rage unless it's all deliberate
Angle wide words clear, but population stay illiterate

Consider it God's a fine power, fools get rid of it
Men build dreams on promises but lacken' the will to deliver it
You, I disolve connivers like saliva on tic tacs
World is strange, but get the job done like sises mix max

Flip tracks, murder stinks, drunk niggaz killin' six packs
Chokin' on venom, suffered tricknological kick backs
Poverty stricken' minds, all thoughts barely worth two cents
Build history through time, many a design on blueprints

Anooshes slides in the sky, eight-five percent never knew
Wise men arise, pull files like internal revenue
Forever true, appauled? There's self evidence with leverage
Upset? The beast belly concoct

Homogenised beverage
Clever shit, calculate a sabatoge trojan horse
Gift from? See through any G motion that grows in force
Chose to toss to teach familiar line throughout the underworld

God of elevation kills Superman, rape Wondergirl
The discounted, decapitated rapist it's acceptable
The everyday occurrence a fatal outcome's inevitable

Might as well join the forces boss
Chance take a loss like coin toss
Roll with the double headed nickel
Pawn the pawn a Jet Jag with the sickle you and a pickle

King Ghidra yo you ass betta leave 'em alone
Before ya go catch a seizure and leave 'em blown
If you ain't the best of the best in the top three

Either myself, I and me don't even think of caps
But act like you had a slight inkling perhaps
Or get smacked back in the ring like Bob Backlund

There's a lot of things you've done I'd damn you for

From finger to finger, from head to toe
I do hope you're alright

That we don't talk anymore, no

I'm winter cold in maiden fall
A beaten road where no one goes
And though I've left my post
The ones who meant the most
Wrote you a song, a stepping stone

Wait and stay, without you I'll decay away
And there won't be a whole lot that's left of me

With muscle and marrow and strength in my bones
I will tear out the bricks
That are holding together the walls
That divide our frail homes

Wait but hold on let me find something roll up on
They say it’s now or never just hoping now it don’t take too long
I’m on my paper chasing we chasin bread and it’s marathon
Yeah I love pussy but plenty of nights I done slept alone
I done it on my own just me myself and my microphone
And til my next life I yell Jet life til I’m dead and gone
Stay high up when the loud pack its that Cali strong
Ain't no child play no need for that girl both us grown
Frontin ain't paying nobody bills better keeps your hustle going
Over these camp fire I tell my ghetto story

But I’m still using my Playstation for a DVD player
Never gave up motherfuck
Not in the business of saving sluts
Theres a auction on some retail space

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes

Are you pretending

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.

Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings,1995

Jethro Burns,"In nineteen and fifty-nine we took a little hike
With our scout master down to Lake Oneeganite
We took a little pizza and we took some saurkrauts
And we marched along together till we heard the girl scouts

[Chorus]
We're the boys from Camp Kookamonga
Our mothers sent us here for to study nature's ways
We learned to make sparks by rubbing sticks together
But if we catch the girls then we'll set the woods ablaze
F: And I was mad because me mother sent me up here ha-ha-ha
Well we crept up to the water and we see the girls a-swimmin
There musta been a hundred of them pretty young women
They looked so fine even birds forgot to sing
We lay down in the poison oak and didn't say a thing

[Chorus]

F: Hey will one of you fellas scratch my back?
Well our counselor said we could take them by surprise
If we didn't say a word till we looked them in the eyes
We kept real still and we had our eyes aglued
We saw how they were dressed they were swimming in the
Welll now...

[Chorus]
Well they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
They ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast even we couldn't catch them
And we can even hike all the way to Buffalo
F: Hey fellas wait for me
Well we ran right after them till everyone was pooped
So we rested for a moment and our forces we regrouped
Then we saw the girls behind some evergreens
Captured by a company of United States Marines

[Chorus]

F: Aww those big guys get everything
Well they ran through the briars an they ran through the brambles
They ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go

Jethro Burns,"When I was walking down the street, a billboard caught my eye.
The advertisement written there would make you laugh and cry.
The sign was torn and tattered from the storm the night before,
And as I gazed upon it, well, this is what I sawr:

Smoke Coca-Cola cigarettes. Drink Wrigley's Spearmint beer.
Ken-L-Ration dog food makes your wife's complexion clear.
Chew chocolate-covered mothballs -- they're sure to satisfy.
Brush your teeth with Lifebuoy soap and watch the suds go by.

When I recovered from the sock, I went along my way.
I'd gone no further than a block, when there to my dismay,
Another billboard caught my eye, just like the one before,
As I gazed upon it, well, this is what I sawr:

Take your next vacation in a brand-new Frigidaire.
Learn to play piano in your winter underwear. 
Simonize your baby with a Hershey's candy bar,
And see the difference that Drano makes in all the movie stars!

Doctors say that babies shouldn't smoke 'til they are three.
People over 35, take baths in Lipton Tea.

With freezing rains melting and no trains running
And sad eyes passing in windows flimsy
And my seat rocking from legs not quite matching
Got passport, credit cards, a plane that I'm catching
Black Sunday falls one day too soon

The taxi that takes me will be moving so quickly
My suitcases simply too full for the closing
Of pants, shirts and kisses all packed in a hurry
Two best-selling paperbacks chosen at random
No sign of sales persons to whom I might hand them
Black Sunday falls one day too soon

And down at the airport are probably waiting
A few thousand passengers, overbooked seating
Time long suspended in transit lounge traumas
Connections broken and Special Branch watching
Conspicuously standing in holiday clothing
Black Sunday falls one day too soon

Pick up my feet and kick off my lethargy
Down to the gate with the old mood upon me
Get out and chase the small immortality
Born in the minute of my next returning
Impatient feet tapping and cigarette burning
Homecoming one day too soon

Back at the house there's a gray sky a-tumbling
Milk bottles piling on door steps a-crumbling
Curtains all drawn and cold water plumbing
Notepaper scribbles I read unbelieving
Saying how sorry, how sad was the leaving
One day too soon

Tomorrow is the one day I would change for a Monday
With freezing rains melting and no trains running
And sad eyes passing in windows flimsy
And my seat rocking from legs not quite matching

But I had a most funny feeling 
It wasn't me they were shouting for.
So when the tall dark lady smiled at me
I said, ""Oh, baby let us go for a ride.''
And we came upon two drinks or four
And popped them oh so neatly inside.

A silver cloud blew right on by.
And, taking in the morning, I sang
O Requiem.

Well, my lady told me, ""Stay.""

Along the strand.

Close behind the taxi stand.
Saw her face in the tear-drop black cab window.
Fading into the traffic; watched her go.

Heard myself singing

And your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick

And the sand castle virtues are all swept away
In the tidal destruction, the moral melee
The elastic retreat rings the close of play
As the last wave uncovers the newfangled way

But your new shoes are worn at the heels
And your suntan does rapidly peel
And your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick

And the love that I feel is so far away
I'm a bad dream that I just had today
And you shake your head
And say that it's a shame

Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth
Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth
Spin me down the long ages, let them sing the song",Thick as a Brick/Farm on the Freeway,
Jethro Tull,"Now is the solstice of the year,
Winter is the glad song that you hear.
Seven maids move in seven time.
Have the lads up ready in a line.
Ring out these bells.
Ring out, ring solstice bells.
Ring solstice bells.

Join together beneath the mistletoe.
By the holy oak whereon it grows.
Seven druids dance in seven time.
Sing the song the bells call, loudly chiming.
Ring out these bells.
Ring out, ring solstice bells.
Ring solstice bells.

Praise be to the distant sister sun,
Joyful as the silver planets run.
Seven maids move in seven time.

Ring on, ring out.

Impressed by all the words we read
And the heroes that we knew.
Climb on your your dream, a dream of our own making
To find a place that we could later lose
To whatever time would bring.

We were seventeen and the cakeman was affecting you 
Moving you to greater things (in a lesser way)
You had to prove.
The clock struck summertime. you were going round in circles now.
Wishing you were seventeen. at twenty-one, it was a long time gone.
And now here you are. you're locked in your own excuse.
The circle's getting smaller every day.
You're busy planning the next fifty years.
So stay the way you are and keep your head down to the same old ground.
Just paint your picture boy until you find
A closed circle's better than an open line.

Yes stay the way you are. I got a circle that's the same as yours.
It may be bigger, but I've more to lose.
Who is the luckier man, me or you?",17 [*],1969

But if I were to share it with you,
You would stand to gain and I to lose.
Oh I couldn't bear it so I've got nothing to say.

No, just because I have a name well I've got nothing to say.

Climb a tower of freedom, paint your own deceiving sign.
It's not my power to criticize or to ask you to be blind
To your own pressing problem and the hate you must unwind.

Dressed in white but your shoes aren't clean
Painted them up with polish
In the hope we can't see where you've been

The smiling face that you've worn
To greet me rising at morning
Sent me out to work for my score
Please me and say what it's for
Give me the straight-laced promise
And not the pathetic lie

Tie me down with your ribbons
And sulk when I ask you why
Your Sunday paper voice cries
Demanding truths I deny

The bitter-sweet kiss you pretended
Is offered, our affair mended
Sossity, you're a woman
Society, you're a woman

All of the tears you're wasting
Are for yourself and not for me
It's sad to know you're aging
Sadder still to admit I'm free

Has grown too young to enjoy

Woman, you were too old for me

Heard him ringing on my bell
He said, my name's the teacher
Oh that is what I call myself
And I have a lesson
That I must impart to you
It's an old expression
But I must insist it's true

Jump up, look around
Find yourself some fun
No sense in sitting there hating everyone
No man's an island and his castle isn't home
The nest is for nothing when the bird has flown

So I took a journey
Threw my world into the sea
With me went the teacher
Who found fun instead of me

Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said?
Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed
I try to socialize but I can't seem to find
What I was looking for, got something on my mind

Then the teacher told me
It had been a lot of fun
Thanked me for his ticket
And all that I had done

Money power wins
And the yellow, soft mountains
Move under him

Though it's a shame that it had to be you
The mother ship
Is just a blip from your trip made for two
I'm with you boys
So please employ just a little extra care
It's on my mind
I'm left behind when I should have been there
Walking with you

And the limp face hungry viewers
Fight to fasten with their eyes
Like the man hung from the trapeze
Whose fall will satisfy
And congratulate each other
On their rare and wondrous deed
That their begrudged money bought
To sow the monkey's seed

And the yellow soft mountains
They grow very still
Witness as intrusion
The humanoid thrill

And digging up their gold

Jethro Tull,"There's the stillness of death on a deathly unliving sea
And the motorcar magical world has long since ceased to be,
When the eve bitten apple returned to destroy the tree.
Incestuous ancestry's charabanc ride,
Spawning new millions throws the world on its side.
Supporting their farflung illusion, the national curse,
And those with no sandwiches please get off the bus.

The excrement bubbles, the century's slime decays,
And the brainwashing government lackeys would have us say
It's under control and we'll soon be on our way
To a grand year for babies and quiz panel games
Of the hot hungry millions you'll be sure to remain.
The natural resources are dwinding and no one grows old
And those with no homes to go to, please pick yourself holes.

We wandered through quiet lands, felt the first breath of snow,
Searched for the last pigeon, slate gray I've been told.
Stumbled on a daffodil which she crushed in the rush,
Heard it sigh and left it to die.
At once felt remorse and were touched by the loss of our own,
Held its poor broken head in her hands, dropped soft tears in the snow
And it's only the taking that makes you what you are.
Wondering aloud will a son one day be born
To share in our infancy in the child's path we've worn.
In the aging seclusion of this earth that our birth,
Did surprise. We'll open his eyes.",Wond'ring Again,1972

Jethro Tull,"Lend me your ear while I call you a fool.
You were kissed by a witch one night in the wood,
And later insisted your feelings were true.

The witches promise was coming,
Believing he listened while laughing you flew.

Leaves falling, red, yellow, brown, all look the same,
And the love you had found lay outside in the rain,
Washed clean by the water but nursing its pain.
The witches promise was coming,
And you're looking elsewhere for your own selfish gain.

Keep looking, keep looking for somewhere to be,
Well, you're wasting your time, they not stupid like he is.
Meanwhile leaves are still falling, you're too blind to see.
You won't find it easy now, it's only fair.
He was willing to give to you, you didn't care.
You're waiting for more but you've already had your share.

He's going to be late.",Witches Promise,1972

And you make all your animal deals
And your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick

And the sandcastle virtues are all swept away
In the tidal destruction the moral melee
The elastic retreat rings the close of play
As the last wave uncovers the newfangled way
But your new shoes are worn at the heels
And your suntan does rapidly peel
And your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick
And the love that I feel is so far away:
I'm a bad dream that I just had today
And you shake your head
And said it's a shame

Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth
Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth
Spin me down the long ages, let them sing the song

See there, a son is born and we pronounce him fit to fight
There are blackheads on his shoulders, and he pees himself in the night
We'll make a man of him, put him to trade
Teach him to play Monopoly and how to sing in the rain

The poet and the painter casting shadows on the water
As the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea
The do-er and the thinker, no allowance for the other
As the failing light illuminates the mercenary's creed
The home fire burning, the kettle almost boiling
But the master of the house is far away
The horses stamping, their warm breath clouding
In the sharp and frosty morning of the day
And the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword
And the youngest of the family is moving with authority
Building castles by the sea, he dares the tardy tide to wash them all aside

The cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the river
Where the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea:
The builder of the castles renews the age-old purpose
And contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need
The young men of the household have all gone into service
And are not to be expected for a year
The innocent young master, thoughts moving ever faster
Has formed the plan to change the man he seems
And the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword
And the oldest of the family is moving with authority
Coming from across the sea, he challenges the son
Who puts him to the run

What do you do when the old man's gone, ddo you want to be him?
And your real self sings the song, do you want to free him?
No one to help you get up steam
And the whirlpool turns you way off-beam

I've come down from the upper class to mend your rotten ways
My father was a man of power whom everyone obeyed
So come on all you criminals! I've got to put you straight
Just like I did with my old man twenty years too late

Your bread and water's going cold, your hair is short and neat
I'll judge you all and make damn sure that no-one judges me

You curl your toes in fun as you smile at everyone
You meet the stares, you're unaware that your doings aren't done
And you laugh most ruthlessly as you tell us what not to be
But how are we supposed to see where we should run?

And your silver buckle shoes

Who lets you bend the rules

So, come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages of your comic-books, your super crooks
And show us all the way?
Well, make your will and testament
Won't you join your local government?

You put your bet on number one and it comes up every time
The other kids have all backed down and they put you first in line
And so you finally ask yourself just how big you are
And you take your place in a wiser world of bigger motor cars

In neat little rows sporting canvas frills

With the blood of the fools and the thoughts of the wise
And from the pan under your bed

As the wise man breaks wind and is gone
While the fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose and the nursery rhyme winds along

So come all ye young men who are building castles
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus
Mark the precise nature of your fear

And the hour of judgement draweth near
Would you be the fool stood in his suit of armour or the wiser man who rushes clear?

For there is no business like the show we're in.
There is no reason, no rhyme, no right
To leave the circus 'til we've said good-night.

It's the same old story to this Passion Play.

Your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.
And the love that I feel is so far away:
I'm a bad dream that I just had today -- and you
Shake your head and
Say it's a shame.
Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth.
Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth.
Spin me down the long ages: let them sing the song.
See there! a son is born -- and we pronounce him fit to fight.
There are black-heads on his shoulders, and he pees himself in the night.
We'll
Make a man of him
Put him to trade
Teach him
To play monopoly and
To sing in the rain.
The poet and the painter casting shadows on the water --
As the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea.
The do-er and the thinker: no allowance for the other --
As the failing light illuminates the mercenary's creed.
The home fire burning: the kettle almost boiling --
But the master of the house is far away.
The horses stamping -- their warm breath clouding
In the sharp and frosty morning of the day.
And the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword.
And the youngest of the family is moving with authority.
Building castles by the sea, he dares the tardy tide to wash them all aside.
The cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the river
Where the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea:
The builder of the castles renews the age-old purpose
And contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need.
The young men of the household have
All gone into service and
Are not to be expected for a year.
The innocent young master -- thoughts moving ever faster --
Has formed the plan to change the man he seems.
And the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword.
And the oldest of the family is moving with authority.
Coming from across the sea, he challenges the son who puts him to the run.
What do you do when
The old man's gone -- do you want to be him? and
Your real self sings the song.
Do you want to free him? 
No one to help you get up steam --
And the whirlpool turns you `way off-beam.
Later.
I've come down from the upper class to mend your rotten ways.
My father was a man-of-power whom everyone obeyed.
So come on all you criminals!
I've got to put you straight just like I did with my old man --
Twenty years too late.
Your bread and water's going cold.
Your hair is too short and neat.
I'll judge you all and make damn sure that no-one judges me.
You curl your toes in fun as you smile at everyone -- you meet the stares.
You're unaware that your doings aren't done.
And you laugh most ruthlessly as you tell us what not to be.
But how are we supposed to see where we should run? 
I see you shuffle in the courtroom with
Your rings upon your fingers and
Your downy little sidies and
Your silver-buckle shoes.
Playing at the hard case, you follow the example of the comic-paper idol
Who lets you bend the rules.
So!
Come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages of your comic-books
Your super crooks
And show us all the way.
Well! make your will and testament. won't you? 
Join your local government.
We'll have superman for president
Let robin save the day.
You put your bet on number one and it comes up every time.
The other kids have all backed down and they put you first in line.
And so you finally ask yourself just how big you are --
And take your place in a wiser world of bigger motor cars.
And you wonder who to call on.
So! where the hell was biggles when you needed him last saturday? 
And where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you though? 
They're all resting down in cornwall --
Writing up their memoirs for a paper-back edition
Of the boy scout manual.
Later.
See there! a man born -- and we pronounce him fit for peace.
There's a load lifted from his shoulders with the discovery of his disease.
We'll
Take the child from him
Put it to the test
Teach it
To be a wise man
How to fool the rest.

Upgrade? hipgrave. oh, mac.
Later
In the clear white circles of morning wonder,
I take my place with the lord of the hills.
And the blue-eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured (in neat little rows)
Sporting canvas frills.
With their jock-straps pinching, they slouch to attention,
While queueing for sarnies at the office canteen.
Saying -- how's your granny and
Good old ernie: he coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win.
The legends (worded in the ancient tribal hymn) lie cradled
In the seagull's call.
And all the promises they made are ground beneath the sadist's fall.
The poet and the wise man stand behind the gun,
And signal for the crack of dawn.
Light the sun.
Do you believe in the day? do you? 
Believe in the day! the dawn creation of the kings has begun.
Soft venus (lonely maiden) brings the ageless one.
Do you believe in the day? 
The fading hero has returned to the night -- and fully pregnant with the day,
Wise men endorse the poet's sight.
Do you believe in the day? do you? believe in the day!
Let me tell you the tales of your life of
Your love and the cut of the knife
The tireless oppression
The wisdom instilled
The desire to kill or be killed.
Let me sing of the losers who lie in the street as the last bus goes by.
The pavements are empty: the gutters run red -- while the fool
Toasts his God in the sky.
So come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus.
Mark the precise nature of your fear.
Let me help you pick up your dead as the sins of the father are fed
With
The blood of the fools and
The thoughts of the wise and
From the pan under your bed.
Let me make you a present of song as
The wise man breaks wind and is gone while
The fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose and
The nursery rhyme winds along.
So! come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus.
Mark the precise nature of your fear.
See! the summer lightning casts it's bolts upon you
And the hour of judgement draweth near.
Would you be
The fool stood in his suit of armour or
The wiser man who rushes clear.
So! come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't your rise up from the pages of your comic-books
Your super-crooks and
Show us all the way.
Well! make your will and testament.
Won't you? join your local government.

Jethro Tull,"Fish and chips, sandpaper lips and a rainy pavement.
Soho lights, another night, thinking of you.
Black cat, sat on a wall, winks at me darkly.

And the policemen nods as you pass along his beat.
Sweaty feet, troubled brow -- we're all in the same game, lady.

Spill their scotch and water.

Jethro Tull,"The old rocker wore his hair too long
Wore his trouser cuffs too tight
Unfashionable to the end drank his ale too light

Death's head belts buckle, yesterday's dreams

Ringing no change in his double sewn seams
In his post-war babe gloom

Now he's too old to rock 'n' roll
But he's too young to die
Yes, he's too old to rock 'n' roll
But he's too young to die

He once owned a Harley Davidson
And a triumph Bonneville
Counted his friends in burned out spark plugs
And prays that he always will

But he's the last of the blue blood greasers boys
And all of his mates are doing time
Married with three kids up by the ring road
Sold their souls straight down the line

And some of them own little sports cars
And meet at the tennis club do's
For drinks on a Sunday, work on Monday

Now they're too old to rock 'n' roll
And they're too young to die

To make a ton before he takes his leave
Up on the A1 by Scotch Corner
Just like it used to be

And as he flies, tears in his eyes
His wind-whipped words echo the final take
And he hits the trunk road doing around a 120
With no room left to brake

And he was too old to rock 'n' roll
But he was too young to die
He was too old to rock 'n' roll

live and die upon your cross of platinum.

Clear your throat and pray for rain to irrigate the corridors that echo in
your brain filled with empty nothingness, empty hunger pains.

And all the little girls

Clump up on their platform soles.

motorways, powerlines,
keep us apart?

Swishing through the rye grass
With thoughts of mouse and apple pie
Tail balancing at half-mast

Lying in the cherry tree
Savage bed foot warmer
Of purest feline ancestry

Look out, little furry folk
He's the all night working cat
Eats but one in every ten
Leaves the others on the mat

And the mouse police never sleeps
Waiting by the cellar door
Window-box town crier
Birth and death registrar

With claws that rake a furrow red
Licensed to mutilate
From warm milk on a lazy day
To dawn patrol on hungry hate

Windy roof top weathercock
Warm blooded night on a cold tile

Sleepy houses lying four-square and firm.

Sliding through Victorian tunnels
Where green moss oozes from the pores.
Dull echoes from the wet embankments
Battlefield allotments. Fresh open sores.

Double-locked black briefcase on the floor,
Like a faithful dog with master
Sleeping in the draught beside the carriage door.
To each Journeyman his own home-coming
Cold supper nearing with each station stop.
Frosty flakes on empty platforms
Fireside slippers waiting. Flip. Flop.

Journeyman night-tripping on the late fantasic
Too late to stop for tea at Gerard's Cross
And hear the soft shoes on the footbridge shuffle
As the wheels turn biting on the midnight frost.

In its May-bud tenderness,
Sending water-lillies sailing
As she turned to get undressed.

And the long night awakened
And we soared on powdered wings,
Circling our tomorrows
In the wary month of Spring.

Chasing shadows slipping
In a magic lantern slide,
Creatures of the candle
On a night-light-ride.

Dipping and weaving
Flutter through the golden needle's eye
In our haystack madness.
Butterfly-stroking on a Spring-tide high.

In the patterns of the sky,

Do you hold snowflakes at bay?
Do you lift the dawn sun from the fields
And help him on his way?

Sad cargo of an old ship: young bodies whoring
Slow ocean hobo ports closed to her crew
No hope of immigration keep on passing through.

Set a sympathetic flag a-flying

In the darkness when the campfire's dead to each his private hell.
If you look behind your shoulder as you feel his eyes to feast,
You can witness now the everchanging nature of the beast.

Beastie

If you wear a warmer sporran, you can keep the foe at bay.
You can pop those pills and visit some psychiatrist who'll say
There's nothing I can do for you, everywhere's a danger zone.
I'd love to help get rid of it, but I've got one of my own.

Beastie

There's a beast upon my shoulder and a fiend upon my back.
Feel his burning breath a heaving, smoke oozing from his stack.
And he moves beneath the covers or he lies below the bed.
He's the beast upon your shoulder. He's the price upon your head.

He's the lonely fear of dying, and for some, of living too.
He's your private nightmare pricking. He'd just love to turn the screw.
So stand as one defiant yes, and let your voices swell.
Stare that beastie in the face and really give him hell.

Keeping cool by mutual permission.
How did the conversation get
To where we came to blows?
We were set up in a red condition
And again we're flying colors.

Dawn light not yet showing.
There's just a thin horizon between me and her
The edge of a half-dream glowing.

Strange how the sheets are warm beside me.
Now, how do I catch the waking edge?
As it slips to the far and wide of me.

Didn't I try to hold it down?
Freeze on the picture, 
Hang sharp on the sound.
Catch the waking edge another time.

Are still here for the taking.

Jethro Tull,"She said she was a dancer, if I believed it, it was my business
She surely knew a thing or two about control
Next to the bar we hit the samovar
She almost slipped right through my fingers
It was snowing outside and in her soul

Well, maybe you're a dancer, and maybe I'm the king of Old Siam
I thought it through, best to let the illusion roll
I wouldn't say I've never heard that tale before, ah
My frozen little senorita, but if your dream is good
Why not share it when the nights are cold?

Hey Moscow, what's your story? Lady, take your time, don't hurry
Maybe a student of the agricultural plan
Hey Moscow, what's your name? If you don't wanna say, don't worry
It would probably be hard for me to make it scan

With her phrase book in her silk soft hand
She spoke in riddles while the vodka listened
I said, ""Let me look up love, if I might be so bold''

She was the nearest thing to rock and roll
That side of the velvet curtain
That separates eastern steel from western gold

Hey Miss Moscow, what's your story?
You needn't speak aloud, just whisper
Am I just the closest thing to an Englishman?
You've seen me in your magazines, or maybe on state television
I'm your Pepsi Cola but you won't take me out the can

She said she was a dancer, so she did

She said she was a dancer, if I believed it, it was my business
It felt like a merry dance that I was being led
So I stole one kiss, it was a near miss
She looked at me like I was Jack The Ripper
She leaned in close, goodnight was all she said
So I took myself off to bed

Have opened up the seam
Of golden nights and champagne flights
Ad-man overkill
And in the haze
Consumer crazed
We take the sugar pill.
Jagged fires mark the picket lines
The politicians weep
And mealy-mouthed
Through corridors of power on tip-toe creep.
Come and see bureaucracy
Make its final heave
And let the new disorder through
While senses take their leave.
Families screaming line the streets
And put the windows through
In corner shops
Where keepers kept
The country's life-blood blue.
Take their pick
And try the trick
With loaves and fishes shared
And the vicar shouts
As the lights go out,
And no-one really cares.

Your jewelled sword twinkles as the world rolls by.
So come up singing above the cloudy cover
Stare through at people who toss fitful in their sleep.
I know you're watching as the old gent by the station
Scuffs his toes on old fag packets lying in the street
And silver shadows flick across the closing bistro.

Their words lost blowing on cold winds in darkest Chelsea.

Got out through the window.
While clinging to the skirts of fate
Was not my idea of fun
I'll jump to it gladly.
The town was filled with smoke and hate.
Came to my senses just too late
To realize that all I ever owned
Was borrowed. I thanked them for having shown
Me that nothing ever really belongs to anyone.

They burned my books and they broke my car,
And gave the dog to a man who used him for breeding.
They felled my trees and they tramped flowers and threw
The kitten into my new pool.
The same things done to other men had made them run away from the city.
This being the case, I joined them there and breathing air spent
The night with these new friends.

Driving gray satanic mills and weaving sad stories

Said Cock Robin from the wall
It's an early bird catches the worm
Show a little pride before you fall

So I flew to the south sun with birds of a feather
To drink in the warm nights and tell of fine weather
A stitch in time saves nine

Listen all you young folk, your lives on a timetable
Clocking on twenty-one, fly while you're able
A stitch in time saves nine

Jethro Tull,"I once met a girl
With the life in her hands
And we lay together
On the summerday sands

I gave her my raincoat
And told, ""Lady, be good""
And we made truth together
Where no one else would

I smiled through her fingers
And ran the dust through her hands
The hour-glass of reason
On the summerday sands

We sat as the sea caught fire
I waited as the flames grew higher
In her eyes, in her eyes

We watched the eagle born
Wings clipped, tail, feathers shorn
But we saw him rise
Over summerday sands

Came the ten-o'clock curfew
She said, ""I must start my car
I'm staying with someone
I met last night in a bar""

I called from my wave top
""At least, tell me your name""
She smiled from her wheel spin
And said, ""It's all the same""

I thought for a minute
Jumped back on dry land
Left one set of footprints
On the summerday sands

I once met a girl
With the life in her hands
And we lied together
On the summerday sands

Sometimes I do.
She's got a tongue like a viper, but she can whisper like a dove.
Soft touch like brushed velvet: till she hits you from above.
And sometimes she does.
She leaves me breathing: down like a fallen log.
Just when I feel like dancing
I wake up sleeping with the dog.
And it goes: sleeping with the dog.

I have to guess at the mysteries of her unfathomable soul.
Guess when the time seems right
to make a broken spirit whole
and that time is due. C'mon.

You want to be aloof?

Fly before you fall,
Little sparrow on the schoolyard wall.

So dress a little dangerous 
And modify your walk.

But try to be a sparrowhawk.
Hunting in the evening and floating 
In the heat in the day.
You might, might acquire 
Some predatory instinct.
Do the wolf pack crawl.

Fly before you fall,
Little sparrow on the schoolyard wall.

Well, I don't want to be your daddy.
Don't want to be your engineer of sin.
And I don't want to play the piper here.
I'm only banging on a mandolin
And anyway, you're just a little sparrow
On the schoolyard wall.

There's nothing wrong with learning. 
Nothing wrong with your books.
So exercise some judgment. 
Too much broth can spoil the cook.
Feel a little sensation 
And know when it's time to join in.

Got to set up my equipment, if you boys can lend a hand.""
Oh yeah. When Jesus came to play.
He set that bandstand jumping. 
Yeah, and he cranked it up so loud.

We boys were getting restless: no girls were moving on the floor.
Those parables, they were merciless and the tables overturned.

Jethro Tull,"She drifted from some minor festival.
Didn't look like any summer of love:
Just a thousand weekend warriors in a muddy field.
She was the hand to fit my glove.
Funny thing, the innocence of the lonely.
Funny thing, the charm of the young.

See how she moves just 
Like two angels (in white innocence).
Yet one of them is on the run.
The other's tapping at my car window
And I'm squinting through the sun
Trying to see if she's some child of the nineties:
Or just another dangerous fantasy of mine.
Yeah. 
White innocence.
She was white innocence.

A perfect hole was in her stocking:
It made a perfect window to her heart.
I could have moved among her waterfalls:
Her misty curtains drawn apart.
Did she see warm safety in my numbers
To want to hitch a ride this way?
Felt like I was taking her to market now
To be sold as the last lot of the day.
Funny thing, the distance of the lonely.
Funny thing, the charm of the young.
White innocence.

She pressed the button, lowered the window:
Let her hand trail in the slipstream of the night.
A frost from nowhere seemed to lick her fingers:
I could have warmed them, but the moment wasn't right.
Obvious, she was headed nowhere special:
Yes, well it was even obvious to me.
I was doing some, some watching, some waiting:
She'd been here before, most definitely.
There was the promise of early bed-time.
There was the promise of heaven on earth.
Think I was sending out low-voltage electricity:
Played it right down for what it was worth.
She turned and looked at me in white innocence
And with the clearest eyes of forever grey,
She rested one small hand for a second on my knee:
I stopped the car. She walked away.
Funny thing, the wisdom of the lonely.
Funny thing, the charm of the young.
Away you go now.

So how can you laugh when your own mother's hungry,
And how can you smile when the reasons for smiling are wrong?

Coffee bars; black tights and white thighs
In shop windows where blonde assistants fully-fashioned a world made
Of dummies (with no mummies or daddies to reject them)
When bombs were banned every Sunday and the Shadows played FBI
And tired young sax-players sold their instruments of torture 
Sat in the station,  sharing wet dreams of Charlie Parker,
Jack Kerouac, RenÃ© Magritte, to name a few of the heroes
Who were too wise for their own good left the young brood to
Go on living without them

Telling me I'll never find what I've already found.
It was they who were wrong,
And for them here's a song.

Did you hear baby 
Come back and tell you the things he's seen.
Did it surprise you
To be picked up at eight in a limousine?
Doing the things he's accustomed to do.
Which at one time it seemed like a dream
Now it's true.

Remind me of jack-a-lynn.
Lush hotels and pretty girls
Won't cheer the misty mood I'm in.
Silly, sad --- I've never had to write this before

Funny how long nights allow
Thoughts of jack-a-lynn.
When phantoms tread around my bed
To offer restless dreams they bring.
And it's just the time and place to find
A sad song to play
For jack-a-lynn.

Magpies that shriek, old boots that leak
Call me to jack-a-lynn.

Nosing where the mice have been.

Owl loved to rest quietly whilst no one was watching. 
Sitting on a fence one day,
He was surprised  when suddenly a kangaroo ran close by. 
Now this may not seem strange, but when Owl overheard Kangaroo whisper  to no one in
Particular, 
""The hare has lost his spectacles,"" well, he began to wonder.
Presently, the moon appeared from behind a cloud and there, lying on the grass was hare. 
In the stream that flowed by the grass a newt. 
And sitting astride a twig of a bush a bee. Ostensibly motionless, the hare was trembling with
Excitement, for without his spectacles he was completely helpless. 
Where were his spectacles? 
Could someone have stolen them? 
Had he mislaid them? 
What was he to do? 
Bee wanted to help, and thinking he had the answer began:
""You probably ate them thinking they were a carrot.""  
""No!"" interrupted Owl, who was wise. 
""I have good eye-sight, insight, and foresight. How could an intelligent hare make such a silly mistake?"" 
But all this time, Owl had been sitting on the fence, scowling! 
Kangaroo were hopping mad at this sort of talk.
She thought herself far superior in intelligence to the others. 
She was their leader, their guru. 
She had the answer: ""Hare, you must go in search of the optician.""
But then she realized that Hare was completely helpless without his spectacles.
And so, Kangaroo loudly proclaimed, ""I can't send Hare in search of anything!""
""You can guru, you can!"" shouted Newt. 
""You can send him with Owl."" 
But Owl had gone to sleep.  
Newt knew too much to be stopped by so small a problem
""You can take him in your pouch.""
But alas, Hare was much too big to fit into
Kangaroo's pouch. 
All this time, it had been quite plain to hare that the others knew nothing about spectacles.

As for all their tempting ideas, well Hare didn't care. 
The lost spectacles were his own affair. 
And after all, Hare did have a spare a-pair. A-pair.",Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles [Video Track][Multimedia Trac,1994

And I think I'm going to cry

My teddy bear's the only friend I can feel

And touches Teddy's head
I now suspect that shadow will touch me

Jethro Tull,"The tiny ant leaves his tiny ant drops in the sand,
And makes his home inside a rusty watering can,
Occasionally going out to look for bread and jam.

He runs into a sparrow who hasn't eaten for a week,
And later, quite contented, the sparrow cleans his beak,
Failing to notice pussy cat has come out to take a leak.
Our cat partakes of dinner when a sudden kangaroo
Emerges from the undergrowth and asks to use the loo.
Kangaroos aren't usually dangerous, for that would never do.
My goodness, will you look at all the animals queuing on the stairs!
Look at the animals in the zoo; how would you like to be one?
They're waiting to use the lavatory and putting chewing gum in each other's hair.
Look at the animals, look at you; well how would you like to free one?
Good gracious, will you look at all the animals playing with their tools!
Look at the animals, look at you; well how would you like to queer one?
Flying from the chandeliers and treading in their elephantine stools.
Look at the animals, two by two; aren't you glad to be one?
This kangaroo's a lunatic and his pouch is very full
Of pussy cats and penguins who can't fly as a rule,

But then neither could the pussy cat: he never went to school.
The kangaroo gets nervous when confronted by the size
Of an elephant named Simon who is always telling lies;
He swears he wears green corduroys and can button up his fly.
Presently, a fatter Simon's indigestion fails.
He regurgitates the whole damn mess into an aluminum pail,
And the tiny ant scuttles back inside his watering can
Occasionally going out to look for bread and jam.

Jethro Tull,"One day he'll walk from out of this place.
You'll see a quiet determination on his face.
He'll toe no lines. Suffer no fools.
But he'll raise three cheers to the losing team

From the other school.
A little dedication. A little pair of daddy's shoes to fill.
Complete education. One day he'll be a man of principle.
And the battle's on. And he'll play to win.

Feel the blue blood rushing quick beneath his skin.
And grim they stand. And hard they fall.
Harder still, when their backs are up against the wall.
Gonna get your attention. But he's carrying his cross

To the other hill.
With divine intervention, he can be a man of principle.
In the evening light, with a fair-ground girl
He stops himself as his head begins to whirl.

And he walks her home. And there's a kiss goodbye.
She feels a chill as she looks him in the eye.
Well, there's a time and a place now
And it's not tonight she'll bend his will.

Just a black dot on an old map with its edges curled.
Where they built their industries on the edge of town--

Who sells papers in the rush hour

An October's day, towards evening
Sweat-embossed veins standing proud to the plough
Salt on a deep chest seasoning
Last of the line at an honest day's toil
Turning the deep sod under
Flint at the fetlock, chasing the bone
Flies at the nostrils plunder

With the Shire on his feathers floating
Hauling soft timber into the dusk
To bed on a warm straw coating

Behind the plough gliding, slipping and sliding free
And now you're down to the few and there's no work to do

Let me find you a filly for your proud stallion seed
To keep the old line going
And we'll stand you abreast at the back of the wood
Behind the young trees growing
To hide you from eyes that mock at your girth
Your eighteen hands at the shoulder
And one day when the oil barons have all dripped dry
And the nights are seen to draw colder
They'll beg for your strength, your gentle power
Your noble grace and your bearing
And you'll strain once again to the sound of the gulls
In the wake of the deep plough, sharing

Up into the cold wind facing
In stiff battle harness, chained to the world

A heavy horse and a tumbling sky
Brewing heavy weather

Bring a song for the evening
Clean brass to flash the dawn
Across these acres glistening
Like dew on a carpet lawn
In these dark towns folk lie sleeping
As the heavy horses thunder by
To wake the dying city
With the living horseman's cry

At once the old hands quicken
Bring pick and wisp and curry comb
Thrill to the sound of all the heavy horses coming home

Is it such a good idea that I am here again?
And I could cut my cold breath with a knife.
And taste the winter of another life.

A yellow cab from JFK, the long way round.
I didn't mind: gave me thinking time before I ran aground
On rocky memories and choking tears.
I believe it only rained round here in thirty years.

Now, it's the first snow on Brooklyn and my cold feet are drumming.
You don't see me in the shadows from your cozy window frame.
And last night, who was in your parlour wrapping presents in the late hour
To place upon your pillow as the morning came?

Thin wind stings my face: pull collar up.
I could murder coffee in a grande cup.
No welcome deli; there's no Starbucks here.
A dime for a quick phone call could cost me dear.

And the first snow on Brooklyn paints a Christmas card upon the pavement.
The cab leaves a disappearing trace and then it's gone.
And the snow covers my footprints, deep regrets and heavy heartbeats.
When you wake you'll never see the spot that I was standing on.

Some things are best forgotten: some are better half-remembered.
I just thought that I might be there on your, on your Christmas night.
And the first snow on Brooklyn makes a lonely road to travel â??
Cold crunch steps that echo as the blizzard bites.

Jethro Tull,"People, what have you done?
Locked him in his golden cage, golden cage
Made him bend to your religion
Him resurrected from the grave, from the grave

He is the God of nothing
If that's all that you can see
You are the God of everything
He's inside you and me

So lean upon him gently
And don't call on him to save you
From your social graces
And the sins you used to waive, you used to waive

The bloody church of England
In chains of history
Requests your earthly presence
At the vicarage for tea

And the graven image you know who
With his plastic crucifix, he's got him fixed
Confuses me as to who and where and why?
As to how he gets his kicks, he gets his kicks

Confessing to the endless sin
The endless whining sounds
You'll be praying till next Thursday
To all the gods that you can count",My God [DVD],2005
Jethro Tull,"Nothing is easy, though time gets you worrying, my friend, it's o.k.
Just take your life easy and stop all that hurrying, be happy my way.
When tension starts mounting and you've lost count of the pennies you've missed,
Just try hard and see why they're not worrying me, they're last on my list.
Nothing's easy.

Nothing is easy, you'll find that the squeeze won't turn out so bad.
Your fingers may freeze, worse things happen at sea, there's good times to be had.
So if you're alone and you're down to the bone, just give us a play.
You'll smile in a while and discover that I'll get you happy my way.
Nothing's easy.",Nothing Is Easy [DVD],2005
Jethro Tull,"Meanwhile back in the year one
When you belonged to no one
You didn't stand a chance, son
If your pants were undone

'Cause you were bred for humanity and sold to society
One day you'll wake up in the present day
A million generations removed from expectations
Of being who you really want to be

Skating away
Skating away
Skating away
On the thin ice of the new day

So as you push off from the shore
Won't you turn your head once more
And make your peace with everyone?

For those who choose to stay
Will live just one more day
To do the things they should have done

And as you cross the wilderness
Spinning in your emptiness
You feel you have to pray

Looking for a sign
That the Universal Minds
Has written you into the Passion Play

Skating away
Skating away
Skating away
On the thin ice of the new day

And as you cross the circle line
Well, the ice-wall creaks behind
You're a rabbit on the run

And the silver splinters fly
In the corner of your eye
Shining in the setting sun

Well, do you ever get the feeling
That the story's too damn real
And in the present tense?

Or that everybody's on the stage
And it seems like you're the only person
Sitting in the audience?

Skating away
Skating away
Skating away
On the thin ice of the new day

In a sad voice nobody hears.
She waits in her castle of make-believe
For her white knight to appear.

Runs from the train. Hear her typewriter humming,

Or to fish the Spey, spinning the first run of Spring
Or to die for a cause somewhere.

My words but a whisper -- your deafness a SHOUT.
I may make you feel but I can't make you think.
Your sperm's in the gutter -- your love's in the sink.
So you ride yourselves over the fields and

You make all your animal deals and
Your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.
And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away in
The tidal destruction

The moral melee.
The elastic retreat rings the close of play as the last wave uncovers
The newfangled way.
But your new shoes are worn at the heels and

Your suntan does rapidly peel and
Your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.
 
And the love that I feel is so far away:
I'm a bad dream that I just had today -- and you
Shake your head and
Say it's a shame.

You must stay with me and learn the secret language of birds.

On a Rousseau garden with monkeys in hiding.
The truth of the matter, yet to be spoken
In words on which everything, everything's riding.
Now stay with me and learn the secret language of birds.

Circled by swallows
In a world for the weary.
Courted by warblers; wicked and eloquent trilling.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2000

Prayer in heart and bible in hand
Standing in the crowd screaming aloud
He touched my hand don’t you understand

I used to believe a lot of things
Thought that if you did those things
That you were far away from any angel’s wings
And closer to hell then I’ll ever tell

But I am not better
I’m just a beggar like you
And I’m no healer
I’m no savior, just looking for the truth

Love is not something you understand
But I’m learning to love the holes in your hands
The holes in your clothes, the hurt nobody knows
I’m learning to love you all over again

I love you but I sure I hate the bottle
I love you but I could do without the E
It’s not easy for you I can see
It’s not so easy for you I can see

But I’m not better
I’m just beggar like you
And I’m no healer
I’m no savior, just looking for the truth

He knew what He was talking about 
When He said I do all the things that I wish not
I’d feed you but I’m so hungry you see
I’d clothe you but we’re all swimming in the same naked sea

But I did not want to change
And I will never be the same
Now that I’ve seen your pain

Forsaken, lonely, nobody
Your hands reaching for me
Praise songs and dessert cement a bond I’ll never forget
I don’t know why your mother left you, but I hope she regrets

'Cause I will never be the same
But I did not want to change
And I will never be the same
Now that I’ve seen your pain

'Cause I will never be the same
But I did not want to change
And I will never be the same
Now that I’ve seen your pain

I can see the little faces with smiles
If you’ve got love then your embracing this child
The very ones that the racist profile
Could teach us all  about some patience through trials
These type of babies come in thousands of styles
Check your neighborhood or travel thousands of miles
From the back blocks to alleys
Reach em young before they reach the crack rock in Cali
The side effects of being sexually abused
 Will leave your heart numb and mentally confused
So let’s turn these penitentiary blues into heavenly news
Rise up little baby, rise up, rise up little baby, rise up
I’ll take you by my right hand, with my mic in the left
One on my back, we’ll face the mountain top and ride to the death
Surely to collide with opposition as daddy provides us with the nutrition
To hop clouds and walk on water, chasing rainbows
Til every broken memory and pain goes
Marked with halo’s perfectly fitted spiritual kangos
We share the same foes being from the same family tree
I’ve summoned the first world to come and take a stand with me
Rise up little baby rise up, put your eyes up, rise up

Been here for weeks was I even thought of?
Sat here for days thinking how the world had wronged me
Well if I blamed your face it was the devil who told me

Are you in the clouds where my head has been lately?
If I take a leap will you reach out and save me?
If I take too long, will you give up on me?
If I lose myself will you come and find me?

'Cause I’ve been dancing without you too long
And I’ve been dreaming nothing much since you’ve been gone
I’ve been waiting for you here in this hole
If it was your hand that saved me I didn’t know

Are you in this heart that feels so empty?
If you are would you come and show me?
Are you in this place that’s so quick to forget you?
If we saw your face we wouldn’t even know you
Are you in my cries for mercy and love?
I’ve got what I need but it’s just never enough
Are you at home sitting all by yourself?
Your best love letter sitting on the shelf

I was dead wrong thinking I was head strong
Lyrically complacent in a spiritual basement to say the least
Influential with the potential to stay fresh as a crease
I put the rest in the peace, he put the death to the beast
So I could rise on up out of Saigon, becoming trial strong
Although this last miles long, I choose to smile on
And carry these torches back into my fortress
To expose these holes that feel like blows to the nose
My present condition of brokenness keeps me searching for hope in this
Is it hopelessness? Sometimes it feels like I’m fighting me
Soul searching for light in me, All I gots a mic and me 
Not really trying to justify these actions
Just trying to rekindle the passion that set my heart apart
So help me find that spark that set my heart apart",Holes,2007

Jetty Rae,"We built a fire you and me
Built with the stick of desire 
And the flame of eternity
You kept me warm many winters untold
But come summer I run from the fire and your side
Ran to the hills with my stubbornness and my pride

Is this who you really want to be?
You said to me
Who's shoes are you still trying to fit in?
Who's battles are you still trying to win?
What crosses are you still carrying?
What burdens are you still burying?
Oh my soul is so tired of feeling uninspired
You've got to light the fire
Then you say, you say

I love you, I love you

Though that I'd be nobler but apparently that's just no me
Thought that I'd be braver, but apparently I can't see what's in front of me
The road before me is laden with sorrows and mistakes that I've made
And I can't look into the mirror today

Iridescently beautiful
And all the lines keep you outside
But you were meant to live
Outside of their walls

Little girl beware of the world
They'll tell you lies, all of the time
But there only lies, so dry your eyes

Little girl you're beautiful like a secret world
Full of waterfalls and rainbows
But all the sticks and stones
Won't leave you alone
They make you feel so ugly
But you're not, just trust me

Little girl your song is like the rain
Washes everything, nothing's ever the same
But everyone tries to steal your song
Playing parts and notes, that don't belong
This, is your song

Little girl your eyes are like the spring
When flowers bloom, and bluebirds sing
But they took your heart,and they took your soul
But you were begging for, a little control
Where, is my soul?

Of all her hopes, and all her dreams
Please don't, cut her wings",Little Girl,2009

I'm gonna bring you up to see all the sights
And If I'm gonna play a game of hide and seek

And If I'm gonna give my bread to the hungry

It's covered with light when I kiss your face
I saw a light consuming me, reflections of love
Cut soul deep
I saw a yellow butterfly

I saw a vision of you and me
Holding tightly the way it should be

I'm gonna want your name written next to mine in history

I'm comin up (choppin' on dubs and showin 'em love)
2000-Fizive and you are not fly enough (young bitch)
Uh Hold up young bitch-bitch I just don't wanna stop comin'up

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uh it's never too much the paper I make
These other pussy niggas ain't real them ho's fake
I'm Sweet James Jones when you come through bitch
I treat you good because you know I'm rich
I was in the ghetto-had nothin'
Sold a lot of records and grabbed somethin'
Now I'm goin' through movies in L.A
Playin' the game the way the hustlers play
And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm try'na get my mothafuckin' paper on
I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city
And them other pussy niggas they record sound shitty
When I see you in the town I'm a hit you up
You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up

[Chorus]
I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)
Cause I'm comin' down, playa surroundin' livin' these ho's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin' maze and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it)
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin' comin' Up

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I remember when I had to come up just to come down
That's the reason for my uncontrollable ballin' right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I payed the price now
My life is to valuable for me to play with life now
Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guility just because now I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck
I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can biblically remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin' rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks
But now money be comin' in wadd's like blocks
Let's go half on a Yacht-I got the pot you got the chicken fried steak
I can't even hear you haters you've been muted by my paper chase

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil' Flip]
Who would've known that this rap shit would take me far
At 18 I had a fifty-thousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now I'm smokin' hydro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle now I'm rockin' clubs
After ""Diamonds N Yo Face"" I was coppin' dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So if you wanna 16 that's forty-grand
Rappers talk a lot of shit but you ain't stoppin' us
Look you don't wanna bump heads with a mafia (Huh)
Look you don't know shit about UGK
Or Mr. Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch I'm wearin'
I'm the first cat in Houston with a black Meclaron
Lil' Flipper tote pistols for them none believers
Cause down here we poppin' trunks on Cadillacs and Regals (Oh boy)

Woke up late, against this world I hold my own
15 texts on my phone but hi ho, it's on the roads I go
Did not get no student loan
Woulda spent that on booze and clothes
Pops didn't wanna see me move on road
Moved them bricks and he moved us home
Welcome to London
You get caught by the Feds you'll get thrown in the queens dungeon
Mums been wondering where's her son been
I'm a real top boy mumsy I run tings
I'm a top boy like Dushane & Sully
Grandads from Kingston see it's gully
Blocks ain't sunny
In London all everybody cares about is just money
New Gen with my underdogs I'm rolling with my stray hounds
Run the streets don't come round here the block is still my playground
Keep it square with all them fakes you know they never stay round
Badman move in silence blud but my ting yeah that stays loud
Is society giving me a chance
Listen if they said I can't
Would they listen if I told them through rhythm that I got Britain in my palms
Put in prison or now live as a villain killing off before your chance
Don't judge my bad decisions man

London Bridge ain't burning down
See all my people screaming but they turn out music down
All they talk about is who they've murdered now
I would pray for my sins but there ain't no church in town
Read my prophecy
Ahh the young Socrates
See my block in flames
I guess I'm hot property
Your estate is mine now
That's the hood monopoly
Oi rudeboy come over here fam empty your pockets show me what you got for me

I know the ends are
So cold oh I
I don't
Know who my friends are I'm alone

That's another son gone missing
Ain't no love in Britain
Word to Charlie & Dotty

Don't wanna fuck with the villain

It would be that we're all ok
And not to worry because worry is wasteful
And useless in times like these
I will not be made useless
I won't be idled with despair
I will gather myself around my faith
For light does the darkness most fear

But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own
And I am never broken

But it didn't steal your laughter
And heartache came to visit me
But i knew it wasn't ever after

For someone must stand up for what's right
Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing

My hands are small, I know,
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own

Where the light lends itself to soft repose
I will let you undress me but I warn you I have thorns like any rose
And you could hurt me with your bare hands
You could hurt me using the sharp end of what you say
But I'm lost to you now, there's no amount of reason to save me

So break me, take me
Just let me feel your arms again
Break me, take me
Just let me feel your love again

Feels like being underwater
Now that I've let go
And lost control
Water kisses fill my mouth
Water fills my soul

So break me, take me
Just let me feel your arms again
Make me oh won't you, make me
Just let me feel your love again

Kiss me once well, maybe twice
Oh, it never felt so nice

Just let me feel your arms again
Break me oh won't you go on and make me
Just let me feel your arms again
Just let me feel your love again",Break Me [Radio Remix],

Leaves are starting to fall
I recall, last time you were here
Your laughter a melody that lingers still

There's a hole in my heart and I'll carry it wherever I go
Like a treasure that travels with me down every road
There's this longing lonesome ending kind of bitter, kind of sweet
There's a hole in my heart in the shape of you

Time stealing swiftly
Children having children of their own
And around life's merry-go round goes
And there you are wanting what you cannot hold

There's a hole in my heart and I'll carry it wherever I go
Like a treasure that travels with me down every road
There's this longing lonesome ending kind of bitter, kind of sweet
There's a hole in my heart in the shape of you

Even though my heart aches
There's a smile on my face
Just like a window to heaven
There's a light shining through

This hole in my heart and so I'll carry it wherever I go
Like a treasure that travels with me down every road
There's this longing lonesome ending kind of bitter, kind of sweet
There's a hole in my heart
There's a hole in my heart
There's a hole in my heart in the shape of you",The Shape of You,
Jewel,"Adrian came home again last summer
Things just haven't been the same 'round here
And people talk
And people stare
Oh, Adrian, come out and play

An unfortunate accident in a canoe
Doctor said, ""I'm sorry, not much I can do""
And the air was so still
And his eyes, they did not blink
Oh, Adrian, come out and play

Little Mary Epperson liked him
She vowed always to watch after him
But still he did not move
And the doctor said it's no use
Oh, Adrian, come out and play

She sat by his side, and watched the years fly by
He looked so fragile, he looked so small
And she wondered why he was still alive at all

Everyone in town had that ""I'm so sorry"" look
They talked in a whispered hush, said
""I'd turn the machines off""
But still she sat by his side
She said, ""Life, he won't be denied""
Oh Adrian, come out and play

Yellow flowers decorate his bedroom
Sign above his door says ""Welcome Home""
But he just sits and stares
He's awake but still not there
Oh, Adrian, come out and play

She sat by his side, and watched the years fly by
He looked so fragile, he looked so small
And she wondered why he was still alive at all

And little Mary Epperson grew up lovely
And she still comes to visit him on Sundays
He's like an unused toy
He's got big hands but the mind of a little boy
Oh, Adrian, come out and play

Adrian came home again last summer
Things just haven't been the same around here",Adrian,1995
Jewel,"You're mother's child
But night lays you down
Hair aflame, wild look in your eye
Naked belly to the ground
A forest fire
Nibbles at your veins
Crawls up your arm
Runs away with your mind
And burns dry thoughts like leaves
Amen

Eyes stare up
But something's in the way
In the Bible only angels have wings
And the rest must wait to be saved
A dry tongue
Screams at the sky
But the wind just breathes words in
As a strange bird tries to fly
Amen

Pieces of us die everyday
As though our flesh were hell
Such an injustice, as children we are told
That from God we fell,
Where are my angels?
Where's my golden one?
Where is my hope
Now that my heroes have gone?
Some are being beaten
Some are being born
And some can't tell
The difference anymore

Yes, I left the refrigerator door half open, Daddy
What's that say about me?

You know sometimes I want to rip out your throat, Daddy
For all those things you said that were mean,
I'm gonna make you just as vulnerable as I was, Daddy
What's that say about me?

You know sometimes I want to bash in your teeth, Daddy
I'm gonna use your tongue as a stamp
I'm gonna rip your heart out the way you did mine, Daddy
Go ahead and psycho-analyze that

'Cause I'm your creation, I'm your love Daddy
Grown up to be and do all those sick things you said that I would do

You're always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees, and

These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You're always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar

You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must have gone off track with you

Excuse me, guess I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself

These foolish games are tearing me

Just to disprove all the things that you say
It doesn't take a talent to be mean
Your words can crush things that are unseen

So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way

You always tell me that it's impossible
To be respected, and be a girl
Why's it gotta be so complicated
Why you gotta tell me if I'm hated

Oh please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way

When I was thinking, that it might do some good
If we robbed the cynics and took all their food
That way what they believe will have taken place
And we can give it to everybody who have some faith

So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way

I have this theory, that if we're told we're bad
Then that's the only idea we'll ever have
But maybe if we are surrounded in beauty
Someday we will become what we see
'Cause anyone can start a conflict
It's harder yet to disregard it
I'd rather see the world from another angle
We are everyday angels

Knock knock knockin' on his door
Again last night, said you needed it bad
You know that ain't right
'Cause so many times you've come to me cry crying
Trying to stop, you said it hurts so bad
But please don't let you
Go back for more

My little sister is a zombie in a body
With no soul, a role she has learned to play
In a world today where nothing else matters
But it matters, we gotta start feeding our souls
Not our addictions or afflictions of pain
To avoid the same questions we must
Ask ourselves to get any answers
We gotta start feeding our souls
Have been lost to the millions with lots
Who feed on addiction selling pills and what's hot
And I wish I could save her from all their delusions
All the confusion hey hey

Of a nation that starve us for salvation
But clothing is the closest approximation
To God and He only knows that drugs
Are all we know of love

Every day we starve while we eat white bread
And beer instead of a handshake or hug
We spill the pills and sweep them
Under the rug, hey

My little sister is a Zombie in a body
With no soul, a role she has learned to play
In a world today where nothing else matters

And stop thinking about what your sister said
Stop worrying about it, yes the cat's already been fed
Come on darlin', let's go back to bed

Put the phone machine on hold
Leave the dishes in the sink
Do not answer the door
It's you that I adore,
I'm gonna give you some more

We'll sit on the front porch, the sun can warm my feet
You can drink your coffee with sugar and cream
I'll drink my decaf herbal tea
Pretend we're perfect strangers and that we never met,
My, you remind me of a man I used to sleep with
That's a face I'd never forget
And you can be Henry Miller and I'll be Anais Nin
Except this time it'll be even better,
We'll stay together in the end
Come on darlin', let's go back to bed

Those words touch me much too deeply.
They make my core tremble.
Don't think you realize the effect you have over me.
And please don't look at me like that,
It just makes me want to make you near me always.
And please don't kiss me so sweet.
It makes me crave a thousand kisses to follow.
And please touch me like that.
Makes every other embrace seem pale and' shallow.
And please don't come so close.
It just makes me want to make you near me always.

Please don't bring me flowers,
They only whisper the sweet things you say.
And don't try to understand me,
Your hands already know too much anyways.
Makes me want to make you near me always.

And when you look in my eyes,
Please know my heart is in your hands.
It's nothing that I understand,
But in your arms you have complete power over me.
So be gently if you please.

Jewel,"Eighty years, an old lady now, sitting on the front porch
Watching the clouds roll by
They remind her of her lover, how he left her, and of times long ago,
When she used color carelessly, painted his portrait
A thousand times, or maybe just his smile,
Her and her canvas would follow him wherever he would go

'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves
A lovely world

Oil streaked daisies covered the living room walls
He put water colored roses in her hair
He said, ""Love, I love you,
I want to give you the mountains, the sunshine,
The sunset too
I want to give you a world as beautiful as you are to me""

'Cause I'm a painter and I want to paint you
A lovely way

So they sat down and made a drawing of their love,
They made it an art to live by
They painted every passion, every home, created every beautiful child
In the winter they were weavers of warmth,
In the summer they were carpenters of love
They thought blue prints were too sad so they made them yellow

And they were painters and they had painted themselves
A lovely world

Until one day the rain fell as thick as black oil
And in her heart she knew something was wrong
She went running through the orchard screaming,
""No God, don't take him from me!""
But by the time she got there, she feared he already had gone
She got to where he lay, water colored roses in his hands for her
She threw them down screaming, ""Damn you man, don't leave me
With nothing left behind but these cold paintings, these cold portraits
To remind me!""

He said, ""Love I only leave a little, try to understand
I put my soul in this life we've created with these four hands
Love, I leave, but only a little, this world holds me still
My body may die now, but these paintings are real""
La li lai la li lai la li lai

So many seasons came and many seasons went
And many times she saw her love's face watering the flowers,
Talking to the trees and singing to his children,
And when the wind blew, she knew he was listening,
And how he seemed to laugh along, and how he seemed to hold her
When she was crying

'Cause they were painters and they had painted themselves
A lovely world

Eighty years, an old lady now, sitting on the front porch
Watching the clouds roll by
They remind her of her lover, how he left her, and of times long ago,
When she used color carelessly, painted his portrait
A thousand times, or maybe just his smile,
Her and her canvas would follow him wherever he would go
Yes, she and her canvas still follow

'Cause they are painters and they are painting themselves
A lovely

Jewel,"She's an ugly girl, does it make you want to kill her?
She's an ugly girl, do you want to kick in her face?
She's an ugly girl, she doesn't pose a threat.
She's an ugly girl, does that make you feel safe?
Ugly girl, ugly girl, do you hate her
'Cause she's pieces of you?

She's a pretty girl, does she make you think nasty thoughts?
She's a pretty girl, do you want to tie her down?
She's a pretty girl, do you call her a bitch?
She's a pretty girl, did she sleep with your whole town?
Pretty girl, pretty girl, do you hate her
'Cause she's pieces of you?

You say he's a fagot, does it make you want to hurt him?
You say he's a fagot, do you want to kick in his brain?
You say he's a fagot, does he make you sick to your stomach?
You say he's a fagot, are you afraid you're just the same?
Fagot, fagot, do you hate him
'Cause he's pieces of you?

You say he's a Jew, does it mean that he's tight?
You say he's a Jew, do you want to hurt his kids tonight?
You say he's a Jew, he'll never wear that funny hat again.
You say he's a Jew as though being born were a sin.

Jewel,"People living their lives for you on T.V.
They say they're better than you and you agree
He says ""Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls""
Says ""Come here boys, there ain't nothing for free""
Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill
Another cute cheap thrill
You know you love him if you put in your will but

Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now
Huh huh who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?

We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them
The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day, another dollar, another war, another tower
Went up where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many different Gods as there are flowers
We call religion our friend
We're so worried about saving our souls
Afraid that God will take his toll
That we forget to begin but

Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now
Huh huh who will save your souls after all the lies that you told, boy
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?

Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking and kill
You got social security, but it doesn't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
So we bargain with the devil, so evil, careful do they say
That you love them take your money and run
Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts

Jewel,"I hear the clock, it's 6 a.m.
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
I wipe the spots off of the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause

Dreams last so long, even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see, you were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't want to talk
So I picked up a paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie it just wasn't the same
Cause it was happy and I was sad
It made me miss you oh so bad 'cause

Dreams last so long, even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see, you were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I go about my business, I'm doing fine
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken every day

I brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it, when I leave the light on
I pick up a book, and turn the sheets down
And take a deep breath and a good look around

Put on my pj's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll be all right
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight  'cause

I know that you love me
And soon you will see, you were meant for me

I lost my mind
Lost heart, lost nerve
I lost my favorite word

I take my cigarettes
I give 'em a smoke
Oh god

I've lost something it seems
I've misplaced my favorite thing

Where does love go
If it can't find a home
One moment here then gone
With no forwarding address
Love no longer has a house
Or residence in flesh

Take the keys
I get in the car
To out run this man
I'd have to go real far
Where mercy wears lace
And bottles are thieves
Which of these took you from me?
Emily

I face myself
But there's this draft inside
Parts of me drowned
In perpetual tide
I want to call names
I want to throw things around
But no bar can buy
Forgiveness another round for

Where does love go
If it can't find a home
One moment here then gone
With no forwarding address
Love no longer has a house
Or residence in flesh

I go to the bedroom
Turn on the light
It's like an empty altar
No angel in sight
Religion with no temple
No place to take my worship to
No god for my eyes to see
No fruit to lay at the feet of

Jewel,"Sunshine came softly through my window today
I could have tripped out easy but I've changed my ways.
It'll take time I know it, but in a while...
You're gonna be mine and I know it, we'll do it in style.

Cause I've made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now...
Any trick in the book, oh baby, that I can find.
Everybody's hustling just to have a little scene.
When I say we'll be cool, well, I think that, you know what I
Mean.
We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when...
I know a beach where baby, it never ends.

When you've made your mind up forever to be mine.
I'll pick up your hand and slowly, blow your little mind.
Cause I've made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now...
Any trick in the book, oh baby, that I can find

Superman or green lantern ain't got, nothin' on me.
I can make like a turtle and dive for pearls in the sea
You can just sit there thinkin', on your velvet throne
About all the rainbows you can have for your own.

When you've made your mind up forever to be mine.

I'll tell you right now...
I'll pick up your hand and slowly, blow your little mind.

When you've made your mind up forever to be mine.
I'll pick up your hand and slowly, blow your little mind.

I'll tell you right now...

Jewel,"Standing in a circle
The wolves have come
But they won't bother her, no
'Cause dancing
With her hands of leaves
She'll sing for them
And ease their hungerin'
She's a quiet warrior
Standing at the
Ocean's stony shores
The waves all worship her
She stands in trust and
Lets the night swallow her
Because she knows that
She's a piece of the sun
And a quiet warrior

You ask her where
From the wind blows
She'll say it's
How the sky sings
And you ask her
How does the sun rise
She'll say 'cause
You desire it to be seen
And you ask her how does
She make your heart fly
And she'll tell you
You know why
She's your quiet warrior

Ravens they rest
On his golden crown
And steal your soul
He smiles and it feels
Like you've known him
Yes it feels like coming home
He's a quiet warrior

And roaring silently
He's a lion
And he'll hunt for you
His eyes are warm
Because his hands
They are made of light
And they seduce your soul
He's a quiet warrior

You ask him where
From the wind blows
He says that the earth breathes
And you ask him
How does the sun rise
He'll say that she's got wings
And you ask him
How does he make
Your heart fly
And he'll tell you
You know why
He's your quiet warrior",Quiet Warrior,1996
